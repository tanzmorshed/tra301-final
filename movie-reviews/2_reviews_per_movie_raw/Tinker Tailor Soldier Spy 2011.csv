"bob the moo","Null","129","151","8 April 2012"," A tad confusing in the telling, but excellent in the tone
","There is a certain snobbery with films that require more than a small amount of attention – an opinion that if you even ask about a small detail that you missed that you should then go watch Transformers and leave real films to the grownups. It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.<br/><br/>I've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.<br/><br/>This is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless ""war"". This feeling is in the characters, in the set-decoration and in every shot. The men we follow had the height of their import many years ago – now it appears they are mainly fighting their equal numbers on the other side simply because they exist. I really liked this overarching sense of smallness that sat across the film and I enjoyed finding it being employed in even the smallest detail – in the attitude of a minor character through to the cheap ""do not unplug"" text scrawled on the wall (those that work in older offices will know this feeling). Alfredson is bang on the money with this feeling, it is part of the story and it is brilliantly delivered throughout.<br/><br/>Speaking of brilliant delivery, the cast is deep in British talent and unsurprisingly they deliver. Oldman may not have won the Oscar but he is great here – working with restraint and doing so much. He does so much with minor reactions and movements and he is a great character. He is the lead here but alongside him is a cast that is hard not to just list – Cumberbach, Hurt, Jones, Firth, Burke, Graham, Hardy and so on; British all perhaps but it says a lot that almost all of the supporting players here will be recognised internationally. Everyone gives strong performances and everyone seems to understand what Alfredson is doing.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film albeit one that is not as easy to follow as those impatient snobs would have you believe. It is OK to struggle with some aspects and it is still easy to enjoy the film. The plot engaged me but what stayed with me more than anything else was how it all seemed so unimportant, how those involved were all working to ignore the irrelevance of their work and how very tired this world seemed – this aspect was very well done and made the film as much as Oldman's strong central performance."
"scunnered_again","8","296","358","16 September 2011"," Not everyone can be one of Smiley's people.
","It is true to say that Smiley is no Bourne nor Bond but Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a beautifully played and observed spy film. Should you expect car chases, spills, thrills, gadgets galore and closely-choreographed fight scenes then you WILL be disappointed. <br/><br/>Set in smoke-filled, sepia-tinged 1970s, the film centres around the uncovering of a mole 'right at the top of the circus'. The 'circus' is the British Intelligence Services and is made up of a who's who of British acting talent - Firth, Hinds, Cumberbatch, Hardy, Strong and Hurt. For the most part, the action takes place in the brown-suited and wall-papered world of England but we are given brief glimpses of the spy territory in Budapest, Paris and Istanbul. Smiley, played inscrutably by Oldman, is tasked with uncovering the mole and is ably assisted by Guillam, the ever-watchable Cumberbatch. <br/><br/>Admittedly this is a slow-burn of a film, full of meaningful looks, pregnant pauses and one that hints at deeper and more complex plot strands but it has an authentic air and it is a fascinating to observe a build-up of tension and cold-war paranoia which culminates in a dramatic if subdued fashion. Being slightly too young to have watched the original Alec Guiness TV series, I cannot make any direct comparisons and I imagine that a TV series allows much more time for plot and character development. The film must be judged on its own merits, and whilst I am sure that this will not be to many mainstream movie-goers' tastes, it is one for those who are looking for a film of a different type, time and pace."

","Forty-six year old Swedish director Tomas Alfredson came to prominence three years ago when he directed the film adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel 'Let The Right One In'. After the initial success of the vampiric romantic drama, Alfredson became attached to an international adaptation of John le Carre's espionage-novel 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'. Based on aspects of le Carre's (also known as David Cornwell) experiences during his time as a member of the British Intelligence service sectors MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s, Alfredson creates a fine, absorbing picture which engrosses from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Control (John Hurt), the leader of an unknown sector of the British Intelligence service, is ousted along with his long-standing companion George Smiley (Gary Oldman) due to a botched operation in Budapest, Hungary which saw the officer Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) murdered in public. Control was under the impression that there was a mole among the top ranking members of the service, referred to as the Circus by the other top ranking members due to its location in Cambridge Circus, London, and Smiley is drawn out of retirement to pinpoint the culprit after Control passes away. Alongside the young Intelligence officer Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley has four primary candidates to focus his investigation upon; they are the last remaining members of the Circus, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik).<br/><br/>Utilizing an all-star, established cast, Alfredson allows the film to unfold at an almost flawless pace. Every sequence contains a small snippet of information which allows the viewer to conduct their own investigation alongside that of Smiley's. While the narrative is also driven along by strong performances from the primarily male cast, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, David Dencik, Stephen Graham and Kathy Burke all give strong, commanding performances. While the true artists of the piece are Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the young, and somewhat naive intelligent officer assigned to assist Smiley. John Hurt as the aging, instinct-driven leader of the British service, and Tom Hardy, who is Ricki Tarr the dirty cleaner for British intelligence's most fowl operations. Their performances go above and beyond in their supporting roles, and at times eclipse Gary Oldman's subdued portrayal of a man drawn back into the murky world of corruption, betrayal and treasure.<br/><br/>Alongside the narrative and its cast, one of the more surprising aspects of the film, is Alfredson, Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and Editor Dino Jonsater's use of stylistic nuances that further enhance the viewing experience. Lingering close-up shots of seemingly insignificant objects and shallow focus shots constantly evoke the nature of mystery and intrigue which surrounds such clandestine organisations. Alfredson never rushes any moment, instead he allows for the audience to become accustomed to their surroundings and appreciate their beauty. Wide angle shots and long lenses are used for interior and exterior locations, showcasing the breakdowns of their interiors, while close-up shots are used to examine objects and characters in their most frail states. During the opening sequence involving Prideaux's botched secret mission, a simple concoction of jump cuts and lingering static shots concentrating upon various characters within the vicinity creates a sense of the tension, suspense and vulnerability of the situation and this is how Alfredson constantly keeps the audience engrossed. By providing those observing the action on screen with just enough information that they themselves become entwined within Smiley's investigation as he moves forward.<br/><br/>Once the credits and a dedication to the films screenwriter Bridget O'Connor who passed away last year finish, the viewer is left with an overriding sense of satisfaction. Smiley's world is a far cry away from the glitz and glamour that the espionage genre has become accustomed to. There are no martinis in sight, but only reel upon reel of bureaucratic wrangling, childish bickering and greed-induced deal-making, where it seems everybody is working for themselves and their reputation rather than the nation's government that is employing them. Since its premiere at the 68th Venice International Film Festival 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' has been touted as an Oscar contender and it is easy to understand why, Tomas Alfredson has taken a solid source novel, utilized an established cast and infused the final concoction with elements from his own visual repertoire to create a wonderfully crafted film that does the original BBC televised series justice."

","I have been eagerly awaiting this production for a long time and have not been disappointed. Never have I seen such a compilation of such fabulous performances together. No way is this another James Bond, it is how the world of espionage was, and is today. No car chases in Aston Martins or gadgets but a world of seedy little offices and the grim reality of this genre. What had the greatest impact on myself was the slow deep menace conveyed by all. Difficult to single out any one performance as all were amazing but I particularly admired Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Tom Hardy for their work. At times this film has some unexpected moments of shocking cruelty. Complex character portrayal is presented in a slow deep style that only inspires you to know more about the person. The story itself is a classic and known by many, yet this production introduces a few changes which work well. One of the most absorbing and classy movies I have seen and has left a lasting impact on me. Please, please, please, make Smiley's People now."
"petra_ste","9","12","13","12 November 2018"," The fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt
","Since I am a fan of both John Le Carré and Gary Oldman, this looked like a perfect match. For once I was not disappointed: Tinker Tailor is a fine adaptation and a masterful spy thriller.<br/><br/>(Now do Smiley's People, please, keeping Oldman and the same writers. The Honourable Schoolboy we can skip, as it's both harder to adapt and, to be honest, not quite as good as the other two Quest for Karla books).<br/><br/>Oldman, one of the most versatile actors around, is phenomenal as George Smiley. Smiley - Le Carré 's owlish, middle-aged spy who is essentially the anti-James Bond - investigates a Russian double agent inside the British Secret Service. Oldman perfectly captures both Smiley's wounded humanity and his keen intelligence - a quiet, unassuming man who, in the dangerous world of spy games, can turn into a skilled hunter.<br/><br/>The stellar supporting cast - including John Hurt, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, David Dencik and Ciaran Hinds - is also excellent. I have to say Hinds is underserved by the otherwise perfect script though; his Roy Bland (nomen omen...) is the only significant character who remains a blank. Everyone else is so well-sketched, he sort of sticks out.<br/><br/>Director Tomas Alfredson crafts a meticulous, intelligent movie, one which requires attention but rewards it with a tense, compelling viewing experience, the thinking man's thriller.<br/><br/>8,5/10"
"timdiggles","Null","177","247","21 September 2011"," Brain not brawn
","It really is interesting to read the above reviews. I've just come back from seeing it and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wondered if for people who hadn't read the book or seen the TV series it would make sense, and obviously it doesn't. It also doesn't fit the change in perception that the current generation have needing an edit at least every 5 seconds and a linear storyline, that's not ageist, just what we in a much older generation have left as our inheritance, sadly. I really enjoyed the film references whether they are intentional or not, they range from Rear Window to La Nuit Americaine to Mr Bean's Holiday to Godard. Gary Oldman as Smiley is very good, much colder that AG and as in the book a bit younger. It is also less of the feel of a group of Oxbridge Dons in charge rather ex servicemen as MI5 was in those days. I was in my 20's in the early 1970's and the general dullness of everything during that time comes through very well. I would think that after they edited it they wished they hadn't had some rather crass graffiti so prominent, but I remember it was all over London at that time. Good film with a plot that makes you concentrate and you have to use your brain, well worth seeing, but don't go if you want thrills and spills."
"Theo Robertson","6","101","138","9 September 2013"," The Fact It's Uncinematic Is A Major Problem
","John Le Carre is without doubt one of the literary greats of the late 20th Century . A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema <br/><br/>You can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography <br/><br/>The problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema . Let's not forget two of the most memorable movies of the 1970s THE GODFATHER and JAWS were based on novels dismissed as trash"

","I have watched this movie 5 times, and I would love to do it 5 more times again; it will actually be my preference over anything I might have available to sit down to and don't quite feel like risking, any time I feel like doing it again.<br/><br/>It has that perfect mixture of a good old European crime movie flow, underpinned with some of the best contemporary music ever adapted for the screen. And then it adds some of its own mystery on top of that.<br/><br/>The cast is mesmerising, the plot just about difficult enough to figure out on the first watch, so the remaining four runs for me were simply pure indulgence in being able to watch a masterpiece again from four different perspectives and not be bored a minute each and every time.<br/><br/>In fact, I enjoyed it more and more, every single time I've seen it."
"imagiking","8","193","278","17 September 2011"," A Genuine Achievement
","Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In, the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.<br/><br/>Called back into service to uncover the identity of a Soviet mole at the height of the Cold War, retired British intelligence operative George Smiley is tasked with unwinding a vastly convoluted web of conspiracy, codenames, double agents, and deceit.<br/><br/>The movement from relatively low-budget foreign language filmmaking to helming star casts in comparably costly productions is one that, historically, holds significant risk for directorial careers. Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.<br/><br/>Hitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling."

"alan-chan-158-451491","Null","120","177","17 September 2011"," The classic Cold War spy thriller turned into a ravishing looking thinking man's thriller
","I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness, but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a masterful re-telling of John le Carré's seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley (played majestically by Gary Oldman) is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill (which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position) when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman's face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece; expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt (who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley) and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense, but which also acts as important plot points and clues.<br/><br/>The film is about the hunt for a Soviet 'mole' in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6 but fictitiously known as 'The Circus') by George Smiley, an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer, a British agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam (Bendedict Cumberbatch) who is Tarr's handler, Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership, anyone of whom might be the mole, headed by Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) and his deputies Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) – the 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' of the book (codenames assigned by Control, Head of British Secret Service).<br/><br/>The director, Tomas Alfredson, established his reputation with 'Let the Right One In', an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too, is a film about human nature, moral dilemmas and relationships – friendship, loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like 'Let the Right One In' Alfredson imbues 'Tinker, Tailor', Soldier, Spy' (his first English language feature) with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient, but this is richly rewarded with scenes, shot after shot, that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming's vigorous secret agent. Indeed, Robert De Niro's admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 'The Good Shepherd' (2006) has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson – a 'grey man' whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of 'Tinker, Tailor' is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the 'grey man' (note Smiley's grey hair, grey countenance and grey suit replete with over-sized glasses and shambling gait) of the secret intelligence service wins the day.<br/><br/>The screenwriters, Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor, have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour potboiler without losing any of its exposition, characters, and plotting. John le Carré and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man's film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship, loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world. If the film does 'King's Speech' levels of business I think it just might and Hollywood would be the richer for it."
"estebangonzalez10","10","74","111","18 January 2012"," This is how a Spy thriller should be made!
","¨It's the oldest question of all, George. Who can spy on the spies? ¨<br/><br/>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy might just be my favorite movie of the year. Director Tomas Alfredson caught my attention a few years ago with his Swedish film Let the Right One in, which in my opinion is the best vampire film I've seen. This is a very different movie, but he still uses very similar techniques. He shoots several shots from a distance which sort of sets the mood of the story dealing with espionage, the setting is also very dark and grayish, and the story moves at a pretty slow pace, but at the same time the mystery and thrills are always there. This is how a spy thriller should be made; it's about as realistic as any spy film could ever be. I'm sorry for all those Mission Impossible, James Bond, and Jason Bourne fans, but this is a far more superior thriller. Perhaps the action isn't as entertaining or as easy to follow, but if you stick with this movie and put your complete attention specifically on these characters the result is truly satisfying. This isn't a popcorn movie you can watch while you're doing something else; you have to devote time and attention to it. My greatest fear is that viewers are becoming so numbed by mindless action scenes and special effects that we don't even want to think about a movie while we're watching it. Sometimes we just want to feel entertained, but we're not willing to spend time focusing on the story and what is going on. We want everything put in front of us and don't want to try to discover things on our own. If that is the case then Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is not the movie for you, but if you are into a well crafted mystery thriller than you will be in for a pleasant surprise like I was. This was one of the greatest viewing experiences I've had this year.<br/><br/>The movie takes place during the Cold War and its set in 1973 London. One of the head members of the British Intelligence Service, named Control (John Hurt), sends one of his agents (Mark Strong) on a special mission to Budapest. Control tells Jim that he received important and confidential information about one of his four top spies being a mole, which would explain why the Russians have been up to date with what is going on in England. Control's four head spies are Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds), and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), and he believes one of them is the mole. Control evens suspects his right hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman), so he orders Jim to go to Budapest and meet with his contact to find out who the traitor is. He has a code name for each one of the spies (tinker, tailor, soldier, and poorman). When Jim arrives at Budapest the mission goes wrong and it's clear to Control that the traitor has found out and blown the mission once again. Control is forced to retire after the Budapest fiasco along with George Smiley. A year later Control passes away and one of the British ministers hires Smiley to discover who the mole is after he receives a phone call from a disappeared agent named Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) who claims to have information about the traitor. Smiley begins investigating with the help of another agent named Benedict Cumberbatch (Peter Guillam) and begins piecing things together through a series of interesting and eye-opening flashbacks.<br/><br/>The story is just really well made, it's really smart, there is a lot of talking going on, and not much action, but it forces you to pay attention to every small detail of the movie. Once the movie is over, you feel like watching it all over again because you feel like you had missed some important details. I really loved this film and was completely satisfied with the movie. The performances are just great, Gary Oldman steals the show. He is so quiet and emotionless; what a really good spy probably looks like. You never know what is going through his mind, but you cant help but think he knows what he's doing. Then there is Tom Hardy who is always great. He is probably the person who shows more emotion in this movie, but he is brilliant. Peter Guillam, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, and John Hurt are all terrific as well. The movie really has a seventies feel to it and I don't think you can get closer to that time better than how Alfredson did. The casting, the setting, the filming, the editing, the soundtrack, everything about this film is just perfect. This film, along with Drive, were the best experiences I had with a movie this year. It isn't a sexy or entertaining film, it will require your complete attention, but the payoff is completely worth it. The screenplay was also really well adapted from the John Le Carre lengthy novel. They were able to condense the story into two hours which is much shorter than the seven hour BBC television version starring Alec Guinness. I really loved this film and absolutely recommend it over any other spy thriller. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy all of them did a lovely work in the movie, But Gary Oldman's performance is from a whole different level! The amount of emotions he managed to deliver to us without expressing them out loud, he did it just by his way of looking, talking and remaining silent when words weren't needed... he was terrific, impressive, and stunning.<br/><br/>The little bit of private life for some of the characters(Jim Prideaux and the school boy, Connie Sachs, Peter Guillam and his partner, Ricki Tarr and his girl, George Smiley and his wife) gave them a human dimension and made them much real to me. <br/><br/>Once again it's a grown-ups' movie if you want to enjoy it pleas pay attention to the details and I assure you it's completely worth it."

","Freezing. John Le Carre's spy story has a new version. Tomas Alfredson the Swedish director of the chillingly great ""Let The Righ On In"" understands the British climate. Impersonal raincoats wore by the very personal Gary Oldman are only part of the story. An undercurrent of passionate wheelings and dealings with poker face players makes for an engrossing tale that allows us some kind of distance. The production design is a masterpiece on its on. Just look at the wallpapers. I'm not going to venture into the actual plot but the performances. Gary Oldman is superb in a slightly younger and more virile version of Alec Guinness who played George Smiley in a celebrated British miniseries in 1979. Colin Firth's bisexual turn brings a dark sort of lightness to the proceedings. Tom Hardy is also superb as are Mark Strong and John Hurt. If you're a Le Carre fan you'll be enthralled, if you're not you may become one."

","The acting was first-rate. The adaptation was horrible. There are so many holes in the plot I felt as though I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie......you know, the part where we're supposed to see the birth of the story line and some character development. Anyone who wasn't already familiar with the book would be completely lost. It's like I was watching part 2 of a two-part miniseries without having seen part 1. It was beyond disjointed. Did Cirian Hinds even have any lines in the movie?? He was in scene after scene but I don't remember him saying anything.<br/><br/>In any case, I was hugely disappointed in this film. The BBC miniseries with Alec Guiness is vastly superior."

","The first episode of the BBC series sets the tone perfectly, introducing the key players and telling us what kind of people they are, all by just having them enter a room for a meeting without saying a word. The trouble with the movie version is that we never get the chance to know the characters. They are faceless people with difficult names and we don't care which one of them is the bad guy. I have read the book at least three times, seen the TV series twice and was still totally confused by the movie. Anyone who hasn't read the book, I would suggest, doesn't stand a chance. The grimy landscape around the Hotel Islay was nicely done. But why make every scene grimy? Where was the circus? Where were the lights of Shaftsbury Avenue? Where were the green fields around Jim Prideaux's prep school? The key scene with Connie Sachs is destroyed by a totally out-of-place crudity and the climax, when the mole is revealed, is thrown away with zero drama. What was going on?"

","This is quite possibly the dullest film I have ever seen. I was hoping for something a little more engaging on a Sunday afternoon but struggled to stay awake through it. It is a fairly simple story line and you know where it is going but instead of a tale with twists and turns it takes a basic linear path. In order to feign complexity all the Director did was cut up the time line. It didn't help that they focused on a particular character in a certain way which was out of context with how other characters were dealt with. Why did they do that? Oh because he is the bad guy. I was hoping that was a red herring. Unfortunately not, the guy I thought it would be 30 minutes into the film was indeed the bad guy. Clumsy, pseudo intelligent, uncreative, dullness."

","Clearly wasted on the attention-deficit cohort, this slow-burner rewards the effort and concentration you give it tenfold. It is only when you see the characterisation that cinema is capable of, in films like this, that you realise how crudely drawn and unsatisfying most performances are at the moment. Others have commented on the plot, but that is not the most interesting part of Tinker Tailor. It is the pulse that is palpable in the small static moments, where every image and gesture seems to thrum with an expectation of something wrong; a jarring discord that never lets the audience settle. You are brought into the personae of the characters in a way that makes you feel culpable; never letting you off the hook morally. This film is so good - packed with a thousand tiny pleasures - that it is sad that not everyone loves it. I wish it had had the confident US release that it deserved."
"enochsneed","1","76","122","31 December 2011"," Watch the TV series instead
","I really wanted to enjoy this film. I watch the 1979 TV series at least once a year and was looking forward to a new, dark, edgy take on a well-loved story.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed. First, the plot is mashed up (for example Ricki Tarr, who should set Smiley's mole hunt in motion, does not appear until the half-way point). Secondly, characters are not developed and even altered (Percy Alleline is a peevish bully, rather than an over-promoted pompous buffoon who has been suckered into giving the KGB a pipeline into Western intelligence, and Peter Guillam is fashionably gay). We don't even get any sense of Bill Haydon's motivation to turn double agent apart from a throwaway line about the West being ""rather horrible"". Colin Firth does make more of Haydon's frustration at working for an increasingly impotent power - Britain - when he wants to make a mark on History and therefore turns to a more dynamic force which he believes the USSR to be.<br/><br/>There is no suspense in the key scenes where Peter Guillam steals a top secret file from the archives, or even in the revelation of the mole. What Hitchcock could have done with these sequences! One scene which did work for me on a symbolic level was the Christmas party. This is original to the film but does suggest how the British intelligence service (and, by implication, Britain itself) has become lazy and hedonistic, and is losing its grip.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman totally fails to capture George Smiley's self-deprecating intelligence. We get no indication of Smiley piecing together a jigsaw and realising what the 'Witchcraft' project really means. Film-makers often confuse British reserve with unemotional stolidity, and Oldman walks straight into that trap.<br/><br/>The cinematography looks good, with shadowy interiors suggesting the claustrophobia of the world of espionage, but the design for the Circus HQ is all wrong - it is not a huge open-plan office, but a series of small, seedy little rooms.<br/><br/>All in all this was a huge disappointment. I came straight home from the cinema and put the BBC series back into my DVD player."
"Lejink","3","85","139","2 July 2014"," Stinker, paler, borer why?
","I know my limits. I just couldn't follow the plot of this labyrinthine movie adapted from John Le Carre's novel, which had previously been made into an award-winning BBC TV series with Alec Guinness as spy-catcher George Smiley. That itself had been a multi-part production but here the action, or should that be inaction, is condensed into a still lengthy two and a half-hour film.<br/><br/>It seemed that every time I picked up a plot thread, it led me down an inconclusive side-road with no real drama at any point. Even the revelation of the mole in the British Secret Service was delivered unspectacularly, in keeping with the dogmatic realism of the rest of the narrative. Plot-lines circle round and turn in on themselves but ended up only dizzying my perceptive powers.<br/><br/>The cream of contemporary British acting talent, old and young, pretty much is the whole cast but I didn't get any sense of the actors really inhabiting their parts. Gary Oldman's playing is very much in the shadow of Guinness and no-one else distinguished themselves in my eyes. They may have been in the book, I guess but strange scenes, like Smiley taking a constitutional swim in a public place or the Secret Service office party, just sort of occur, although to what end I'm not entirely sure. Apart from hearing the odd stray song on the soundtrack or sighting a vintage car in the streets, I hardly got the impression that this was the 70's at all. There were no news inserts or political issues to reference the times, leaving the story to unfold in a musty, grey netherworld, vaguely Kafka-ish in tone.<br/><br/>Which may well have been the point. All I know is this film failed to connect with me at all and was a major disappointment for this particular viewer in almost very respect."
"technical0","Null","122","207","24 October 2011"," The Emperor's New Clothes
","As the title suggests, I feel it can only be a case of the Emperor's New Clothes when reviewers commend this as a classic and brilliant film. In a discussion with a friend of mine I was also treated to the same rhetoric when I disagreed - that I must be some kind of unintelligent heathen who only likes simple action films. Not so, unfortunately. Rather, I just spent the last two hours being bored to within an inch of my life. Only because I thought there must be something coming that justified said glowing reviews did I not leave the theatre, but it turned out to be as bad a decision as going in there in the first place.<br/><br/>The film setting is pretty much the most dismal and dreary image of 1970's England imaginable. Everything is brown or grey, dirty and uninspiring, as if looking through the eyes of a severely depressed individual. We are treated to endless scenes of characters simply moving from one dreary location to another, and then sitting there not speaking. Smiley, whilst brilliantly acted by Oldman, seems incapable of responding to any dialog without first a 30 second pause of suspended animation. The majority of the rest of the characters comprised a bunch of sour, rude and miserable old men, none of which I developed even the slightest compassion for.<br/><br/>The basic story of the film is the discovery of a mole in MI6, except that since MI6 appeared to consist of the most miserable human beings on the planet then really, who cares if they find the mole or not? In fact, why not leave the mole there since he's the only thing that's even vaguely interesting. The mole is, of course, finally uncovered in a scene that typifies the film: another brown room, two miserable old men not speaking and not moving.<br/><br/>Cinematography also seems to be another buzzword to use here, so let's address it. To be fair, some nice use of the camera does add a modicum of style, but it's nothing that hasn't been done before, and if anything it's overused to the point where it gets in the way of the film and becomes tiresome.<br/><br/>It's not that there aren't some good points, there are. There are a few well done scenes, the acting is good, and the younger characters do infuse some life into the plot. However, unfortunately these islands of relief are few and far between, and the result was two and a bit of the most dreary and uninspiring hours of my life."
"teddyfridgie","1","34","52","6 February 2012"," A complete waste of money and time
","This film is superfluous. And worse, it muddies the well of memories from the superb TV production. From the advertising and trailers I had seen before, I had thought I should see this, but I shouldn't have gone. Nobody should. Very poor casting, the story brutally trimmed back to what (and where it) was cheap to film, and all mixed up anyway as the writer seemed keen on avoiding the examples of the preceding production, and of the book. My goodness, they made a ridiculous dwarf out of Percy Alleline, and a beau out of Bill Hayden, as if they thought the audience would not understand their roles otherwise. Agreed, Le Carres original novels are complex, and rich of detail, wit and character, so not really suited for the mass market. This film seems to be an attempt to reduce the detail and refinery of the novel in order to make it all better digestible for the people who are not fond of detail and refinery. Consequently, this film is not a work of art, but one of shameless exploitation of the fame and publicity of the original. I was utterly disappointed, and feel compelled to warn people of it.: Give this one a miss. Go buy and watch the TV series instead."

","First off, unless you're prepared to this multiple times you'll not get the shear brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>Every second counts in this film. There is no filler whatsoever. Watch it once and it's good (maybe not fantastic), after the 20th time of watching it becomes apparent that this is one of the best films ever made. <br/><br/>The film moves along with a pacey melancholic jazz score which meshes with action. Action in this case is doors opening, lifts whirring and railway points changing and which in this film are infinitely more powerful than exploding buildings, shootings and car chases. The film captures 70s London: grimy buildings, dull light, offices sinking in paperwork, clanking analogue machines, bland food and uniform like clothes.<br/><br/>Everyone has a secret weakness which they hide with varying degrees of success. The film shows this in the expressions of the actors more than dialogue. Every actor in this film plays a blinder. Clearly Gary Oldman is up there. His Smiley is expressionless most of the time and dialogue delivered in studied way, however, he only has to modify this slightly to make it count, when he does the effect is devastating. The other actors deserve credit: Toby Jones constantly peevish smug Alleline, the haunted look of Mark Strong's Prideaux, Colin Firth's self satisfied Haydon and David Dencik's anxious ingratiating Esterhaze. There is a classic 'wtf have I done' moment of acting from a bit player that is fantastic, if you've seen it you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes wraps up the film completely and the inspired choice of soundtrack counterpoints the repressed desires of the key leads. <br/><br/>Finally the plot is straightforward and linear, but it is made up of many many links which slot together seamlessly. At first watch you may miss many of these. On each re-watch another link will emerge which will further tie things together so making it a better film each time."
"vespet2000","1","134","238","16 January 2012"," Textbook Failure
","Many people here dislike the movie but are satisfied with the TV version and/or the book. Well, judging from the film, the spy story itself is ridiculous on so many levels. Le Carre, as a former spy should have known better.<br/><br/>The opening scene in Budapest that sets everything in motion, sadly, doesn't pass the laughing test. A British undercover agent is to meet a potential defector - a Hungarian general who is willing to reveal to the British ultra-important information about a Soviet mole at the very top of MI6. Why would this general use a go-between and thus increase the chances of being discovered, exposing his go-between (probably a dear and trusted friend) to a mortal danger? It's absurd.<br/><br/>The Budapest operation had already been betrayed, however, and the Russians know. So they are supposed to be in full control - remember, the stakes couldn't have been higher. Instead, they let a sloppy Hungarian agent mimic nervously in front of everybody and let sweat drop in front of the British spy among other revealing signs and yet the British spook omits all those. Then the stupid Hungarian agent shoots the fleeing Brit, why, when they can just surround the place and apprehend him???? Only after all this nonsense takes place, some Russian spy chief pops out of nowhere and shouts that everybody is stupid.<br/><br/>A young woman breast-feeds there right in the middle of it, sitting in the open, in the cold, so that she gets shot in the head by mistake - the bullet aimed at the fleeing spy takes a left and ends up inside her brains contrary to real life ballistics. How cruel can the spy world be! Really? How dumber and more contrived can this go?<br/><br/>Then, the captured Brit is tortured, why, when the Russians have this much better informed mole, higher, at the very top of MI6. And then the Russian master spy, named Karla (because that's how Le Carre wants to present him - a master) lets the Brit back to the UK, so that he would tell how he was tortured, how they unnecessarily blew the brains out of a young nice woman in front of him absolutely for no reason, and most importantly, the captured British agent had talked to the mole before leaving for Budapest. So if he is let back to the UK, he would immediately point at the all important mole as the potential source of the information that betrayed the entire Budapest operation. This officially makes Karla, the worst agent-runner in history, despite Le Carre's half-baked attempts to make him a master spy. <br/><br/>But it is not only the Russian ""master"" spies who are stupid. So are the British: when the mole (played by Firth) is finally caught and in custody, the British let him outside the safe house, in the open (???), nobody guarding him (???) so that everybody who wants revenge or just to shut his mouth can easily sneak in and put a bullet in his head, no sweat. Really? This is how the British will keep their uber-important detainee? The man who is supposed to give them some idea how much damage has been done, how many operations have been compromised??? <br/><br/>And this goes on and on ..., nothing makes sense in the ""spy"" story.<br/><br/>The director is employing a series of cheap shots to impress the easily impressionable - the young breastfeeding woman, the completely unnecessary violence all along. The story is boring, as many already pointed out, incoherent from A to Z.<br/><br/>On a personal level, Smiley, as smart and deeply intellectual as he pretentiously is supposed to be, finds out his wife is cheating on him only by chance, simply because she is so careless that she makes out with the mole at some ridiculously set party at the MI6 headquarters. I thought he was supposed to be able to read people, if he is so good. It turns out his wife was betraying him every step of the way.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are 2-dimensional at best, John Hurt's Control is a caricature of a human being, who would allow a person with such unhinged behavior to be the head of British intelligence? We've heard about British eccentricity and propensity for alcohol, but how do you go up in such a hierarchy with behavior that outrageous?<br/><br/>The gay element also seems contrived. For obvious political correctness. Since we all heard how some of those Soviet moles in MI6 were homosexual, here comes Le Carre (or the director) to remind us that gays can also be the good gays who catch moles. And sacrifice their personal lives, for the cause. This is sophisticated world, people, make no mistake.<br/><br/>We don't learn anything about most of the characters and their motivation with very few exceptions, such as the British rogue agent in Istanbul, who wants to save a Russian damsel in distress just out of some basic human decency. This, give or take, is the only plausible event in the whole story.<br/><br/>Oldman's acting is reasonable but nothing extraordinary, although I found some elements of his performance rather pretentious than anything else. But it could only be me.<br/><br/>The director employs clichés that I'm sure the cinema-snobbery would fawn over. For example, the main character, Oldman/Smiley is shown several times swimming in some pond with deep, deep, dark, dirty waters. So if you are so dumb and not getting it how Smiley is swimming in the dangerous and muddy waters of international espionage, here comes the director of this movie with his mind-blowing 'symbolism', generously helping you out.<br/><br/>The film was tremendous disappointment for me, especially since I saw some of the ads on British TV, presenting it as something like the best spy thriller ever. What?"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","33","52","30 January 2012"," Great Looking Film but Very Confusing
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Gary Oldman plays George Smiley, a retired British agent who is placed back into the field to try and uncover the identity a mole within the ranks of the M16's who is giving information to Russia. TINKER TAYLOR SOLDIER SPY, adapted from John le Carre's novel, is certainly a very well-made movie and it features some terrific performances but I must admit that I got lost several times. It seems most people are commenting that they can't figure out the story and it seems many people are hating the movie for this and I can't blame them. However, even though I couldn't figure out all of the plot points, this type of confusion reminded me of THE BIG SLEEP with Humphrey Bogart, another movie where you couldn't follow the story but that didn't take away from the entertainment. Director Tomas Alfredson (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) does a marvelous job at keeping the film moving at a good pace even though it's deliberately a very slow one. It seems like the director wants to get every bit of detail within the frame so there are very slow, drawn out sequences where not much happens but you can look around and just about everything will grab your attention because you never know if it's a clue or not. I really loved the cold atmosphere that he brought to the film and it's almost identical to his vampire movie. The other very strong point is that you got some terrific actors doing strong work. Oldman is so great here that I'm surprised he's gotten as much attention as he has. This isn't James Bond and there's not a single bit of flash to his character but that's what makes the performance so great. I'm sure most actors would have wanted to add more flair to the part and this is something that Oldman did in many of his early great performances. He doesn't do that here and instead he really gives such a low-key performance that you just sit there riveted because his eyes tell you everything you need to know. What also impressed me was the way he came off to be constantly thinking about everything he's taking in. Several actors have talked that it's important to listen and think while on camera and Oldman does that brilliantly here. It certainly doesn't hurt that you have impressive support by Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, David Hencik, John Hurt and Tom Hardy. Again, the story makes very little sense or at least to me, someone who hasn't read the novel but everything else is just so perfectly done that the film remains entertaining."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","49","81","17 September 2011"," One of my most anticipated movies of the year, and I wasn't let down!
","Ever since I first heard of this Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, I knew I wanted to see it. Primarily because of the cast, with Gary Oldman and John Hurt two of the best underrated actors today, Colin Firth a vast majority of the time delivering solid to marvellous work, Mark Strong who impresses me more and more every time I see him and Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch two of the most promising young stars working now.<br/><br/>Another point of interest is its source material and the 1979 version. At first, I did find the book somewhat a slow-burner and not to easy to get into. On repeat readings however, I do find it a compelling and very interesting piece of work. I had heard much about the 1979 version, and when I saw it I was more than impressed. It was tense, involving, I connected to the characters and Alec Guinness' performance in it for me was one of his most memorable and iconic of his very great career.<br/><br/>About this Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy it did have a lot to live up to, considering how great the book and the Alec Guinness version were. And I think it succeeds, it admirably condenses a very difficult book which I imagine is a daunting task, and does extremely well on its own merits too(which is how I will judge the film). At first, like the book it is a slow-burner to start with, but once the tension rises, the story gets going and more characters introduced the film becomes more absorbing. The ending I agree was a little rushed, but I personally didn't find it too convoluted.<br/><br/>I did find that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was very well made. The period recreation was wonderfully evoked, and even better than that it was authentic. The cinematography was also impressive, perhaps grainy, but it did suit the gritty, menacing tone of the film and atmosphere very well. The music is electrifying, it does play a subtle part in some scenes but also adds to any scene that is tense or shocking. The direction consistently is assured and don't fall into the trap of being too artsy.<br/><br/>The script is thoughtful and has the basic feel of the prose of the book. The story as I have said is slow to start with, and it is a good idea for those who haven't read the book or seen the 1979 version to have a good enough idea of it before watching, but the number of shocking scenes such as the killing of Hardy's love interest and Firth's character's demise and the atmosphere throughout kept me interested and thrilled. Also the part where Ciaron Hinds' character hums the George Formby song, it was terrifying in a way that they'd been listening in but Cumberbatch's face was a picture! The pace is solid, alive to nuances and doesn't plod so much as for me to call it dull or something like that.<br/><br/>Characterisation wise, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy isn't as good as the 1979 version or the book even, but in many ways I can understand. The 1979 version did have more time and room to delve more into the characters. That said, I do commend the film in doing what it could to make the characters interesting and perhaps complex and I think any ""slow"" pacing helped with this rather than hindered it. I also loved that the emotion in this film is very under the surface rather than hard hitting. The acting is excellent.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is superb, George Smiley is perhaps one of his more subtler performances, but nonetheless it is still commanding and one of my personal favourite performances of his. Of the support cast, the standouts are Tom Hardy, whose character apart from Smiley was the film's most interesting, and Mark Strong whose charisma and intensity still captivates. Benedict Cumberbatch I initially wasn't sure about in regard to age, but the acting was so great I forgot about any worries. Colin Firth gives his usual solid performance, Toby Jones also excels and Kathy Burke does well in a hard role. John Hurt gives his all into what he's got, which goes to show how good an actor he is, he's got some good lines and excellent delivery but the character isn't as developed well or as natural as the rest.<br/><br/>Overall, a very interesting and well done movie. It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and it ended up being one of my favourites too, which is saying a lot seeing how hit-and-miss so far 2011 has been for movies. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

They will find out everything they need to know without having to endure a great deal of confusion and frustration.<br/><br/>I think this movie falls into the same category as the story about The Emperor Who Had No Clothes.

"naun","7","17","25","27 December 2011"," Inevitable comparisons
","Though skilfully adapted and made with a pleasing combination of solidity and flair, this film ultimately disappoints. Its tone, grandly, cinematically sombre, strays occasionally into bathos or, at the end, barely suppressed triumphalism. At times you feel that television, an intrinsically more humdrum medium, is better suited to the moral seediness of this genre. And of course it's with its BBC television predecessor that this film invites comparison. Some things come out about even. John Hurt is a charismatic Control, even if the shortened format doesn't allow us to witness the gradual and complete disintegration of the character that Alexander Knox portrays in the BBC series. But Colin Firth brings nothing to the role of Haydon to match Ian Richardson's self-tormenting irony; it would have been interesting to see what Ciarán Hinds, already in the cast but underemployed as Roy Bland, might have done with the role. As the central character, Gary Oldman is an enigma, a man who reveals nothing of himself to others. Alec Guinness gives us something more complex, a character who reveals to others exactly what he wants them to see. In showing the light in his character, he also reveals the shadows. Oldman's Smiley is, by contrast, a hero for our modern age: we don't much care who or what he is as long as he is on our side and we win."

It goes back and forth through time and you've no idea of when a transition occurs, that is, if the next scene is a continuation of the last one or gone back in time or back to the present. I couldn't tell if there were 10 or 50 time changes. I could tell from the silence in the auditorium last night that no one else understood it either, perhaps this is why the critics have given it such high ratings. I think this gratuitous confusion added to the film really takes away from it. I won't bother trying to watch and understand it again."

","I love the '79 TV serial and the book it was based on. I went to this expecting, given the cast and LeCarre's involvement, that it would be an interesting attempt to compress and update the original and that the noble effort would fall short. Unfortunately, this film is a disaster at every level. Not a single element rises to the level of the original, most are far worse, and the failures are stupid and unnecessary.<br/><br/>In the course of trimming the material to film-length, someone decided to leave out character development. Lacon, Bland, Esterhazy and Haydon are semi-dimensional ciphers and Alleline and Control are peevish wasps. What a waste! Oldman, playing Smiley, tries for reserve and manages to look petrified; the botox budget must have been enormous. I have never appreciated the expressive and nuanced performances of Alec Guiness and the rest of the original cast so much.<br/><br/>By all means, watch the DVD of the original and its sequel. And if this bunch ever remakes Smiley's People, stay away."
"imxo","3","53","93","7 January 2012"," Compares poorly with the brilliant 1979 British television version
","I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this 2011 version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy with Gary Oldman, but when it finally arrived I was so disappointed that I considered leaving the theater shortly after the movie began. I didn't, but I should have.<br/><br/>To be fair to this current film, I admit that I have seen the British TV series version with Alec Guinness many times, so perhaps I'm merely biased. Frankly, though, - and despite the wonderful reviews of this film from many people - I don't see how anyone can take this dull, lifeless version seriously.<br/><br/>The acting in this film runs the entire gamut from A to B. Gary Oldman is no Alec Guinness. For all the taciturnity of his George Smiley, Guinness imbued his Smiley with genuine character, whereas Oldman is reduced to maintaining a stone-faced, unemotional countenance for the entire 2 hours 40 minutes duration of this film. Much has been made of Oldman's not saying a word in the first 18 minutes of the film, but this can be easily matched by some characters who had barely a sentence of two in the whole production. The usually formidable actor Ciaran Hinds must not have had more than 10 words total, and they were of absolutely no consequence. Academy Award winner Colin Firth had barely more to say, and I doubt if his role in the film contained even a whole page of dialog. Compare that to the brilliant 1979 performance in that role by the late Ian Richardson. The only character in this film who exuded any sense of real life was that of Jim Prideaux, played by Mark Strong. But Strong was not allowed to be anywhere near as ""strong"" as that of the character played in 1979 by the late Ian Bannen.<br/><br/>If I had not seen the earlier British television series I honestly doubt if I would have been able to follow the plot of this current movie. The film is dark, the characters rather dull, and flashbacks abound. I really believe the makers of this film expect viewers to already know the plot before arriving in the theater.<br/><br/>I have other quibbles. This film has the headquarters of MI-6 located in what looks to be a former warehouse. Inasmuch as MI-6 is an arm of the U. K. Foreign Office, are we expected to believe that the elite of the British intelligence establishment would be housed in those dark, dank conditions? And would spies work in an open office environment with no privacy? Hard to believe.<br/><br/>If you go to this film I hope you enjoy it. But I'd also recommend you get a DVD of the 1979 British TV series in which the acting, atmosphere, locations, and music are all far superior to this current version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy."
"scaevola","5","9","12","25 May 2013"," Directed by a cinematographer, not a story teller
","I've both read the book and watched the TV miniseries starring Alec Guinness. But the film has to stand on it's own. I don't think it did. I became increasingly disappointed as the film progressed. The ending was an absolute fizzle.<br/><br/>The director spends too much time on long empty pauses, getting from here to there, and sitting quietly in ugly rooms. The film seems to be more about getting good ""shots"" than telling a cohesive and gripping story. Even the more tense moments devolve into mere 'business.' Yawn. I imagine some people were lost. I know I was in spots. I also imagine some people just didn't care by the end. <br/><br/>Some of the director's more dubious choices pulled me right out of the film. Did we need to keep seeing the chess pieces? Got it the first time. The shot of Control dead in the hospital felt clumsy and disconnected. Why waste all that time with Smiley swimming in muddy water? We get it. Move on. The Christmas party flashbacks interrupted the story with no value added. And the time wasted in buying new glasses so we can tell future from past was clumsy and sophomoric. Cumberbatch played his big scene beautifully, but the device of making him gay was ludicrous. Honestly, a gay partner in this world would NOT be secret. <br/><br/>I'd trade all of that for a bit more character development. I had trouble placing—or caring about—the players throughout. Smiley was especially flat and remote—his sharp intelligence and drive lost in empty silence. The meeting with Connie could have been a poignant reminder of the Circus that was, but here it's just a plot device. No Karla? That scene should have been a mine of material about these two titans, yet we get a flat narrative.<br/><br/>If the effort made in manipulating our visual field was spent on the story, this could have been so much more. Instead, it falls far short of engaging us in a very personalized tale of betrayal and the decades- long manipulation of an entire service."

","I am a sharp, creative 46 year old man with more than thirty years in the television/movie industry and this was simply a very slow, boring movie. I love spy movies from Bond to Bourne, and the classics like Three Days of the Condor, The French Connection and Day of the Jackal. I like slow movies by David Lynch and Martin Scorsese. But this - this was a exceedingly lackluster slow motion film noir vanity piece and it's mostly about how long Gary Oldman can stare meaninglessly into space without blinking! Remember all those long shots of people walking to & from cars, buildings and offices from the sixties? They're back! Minus the drama because editorial is cut like an Army Training reel from the Nixon Administration!<br/><br/>What really bothers me is how out of touch I am by hating this movie; I'm still shocked anybody could rate this any better than a generous 5 or 6 - it's just that bad.<br/><br/>If you like glacial pacing and subtext to the point of parody, this film may still be too ambitious for you. I can only imagine how bored a young person would be with this moldy old movie. Avoid!"
"CihanVercan","5","25","41","16 December 2012"," The premise is hard to fit into two hours and into this sort of plot-structure
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a movie adapted from one of the best Cold War era crime novels, with the same title with a slight difference: ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy"". When you put commas as they appear on the 1974 novel cover, you get to understand that a tinker is a spy, a tailor is a spy, and a soldier also is a spy. And when you think of it, you get to ask yourself this question: <br/><br/>""Why would a tinker turns a spy, and a tailor, and a soldier too?"" <br/><br/>Take a guess to answer the question above. 'Cause if you don't, the movie, which is terribly directed, won't tell you what the spies are trying to find out. Here is the truth after the unknown. The truth lies underneath a tongue twister game Children of the Cold War in Britain used to play. The tongue twister is this, as it appears on the prologue of John le Carré 's novel: <br/><br/>""Tinker... Tailor... Soldier... Sailor... Rich... Poor... Beggar... Robber, take the sea-shells and take the jacket buttons, trade in daisy leaves and trade in sunflower seeds, now you did, we are friends, we are friends, we are friends"" <br/><br/>While reading the novel, which is consisted of 42 episodes, 7 episodes for each occupation from the children's tongue twister and there are 6 pieces in the game of Chess. 7 times 6 equals to 42. When you pair them with each other, you get to solve the mystery: <br/><br/>Chess pieces from highest rank to the lowest rank: ""King... Queen... Rook... Bishop... Knight... Pawn"" <br/><br/>Let's pair them: ""Tinker is King... Tailor is Queen... Soldier is Rook... Sailor is Bishop... Rich is Knight... Poor is Pawn"" <br/><br/>When Bishop(Gary Oldman as Smiley) explores the Rook(John Hurt as Control)'s chess board with the names and photos of his subordinates(Knight and Pawn), even Smiley didn't know that he was the Bishop. And when the Knight(Mark Strong as Prideaux) is assassinated, what should the Rook do next? That's what the movie is about. <br/><br/>Since the promise is a heavy secret, which both the screenwriters and the director hides away from the audience, to fit the story into this sort of plot-structure ; then you don't have much to tell. <br/><br/>John le Carré 's novel is one of the best boring novels I've ever read in my life, even though it has a unique mystery. Yes, it's a mystery, but in fact there is nothing happening at the present time. It's just all thoughts and ideas about the events in the past, in order to find the mole that destroys the organization's plans. Should every crime story necessarily be involved with a mole? <br/><br/>So, don't expect nothing original to find, when you're watching Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, except some unique production aspects as follows: <br/><br/>1- Unpredictable hero 2- No bad guy to challenge against 3- An unrevealed secret turns good guys into bad guys 4- Suspicion, kills! 5- Spectacular views from some European cities, the shots from the city of Istanbul are the most accurate ones(except the Hotel shot) after other hit movies such as Eastern Promises, James Bond: From Russia With Love and a Jackie Chan comedy/crime flick <br/><br/>If you really want a good crime/thriller/mystery watch Robert De Niro and Matt Damon 's The Good Shepherd(2006), since in this specific genre and sub-genre mix no better movies filmed yet."

I even tried watching this film on two different occasions--and just found my mind wandering. It isn't that the acting is bad (the film is made up of wonderful actors such as John Hurt and Colin Firth). And, perhaps it isn't because the story sucks--as a bazillion copies of the book have been sold and it also was a very successful British TV series. No, to me the trouble is the mood. The director chose to film the movie in the most somber manner possible. As a result, despite being a spy film, there is almost no energy. And everything is GRAY--very, very gray. Despite 1973 being a year known for its outrageous colors, everyone in the film wears gray and brown suits---and even the brown looked rather gray! This, combined with oppressively dismal music just made this a very unpleasant viewing experience for me. So unpleasant, I just didn't care at all for the characters and was kind of hoping international Communism would win JUST to shake it up and provide some interest!! I know the film was Oscar-nominated and folks love it based on the reviews I read, but apart from ""Tree of Life"", I can't think of a duller film that's received a nomination in recent years.

In addition, there are random scenes which do not add to the film in any remote way and can only be described as 'filler'. There is no continuity or flow. The soundtrack is obscene.<br/><br/>Oldman is not acting, rather just staying very still and looking pensive. Hurt's mannerisms are a carbon copy of his role as Sutcliffe in V for Vendetta.

","This is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen, here is why... The audience at the cinema was choc-a-bloc with silver haired, distinguished types probably yearning for an intelligent spy thriller which would pay homage to the Alec Guinness's famous television mini-series. What they got was a snail paced, bland piece of story-telling set in a post-cold war era that seemed to lack any sense of conflict or relevance. The story is essentially about the Head of British intelligence believing that there was a double agent at the top of the organisation. He then subsequently dies, so little is made of this that if you mistakenly enjoy a long blink, (which you probably will during the course of the film) you would miss what I would've assumed to be a fairly significant event. Smiley (Gary Oldman) is then brought back from retirement to investigate this further... I just feel like so many different story trails were started and never addressed, let alone finished. What was the information being passed on? Was it significant? What was the motivation for being a double agent? Was there anything sinister about the Head of British intelligence's death? Well the answers won't be revealed by this film. I am all for subtlety and a thought provoking, engaging plot but this left me feeling that each scene veered from egg white to cream. Another dire aspect of this film was the lack of depth to any of the characters. Put simply, I didn't have a bleeding clue about the background of well... anyone. Annoying as the acting talent available was so obviously outstanding. This was either a bad film, or I didn't appreciate the meaningful stares, unspoken dialogue or mysteriousness-ness of it all. My advice is to avoid this film, or counteract it's soporific effects by renting The Rock , Mission Impossible or Bourne Identity to blow the cobwebs away from your mind immediately after."

","I'm a huge fan of spy movies! I loved The Day of the Jackal, The Bourne Identity. However, this film fails on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. First, we learn almost nothing about the characters. Secondly, I really got tired of watching filing, shuffling of papers, and scenes of men sitting in chairs over and over without any real action. The cuts back and forth are confusing, the actors look extremely unattractive, and most of the scenes are of men sitting down and talking. Or not talking. They stare, they stare again, they mutter. I found this film to be toxic it was so dull. And if the scenes are from the 1970s, how about sideburns on the men? Or double vented suits? This film was a terrible disappointment."

","First of all I have to say, I find it hard to think of many films at all that I hate. This one definitely fits into that category though.<br/><br/>Not only was this the most confusing film I have ever seen, it was also the most bored I ever remember being. I do like some films which require some thought process to enjoy, but there has to be something to actually think about or they are pointless. This film had nothing: no discernible plot (as far as I could tell), no characters that I particularly felt that I got to know or cared about, and I have to say that I am left totally confused by some of the characters, events and scenes (such as the point of the first scene) and about how they actually found out who the 'mole' was (as they were obviously always going to). I always think that films that start out boring have potential to pick up at the end and redeem themselves, and many do, but this one never came close.<br/><br/>I was never expecting a James Bond style film with car chases, fire fights and gadgets but it would have been nice to have something to actually make the film at least slightly interesting. Both myself and my girlfriend, who I went with, could feel our eyelids drooping most of the way through and when leaving most films we usually talk about the good bits, whether funny, surprising, thought provoking or just memorable, but there was absolutely nothing to discuss about this film that fits into the above. <br/><br/>As you may have gathered I was not a fan.

","It says a lot about the film that there's a post at the front page right now calling it the emperor's new clothes, doesn't it? Oh, the film may turn out to be complete bunk when you watch it, but you just know it's going to be interesting. Right? <br/><br/>It is. It's one of the most engrossing stories I've been told. It ticks for me all the same boxes The Lives of Others did; Cold War, cold souls, coded eyes looking everywhere. The very best that cinematic deceit can offer.<br/><br/>I cannot tell you what it does or doesn't to the book and TV series, only that I was so stoked that I have the latter here with me to watch. But that is another post.<br/><br/>This, this you have to work to enjoy. It's directly structured to receive you but you have to be the spy, actively so. To better explain how this works, imagine Nolan had done this. There would be an architectural puzzle you'd be called to solve, boxes to arrange, but constant verbiage that would point for you the order of the pieces. It would seem like cerebral work, where in fact it would be like doing a crossword. Why this works by contrast, is the complete abstraction that permeates the story. Here, in dingy murky England, as well as abroad, then as well as now; there are no clear demarcations, and no one to guide us. Our detective is as much a cipher as anyone else, also part of the chess pawns we're called to move. <br/><br/>The broader idea is that the powers in control of this world that many of us experienced from one corner and believed elsewhere to be better, brighter, are equally ruthless, equally cunning, that the game unfolding between them has been so diffused it has drained the world of any color that would make a difference. England looks every bit as we were told was on the other side of the Curtain, pallid shambles.<br/><br/>So in order to get to the bottom of things, you have to abstract from your end. It's not enough to see spies outwit each other, you will have to see like one. You will need to be able to see every detail without being bogged down by any. You will need to leave this as you found it, having touched every corner. Move swiftly back and forth between the pieces, and move passionless, detached, knowing it's going to be always a little bigger and more intricate than you can immediately fathom.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is simply superb in this, a role he cultivated as Gordon in the Batman films. It's a joy to be able to watch a great actor erase his presence.<br/><br/>For Smiley the point is to solve the case. Ours is getting to see how he tinkers and tailors the narrative. The resolution is an anti-climax, and we get to know all there is to know here. It was an aesthetic choice we learn, as much as a moral one.<br/><br/>Again neither of this is what is at stake in our film. Aesthetically, it is a simply drab, controlled affair. It was perhaps a wise choice that a Swede was brought in to direct, from a country that never having had any stakes in the game. But it's the only false note here, because he merely colors the thing. Morally, the whole thing is meant to be moot. Who knows what ruthlessness Smiley and Control perpetrated from their end.<br/><br/>No, the point is that you get to watch a world unfold beyond control. You can only spy. The whole shifting world is a distant reflection on your glasses. I get shivers just thinking what Antonioni could have done with this, it should have been his project after The Passenger."

","I really enjoyed this film. Gary Oldman's portrayal of George Smiley was brilliantly enigmatic. I liked the way the characters and locations were introduced verbally by another character and then visually in the film, so it was always clear where the action was taking place and who was in the scene. All the complex threads of the story were followed clearly. I remember trying to follow Tinker, Taylor, Soldier Spy when it was televised in days before video recordings were available and, if you missed an episode, you lost the plot! Not so with this film, which with a strong cast and intelligent filming makes for a completely engaging film. It will keep you guessing and get you trying to work out who the mole is to the very end. It was great to watch and the music was well chosen, complementary and not intrusive, never obscuring the dialogue. It makes a change for a film to challenge you to try to anticipate the twists and turns of the plot. This is definitely a watch-again film and I look forward to seeing more like it."

","This is one of those films in which everybody looks at everybody else deeply meaningfully, to convey a story that by now lacks both originality and interest (who is the mole in the organization?! wowee!). The characters even walk slowly and purposefully to ensure you realize they're involved in something terribly significant.<br/><br/>Every small step of the plot is unfolded with the kind of heavy handed, overblown technique so beloved of the pretentious auteur directors of the 1960s. I thought they didn't make them like this any more, but unfortunately I was wrong. I'd like to give such an obviously high quality cast and production team the benefit of the doubt; that they caught me in a bad mood on a bad day. But when you see even railway trains overacting you have objective evidence that you're watching a film whose makers think they're a darn sight smarter than they really are. One cutaway shows a portion of railway track switching — presumably symbolism that someone in the story just got the point (geddit?).<br/><br/>I'm sorry I couldn't like this one better; it is meant to give us a realistic view of the tedious but dangerous business of cold war spying. But it takes ponderous, pretentious movie making to new heights.

"michaellaing71","7","28","51","16 September 2011"," A good film but not as good as the BBC's adaptation
","Going into watching this film, I had recently watched the BBC adaptation, which is a master piece of television. So when I review this film, it is in comparison with the BBC version from 1979.<br/><br/>Firstly I have to talk about the Mise en scène. The film is set in 1973 and everything is made to feel drab, desaturated and used, as if the 60s never happened. The feeling is that Britain is old, not the power that it once was, where bureaucracy is beginning to take over and everyone is feeling negative.<br/><br/>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a very strong cast and I think, mostly everyone does very well. Gary Oldman is one of my favourite actor and his portrayal of George Smiley is one of the most subtle and destingished performances I have seen from an actor, He is soft spoken, often letting his gestures and movements do the talking. Tom Hardy again shows that he is one of the best up and coming actors, dominates his scenes, with skill and vigour, that never goes over the top. It actually show the skill that Gary Oldman has that he doesn't feel the need to compete and it reinforces the gravitas that his character has.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is good in his role, though I don't always feel that he has a toughness that his character should have. Kathy Burke handles a very hard role well, though she isn't in the film for long and her scene doesn't feel as important, as I feel it should. The role of Control is probably the most over the top and for me works the least well. Mark Strong gives a good performance but I would have liked to see slightly more of his character.<br/><br/>John Hurt tries very hard as a man running out of time but the character feels forced and doesn't quite work. I am not sure if this is down to the acting of just the way the character was originally written. <br/><br/>With the four members of the top of the circus, I have mixed views. The film starts to try and build the four of them up but then fails to keep the early momentum going. I think the acting is well done, though Toby Jones character isn't nearly as pompous as I would have liked and David Dencik just breaks down to easily towards the end. Ciarán Hinds is a very strong actor but he isn't given enough to do which does leave a problem. Colin Firth plays the most likable character in the entire film and does a good job, coming over as friendly and reliable.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of films where the cinematography is particularly noticeable and this is one of the more distracting things for me with the new version of the film. Hoyte Van Hoytema is a very talented director of photography and is quite amazing, for me Oscar worthy if you enjoy it. But I just found that the constant use of and changing of depth of field, especially in the first half of the film was too artsy. It didn't help much with the pacing of the film, which I will go onto in a while. The score by Alberto Iglesias is very underplayed but perfectly fits the tone of the film, never distracting and extremely subtle. There is also a very interesting moment in the film where is played which although from the 1930s works very well. <br/><br/>Tomas Alfredson is a good director and I suspect a very good actors director, bringing out some very good performances. I cannot give complete praise though. Scenes don't always seem to flow as well as I would have liked, in conjunction with the cinematography there is a lot of lingering around, where nothing his happening, which is meant to show a character contemplating but is just slow.<br/><br/>In the end though the biggest problem with the film is time, Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan have done a sterling job of trying to adapt John le Carré book, but I just don't feel that they can succeed in the time allowed for a film. There are just so many little things that the film has to either cut or condense, and some of the characters are never given the space that they need, to build up the tension that is needed for a 'who done it'.<br/><br/>The film is not bad, in fact it is good. It cannot compete with the BBC series though and how ever good Gary Oldman, he runs up against the classic performance Alec Guinness gave in the role. If you have not seen the BBC series, I would suggest watching the film first and then watching the TV series because it is the definitive version of the story and also leads to Smiley's People which for me is even better."
"thefilmlawyers","9","6","8","27 October 2015"," A British film aficionado's ultimate orgasm
","Gary Oldman. Tom Hardy. Benedict Cumberbatch. Colin Firth. John Hurt. Ciaran Hinds. To say that the cast of the film adaptation of John Le Carre's famed spy series is at an A-list level is an understatement; this film stars a ""who's who"" of British cinema. In keeping in line with the Cold War theme established in our recent Bridge of Spies review, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy replaces the Americans with MI6 (British Intelligence) against the Soviets, in a very thrilling cat-and-mouse game intent on unmasking the traitor embedded within the Circus (MI6's upper echelon). <br/><br/>To start off, all those worried about the large ensemble cast potentially being too egotistical to coexist in minor roles within this the film can rid themselves of any worry, as the cast meshes perfectly and sees every actor deliver a stellar performance, regardless of screen time. Another thing to keep in mind is that this film is not targeted towards those that have an inclination for action-heavy spy films ala the Bond film series, but rather those that are willing to think and appreciate the subtle nuances that the film painstakingly recreates from its source material. <br/><br/>It seems hard to believe that it was over twenty years ago that Gary Oldman was playing insanely over the top – and still memorable- villain Stansfield in Leon The Professional. In Tinker, Oldman heads the cast in the role of George Smiley, recruited by Control (played masterfully in a short role by John Hurt) to sniff out the spy at Circus, with the suspects being assigned codenames that are illustrated in the film's title. Smiley has two weaknesses that are established early on, his cheating wife and a Soviet equivalent named Karla. It speaks volumes about the quality of the script and the direction that not once are either of the two parties shown yet they both play an integral role in establishing Smiley's character and aiding in arriving at his decision determining who the mole is. Within the cast that we mentioned was as deep in high-end talent as any in recent memory, Oldman stands out for portraying his veteran character as someone that would normally be as nondescript as can be if not for Oldman mastering how to portray a brilliant mind and checkered past that helped earn his Smiley character his position within MI6's Circus. <br/><br/>Accompanying Oldman are the actors mentioned above and it truly is a veritable dream team of the top British actors alive today. Cumberbatch and Hardy play roles one would not expect them in with their massive popularity nowadays, but it speaks to their quality as actors that they excel in their roles (Hardy was a delight as the disheveled Ricky Tarr). Mark Strong is amongst the least heralded of the cast yet delivers an equally poignant performance in his role as a teacher whose role in the introduction sets the stage for the rest of the film. There is no disappointment amongst the cast's performances, further helping the film stake its claim as one of the best of 2011. <br/><br/>The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson, he of Let the Right One In fame, which established his credentials as an auteur capable of establishing the right blend of melancholia and tension amongst Tinker's less than happy group of spies. Alfredson's direction was just the right amount of subtle, capturing the smallest of facial expressions and presenting them in ways that make the viewer actively wonder who the mole could be. Although the revelation of the mole was a tad anti-climactic and should have been guessed by the more attentive viewers a few scenes prior, the setup leading up to said reveal was executed as well as can be, with Alfredson's presentation keeping the viewer in a state of suspense and tension throughout. Very rarely can one say that a film is just the right length as an adaption from a book –Peter Jackson's ludicrously bloated Hobbit trilogy, anyone? - but Alfredson manages to capture the essence of the TV series and book in the run time of 127 minutes. Here's hoping he gets another crack at adapting source material as well written and established as Le Carrie's spy series, his work on Tinker solidifying him as one of the better directors in cinema.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound that accompanies Alfredson's direction was nothing short of brilliant itself, with the sound editing standing out for its innovative use of conversation filters. To put it another way, the sound editing helps the audience listen to conversations within Smiley's head and filters it just right that it presents the key phrase which helps him solve the mystery as if it was homing in on it. A tad difficult to describe in text form but it is something that needs to be experienced in order to be appreciated for its innovativeness. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytemma's use of stylistic nuances further elevates the quality of scenes, as lingering shots that focus in on random or insignificant objects still evoke a sense of intrigue for the audience. The visual pleasure that Hoytemma's shots is something which must be experienced along with the aforementioned sound editing, with something as insignificant as a close-up of Oldman's character's furrowed brows on his face, draped in shadow, still somehow serving to showcase to the audience what his character stands for. Speaks to the quality of the cinematography that scenes such as this can be paired with the highly-tense opening scene that was focused on quick cuts and yet still flow well together. <br/><br/>For those that appreciate old school espionage tales or just wish to see all of Britain's finest actors in one film together, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a must see. Nowhere else will you get to see Sherlock Holmes in a film with Mad Max and King George while Commissioner Gordon is omnipresent.<br/><br/>http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com for more reviews"
"tedg","Null","13","21","15 January 2012"," Control
","My notion of noir is simple: it is a form of narrative that recognizes that there is a viewer, and that the presence of the viewer reshapes the world to make an interesting story. That is, various unlikely circumstances occur; portholes to visibility by us as ghosts are opened; knowledge by the characters of what is going on are gated by what we know in a too and fro of dominance.<br/><br/>It is, in other words, a world where the very presence of a viewer controls various aspects. A central character (usually one, usually a random man) struggles with how he is buffeted; comes perhaps to understand it and in the normal form achieves points in the game that puts him at the same level as the viewer. <br/><br/>We are a sophisticated people, and this has been around for a long time — and in cinema and cinematically influenced art as well. So we have some clever adaptations and twists. One common form is the massive, all-controlling conspiracy. Another is the modern detective story where the discovery is about the detective's self as much as grokking the murder. Yet another is the con story where we follow the controller's actions but only at the end discover the means of manipulation.<br/><br/>Here we have another variant, which is essentially a detective story to discover who is the control over the world that is manipulating our random guy, aptly named Smiley. It shares elements of the three examples above, but allows for a deeper texture because it recalls worlds that have dynamics we understand. So a talented filmmaker can reference these.<br/><br/>And boy do we have a talented filmmaker!<br/><br/>One world is simply the world of men with power and how they perform small ballets in their relationships one to another to be top dog, using deniable, even unconscious tactics. This becomes the foremost world in this film, and gives our main actors something to use. All of them are first rate; all respond with insights from the craft. Kathy Bates is perfectly placed as a displaced analyst with enough vision to value 'her boys' for their sexual attractiveness at the top of the heap we see.<br/><br/>Another world is the cold war. It was hot when the book appeared, but the book already was treating it as a sort of fantasy world that came with prefabricated rules. In some ways, it has taken until now for this perspective to fully mature so that this film in this time can be far deeper than the original novel was in its time. Frankly, in its time it was trash for airport reading, of the Grisham variety. <br/><br/>Yet another world is that of Britain in the early seventies. This was a bleak country, still not recovered from the war while its adversaries were soaring. It clung to the US instead of the continent. There is a wistful desire to please the master here that hits home for this US viewer, knowing what I know about the relationships of the intel communities.<br/><br/>And we have the inner, personal world of loves, companions, friends, trust and sex. These are always where the bones of a story rest, and are broken.<br/><br/>All of these are noir worlds, all manipulated by various controls (Controls, as a proper noun).<br/><br/>All of these are masterfully called, merged and presented with us unsure of what we control.<br/><br/>Already, I have this as a candidate for one of my two rare selections of the most important films of 2012 (my 'Fours').<br/><br/>See it. See it in a theater.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","9","14","23","6 January 2012"," An impressive emotional labyrinth.
","In the twisty, desolate world of espionage present in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, director Tomas Alfredson and a lush ensemble cast dive us into a world deceit and distrust during the Cold War era. The premise is simple; in the top ring of MI6 (known as The Circus) there is a Soviet mole. What follows this, however, is anything but simple. Characters weave in and out, giving us answers but leaving with potentially more questions. Often times there are films dealing with deceit that present characters who have a small grasp of what's going on but not much of an idea of the overall picture; rarely has there been a film that leaves the audience feeling the same.<br/><br/>It's this interesting tactic that I think sets Tinker apart in many ways. For every move that you understand there are one or two that are left mysterious; a motivation you're unsure of, a conversation that may not be everything it seems. I think Alfredson does a terrific job of, almost from the very moment the film begins, establishing a world so filled with double meanings that even the most casual conversation can lead the viewer to question if we're seeing what is really going on. There's so much below the surface that watching the film becomes as much of a puzzle as the one the characters are trying to figure out within it.<br/><br/>A lot of credit here goes to writers Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, who are surprisingly skilled at condensing a very dense novel into a two hour film. Every now and then you can feel the effect of maybe some characters not being as fleshed out as they should, but for every scene that we might not see on camera, the actors make up for with an insightful look into their souls. Eye-acting is something that I've always admired greatly and just about every member of this deep ensemble is working that skill to the level.<br/><br/>At the top of the hill is Gary Oldman as George Smiley, the recently retired agent who is tasked with the duty of cracking this labyrinthine code, and he absolutely shines. Oldman is a performer who has many times been praised high for his theatrical performances in films like Leon and Sid and Nancy where he bursts at the seams with emotion, but here he proves that he can do the opposite by keeping that wealth of feeling hidden beneath those big frames.<br/><br/>Through all of the twists and turns of the narrative that goes on here, I think that the film ultimately shines brightest as a character piece, strangely enough. In spite of having to condense the story at the risk of some character development, it still ends up being this heartbreaking study of the men who go into this line of work. Along with Oldman there is a wealthy ensemble of performances that hauntingly portray the pain and suffering that decades of lies and paranoia can eventually take on someone.<br/><br/>There's a scene where Smiley tells Benedict Cumberbatch's character about a time when he tried to turn a Soviet agent and in that scene Oldman displays the toll that this life has taken on him and it is devastating. He does it without shedding a tear or even pushing too hard on any syllable, but in those eyes and that voice you can feel the things that haunt him at night and it's powerful stuff. Of course the entire ensemble brings their A game here, with very notable performances from just about everyone.<br/><br/>Almost everyone gets their moment in the sun, except for Ciaran Hinds, and they all manage to impress. I just want to single out Colin Firth, who absolutely broke my heart in his final scenes, and Mark Strong, who after the past few years of playing the stoic bad guy finally got to dig into a part with more emotional layers to it and he really nailed it. These veteran actors all give us that sense of what this life can do to a man, and the roles played by Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy are just as important looks into the beginning of a path that will eventually lead them to the same location.<br/><br/>In that same scene with Oldman and Cumberbatch, he tells his young protégé that in this world you are constantly looking for the weakness in everyone else and the acting here shows us just that; everyone is putting up such a front, trying to remain cold and complacent, as to not allow anyone else to see any weakness for even a single second.<br/><br/>The puzzle leads to a rather conventional place in the narrative sense, but what it does on a deeper level I found to be extraordinary. We enter a world where the people in it don't even know what their motivation is half of the time. It's a new kind of espionage out there and some of these pieces just feel like they're playing a part. Some of the dialogue is so bold and eye-opening for this kind of film, a rare look into the actual hearts and souls (or lack thereof) of these people, rather than just an excuse for some slick action.<br/><br/>Of course the technical qualities of the film are aces across the board, from the very bleak and cold tone in which it's shot to the wonderfully impressive set designs, but for me it really came down to this painstaking study of these people. I find it interesting when people say that they were bored by the film, because with this tone and these wounded creatures I honestly wish I could have watched this play out all day long."

Given the source of this material, I was really expecting something much, much better.<br/><br/>The beginning was pretty good. The first 10 or 15 minutes really put you on the edge of your seat. Then, it happened. NOTHING! This was a dialog film and I knew that going in but the whole movie? We are talking espionage, secrets, covert ops! This thing talked itself to death. I found myself looking for the fast forward button in the theater, hoping to move this dinosaur along. I love Gary Oldman and was expecting, I don't know, maybe a performance? I think of his work in Dracula and wonder, where did he go? This film was slow, boring, it dragged and dragged. After an hour and a half I was so looking forward to ending. When it finally came, after what seemed to be a second lifetime, it ended... Badly!"
"davaria","Null","29","55","26 September 2011"," a failed experiment
","My impression, while trying to stay awake during the first part, was of a failed experiment: let's vampirize the cold war movie genre (good intention) and take anything vital out of it. Which might have been interesting if the vampirization had given life to something else. Unfortunately this does not happen. The film is excruciatingly lost in details, and it's even more painful because of the beautiful cinematography, which feels wasted on this effort. It's like a heavy coat of lead covering... well, not much. The actors seem disconnected from the environment and from each other (not only the characters, which would make sense considering the context, but the actors themselves, they seem to be in a vacuum). I found impossible to connect emotionally with any of them, which makes sense as they're all quite dispirited, but the problem is that none of them actually develops into a proper character. The non-linear time-line doesn't really feel justified, it's just confusing, over a plot that (Le Carré) is already quite convoluted. The only things that kept me from falling asleep were the photography, cinematography and editing, which are definitively captivating. But it's a case of style over substance. I might have as well stayed at home to watch my espresso machine."

","I really was looking forward to this movie. Haven't read the book, haven't watched the TV Series. So everything about the movie was new to me. Had they supplied a handbook explaining who is who what is what and where is where and especially when is when, I might have followed the story a little bit. But even then, I am not so sure. I really thought that either my English language was not enough or my IQ until I spoke to one of the other viewers on the exit of the theatre and -thankfully- she confirmed to me that it was neither my English nor my IQ. The film is just plainly bad. Nothing moves or means anything. Obviously an intricate story is there, but someone has to be able to tell you that. Yes the acting is excellent, no denying that. But it's more like different -and totally unrelated- sections of a script being rehearsed in a top level theater school. A real time waster."
"jr_is_online","2","27","51","16 October 2011"," No Depth to Characters
","I went to see this film expecting great things, a thinking man's thriller is what I had read. Unfortunately in trying to squeeze a very complex plot into two hours no amount of fine acting was going to make this movie any more than a superficial cover of the original TV series. The movie, however, still felt long and drawn out probably because I never engaged with the characters. We were not given enough detail or history on any of the key characters or 'suspects', we did not really know what they did or feel any affinity to them, therefore by the end I not only wasn't shocked or surprised by who was the spy or why they did it, I just didn't care. In essence although there was some good acting the delivery of the story was flawed and left massive holes for the viewer to fill in. All in all a waste of a couple of hours."

","I enjoy a wide range of movies, all styles and genres: Hollywood blockbusters, Art House, Foreign Films, Sci-Fi, Action movies, Dramas, Thrillers, Rom Coms etc. and especially this sort of spy drama/thriller/mystery I think I am generally favorably inclined to most movies. Even films I do not greatly enjoy I can usually appreciate some of their qualities.<br/><br/>However not this film.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I have found a movie as dull and boring as this movie, to the extent that I felt compelled to jump on the net and add my views to the comments being made about this film.<br/><br/>Dull, boring, tedious and uninteresting are the words that spring into my mind after putting up with this wholly underwhelming movie.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy this movie and I kept holding out hope that at sometime during its interminable 127 minute duration it was going to get better. Alas it did not, boring from start to finish.<br/><br/>Being a fan of Gary Oldman I can only blame the director for the dull performance he delivered in this movie. Even characters that are meant to be played as complex and deep need to convey some spark and insight from the actor. Here there was none.<br/><br/>I watched this movie because it was generally being well reviewed and had an IMDb rating of 7.3 and was nominated for a number of awards (eg 11 at BAFTA). Now I cannot understand how this has occurred.<br/><br/>A bit more research now and I find it was snubbed by the Golden Globes so it seems not everyone has been sucked in.<br/><br/>I also found out that there are a number of members on IMDb who share my opinion. I now wish I had taken notice of them before deciding to see this movie.<br/><br/>I had the choice of viewing this movie or the Iron Lady. I can only hope that my comments here may save some poor soul from making the same mistake that I did. In my opinion any other movie playing now or at any other time in the foreseeable future would have been a better choice than this boring and disappointing movie.<br/><br/>By the way did I say this movie was boring? Just wanted to make sure I got this point across."

","Finally caught this wonderful film on DVD. Being a fan of le Carré's work I wasn't keen on watching it on the big screen. But I should have! Asides from the spectacular performances, the indelible score and the deftly nuanced direction, the adaptation itself handles most of the novel's complexities quite effectively. It's surprising, affecting and even touching. Yes, the Alec Guinness TV version is fondly remembered by most. However, I felt that this new version is more effective in how it challenges the viewer so that the reward at the end is exponentially more satisfying. Indeed, this is the type of film that begs to be screened more than once and I can't wait to see it again."
"bdx3","1","9","14","26 March 2012"," Horrid
","Terrible from start to finish. If you read the book, and I have read almost all John LeCarre's books, you wonder why they bothered to remake this classic.<br/><br/>The penultimate Smiley is Sir Alec Guinness, who played the role in a PBS television production and aced it. Guinness is Smiley. Peter Guillam is much more convincing in the TV miniseries as is Ricky Tarr, the instigator. The best thing that can be said about the movie's Bill Hayden is that he looks a little bit like the miniseries Bill Hayden. You don't realize who anybody is - Percy, Esterhase, Bland, they all blend together like Summer theater actors.<br/><br/>In the TV version, Smiley interviews Karla, and Patrick Stewart gives an outstanding performance without ever uttering a word. In this movie, they skip trying to outdo Stewart by having Smiley recount the spy's actions to Guillam, as if they don't even want try to compete with the TV version. I wish they had felt that way about the whole movie.<br/><br/>Oh and the opening scene with Prideaux takes place in the countryside in the book and the TV miniseries. The movie does a modern restaurant version that could be used in an NCIS episode. Crap - multiplied at the end when Prideaux shoots Hayden with a rifle - sheesh - why bother? Do yourself a favor - read the book (trilogy) and rent the TV version with Alec Guiness. Forget they even made this. I wish I could."
"llewelp","Null","9","14","17 September 2011"," Depends if you've seen the BBC serial
","As someone who watched the original BBC adaptation in 1980 and admired it as one of the best BBC series ever made, watching this film was a disappointment. It suffers by comparison in almost every respect. At key scenes I kept thinking back to the BBC version: Smiley's interviews with Connie, beautifully played by Beryl Reid; the scenes with Jerry Westerby played by Joss Ackland; the introduction to the main characters as we see them enter the Circus meeting room for the first time - particularly Percy's elaborate pipe filling. In this version we have moved on three scenes in the time it takes Percy to tamp down his tobacco.<br/><br/>And that is one of the major problems with this film, the plot exposition is so compressed. It has been well done, but it was the slow unfolding of the 'beautiful knot' that was half the pleasure. The other half was the incomparable acting led by Guinness. Gary Oldman is a seriously good actor, but Guinness was a great actor and could convey with a gaze or a look the deep intelligence and melancholy at the heart of the character in a way that Oldman can't. <br/><br/>Even the recreation of the 1970's, though convincing , has to be strived for, whereas in 1979 it was just there for the BBC, ready to be used. The overall result left me ultimately feeling uninvolved. The film ended, the lights came up and that was that. OK but not as good as the book or the TV series. Now that's damning with faint praise."
"robert-temple-1","1","13","22","4 March 2012"," A complete failure
","I have seen the TV series of this novel made in 1979 three times and the performance by Alec Guinness as George Smiley was one of the great milestones in the history of television drama. Compared to him, in this sad and failed new film version, the performance as Smiley by Gary Oldman is utterly pathetic. Oldman is so wooden he should really be growing in Kew Gardens. On the rare occasions when he moves or tries to show some expression, it is like watching the twitching of a corpse in its coffin, having been given a slight shock by a portable battery. The only decent performances in the film are by John Hurt and Colin Firth, who simply do not know how to be bad, no matter how hard the director attempts to make them so. Mark Strong as Prideaux does well. Everyone else is lost in a wilderness of incompetent direction. The screenplay is so bad that it could enter the list of Worst Film Scripts of All Time. The film is rambling, incoherent, incomprehensible, mumbled, vague, affected, pompous, stupid, and an offence to the viewer's intelligence. It is as if Donald Duck had been asked to film Shakespeare, so comical is it as a pastiche of a spy film. Was it the intention of Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner to make a comedy on the sly? Is that their game? If so, why was Dawn French not cast as Smiley so we could have some real laughs? Now, that would have been worth it. This film is what my late friend John Trevilian would have called 'wrist-slashingly depressing' (which was one of his salubrious phrases). Of course, what does ooze from this misbegotten film, as it does from any John le Carré story, is the omni-presence of treachery in Britain. Britain over the past century has produced traitors in the way that a stagnant pond breeds mosquitoes. There must have been at least 150 major Soviet agents working for the British Government between 1930 and 1990, most of them in the Foreign Office, though always some in the Home Office. In the TV series, the 'finger code' was prominent, for identifying the mole. This was probably based upon the 'toe code' which appears really to have been used by MI6. When Kim Philby reached the Soviet Union he sent a cryptic message back to England by an individual whom he trusted saying that 'the middle toes of both my feet were black'. I always took this to mean that he was not a genuine defector but a 'plant' sent to find out who the mole was, but from his message it appears that there were two. The film omits the finger code altogether. The only famous traitor I ever met was Sir Anthony Blunt. I spent an uncomfortable hour discussing an art matter with him in his grand office at Portman Square when he was Director of the Courtauld Institute. At that time no one would have dreamt that such a man could be a spy. The instant I set eyes upon him I sensed that I was in the presence of a dangerous killer-reptile. I have never hated anyone so violently at first sight, and he seemed to feel the same way about me. It was as if we had known each other in a former life and hated each other before. He was one of the most arrogant, supercilious, snobbish individuals I ever encountered, and utterly loathsome. He covered himself in a vestment of unctuous politeness which oozed vanity and contempt. The atmosphere in the room congealed into a solid state of mutual hatred. We somehow made it through our meeting, despite the fact that to judge from our eyes, what we really wanted to do was lunge at each other's throats and attempt to kill one another. Fortunately, I have never had this happen with anyone else, as it was most disturbing. The hatred was so intense and so instantaneous between us that I am at a loss to give any normal or rational explanation. Many years later, when he was unmasked, I was at last able to say to myself that he was genuinely a villain, and I had not been imagining it. Security chiefs can also be odd. Long before anyone had ever heard of her, or could conceivably have imagined that she was a spook, I sat beside Stella Rimington at dinner, and she did her best to appear an ordinary person. She was tense, brittle, sharp as a whip, totally on the ball, and intermittently prickly. Strange how little innocent Stella at a harmless dinner party steered the subject of conversation onto what I thought of Soviet penetration of the Foreign Office. Such an innocent, in a simple frock! I once saw Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller interviewed on the television news. I thought she came across as an idiot. Let's hope it was just bad 'presentational skills' and not congenital idiocy. Perhaps this all goes to show that security bosses slightly resemble human beings, in that they too can range from the brilliant to the terminally foolish (with all the disastrous consequences that the latter implies). Surely the worst security boss the West has ever known was Allen Dulles, and that was not because he was a fool, but for the opposite reason, that he was too clever, and thought controlling the CIA was not good enough for him, so why not the world instead. The depiction of security bosses in this pathetic film may indeed be its one merit, for if this serves to inform the public that some of the weirdest people in the world are in charge of all our destinies, and that many of them appear to have been dragged foaming at the mouth from an insane asylum in order to preside over assassinations, 'the war of terror', renditions, torture, and the humiliation of airline passengers, then congratulations!"

"charlie_d_007","6","23","44","21 September 2011"," A very different type of spy film
","Those more accustomed to a 'modern' spy thriller may be overwhelmed by Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, which is a slow pace, well acted spy drama, full of interconnected sub-plots, over a dozen characters, and a mere one or two action sequences (all low key, realistic affairs). Thus, modern spy fans may well be disappointed; overwhelmed with the chronology defying story and bored with the film's snail's pace. But of course, this does not make Tinker, Tailor a bad film, but rather something very different from what modern audiences are used to.<br/><br/>Tinker tailor is a strange kind of film; marketed as a thriller, it is in fact a story driven drama which keeps espionage and spying to such a minimum that at times one would struggle to even call it a spy film. James bond it is not; it is far darker and infinitely more realistic. Yet equally it is also in no way similar to the Bourne franchise, Bond's darker brother. In fact, Tinker Tailor has more in come with a character driven drama than any modern spy film.<br/><br/>I entered the film with no prior knowledge of the film or it's source material (or previous adaptations for that matter), other than its basic plot line; that is, a retired spy (Oldman, on top form) is brought back into British Intelligence (Circus) to investigate the existence of a mole working for the Russians. This simple premise is quickly elaborated on, and I found that, with my lack of knowledge of the source material, combined with the films casual and frequent use of the flashback without warning, that I quickly lost track of the plot. Characters are brought in, disguised as main characters, and then never seen from again until much later in the film. Names are thrown around but as the audience is not that familiar with them it is easy to lose track of who is who, and perhaps worst of all, the huge ensemble cast means that each character (even , criminally, Oldman) is given little screen time and thus almost all our underdeveloped. I would have preferred the film to have been a bit longer, to allow all the characters to fully develop. This character development is never fully achieved, and so by the end of the film, it is hard for the viewer to even care about whom the mole is, and thus the final reveal is a real let down, with no tension or shock accompanying it <br/><br/>Fortunately, the film is about more than just the final reveal of who the mole is; the journey is equally important, and at times, this journey is incredibly exciting. Standout scenes include Cumberbatch's (again, underused, considering his ability) sneaky attempt at retrieving a file from Circus (one of the films few tense scenes), and the brilliant ending scene with the juxtaposed soundtrack. In fact, it is a shame that the film didn't have a few more scenes like the final one, which had a real scenes of fun and style, despite the violent and serious events portrayed .<br/><br/>Moreover, anyone going to see the film with even a slight interest in cinema, will instantly realise the cast is a magnificent one; in fact it was really the cast that drew me to the film in the first place. Oldman is terrific, and it is good to see him in a meaty starring role again. In addition, there is an abundance of well known names including Colin Firth and John Hurt, and some relative newcomers; specifically Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch. All play their roles to perfection; it is hard to think of even a single weak link.<br/><br/>Thus, the film in theory should be a good one; a great cast, combined with some excellent scenes, and an intriguing plot that demands multiple viewing. However, in practice, the overall package is a real let down. As previously mentioned, the film is very hard to follow for someone who has no prior knowledge of the source material. The complex plot is not helped by multiple flashbacks, and a huge cast of characters. I found it exhausting to keep track of the plot, and judging from the audience response in my screening (a handful of people walked out), I am not alone in thinking this. Thus, on first viewing, for a person in my position, this film is very much a disappointing one. The film is not quite what one would call a 'mess', but it is certainly all over the place.<br/><br/>But, that does not mean it should not be seen; the complexity of the plot demands multiple viewings, and I can imagine it would be incredibly rewarding to watch the film over and over again, slowly piecing it together. Therefore, I would recommend that people in my position give the film a miss in the cinema, and instead get it as soon as possible on DVD; watch it once, then immediately watch it again.<br/><br/>However, this will not affect everyone. I want to reassure all fans of the source material who have not seen the film, that they will more than likely enjoy this film, which I understand is a faithful adaptation. A fan will have no trouble following the film, and thus will be able to overcome my main problem with it.<br/><br/>In summary, it is hard to recommend someone with no knowledge of the plot go and watch this film in the cinema; they will more than likely be, at the very least, slightly overwhelmed. However, I have no fears about recommending this film to those already comfortable with the plot; do not let my slightly sow review score put you off; this is merely my opinion (an outsiders opinion). It is more than likely that overtime, with repeat viewings, this film with gain a star or two, but, for now, I must give it only an above average rating of six stars."
"luke78125","1","22","42","25 September 2011"," In my opinion, i hated it
","When i saw the trailer for this film, i thought it looked alright, then i saw a poster on a bus stop and realised it had some good actors in that i liked. 10 minutes into this film i realised it was not what i had thought, it had a poor start (= a poor first impression) and the whole film is just dull, pointless and boring. The actors are good, but in terms of action, violence, bad language, or anything that may give a slight adrenaline rush, there is none. The only people who would enjoy this is people over 60 who lived through the seventies. I did not understand what was going on through the whole film and it was so boring i considered leaving half way through. The props and scenery are not too bad i suppose and the effects are terrible. eg. when they're in a car or a boat you can tell they're not really and its a green screen effect. There is so many pointless and random scenes, eg. Gary old man swimming in a lake with a load of other men, there is not even a hint why hes there or where he is, and when Benedict cumberbatch gets into the elevator, there is a sign in bold saying ""close the door when you leave or others cant call the elevator"" or something like that, and when he leaves the elevator he leaves the doors open. But it has nothing to do with the movie whatsoever. 75% of the scenes are old men in an old fashioned office, smoking (which they are pretending to do very badly, they take it back and then when they speak there is no smoke..) and discussing in a weird language that they have to find out who the mole is, and leaving the cinema at the end i think no one had any idea at all who the god damn mole was. If your a fan of fast flowing, James bond/ comedy movies then do not see this in a million years."

","I'll agree with some of the viewers that the movie can be a bit confusing. It took an entire miniseries that originally cast Alec Guinness as the main character, and tried to pair it down 2 1 movie. If you did not see the BBC mini series, or read the book, this movie may be a bit challenging to follow. Regardless of that however, it is still an excellent movie with a fine cast of characters and superb acting. If you are expecting something that is of high action you may be disappointed. This is not a James Bond film . This is a far more cerebral film about a spy at the end of his career. I enjoyed both the BBC miniseries and this movie, and I have recommended it to others."

","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is about as realistic you can get depicting spies in a movie. Based of John Le Carre's novel, this film is complex, well-acted, and it doesn't rely on car chases or action sequences to tell a story. I like action scenes, but there are some movies I'd prefer to watch without them and this is one of them. This is a story that could happen in real life and that is what makes this movie even better.<br/><br/>Tomas Alfredson's film is about how there was a mole detected in the British MI6 and how everyone tries to find out who exactly the mole is.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, this is very well-acted. Gary Oldman makes a perfect George Smiley with his long raincoats. There are other great, well-respected British actors here such as Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. They really did well with all the turns and twists and I always had a changing opinion about who is the mole or not.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a riveting spy thriller that does well without the action sequences. I found myself hooked to the film even though movie many people found it boring. I did feel it moved a little too slow in parts and the length was a little long.

Performances by Gary Oldman as the quietly brilliant George Smiley and Colin Firth as a mysterious leading character create all the viewer should need to enjoy this movie; but, having read LeCarre's book helps, as watching the artistry of the film goes only so far. Eventually, the viewer must come to an understanding of the plot- a story about the way clandestine operations were executed, figuratively and otherwise, in the days post Cold War. Lots of Sherlock Holmes ponder- thinking goes into Smiley's ultimate conclusions, which makes this story a classic. Oldman is the perfect Smiley, so he kept the often confusing script together, simply by bringing LeCarre's lead spy to life. I recommend this movie but also suggest the viewer enjoy LeCarre's book prior to viewing. Wonderful performances throughout the film."

","Filmed at the time when Oldman ceased to be a box office draw, this film makes an attempt to capture that former glory. All it captures is silliness and pretension. Oldman seems restrained, almost lost, in the trifle he is asked to play here. Kathy Burke has her shrill moments but there are times, especially by the fire, when she is especially lovely. Mark Strong has nothing much to do, though she does it fine enough. Péter Kálloy Molnár as the main Hungarian Waiter is especially wooden. John Hurt does come off the best, playing a total creep, as The Bollywood Insider puts it.<br/><br/>We never get a sense of the the espionage that would have made more apparent the strain Oldboy was under. We never see his reactions, most likely because the producers would have thought it would have made him seem like too much of a heel.<br/><br/>The philosophy in this movie is heavy-handed and especially disappointing since two famous writers wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>Another absurdity is that Oldman lives in what is described as a shack. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn't trade their house for that shack in a split second. Also, for a starving government employee, how does he afford it? Movie logic, that's how.<br/><br/>There are two reasons to see it, though. One is the aerial photography of gloomy industrial districts. Truly phenomenal. The other is the truly lovely score by Aziz Mandel, which has haunted me for about the last 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Really, watch the first five minutes and the end credit sequence and you'll have seen everything worthy this movie has to offer. And let's be honest, Gary Oldman as Smiley, the wily, worldly-wise, and world-weary cuckold, is a badly thought-out casting decision, to say the least."
"Arriflex1","9","11","19","5 January 2012"," For Mature Audiences
","Yes, in the not too distant past Tomas Alfredson's film version of John Le Carre's engaging mystery-spy thriller would have certainly attained an ""M"" from the old ratings board, though not due to any overt displays of sexuality or nudity; and while there is one hilarious bit of profanity tossed out in the midst of the slow, icy grip of the plot developments, the language used by most of the characters in the film could hardly be described as ""mature"" in the pejorative sense. <br/><br/>No, the maturity of TINKER is indicated chiefly by the staid, stoic behavior of the indisputably adult figures who go about their business in their chosen profession and by the intricate, labyrinthine permutations of the unfolding tale. And the tale is set into motion by one objective: find the mole. Who is the spy (from the other side) who has been gathering information on the other spies (from our side?)? As depicted here the answer to the question does not come easy at all; finding the mole is painstaking, dangerous, even deadly work. This is James Bond for grown-ups; Mission: Impossible for (perhaps) the seriously middle- aged (though not exclusively). Pyrotechnic exhibitions and ingenious toys of destruction would serve little or no purpose in a film such as this. Indeed, as already pointed out by quite a few reviewers on this site, aficionados of the ""high concept"", low complexity, jump cut, action-driven school of filmmaking may find themselves searching for the exit door after the first thirty minutes or so of TINKER.<br/><br/>The audience is asked to attend and attend closely from the very outset and if there is bafflement in the viewers in determining who the mole is, there is equal bafflement among the characters in the film owing to the twists and turns and deceptions of the plot and the utter elusiveness of that slippery mole: the bafflement as well as the satisfying conclusion is well earned due to an excellent script, a tour de force of ensemble acting brilliance and superb direction.<br/><br/>Despite the very entertaining restraint of the characteristically volatile Gary Oldman (it was fun watching him rein in his energy and verve) the George Smiley on display here, though subdued in appearance and demeanor, cuts a more dashing figure than the bland cipher created in the novel and later portrayed with nondescript perfection by Alec Guinness in the 1979 television series. There were six hour long episodes in the television show and if memory serves the show was also a very engaging viewing experience; there was, naturally, far more time to delve into character and clarify (but not simplify) certain elements of the story.<br/><br/>Still, with a running time of just over two hours Alfredson achieves a wondrous compression of detailed information that, again, keeps you well engaged and yet gives the impression of a very sober, deliberate, unhurried immersion into a world apart, a world where trust is a rare commodity and where that close associate looking at you with cool yet friendly detachment from across the conference table may just be planning your imminent demise."

Oldman delivers a masterful, crafty performance as career British spy George Smiley whose old-school smarts are enlisted to thrush out a mole amongst his conniving den of thieves colleagues while investigating the death of his mentor and the unraveling of a botched assignment with lethal ripples of espionage gone awry. Based on the international best seller by John la Carre, the tightly wound, knotty crackerjack screenplay adaptation by Peter Straughan and his late wife Bridget O'Connor serves up some classic turns of the screws, cloak-and-dagger genre chestnuts while keeping the audience lively (a few scattered moments of very real violence inflicted) thanks largely to Tomas Alfredson's taut direction, expert cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (the drab palette of muted greys/blues/browns expertly show a Europe in the dark in its Cold War era) and impeccable production design by Maria Djkorvic with crisp editing by Dino Junsater. But it is hats off to the very lived-in, implosive, internally observant Oscar-worthy turn by veteran Oldman (with a nice tribute to previous role interpreter the late, great Sir Alec Guinness by employing the old master's plummy vocalizations and the owlish specs), whose very stillness only betrays the villainy at hand. Top Notch!"

","I read all the ""bored to death/too confusing"" negative reviews and ""it demands multiple viewings to understand"" positive reviews before watching. I personally found both not true. I thoroughly enjoyed the intricate plot, extremely slow-paced intensity, superb performances and beautiful cinematography at the first viewing. If you are bored by this film you should stick to the shootout & explosion-type action flicks or rom-coms that explain everything with wordy dialogues. Those who find it too confusing to understand and give it one star should seriously grow some brain cells.
Gary Oldman is simply sublime as George Smiley. The script has almost zero exposition but you can clearly see what's going on by just watching his face and demeanor. He raises his voice only once in the entire movie and it's enough to show Smiley's anger, pity and contempt to the mole. Truly great example of ""less is more"" subdued acting. A standout among the stellar supporting cast is Mark Strong. I couldn't take my eyes off him whenever he's in the scene. Prideaux is perhaps the most human character in Tinker and he played it perfectly.
Overall this is a brilliant film in that it trusts its audience. Yes it takes concentration (and brain cells) to enjoy but it's really nice to see an adult film that doesn't play up to the desire for easy gratification of lazy moviegoers. Definitely a future classic in my opinion."

","When Jim Prideaux is sent to Budapest to arrange the defection of a senior Hungarian officer things do not go according to plan; he is shot and we presume killed. One of the reasons Control, the head of MI-6 was so keen to get his hands on the officer was that he had come to believe that their was a mole high up in the service and this man could identify him. With the operation failing Control is soon replaced along with those closest to him. One of those let go is George Smiley; he is recruited to find out who the mole is without those still in the service knowing. As the case progresses we will learn more about what happened to Prideaux after he was shot; the details of 'Operation Witchcraft', which concerned an apparent Soviet agent who was passing valuable information to the west and ultimately the identification of the mole.<br/><br/>Having seen the television adaptation of the story starring Alec Guinness I was curious to see how this would compare. Now I have seen both I'd probably rate the series higher but that might just be because I saw it first; inevitable a fair amount has been removed in this version but the key parts remain. The acting was top notch; Gary Oldman made a fine Smiley and the rest of the main cast was made up of fairly well known actors all of whom did well. People who don't know anything about the story before watching may be a little disappointed if they are expecting James Bond style action; there is none of that here; these spies aren't glamorous action men they are ordinary people; the sort you'd barely notice in a crowd; in other words far closer to what I imagine real people working at MI-6 are like. That isn't to say there is no action at all; there are a few shootings; one of which is particularly shocking. Over all this was a quality film which I'd certainly recommend."

There are so many details that I still go through in my head even after weeks of seeing it. <br/><br/>The pacing was perfect. For me personally, it was gripping. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, which has a lot to do with all the great performances in the film. I don't think there was a weak or bad performance by anyone. <br/><br/>Gary Oldman is simply mesmerizing. I've been a long time fan. And to see him taking on a lead role like this is just....heaven. With the smallest infliction or twitch, he can convey so much information as well as emotion. In such a stoic character, I could still feel his character's incredible loneliness as well as his resolute for ideal. I can go on for pages about how terrific I think this performance is. If he doesn't get some award recognition for this, I'm going to be sick. <br/><br/>Kathy Burke's cameo was superb. Her scene with Oldman ranks one of the best in the film. <br/><br/>Like many others, I really enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy in the film too. Both of them have these moments that really touched me. Yes, they are not huge emotional moments that are ""designed"" to elicit some sob reaction from the audience.

I can see why some might dislike that trait. Thought it doesn't bother me at all. It fits the entire tone and theme (distance) of the film.

"bdgill12","9","13","24","1 January 2012"," Darn Near Close to a Masterpiece
","I was hooked on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy from my first viewing of the trailer. Everything about it, from the gritty film print to the unmistakable voice of John Hurt down the pulsating background music, was exhilarating. Oh, and then there's Gary Oldman. No actor draws me in quite like Oldman and Oldman in a rare starring role is even more appealing. I looked forward to TTSS more than any other film of 2011 (outside of Harry Potter) and built it up so much in my mind that there was no way it could ever live up to my expectations. Or so I thought.<br/><br/>In the midst of the Cold War, the head of MI6, Control (John Hurt), becomes aware of a mole within his organization. The operation to unearth the spy goes terribly wrong, however, and Control is forced to resign along with George Smiley (Oldman), a member of ""The Circus"" (MI6's inner circle) and Control's man through and through. A year later, Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), a field agent who was previously under Control's authority, comes out of hiding and brings with him the renewed belief that one of the members of The Circus is indeed a traitor. With nowhere else to turn, Smiley is brought on board to investigate the claims and root out the mole. As he delves into the work of The Circus and a particular operation known as Witchcraft, Smiley finds himself caught up in an increasingly complex web of lies and cover-ups that threaten to bring the world to the brink of yet another war. <br/><br/>TTSS is the anti-Bourne, the anti-Bauer, and certainly the anti-Bond. I thoroughly enjoy those characters and their respective franchises but this is an entirely different sort of spy film. You could almost believe that TTSS is based on a true story. It is a real espionage thriller and one that stands up against the best of the genre. This is the definition of a slow burn with a narrative that moves at a snail's pace. But that isn't to say that it is boring or that it lacks in drama. While there are no fiery explosions, no nuclear threats, and very few shootings, it is still taut and riveting, the type of film that has you on the edge of your seat without you even realizing it. TTSS builds its tension through its masterful storytelling that mixes in timely flashbacks while constantly moving the narrative forward. This is a layered, deep, and complicated film but director Tomas Alfredson and his team of writers never make a misstep or allow the film to become overly convoluted. This is a thinking man's spy thriller, a film for adults, but it isn't so complex that you can't follow along, a fact that I truly appreciate. Every scene and every line of dialogue is carefully crafted and nothing goes to waste, the mark of a great film. In essence, this is really about as good as it gets from a storytelling standpoint.<br/><br/>For all the good of the story, however, TTSS would fail without a killer cast. Fortunately, Alfredson assembled an impeccable and diverse group of actors who fit their characters beautifully. You know what you're getting from reliable veterans like Oldman, Hurt, and Firth (I'm not sure when exactly Firth went from a ho-hum likable guy in romantic comedies to a tour de force in meaningful films like this but I dig the change) but Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch provide a bit of youthful exuberance to balance out the reserved nature of the older stars. Cumberbatch in particular is a spectacular addition. His character, Peter Guillam, is sort of the audience's representative, as his sense of wide-eyed bewilderment at the grimy reality of espionage adds yet another element to the mix at work within TTSS. Every member of the cast comes through with flying colors, each delivering a powerful performance. <br/><br/>But at the end of the day, this is Oldman's show and he makes the absolute most of it. Smiley basically doesn't speak for the first 20 minutes of the film and even after that his words are limited, calculated. And yet the entire time, Oldman commands attention. He is quietly calm in all situations and gives the impression that you had better listen closely to everything he says. So much information is conveyed without words and so much of the film's success depends on Smiley's ability to create a real presence. Even when he doesn't have the answer to the riddle set before him, Smiley displays a keen understanding of the world he is working within and for me, that sense of, ""this guy knows what he's doing"" only adds to Oldman's on-screen power. It's not just that Smiley knows what needs to be done; it's that he knows what the cost will be to get it done. This is an incredibly challenging and understated role and one that I think a number of very talented actors would struggle with. Instead, Oldman revels in the difficulty, giving a flawless performance. Deliberating over Oldman's best role is like picking which of Michael Jordan's six championships is his best (it's the third one, by the way) but Oldman's work in TTSS should be held up as a work of art, a masterful portrayal that should not be overlooked in February. <br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com"

","I have the audio and video versions of the Alec Guinness portrayal of George Smiley and enjoyed both. So I was intrigued as to how a new production, complete with new actors would supplant my ingrained vision of Control, George, Bill, Toby, Roy, Peter, Connie, Riki, Mendel etc. I have to say you need a blank sheet when watching this version as the whole thing has been re written for the cinema so comparisons will be unfair.<br/><br/>The writing and acting cannot be faulted, how can it with such an august cast. Oldman, like Guinness, portrays Smiley as a studied man and therefore the film is just as you would expect of a spy film, as has been mentioned in other reviews, a slow burner. There are different angles explored but one thing I didn't like and it goes for all films that I watch, and that is the use of flashbacks, which, unfortunately for me, this film uses.<br/><br/>The story is the same, its the way its portrayed that is different and now we may be able to look forward to a re-make of Smiley's People in the future."

The film feels so well studied and controlled - you know that the director has it very clear in his head what he wants from everybody involved and he knows how to get it from them. I'm surprised that the director didn't got an Oscar nod for this, really I would put this among 20 best directed films of the decade.<br/><br/>Other than directing what I really loved in this film was the cinematography and the score. This film has some incredibly beautiful shots but more than that they are very fitting with in telling this story in the proper way. I love the way the camera moves, I love the way they use the close ups and the way they use the shadows, really really beautiful. The score also works perfectly in setting the tone of the film, it makes you more invested in the movie.<br/><br/>I think that Gary Oldman is one of the most overrated actors on Hollywood and this role, this performance of his is no exception. I don't know how he has everybody bewitched into thinking that he is such a good and even special actor, but man he is far from that.

","Theaters would need only to pipe in cigarette smoke and the rattle of a failing Eastern Bloc HVAC system to make the experience immersive. . .<br/><br/>Portrayals of the profession of intelligence in popular culture matter because they influence the perceptions of the customers of intelligence, congressional overseers, and even new hires into the business. The performance and capabilities of intelligence officers are often measured against standards established by film directors and novelists, from Brian De Palma to Tom Clancy. Perhaps one of the most enduring renderings of the profession is John Le Carré's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which, since it was published in 1974, has been adapted to television, film, and two BBC radio series. The most recent addition to this collection is the Tomas Alfredson- directed film.<br/><br/>Coming from a veteran of British intelligence, Le Carré's fiction offers a counterpoint to the glamorous spy tales of Ian Fleming and others. In his books, espionage is a high-stakes game of bluffs and double-bluffs played by unsmiling men in sparsely appointed rooms. Here, Gary Oldman plays one of the most famous of those unsmiling men, frequent Le Carré protagonist George Smiley, a British- intelligence lifer who, as the film opens, has been forced into semi-retirement following the high-profile failure, and subsequent death, of his mentor (John Hurt). When it becomes apparent that a mole remains in place in a position of power back at ""The Circus,"" Oldman doesn't get to enjoy his time off for long.<br/><br/>This review aims to address three questions concerning this addition: How does the movie differ from the novel and the 1979 BBC miniseries? (The BBC production is such a faithful rendering of the book that in this review the two will be regarded as essentially one version of the story.) Does the film realistically portray the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)—or any other major Western intelligence agency? Finally, is the movie likely to alter or reinforce popular perceptions of intelligence in general?<br/><br/>Does the movie accurately depict the day-to-day life of the SIS? The upper tier of the SIS is reduced to six managers: their personalities and interactions have to stand for the accessible human factor of an obviously large and complex organisation. Strategic considerations and external politics are absent from their discussions. There are few hints about the size of SIS; at one point Smiley is told that the service has a total of 600 assets worldwide. <br/><br/>It stretches credulity that these six men manage worldwide operations but play operational roles in the running of the asset Merlin or the dissemination of the Witchcraft product. The analogue would be CIA's second tier—the directors of the National Clandestine Service, the Directorate of Science and Technology, and the Directorate of Intelligence—meeting an asset, servicing a safe house, and briefing the product downtown. This organisational compression works very well at moving the story along in print, but images of senior executives sneaking through the shadows themselves is a stretch for anyone who works in the federal bureaucracy, much less in the Intelligence Community. They know the prevalent—and, after all, logical—tendency to delegate assignments down through the strata of skills and expertise.<br/><br/>The movie's staging of the Circus offices is wonderfully effective: a claustrophobic world of crowded bullpens, ancient escalators, narrow corridors, and creaking dumbwaiters. It evoked for these greying reviewers their first experiences at CIA and NSA respectively, when paper files dominated the landscape. To exit the Circus, Smiley, and his boss, Control, weave their way through a maze of stairways, courtyards, and corridors. The editing of the film makes it seem like an hour's journey. It is consistent with Kim Philby's description of SIS Headquarters: ""A dingy building, a warren of wooden partitions and frosted glass window, served by an ancient lift.""<br/><br/>The final intellectual stretch readers and viewers are asked to perform in each of the versions is in accepting that a major counterintelligence (CI) investigation could be carried out without the involvement—or even the knowledge—of CI professionals. The Cabinet Office official, Oliver Lacon, turns aside Smiley's suggestion to turn the inquiry over to MI5: The Minister won't have that. You know perfectly well how he and Alleline feel about the competition. Rightly, too, if I may say so. A lot of ex-colonial administrators ploughing through Circus papers: you might as well bring in the Army to investigate the Navy. <br/><br/>Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan compress Le Carré's labyrinthine plot, but don't simplify it. Its dealings and double-dealings will probably be better understood on a second viewing, but it only takes one to appreciate Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a film. After establishing an atmosphere of nearly unbearable dread, Alfredson keeps thickening and chilling it. There's less snow here than in the Swedish director's previous project, the coming-of-age vampire film Let The Right One In, but Tinker shares its pervasive coldness. Much of the action transpires against a backdrop of overcast skies, Gray institutional buildings, and anonymous apartment buildings, which look the same on either side of the Iron Curtain. There's a sly bit of commentary in that detail, as if the Cold War had drained the light and beauty from its super-powered antagonists' homelands. But the toll is just as evident in Oldman's face as he stares past those around him, analysing the information, planning his next move, thinking more than most, and feeling only what he still lets himself feel."

","If you like intricate plots, this is a good flick to watch. To catch all the details, though, I recommend watching it twice. Surprising how much more sense the story makes the second time around. The details fit together like a find Swiss watch. To catch all the heavy British accent dialog, consider enabling subtitles."
"Mobithailand","7","2","2","25 April 2016"," Overall, it was an enjoyable ride.
","I am a life-long fan of John Le Carré. He is one of my favourite 20th Century authors – and he is still going strong in his 70's. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier, Spy' was a classic of the cold war spy genre and it wasn't long ago that I watched the BBC 1979 adaptation, which I enjoyed very much, although I found the background music somewhat grating. So it was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch the 2011 celluloid version of Le Carré's classic.<br/><br/>On the whole I did enjoy it and I think I will probably watch it again as I feel it is that rare kind of film that requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate its 'finer points'. I have to say that if I hadn't read the novel and recently watched the BBC version, I doubt that I would have had much idea about what was going on. The film is a 'film noir' to outdo all 'film noirs' and I think you would have you be a bit of a clever-clogs to really follow all the nuances of the convoluted plot if you hadn't previously read the book or seen the BBC adaptation. But given that I had and I did, I managed to follow where the film was going – just about, as they did change some of the finer points of the story line. I also found some of the scenes quite brilliant in their ability to evoke to a bygone age and atmosphere.<br/><br/>I am now devoted fan of Gary Oldman who gave a masterful portrayal of George Smiley, but I do feel that most of the other main characters were pretty one-dimensional. Not the actors' faults, as they were all top drawer, and did their best with the material at hand, but more a fault of the screenplay. The exception to this was Smiley's wife, of whom we only ever caught the briefest glimpses, yet in some indefinable way, we somehow knew all about her. It is a 'patchy' piece of work – brilliant in parts and sometimes baffling, but never, as some have asserted, boring. <br/><br/>The plot moves along in brief 'snapshots' of dialogue and action and as a consequence, you have to be pretty quick-witted to fully appreciate what is actually happening. Overall, it was an enjoyable 'ride', and I particularly loved the scenes of the spooks' 70's 'office Christmas party', which were so evocative, grotesque and almost scary. I also loved the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. Oh the music is totally brilliant!"
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","2","2","11 October 2015"," Amazing cast help to overcome flaws
","The cast here is so exceptional - easily one of the best ensembles this century - and the story crafted so meticulously, that it overcomes the fact that for most of its runtime I was only comprehending it on the margins. This is 20lbs of story stuffed into a 10lb sack, but by the end most of the tumblers had fallen into place and the end result was an intense, white-knuckle spy thriller without one car chase or shootout.<br/><br/>As I said, the cast is amazing, but not more so than Gary Oldman. The man is a chameleon, and this may be the finest performance of his career. But he's only one of a dozen great performances that help to shove aside any flaws and make 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' a fantastic spy thriller."
"Brie_Zhao","6","2","2","31 May 2015"," ...the texture of wool felt, grey and grainy.
","Rated 7 out of 10 When I look at Tinker Tailor, I get the sensation of touching and feeling the texture of wool felt, grey and grainy. The film has never feared of keeping the audience waiting. It's like waiting in a restaurant, hoping the waiter carrying your order might come up at any second, and the only thing you could do is listening to the music running through the restaurant's speaker. In this case, Alberto Iglesias's excellent scores would immediately place you in a rather apathetic atmosphere of the cold war era. The whole film is mainly about how George Smiley (Gary Oldman) uncovers the identity of the mole inside the top of the Circus, the British Intelligence Service. The film never intends to surprise you, as what the old man in the film Sleeping Beauty (Australia) says, the great truths are often unsurprising. Thus throughout the film, you will rarely feel extremely intense, but the film creates something grasping that makes you unable to leave it aside. It's always puzzling for me to understand how these characters manage to seek the underlying facts from the minimal evidence. And that is probably why I failed to catch up with the story the first time I watched it. So don't worry if you feel the same while watching it, watch it again. However, that might be one of the things that this film fails to accomplish, to guide the audience through the process of unraveling of the mystery. I don't think a film that fails to let the audience understand the surface reality of it is worth applauding, but I have to admit the beauty of the images of this film has absolutely overshadowed this. This film applies a number of close-ups. Therefore, most characters' faces and emotions are all under the audience's monitoring, which makes it looks like if all of the characters have nowhere to hide. In the scene which Smiley tries to replicate the exact actions and words he used in his encounter with Karla, the leader of Russian Intelligence, to Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Oldman stares right into the camera, and then into the audience's eyes; you can see all the subtle changes of Smiley's face while he's talking and it's as if you're Karla, and he is speaking to you. Smiley is no wonder the protagonist of the film. Different from Bourne or Bond, Smiley rarely makes a sound or ever shows emotions; he is almost as cool as the color of his hair----silver; he is not the one that you'll look twice if seen on the street, but through his thick spectacles and distinctive accent, you can instantly realize this is Smiley. To me, Oldman's performance of Smiley is absolutely true to the original novel, written by John Le Carre, but on the other hand, a bit overly pretentious. Oldman's Smiley is conspicuously different from all other characters, which are exposed of their greed and cowardice; he's almost detached from the world he is in. But that might be exactly what the film wants Smiley to be, to stand out, to be silent but appealing. Besides Oldman, the whole cast gives a convincing and compelling performance, including Colin Firth, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong, David Dencik, and Kathy Burke as the officers of the Circus. One of the smart things that the film does is to eliminate Lady Ann Sercombe's face. We can only see Ann's back, her blurred figure, or her figure in dark in the whole film. If you have seen the film or read the George Smiley Series written by Le Carre, you would learn that Ann has a complicated relationship with Smiley throughout the storyline. I'm often curious of how Smiley feels about this. One of the scenes that I feel is quite symbolic (which means I think there's something more than it but I have no idea) is the scene in which Guillam is driving Mendel and Smiley to Hotel Islay and a bee comes into the interior of the car. Guillam is quite annoyed by the bee. Smiley notices the bee, then rolls down the window, lets the bee out. Maybe if you have any opinion of what this scene symbolizes, you should contact me. Tinker Tailor is inundated with natural sounds but lacks human voices. You can hear Control (John Hurt) sitting down, the sound of the chair moving and Control landing on the chair; you can also hear the clicking sound between the coffee cup and the plate knowing the Hungarian waiter's hands are shaking nervously. The magnification of the sounds actually produces a subtle but significant sense of tension for the audience. You can imagine what it would feel like if you could hear the leaves rubbing against each other in the wind, people mumbling words, sweat dropping to the ground all of this, continuously, endlessly; it must be excruciating. I have heard that listening to the sound of water drop is one of the ways of torturing people. This is the time when I hesitate again if we should call all films 'entertainment'. Tinker Tailor is not an 'everyone's film'. I would not say that Tinker Tailor is entertaining but is quite well-planned, enigmatic and thought-provoking. I do not intend to recommend this film to you or to discourage you to watch this film, it is up to you, if you ever want to see (*spoiler alert) Bill Haydon being shot by Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) with Le Mar in the back ground."
"nszponar","5","2","2","31 August 2012"," Curate's Egg
","I can only recommend 1- read the book 2 - view the BBC series with Alec Guinness. Gary Oldman and John Hurt stand out but I was surprised to see that the budget was 20M. Obviously not spent on the script since very few people got to say anything and it looked like a made for TV movie in its set pieces. This is one of the seminal espionage stories so why mess with the details. Ricky Tarr's story was altered and none of the major suspects in the book were given any voice in the film. Characters were not developed properly - what a wasted opportunity. No sense of the betrayal of friendship which is what the book is about and no sense of the humanity, frailty and intelligence which pervades the book. Disappointing all in all."
"lasttimeisaw","6","2","2","8 February 2012"," Tinker Tailor Spy Soldier
","Saw this one in cinema eventually several days ago, as usual, I am totally ignorant to the eponymous worldwide bestseller novel or the BBC TV mini-series in 1979 starring Sir Alec Guinness. And my instant response when the ending-credits rolls is that it is too intricate for a feature film and with sustained jumping back and forth of the actual narrative, a first viewing could barely serve as an introduction. <br/><br/>The grainy texture of the film is retro and unassuming, like its protagonist George Smiley, and a lengthy running time with tepid fixation to the minimal details are tiring, foolhardily devoid of any suspenseful theatrical stunt (the scene of file-theft in the Circus library could merely be qualified for the aim); sundry gory scenes of death are infelicitously irrelevant with the film's avowed self-effacing tone, anyway, the film is too hard-bitten for my digestion system in a way grating my patience and diminishing my interest. <br/><br/>Nevertheless the film has bountiful merits to demonstrate that it has its offbeat appeal, particularly towards its cold-war spy genre buffs, a pervasive austere gray-blue palette could not be more emblematic for the back story and director Tomas Alfredson's (whose debut LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008 is an unsurmountable milestone for any budding directors) knack for manufacturing a stylized cine-atmosphere is unswerving, a love-it-or-hate-it aftermath is predestined. <br/><br/>The acting is practical but underwhelmed, Gary Oldman is acclaimed merely because it is against his stereotyped flare-up spitfire, and due to an appalling shame he had never been nominated before this film, at any rate it is not a new fuss, just an unspoken consensus all the players comply. So I do sincerely wish this will not be Mr. Oldman's career peak as we all know he could do way better! Among a male-studded supporting cast, Mark Strong is remarkably excellent against that almost everyone character is in somewhat underdeveloped ellipsis (save for Smiley), also a thumb-up for Kathy Burke, who magically generates the one and only chuckling.<br/><br/>I admire the effort, but the platitude is that not all masterpieces could be made into films, so a mixed feeling of unsatisfied still hovers."

","It's been a long time running since the last time I did not follow or get a movie. I am proud to announce that my latest espionage spying experience has ended in tatters as I somehow never out into it, involved or understanding the whole point of a waste of two and a half hours of my time. It is that disappointing and even more so, considering the performance of Gary Oldman (getting an Oscar nomination for the role). At the end of the day, this film is far too inaccessible for mainstream audience and even for those that do get it, I cannot see the joy of the ride.<br/><br/>Despite Gary Oldman best efforts and probably deserved Oscar nod, the film sense of direction, pacing, editing and story are all borderline boredom. Perhaps it is not targeted at the general public, but for even a festival film experience, it is an hour too long and tad too daunting to endure. Don't get me wrong, the locations, the film sets and the film as a whole actually looks great and it is clear that the director and producers have out a lot of effort into the details. In fact most of the dialogues are cleverly written. However the problem exists in its inability to engage the audience and transcends them from boredom.<br/><br/>All in all, to say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a bore fest is probably an understatement, but it is probably safe to say that the film has good intentions and a decent display from Gary Oldman. In spite of this, the film fails where it matters most, namely assuming everyone in the audience knows the historical backdrop of the 70s and resulting in losing the audience in the process. As much as I wanted to like and embrace this part of work, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy just doesn't work or click with me. A disappointing experience to say the least Neo rates it 5/10"

","Languid and laconic are the words that most come to mind when recalling this accomplished film adaptation of the famous John le Carre novel of 1974. The plot unfolds slowly and the silences are prolonged; yet the pacing and paucity work so well in this espionage drama because the direction by Swedish Tomas Alfredson is so assured, the script by British husband & wife team Peter Straughan & the late Bridget O'Connor is so compelling, and the multi-talented cast is so superlative.<br/><br/>We are used to the British Gary Oldman playing American characters of evil intent, but here he is brilliant as George Smiley, the resilient and lugubrious hunter of the mole in MI6's Circus. He heads a roll-call of terrific British talent which includes John Hunt, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Ciarán Hinds and Benedict Cumberbatch. Even le Carre makes a momentary appearance. This is a very male movie but Kathy Burke rounds off what is almost an embarrassment of thespian ability in one film.<br/><br/>If you've not read the novel or seen the 1979 BBC serialisation (as I haven't), you may struggle at times to follow each twist in this tale of betrayal at so many levels, but this does not spoil the experience so much as encourage a second viewing."

So if that's what you're looking for in a movie, be warned.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm supposed to write more lines about how this movie was so incredibly boring.

","The only people that will applaud this movie is: movie critics of the all too common variety that thinks that the more boring, meaningless and artyfarty a movie is, the better it is, and fans of the book and/or original screening. Anyone else that does, should seek professional help. Because this is a movie that goes on and on without anything interesting or exiting ever happening. To call this a thriller, is like calling watching a tortoise move having a front row seat to a fast-paced race to the death. Only in the last scene something exiting nearly happens, but the director elects not to show it to us. He must have thought that after over two hours of interminable boredom, the shock of something actually happening would be too much for some and might cause heart attacks. Sometimes the editors make halfhearted attempts to liven things up - by resorting to completely unannounced and utterly confusing jumps in time and space. Gary Oldmans excellent acting skills goes completely to waste, and could easily be replaced by Sylvester Stallone and his infamous lack of emotions. This movie is SO bad, that I initially believed it to be made by Norwegian State TV (NRK)."
"jouvent","1","7","12","17 January 2012"," ""How do I bore you? --Let me count the ways.""
","I warmly recommend this movie to those for whom the distillation of ennui is an acquired tasted and a cherished pastime as it gives a whole new meaning to the word ""Boredom"".<br/><br/>As for me, it left me baffled, very frustrated and, worse, ill at ease. I've seen late afternoon professional training programs more exciting than that! I caught myself looking at my watch, which I usually never do at the movies. In the end I no longer cared.<br/><br/>I am quite familiar with the type of narrative technique. Tidbits of information are interspersed with flashbacks and silences, lots of long silences meant to be weighted with meaning or import it seems; the components of the puzzle at long last congealing together like a mosaic whose full effect is programmed to appear in the last 15 or 10 minutes of the movie. Nothing new. But here, this technique is so obsessively systematic as to become ponderous, tiresome, then boring and finally utterly demobilizing. The bits and pieces felt unrelated or poorly connected, but knowing that the solution would be revealed in the end, I just waited for it. <br/><br/>For two hours I waited and waited, and waited it out. <br/><br/>Meanwhile there was nothing engaging, involving, motivating, moving, touching, much less memorable or thrilling to alleviate the monotony of the unfolding process. It was no longer entertainment nor fiction but a process, a spy movie being deconstructed on the screen. <br/><br/>Not the slightest emotional connection with the characters was possible. Neither likable nor hateful, they were just plain, gray, drab civil servants going to the office, a collection of perfect strangers' snapshots. <br/><br/>The characters' personalities remained so shrunken, so sketchy, so abstract, so devoid of humanity, so disconnected from any appearance of life, so completely lacking any existence outside their place of work that I could never get to care about what was happening to them in the present nor in the end. After leaving the movie theater, someone told me that they were under the impression that Smiley was married, yet throughout the movie I took it that he was single. Anyway, how such a cold fish as he could have ever known what love is? Or would marriage have been a professional move, part of his cover? This man's only life was to go to the office, sit at a desk, shuffle papers, ask bland questions, have a drink after hours in a depressing looking house: gee, how exciting for the viewer! <br/><br/>Empathy for the eventually victimized characters was impossible since they always remained complete strangers to one. The very violent demises left one rather detached: they came across as staged, badly staged sometimes: merely happening through actors enacting them for a movie. I felt I was watching a construct, an artificial creation, a castle of leaden Lego blocks haphazardly being put together. Never a minute was it possible to suspend disbelief; trying to understand turned into a penance. Watching Tinker, Tailor, etc, felt like atonement for having had too much pleasure with other movies such as The Descendants.<br/><br/>This huge endeavor of a movie comes undone like a bad crosswords puzzle; it collapses under the crushing weight of its narrative technique and mystifying deliberate blandness. The conclusion merely feels like the last dot at the end of a book, leaving one uninvolved. It reminds one of the fabled mountain giving birth to a mouse (I'll skip the facile pun). This lack of drama and emotion might have been the director's point for all I do not know. So that's all it was about: bland people leading bland existences doing abstruse tedious activities at the taxpayer's expenses in a world where it endlessly rains? Nothing else but a lengthy dissertation on boring existences? Probably the traitor betrayed because he couldn't stand the tedium any longer and was dying for some excitement.<br/><br/>Of course there's a moral, and more than one philosophical points; insightful scholarly articles with lots of footnotes will probably be written about them. If there was fodder aplenty to give academics a field day, there was not much of a story and even less entertainment.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, the acting was very good. Poor poor actors! It was only too obvious they were giving their all trying to extricate and prop up some figments of personality from the morass in which they were obsessively confined! One felt sorry for their talent to have to fight against such unrewarding material and direction. A great pity for the actors, between two yawns, was the only emotion this movie elicited.<br/><br/>This story felt like a very old, very worn tale exhumed out of the wet ashes of a sordid and irrelevant past in which it ought to have been left buried and forgotten. Too much Tinkering made an excellent cure for insomnia."
"Maleplatypus","4","10","19","1 February 2012"," Too demanding movie (for an average viewer)
","Through the period of the cold war I was a kid but I do remember it and everybody knew there's something going on ""behind the curtains"". But what? This movie does not explain anything. On the contrary - it shows how entirely absurd the whole thing was. Idelogy? What ideology? They were all the same. People were spying each other, betraying, killing and so on for no real reason (maybe money, but even that is doubtful). All ""affairs"" were just construction, one over the other, and all of them somewhere in the clouds. That's how I perceive this movie and the period described. Requires too much attention and background knowledge. Too much happening in too little time. One barely (if at all) distinguishes who is who in one scene, and here is already another with something totally different. Confusing and boring, yet beautifully photographed. The cast is full of ""stars"" but why? None of them really has a chance to show anything impressive. There are more characters than in local phone book. Everything is sacrificed for the plot, which probably 100 people in the world understand. I'm not amongst them. The only reason I could recommend this film is testing your patience. Sorry, but nothing more than that."

","Somebody on here put this film down as the worst movie ever. I can't imagine what the reviewers IQ is, double figures would be gambling. Did they get bored being away from the X-Box for a couple of hours, or did they think it was based on the nursery rhyme.<br/><br/>There were no over the top car chases, machine guns or fist fights that would make Muhammed Ali look like a slouch. In fact there were no childish gimmicks, it stuck to the story which is much more the dark real life of cold war espionage. <br/><br/>A very strong cast with some outstanding performances. Gary Oldman is one of the best film actors around today and his performance here was on par with the great Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes John Le Carre and especially those who enjoyed the TV series. I would advise those with a short attention span or can't handle thinking to steer clear. This film is not Bourne or Bond type Hollywood style entertainment The film deserves awards, let us hope it gets some good ones."

","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor, Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief.<br/><br/>This is a common counting game, or nursery rhyme. This is also the greatest spy story ever told by arguably the finest writer of the genre, John LeCarre. And like Fleming, why are leCarre's work so inspired- because of his own spy background. In the real world is name is David Cromwell, and he was unfortunate enough to have his cover blown to the KGB by a MI6 double agent. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in many ways then is the story of his own life.<br/><br/>Control: ""I know Moscow has planted a mole in MI6, and it is one of five men- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman and Beggarman"". A failed conversion attempt of a Hungarian general by a MI6 operative sets off the witch-hunt for this elusive mole by ""Beggarman"" Gary Oldman. This forms the basis of the movie, which is an intense concoction of dramatic interrogations, revealing flashbacks, and all pervading sense of paranoia. <br/><br/>Set in the 70s mostly in grubby London and some more of Europe, this movie is about the real world of spies vs spies- No gunfights, slam bang car chases, high stake heists and liberal use of weapons of mass destruction. Rather this one is grim and cerebral, consists of whispered conversations in sealed rooms that help put snippets of the puzzle together to flesh out someone who has been an enigma till date. The movie has moments of dullness where nothing happens, yet so utterly engrossing that you don't move out of your seat till the final chapter plays out. <br/><br/>And a large part of the film's appeal lies in the iconic, all British starcast- John Hurt as Control, Toby Jones as Tinker, Colin Firth as Tailor, Ciaran Hinds as Soldier, David Dencik as Poorman, Mark Strong as Jim and of course, Gary Oldman as Beggarman/Smiley. All these masters put on their best acting suits to keep the viewer engaged in an essentially drab, weathered, smoke filled setting, where the closest thing to excitement is often the telephone bell ringing. There are occasional moments of shocking cruelty but yet why the movie really works is that every little scene remains important allowing us to simultaneously conduct over very own investigations into the case, and the fact that till the very end you don't know who to trust and who not to. <br/><br/>As the inquisitive Smiley, Gary Oldman is stupendous- here is a spy who due to personal issues may be beaten but is not broken, who pursues his task through a world filled with distrust, and corruption with a quiet sense of capability, intelligence and ruthlessness. Colin Firth, fresh from his Oscar, has a small but significant role is brutally effective, John Hurt plays his usual fatherly self, while the supporting cast of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy put in crucial and nuanced performances.<br/><br/>Director Tom Alfredson has already impressed with the authentic vampire story- Let The Right One In, and here in addition to condensing source matter which the BBC did in 7 hour-long episodes, into a compact 2 hour feature, he also stitches together a gloomy and impenetratable atmosphere along with layered performances from the cast to create a film not for everyone, but rewarding for those who know how to look and listen. 9/10 and for the discerning viewers only. Playing at a theatre near you."

","If you have never watched the original then you won't know just how good this story is. Gary Goldman's acting is rather similar to a manikin; his expressionless stares are an example of how poor so many actors are nowadays. He is no Alec Guinness! The original series really did capture the atmosphere of the civil service this poor remake showed that the director had little idea of what British government offices are really like. Also, he totally failed in all the characterisations. Many top civil servants are ex-public school and this was so very well portrayed in the original series and totally missed in this film. Each character in the story was wrongly portrayed in the film – especially Connie. Smiley's introvert and flawed personality was completely missed and the phoney happy ending with his wife was so pathetic. The violence in this film was gratuitous and wholly unnecessary – as was the foul language, including the murder of a woman who was feeding her baby was a reflection of a sick minded and second rate director. Rather than me list the numerous flaws in this film just do the sensible thing. Watch the original."

I asked several other people from our team who saw the movie and they too said they struggled with falling asleep.<br/><br/>Of course the director had to throw in a homosexual sub-plot, like this added anything to the story. Maybe if the director had spent more effort developing the plot rather than trying to throw in things like homosexuality, gore, or sex, the movie might have come out better.

"northlight-74670","Null","3","4","29 July 2016"," An attempt that to me, as a long standing fan of John Le Carre's Smiley trilogy, consistently hits false notes despite the well known names in the cast.
","This movie has some good aspects to it, as one would expect considering the budget and the cast. Unfortunately those are overshadowed by a lack of understanding of the characters and the book(s). None of the characters ever felt either real or true. Which is so very different from the books where all the characters feel very real indeed, even if we may not always understand them. Colin Firth as Bill Haydon is the only main character that I feel somewhat channel the true personality of his persona. <br/><br/>This may partly be casting but is probably mostly the directing. The choice to make Peter Guillam gay is a particular jarring; instead of this very down to earth physical ladies man with a never ending boyish charm, which is not only an essential part of his persona but also key to how he gets along and obtain information, Peter is a stiff suit with a personal crises when he has to break up with his bf. As if there isn't enough ground to cover storywise wo inserting a PC sideline which also confuses the main storyline bc it does not fit. <br/><br/>You are better off watching the BBC mini series from 1979 starring Alec Guiness. Or if you haven't: read the Smiley trilogy. For a softer start, begin with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. It will surprise you :-)."

"brando647","8","3","4","12 June 2012"," A Great, Solid Movie for Those with the Patience for it
","You've got to have a bit of patience when settling in to watch TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. It's not the sort of secret agent/spy film the general public has come to expect; this is no James Bond or Jason Bourne. The movie is based on a novel from John le Carré and depicts a more realistic view on the world of espionage. The action is minimal and the plot is dense. After my first viewing, I had a good grasp on what had gone down but I was still a little confused as to how it all came together. There are a lot of characters to keep tabs on and twists and turns in the story to follow as it leads you to the final reveal. From Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, the movie is a slow-boiler that stars some of the biggest names in British cinema. The movie is set in the midst of the Cold War in 1973 Britain. The head of the British intelligence service, Control, believes there is a mole embedded within the organization's highest ranks but a mission to flush it out ends in failure and Control's forced resignation along with his right-hand man, George Smiley. Control dies soon afterward and information arises that might mean Control was right, and Smiley is asked to return as head of an unofficial investigation and determine which of the remaining heads of MI5 is selling the nation's secrets to the Russians. No explosions, no car chases, just sold storytelling and powerful performances.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, this movie will loses a lot of peoples' interest in its execution. This movie is a little more than two hours of talking heads. Information is doled out slowly and gives the chance to try and come to conclusions at the same pace as our hero, George Smiley. The problem, and the film's only weakness in my opinion, is that there is just so much information to track. At the end, I wasn't surprised at the reveal of the mole and I understood his motives and even spotted some of the clues, but I had a rough time getting there on my own. When the movie finally gets to that point, I just readily accept it and try to follow the path a little better in a second viewing when I know what (and who) I'm looking for. Despite its often baffling density, I really did enjoy this movie. It's not often we get an espionage movie that isn't just a series of action scenes and a villain with a grand scheme. These spies use subterfuge and misdirection as their tools. The pace is slow but the story grabs you; it doesn't need expensive effects to entertain its audience. The movie is a bit of a brain teaser and I dig that. And the production design is superb in its recreation of the sights, sounds, and styles of 70's era England. Alfredson and his crew paid amazing attention to detail in their immersion into the era.<br/><br/>And the best part of the movie is the cast. Seriously, they have pulled together some of the best for this movie. First and foremost, there is the spectacular Gary Oldman in the film's main role, George Smiley. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role here, and it was deserved. He is a tense man with a lot boiling under his surface while maintaining his cool the entire time. He's the penultimate polite Englishman here and the ultimate professional. His colleagues include Colin Firth, Toby Jones, David Dencik, and Ciarán Hinds. Some receive more attention and screen time than others but all put forth fantastic performances, especially Jones and Firth. The movie also boasts John Hurt (in a limited role as Control), Tom Hardy (in my opinion one of his best performances as a suspected turncoat), Mark Strong, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch, who I'll admit I never heard of before this film, is an integral role in the movie as Smiley's inside man and nails it. This cast really is a collection of some of the best Britain has to offer, and they have to be because the movie rests entirely on their shoulders. I would love to recommend this movie more widely but I can tell right off that the majority of general audiences would be bored to tears. So if you have a bit of patience and love an intricate plot, I certainly recommend this film but be prepared for a second viewing if you want to walk away with a solid understanding of its events."
"kgprophet","7","3","4","5 May 2012"," Spy Thriller ""Jazz""
","Jazz music comes from musicians ""playing around the notes"". In other words, instead of playing the root notes on the downbeat, they deliberately omit the obvious melody, and fill in the spaces with embellishments that suggest the primary structure. For the educated ear, the way the musician artfully colours between the lines is the source of entertainment. As a moviegoer, I don't mind being presented a puzzle, where you have to think a bit at how the movie is playing around the more conventional spy thriller notes. Strangely, this well heeled story may have become more of a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces missing purely because of the running time. Reportedly the running time was much longer in the original cut, so these holes in the story may have been cut out of necessity.<br/><br/>I am writing this review after watching it a second time, and can say that all the motives and activities are accounted for. I have to commend screenwriters as well as the editor for patching together a complex but intricately told tale. Part of the fun is being aware of the ride you are being taken on. For instance, George Smiley, our main character, is seen a great deal of time without every actually speaking. And when he does speak, it is very calculated, since he doesn't know quite who to trust. There is a subtext about secret sexual relationships, where Smiley's wife appears in a couple scenes but you never see her face. The main group of suspects are a who's who of familiar faces from some of the best films in the last decade. The supporting cast delivers poignant exposition and avoids stereotype dialogue. I could easily see how someone may not like the longer gaps in explanation as to why a certain character appears to be dead and suddenly is alive in an unexpected way. But a similar type of mystery surrounds each of the main characters, and is eventually played out as part of the larger payoff, who is the traitor in the British intelligence service? The greatest appreciation one can have is the ability of the filmmakers to tell a story this complex using visual cues as much as possible. Key moments in the story are told with spare conversation, allowing the audience to mentally piece together what is implied. The stone faced hero played by Gary Oldman, is akin the quiet hero, such as the tight lipped vigilante gunslinger, who carefully carries out justice."

","Well of course it's literate - it's a John le Carré book. Where the book moved at the rate one associates with planet formation in the solar system, the movie manages to speed things up. That is, ever so slightly.<br/><br/>While the movie goes it's own way in rejecting much back-story, the editing mimics a degree of the time shifting style of the book. Yet transitions are poorly placed and you wonder if you merely fell asleep and missed a bit, which is possible, than witnessed brilliant editing. The story simply isn't all that engrossing. Smiley is brought in and assembles a team to look for a mole in the ""circus.""<br/><br/>Thats about it. Few surprises and the plot, while edgy in the 1970s, now has been done over a few times even by reality in the form of Aldrich Ames. The cloak and dagger bits are few and far between, though action is appropriately brutal and well timed. The second half is far better than the first.<br/><br/>Performance wise, the cast is peerless. To name a few, Firth, Hardy, Oldman and Mr Holmes himself, Benedict Cumberbatch give every ounce of credibility you need for serious jobs like this. Yet, there's still something missing. While this takes a vote above disappointments like Breach or The Good Shepherd, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy feels like a dusty old overcoat. Sneakers from 1992 was more comic, less authentic, but more interesting and a better spy movie.<br/><br/>Good, not great. Saved by the acting and worth a rent."

","Atmosphere: superb. Acting: outstanding. Cinematography: wonderful. Soundtrack: very nice. <br/><br/>Still, I didn't like this film. And that's because of its only weak point: the storyline. I have never read the book it is based on, nor seen the television series, and I completely lost track of the intricacies of the plot. I had only a vague idea of what was going on, where the story was headed and what the time perspective was (indications of the years in the flashbacks would be helpful). <br/><br/>I watched this movie late on a Friday night after a busy working week, so maybe I wasn't as sharp as I should be. You have to be absolutely concentrated every single second to understand everything that happens in this film. <br/><br/>Perhaps the movie was not meant to be crystal clear, and perhaps the director wants the viewer to discover all the subtleties after a second or third viewing. But then you are left with lots of scenes in which middle-aged men with stiff upper lips exchange what seems to be incomprehensible inside information. The lack of much real action might be a plus for viewers who like serious films, but it's a disadvantage when you lose track of what is actually happening."

"hbk_nwo33","8","4","6","25 August 2013"," A clever whodunnit featuring the cream of the British acting crop
","The acting and cinematography really shine in what is a smart espionage film that highlights just how lonely and paranoid of a job a spy really is, very little of your Bond-esque glamour to this lifestyle. The story is filled with twists and turns, as well as frequent shifts in time help to keep you guessing until the very end.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS BELOW****<br/><br/>For a film that is a who's who of British actors, you would go into this expecting top notch acting performances if nothing else. And the film doesn't disappoint, in particular Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch but that is not to slight the work of the likes of Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones and Mark Strong who all put in solid performances here. The best part of the performances is that every actor keeps it subdued, as this film is all about being grounded and the actors follow suit, all allowing each other to remain on a level playing field. For a true sign of the restraint shown here, Gary Oldman's protagonist has no dialogue until over 15 minutes into the film and when he does speak he remains cool, calm and collected at almost all points.<br/><br/>Due to the very nature of the plot, constant attention is a necessity. Miss something and you might not even know whether you are in the present or the past, and will almost certainly find yourself lost with the story, at least temporarily. This is mostly down to how underplayed everything is. You won't be seeing explosions here, no car chases either. What you will instead find is a lot sitting and deliberating, plotting and spying.<br/><br/>A great example of how understated and lonely the film and its characters are comes from the moment that Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) is told by Smiley that everything he does from that point on will be watched, then tells him to tie up any loose ends. The next scene sees Guillam arrive home to his boyfriend/partner and simply stand, looking despondent whilst he is talked at. We then see his partner packing his bag and leaving, asking for an explanation whilst Guillam just sits, trying to hold back his tears until he breaks down as soon as the door closes. No need to make a big deal about the homophobia within the service, no need to make a big deal out of Guillam's sexuality, just a mostly silent scene that sums it all up without the need to dumb it down or insult the audience's intelligence. This revelation, even despite the film making no big deal of it, explains why despite Guillam's reputation as a resident skirt chaser in the office is never seen doing it, and why he gently dismisses the lady at the bag check-in who is clearly into him.<br/><br/>The mystery of who the mole is within ""The Circus"" is one that you will likely not guess, at least not with any certainty. Even as you approach the reveal, and indeed at the moment of it, you still find yourself paranoid and questioning whether or not it is truly him or if another twist is inbound.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also stand-out, with unique angling and extreme close-ups increasing the feeling of unease and paranoia.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor is a unique film, in that it is, ironically, one that trusts; both the viewer's ability to focus at all times to follow the story, and its actors to play their roles without getting carried away. But with acting talent like the ones seen here, how could you not trust?"

They strongly suspect that there is a mole, a traitor in the organization and that it is one of the top five members. Smiley is asked to come back to investigate and figure it all out. Which he eventually does.<br/><br/>The movie's title comes from a code system used during the investigation and required communications. Each man being investigated was given a code name ... Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, etc ... and one of them would turn out to be the spy! Some action, but mostly quiet and often incomplete conversations which ended in vague, indirect references or implications. Enjoyable movie but very hard to follow. Maybe I already said that?"

","Extremely beautiful film. However, for us who have not read John Le Carré's book, the film is quite incomprehensible. The director has completely missed out that a story has to be told, in order to give cinema visitors more than just beautiful photo and splendid acting. I left the theater like a major wandering question mark, determined to read the book to eventually give the film a second chance.<br/><br/>Seriously speaking, the film was painfully boring and nothing much happens. Every now and then it felt pointless. I did find myself looking at my watch, wondering ""When does it end?"". The actors, nothing wrong, but wasting their talent on this film was really a waste of money and time. And speaking of time - remember that if you see the movie, you'll never get that time back. I already miss the two hours I spent on this overrated production."
"killpandakill","5","4","6","1 February 2012"," Should Have Been Better
","I was looking forward to seeing this film. I heard great reviews and it was based on a John Le Carre novel (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, The Constant Gardener), so I thought it would be a great spy tale from the times of the cold war. I was half right. It is a spy tale from the times of the cold war but it is so boring and jumbled that I was having a hard time following the story.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, John Hurt is Control, head of the British Intelligence in the 1970's, and he resigns after an operation in Budapest goes wrong. He believes one of his four senior officers is a mole working for the Russians. Gary Oldman's character is Smiley, one of those senior officers and is forced out with the resignation of Control. Smiley is then asked by a top ranking government official to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that supported Control's (Hurt) suspicion of a mole in their midst. With the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley finds information that leads him to Jim Prideaux, who was the agent at the heart of Budapest operation. This allows Smiley to put the pieces together and discover who the mole is.<br/><br/>The beginning is painfully dull and once the story begins, the flashback scenes are so poorly placed and confusing. It's hard enough to follow an intriguing spy film and when you have so many flashbacks shoehorned into the film, it's just awful.<br/><br/>Also there are stories that never get developed or even resolved at the end. * SPOILER* * SPOILER** SPOILER* For instance, what was up with the relationship between the boy and Prideaux? Where was that going and was it really necessary? Was Ricky Tarr ever going to find out about his lover? Did Smiley ever confront his adulteress wife? And what was up with Ciaran Hinds' character, the Soldier? Did he even have a line? That is waste of good talent. I understand you can't fit everything in, but it's nice if it makes sense.<br/><br/>The ending also seemed tacked on, there was no confrontation between the characters and it didn't tie everything together. I also thought there should have been a lot less people surviving at the end.<br/><br/>I feel bad for the cast, who gave outstanding performances in the film, but this mish mash of time jumping, poor pacing and bad editing really doesn't do them justice. I'm afraid all this movie does is make me wish I had read the book."
"The_Deputy","6","4","6","17 January 2012"," Not as good as the mini-series
","I realize a two hour movie has to cut things out that a mini-series running five hours can leave in. However, it seems the heart of the mini-series was cut out. In the end, this is a suspense story - who was the spy (or spies)? In the mini-series, we are early on introduced to Alleline, Haydon, Bland and Esterhase, particularly in flashbacks when Smiley approaches them individually, at Control's request. We can also see motives for spying - Esterhase is a foreigner, and unmotivated by British patriotism, Haydon is a fop, Bland is working class with a left-wing background, Alleline has characteristics which would bring to mind Kim Philby. This is gone in the movie, we're barely introduced to the suspected spies, and have no ideas what the motives are.<br/><br/>Then at the end of the movie, when it is revealed, we still don't really get an idea what the motivation for spying was, like we get in the mini-series. The entire Cold War context of this is drained. There was a real Cambridge Five in England, five men from the best families who went to the best schools, yet chose loyalty to the Comintern and the USSR over England. Fiction pieces like this are partially an exploration on what the motivations of such men would be, yet this is completely missing in the film. Absent the suspense, and the character motivations, the movie is rather empty. If they had switched around who the spy was in the movie, would it have made any difference? The answer is no, and that's the failing of this movie, ultimately there's about as much suspense as what card might get picked out of a deck - the answer is drained of all meaning."

","I caught an early screening of this recently and I have no real opinion either way as to whether I enjoyed this film or not. Let me start by saying that the cinematography, art direction, sets, costumes and little details are fantastic and no doubt the relevant departments will be honoured for those come the awards season.<br/><br/>The film itself - the tone is very dull and bleak from the start (recent films such as 'The Ghost Writer' and 'Let the Right one in' are similar in look/feel). The plot is generally easy to follow for three quarters of the film however when it comes to the big reveal at the end as to who the mole actually is, I felt both disappointed and underwhelmed. The conclusion to the film is quite convoluted and I still cannot fathom as to how the 'mole' was revealed.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman plays Smiley well and should get an Oscar nod. Other standout performances are from Mark Strong as 'Jim Predaux' and Toby Jones as 'Percy Alleline'.<br/><br/>The film was quite dull and non-entertaining for the majority. There were a couple of standout moments that both shocked and were watchable. The scene where Tom Hardy's love interest (I cannot recall her name or character's name) is shot dead in front of Mark Strong's character whilst being interrogated is truly shocking as is Colin Firth's character's demise.<br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't see this film again and if the roles were not filled by 'name' actors such as Gary Oldman and Colin Firth who give standout performances, I definitely would not have seen this nor recommend it to anyone else.<br/><br/>I would avoid this unless you have a specific interest in any of the actors, John Le Carre or the original series."

","More like ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Snore."" Tomas Alfredson's big screen interpretation of John le Carre's spy novel may have won over many critics, and now the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, but it certainly didn't impress me.<br/><br/>I would try to tell you what the film is about, but seriously, I had little idea what I saw until I got home and re-read the plot on Wikipedia...and even then, it wasn't terribly clear. But it is about an ex-Secret Service guy, played by Gary Oldman, who is looking for a mole in the higher ranks of the British Secret Service.<br/><br/>Loads of things happen in this film, and I guess it was just done in a way that went so completely over my head, I spent the entire film just barely understanding what I was watching. It was like they condensed an entire season of a television series into a two hour movie, making it virtually impossible to follow. To understand it properly, I would have to watch it again.<br/><br/>And believe me, that is not going to happen.<br/><br/>The way Anderson directed it is well done in some ways, but with frame after frame of a backdrop so dreary, it makes London look suicide-inducing, the film plugs along without having any redeemable features that will truly grab your interest and keep you entertained. When someone gets shot in the head, you think finally! Some action! And then it sinks back into the greys and far too many words and names to keep track of.<br/><br/>I think the only reason why the script got an Oscar nomination was that it may have been the thickest of them all, because it certainly was not written well enough for the average human to keep up with the story and keep one terribly interested. A nomination for the score? Sorry, nothing impressive there either. It was as long and drawn out as the film was.<br/><br/>And then there is the Best Actor nomination for Gary Oldman. I would understand it if he were old enough to maybe not get another one, but out of all the performances I have seen this year, this one certainly did not stand out as deserving such a recognition. Yep, there could have easily been a spot there for a more deserving Gosling.<br/><br/>Yep, after sitting through this overly complicated bore of a film, not only did my head hurt, but so did my wallet."

","I am baffled by the rave reviews for this film. While I had every reason to believe it was going to be excellent, it was a tedious let down. Despite its brand-name actors, great scenery, etc., there is almost zero character development (and, no, I should not have to read the book first), no real protagonist (or antagonist for that matter), and very little by way of an actual story. Further, there is no vested interest in a central characters(s) and I found myself not caring a fig for what happened to any of them. The whole thing amounts to little more than a mildly interesting, parlor photo album of London in the 70s. Big disappointment. I was glad when it was over so I could go have a smoke."
"michael-dixon22","Null","7","13","19 September 2011"," Good but just a touch disappointed
","I have seen the original on many occasions so there are bound to be comparisons in my own mind. However the Alec Guinness-led version has much longer to expand the characters so that must always be taken into account.<br/><br/>The most important factor is whether you would recommend someone to go and see this film and the answer is a definite yes. So what of the film are the best and the not-so-brilliant? Excellent were Gary Oldman, as good as Guinness and less frustrating in his meekness and Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr. Very good were the rest of the cast, with the exception of Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Graham.<br/><br/>These fine actors are obviously perfectly capable, but were. for me miscast. Cumberbatch was far too young for Peter Guillam, the man who ""ran"" Ricki Tarr as his boss, underlined by the fact he is only one year older in ""real-life"" and comfortably looked it. The last time I saw Stephen Graham was as Billy Bremner in The Damned United and with his scouser accent it just did not work for me in the role he was given.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the climax to the film when the ""mole"" is revealed was over in a flash and there were times in the film where we spent longer watching the pouring out a glass of whisky or the many silences to music.<br/><br/>The Director also failed completely to give us even the remotest idea as to why the ""mole"" had served his Soviet masters for so long and betrayed his country and colleagues, sending people to their death. The late scene including the traitor and Oldman promised to do so but then ended, again far too quickly. The film was unbalanced with a slow start and a rather speedy conclusion.<br/><br/>That been said it was a good film, but I have to say that I was just a touch disappointed. I was hoping for better and the reaction of the small audience when I viewed the film, upon the end was a bit like ""is that it""? I have given the film 8/10 but it could easily have been a 7 mark and viewers would do well to concentrate hard or else they will in trouble following the plot. There are so many short scenes that quickly move on. Hence the inability of the director to allow most of the character's profiles to be made better known to the audience, who would then find the end scenes more satisfactory as a result.<br/><br/>I would suggest another Director is given the opportunity to work on the Smiley's People follow-up, with Oldman in place and definitely a new Peter Guillam."

An acting ghost ! They, the directors or producers, or whatever these punks like to call themselves, had a field day of pretension.<br/><br/>The BBC original got the facts spot on.<br/><br/>These punks messed with story, flashbacks more than a year on Vodka could produce. The BBC then, didn't have caged rooms where the 'opposition' couldn't listen in. Just, crappy, government offices in Cambridge Square. Which was how it was. Then they may have had a 'Faraday Cage' ? More likely they probably sat in the bathroom and ran the taps.<br/><br/>There was little, if at all, character development.<br/><br/>Smiley was a ghost that drifted in and out. Peter Guilem was a homosexual that Michael Jayston would get hot under the collar about. The excellent and important character of Jerry Westerby was buried in the poor script. John Hurt was John Hurt, they even had to make a gimmick out of his end.<br/><br/>The only character I liked was Ricky Tarr.

To conclude then : A great spy story, dragged down to the level of soap opera. Which is all about you get these days. Just gimmick and gore for the sake of it. Almost got a nerve to give the film that title. I could have done a better job after a trip to the pub. Subtle and intelligent, it definitely is not.<br/><br/>‎""How's Ann?"" Alfredson plays light with some of the fundamental relationships in the story.He creates about as much atmosphere as a Bradford railway station. He would have trouble directing traffic on an empty street.<br/><br/>I expect Alfredson will be asked to guest direct, Coronation Street and Eastenders. That is his true forte. Alfredson's next two films will be:- 'Deep Dirty Raincoat' and 'The Trondheim Lawnmower Massacre'.<br/><br/>‎'The Trondheim Lawnmower Massacre' by Tomas Alfredson- a true coup de grace(gras) if there ever was one.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, avoid this trash, and save your money !"

The look and feel is outstanding ... it's beautifully shot. The acting is very, very good from a stellar cast.<br/><br/>The let down in this whole project is the screenplay. Gary Oldman doesn't utter a word for (something like) ten minutes at the beginning of the film, despite being in nearly every scene. It felt rather cringe worthy at points, watching him stare into the middle distance and then sullenly raising an eyebrow; as if this would suffice instead of conversation. It doesn't. <br/><br/>I was very disappointed in the general pace and tone of the entire piece, ambling from scene to scene. Never really acceding to anything or making a solid point.

The TV episodes were long and drawn out but at the same time they were genius. This film is only a few hours long but feels much longer without the genius. Sad, sad, sad. I just can't understand how it is getting such good reports. The portakabin offices of The Circus should have been my first clue. Totally unbelievable. I was 12 in 1973 and so the next clue should have been the complete absence of any kind of believable London street scenes. All the traffic was shot in close-up and it was almost all comprised of London Routemasters and Taxis. Don't waste your time. This is a film that ought not to have been made. The acting is wooden and even the cinematography isn't up to par which is odd considering that this is often what makes a remake worth watching.

","Being John Le Carre's (and this particular novel's) faithful fan for so many years, - I've been impatiently waiting for this film to appear, and even contemplating pre-order of the BluRay version scheduled to hit the shelves on January the 30th. In my impatience I could've never imagined the 2011 version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" would appear to be such a disastrous failure... Most surprising has been Mr.John Le Carre's having actually participated in adaptation of the novel for screen : my first impression was the creators of the 2011 version have never read the book properly. I could imagine ""squeezing"" the novel to 2 hrs of screen-time was not an easy task, but quite a number of changes done to the plot seem completely out of place and utterly unjustified. Garry Oldman is an excellent actor, but who on earth told Mr.Alfredson this actor could actually do George Smiley? Same goes for most of the other characters : except for Control, Bill Haydon, Peter Guillaume and, probably, Connie Sachs and Rikki Tarr (sorry, have omitted little Bill Roach), - they all seem to have nothing to do with Mr.Le Carre's personages. Gone are all the subtleties of the novel, so wonderfully depicted by the BBC TV series of the '70s with great Alec Guinnes (who WAS George Smiley indeed), gone is the whole magic of Mr.Le Carre's epic spy novel. While one could probably applaud the ""Circus atmosphere"" as created by Mr.Alfredson and his Art- and Photography Directors, - using the Connie Sachs' language (which I don't recall from the book), after leaving the theater one cannot but feel ""seriously under-f..ked""..."

I was very much disappointed. For the first half hour or so I was waiting for the movie to get going. Gradually, I realized it never was going to. As others have pointed out, there were scenes where people were apparently supposed to be giving each other deep, meaningful looks. Interestingly, the music clashed with this device.<br/><br/>In fact, I would say that the sound track was actually pretty good, and was looking for a good movie to accompany it. I found my mind wandering about such things as whether it would be possible for a sound crew to get awarded on a film that was otherwise a dud rather than paying attention to the film itself. Having said that, even the music seemed to sort of peter out before the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I was also bothered by some technical issues. Near the beginning of the film, we are presented with a scene of Budapest. Apparently, the traffic must have been edited, because it bounces up and down relative to the city. No excuse for that, and I found it distracting. I grant that most people probably wouldn't notice it, though.<br/><br/>It was all I could do to stay awake. Should I also point out that I fell asleep during ""Harry Potter""?"
"JoshuaDysart","7","6","11","14 December 2011"," Neuters the Novel
","From the director of the amazing LET THE RIGHT ONE IN comes a movie with the same economy of image, but certainly not of narrative. Cinematographer, and general genius, Hoyte Van Hoytema turns in a vision of an era that seems almost entirely reliant on muted colors and a constant interior asbestos haze, which feels a little lazy, though the use of a lot of long lenses does successfully give the viewer the sense that they're spying on the whole endeavor from afar. The art and set decoration is amazing, with London at the end of its post-war weariness coming off looking particularly nice. All the actors are excellent except for Gary Oldman who manages somehow to overact even when playing the contained and muted George Smiley. The reveal at the end has all the bite of an old toothless dog and is arrived at in such a by-the-numbers fashion that it seems like a chore that needs to be gotten out of the way. The thing is that Le Carré's work may be this dense and even ""plodding"", but it's never this cold or unengaging. In suppressing and condensing everything the film makers have done him a disservice. All and all I'm a huge fan of real world spy thrillers and a student of the Cold War, and this is, of course a fictional retelling of the Cambridge Five traitors incident, so there's a lot here for people like me to enjoy and I do recommend it for that reason. The quiet reality of the Cold War is so rarely depicted in film and I'm always excited when someone tries. But when it's all said and done, I prefer the BBC mini-series staring Alec Guinness by a long shot, it simply seems to have more life in its bones."

I don't remember any meaningful dialogue, for me it was fairly obvious the way it was going to go, I couldn't have cared less about the characters. What a waste of the cream of British talent.

","In most cases a movie can condense the subject matter of a novel or story it is based off of. Such was the case in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. However, in this instance it should be said that this movie could have gone on for another 30 minutes or an hour and that would have been perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>The film could be described as a analysis of the psyche yet a better way to describe it would be to say that it is an action film with no discernible action. The drama is there but your on the edge of your seat because it's your brain versus George Smiley's - wonderfully portrayed by Gary Oldman - and that's a battle you can't help but lose. Although it should be said that if one doesn't figure out who the mole is before he is relieved you're not paying enough attention to the film. The pieces are placed before you and explained but it's up to the audience to put the puzzle together.<br/><br/>The casting done by Jina Jay was wonderfully done. The roles were fitted snugly and were great representation of the characters created by John le Carre. As mentioned Oldman portrays a great George Smiley, and Colin Firth as the likable Bill Haydon. John Hurt, though a small role, showed Control as a character you couldn't help respect even if you didn't like him. But perhaps the character that deserves the most credit was Peter Guillam played by Benedict Cumberbatch. A relative unknown when compared to the rest of the cast, Cumberbatch was able to balance the youth of the character with the responsibilities thrust upon him by the likes of Smiley.<br/><br/>It's no wonder this movie is getting rave reviews but note that if you truly want to get an understanding of these characters it's certainly not too late - even after seeing the film - to pick up a copy of le Carre's novel and find out just who is Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman, and Beggarman."

","I have not been as disengaged by a movie in a long time! Yes it looks great and the production design and costumes were moody and flawless, but I found myself asking ""why should I care?"" about these characters. I felt NOTHING watching the film, except maybe a bit uneasy in my seat as Gary Oldman sat around 'thinking' in yet another scene. I just about followed the plot but it certainly was not an entertaining experience. A lot of critical sucking up going on it seems but most of the theater I watched it with sighed and shifted in their seats throughout, and people left at the end muttering ""what was all that about?"". A real bore."

","Well if it looks like a turkey, walks like a turkey and gobbles like a turkey, then just like this film, it is a turkey. I wanted to enjoy this film and was very much looking forward to seeing it. I remember the BBC TV series very well and tried not to make comparisons, but I could not help it. The TV series was slow but it had style and atmosphere and suspense. This film version didn't have any of these things. Gary Oldman as George Smiley could just as well have been played by a dummy dressed in a suit. He had no emotion, no energy and just seemed to sit there looking into space. How he ever managed to get a wife with his zero personality is a bigger mystery than who the mole was. No wonder the poor woman sought solace and satisfaction elsewhere. Everything just felt flat and waiting for that spark to get the all thing going, never came. I knew who the mole was from the start after watching the original TV series, however, had I not known I would hardly have been sat on the edge of my seat wanting to know because I would not have cared. We never really got to know anything about the four suspects who all appeared to be incredibly dull. Peter Guillam played by Benedict Cumberbatch was portrayed as a homosexual with funny coloured hair. Dreadful!! I was going to buy the DVD but am glad now that I never got around to doing so."
"kimdino-1","4","5","9","13 August 2013"," Why bother?
","'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a damn good story. The BBC dramatised it very well with great actors and, more importantly, using a mini-series format. Which led me to wonder what the makers of this version could have hoped to add. With a well acted miniseries version out there creating a feature film version is akin to creating a Ferrari based on a moped engine. i.e. it just cannot be.<br/><br/>So I have just watched it hoping to find out because (i) I wanted to make a 'fair' comment, (ii) there was a tiny chance it MAY have been worth seeing & (iii) I had nothing better to do.<br/><br/>Perhaps Gary Oldman could have created a really good Smiley but he doesn't have the time to develop the character anywhere near properly. Perhaps he may even have been able to do even better than Guinness (scoring 11/10) but the the actual result, with the BBC version out there, scores him very low. There is far too little of him to judge compared to what Alec Guinness & Simon Russell Beale have given to Smiley. He stood no chance.<br/><br/>That comment applies equally to the whole film. No matter how many great actors, money, etc the makers may throw at it they had no hope of creating as good a version, not without the extra time. And they failed miserably.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what I saw when I watched it. I found the question 'What could they hope to achieve' unanswered.<br/><br/>So, before this film even reached the box office anyone honest would have said ""Don't bother with it. If you want to see LeCarre's story WELL told get the BBC version. We've only got two hours to tell the story in, not a hope of beating them. This remake is pointless"".<br/><br/>If you prefer cod-roe to caviar, cola to champagne, Ford Fiestas to Ferraris & plastic cutlery to silver then this might be the version for you. Anyone else get the BBC version where there is room for character development, drama & suspense. A 9/10 version. Or even better - read the book."

","I like to invest with the characters I see in films. I like to experiencing what they're feeling, go with them on a journey, feel like I'm living their life as it plays out on screen. I like to laugh with them, cry with them, go psycho with them. Even the Japanese stone-face films of Beat Takeshi figure out clever ways to show the hidden emotions, the ones lurking behind the featureless faces.<br/><br/>Sadly, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a film that offers absolutely zero emotional investment on the part of any of its characters. You simply don't care about any of them - in particular the lead, George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman. You know, I remember the days when Oldman used to fire up Hollywood with his blazing performances in the likes of LEON. These days, on the strength of this and his turns in the BATMAN films, he's simply a bore.<br/><br/>The story is s-l-o-w and drawn out unnecessarily to no great end. It's also overly complex, and the script takes great delight in tricking the viewer with one unbelievable plot twist after another. I wasn't expecting another Bourne or Bond, but I was expecting characters I cared about in dramatic situations. I got neither. Tomas Alfredson, of the excellent LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (a film where, you know, I cared about what happened to the people in it) directs a film of an admitted icy beauty, but I can look at the ice formations in my freezer if I want to see that.<br/><br/>Yes, the cast is good. Yes, it's a film that takes a more original approach to the spy genre than most as of late. But is it a good film? Not by a long shot. By the end, I was so uninvolved that I didn't even take note of who the real spy was - by that stage I was long past caring..."

","Spoilers, and harsh commments. Very slow paced but purposely made overly complex so that it requires constant attention to often vague disjointed and nuanced details. Many wasted scenes of old men sitting and scowling but without any action and with no development of the characters. Thrilling scenes of spies shuffling papers. Worse yet, no one ever lays out the key plot points or timeline so you constantly ask yourself WTF is going on? Why this and Whaaat? When, where and why did that happen, or did it???? Oldman often does not react or explain much, rather he just stays strangely still, looking pensive and emotionless, looking into space, even when he seems to be in grave danger, or is sending his helpers out on deadly missions. And then the pace picks up as the film ends with quick cuts to puzzling scenes. Like the one about the top MI5 spymaster who gets taken by Smiley to a country field and a plane mysteriously lands and he breaks down begging not to go. Uh, where? Why? And the final ludicrous killing of the mole outside a ""safe house"" in the woods by Esterhase for obscure reasons. Gay lovers? Mercy? Thanks for getting him released? The Russians? Who knows (maybe its in he book). I hated the direction, not to speak of the bad sound track and weird songs (Mr.Wu?)."

","This is already turning out to be a movie that you'll either just love, or hate. Or perhaps this is a bit of a too simple thing to say really, since it's also really being a movie that you must be in the right mood for. I guess I was in the mood for it, since I basically loved every second of it.<br/><br/>It's a spy thriller but a very talkative one. There really is no action in this movie and also no crazy gadgets or any over-the-top movie villains, that try to destroy the world. Just a bunch of middle aged guys inquiring and almost constantly suspecting each other, in the midst of the cold war frenzy. And this is of course also what it really is and was like for most MI6 agents. It makes this a more realistic movie than the average spy thriller but also obviously a far less exciting one. Not that I minded this though.<br/><br/>The movie simply has other qualities to it. I for instance really liked the movie its atmosphere. I admit that I'm often fond of cold war thriller and their overall visual style and atmosphere, so this movie was right up my alley. I really liked its time period and the almost constant sense of paranoia. Even when you don't always get what is going on in its story, you still should be able to be grabbed by it, due to the way it is all getting told, by its director, writers and actors involved.<br/><br/>It really was foremost Gary Oldman's performance that got me into this movie and put me in the right mood for it. I had never seen him act so...well, British! He is of course a British actor, that is however far better known for his work in big American productions. Seeing him- and hearing him play a very British, literary character, was a great experience. They even aged him up convincingly for his role in this movie, which made his character work out all the better. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more movies with the George Smiley character in it. As long as he also still gets played by Gary Oldman of course! <br/><br/>But he most definitely is not the only well known and great actor in this movie. Actors like Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciarán Hinds, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch are all in this!<br/><br/>I enjoyed every second of it, though I can definitely see how this movie might bore certain people.

This movie spends no time on character development so you spend the first hour and a half trying to figure out who the characters are, if they are key players, or don't even matter. This was the first struggle. It was also impossible to figure out or follow the attempt at a plot. The word ""mole"" was said about a hundred times but this person didn't even seem to matter. What was he even doing and why did anyone care? There was no action whatsoever. How can you have a ""spy"" movie with Russians, Brits, and Americans but no action? I don't even know how it is impossible to make a bad spy movie. If you liked Breach, Sum of all Fears, Bourne Identity, Clear and Present Danger or similar movies stay home.

It is good film, but it isn't going to be liked by everyone although it does not deserve to be slated by morons. John le Carre lovers and those with a brain and an understanding of real life spy stories and the cold war will love it, but there are millions of who will never get it.<br/><br/>There are several really stupid reviews but I single out one by jackcarver2009 who went to see the film with his mother and his aunt. In a painfully feeble attempt to be funny he wrote that the two women found it more painful than childbirth. Hilarious, so so funny jack..you sound like a very silly ten year old who was taken to the pictures by Mumsy and auntie Doris, who sadly got 'Tinker Tailor' mixed up with 'The Smurfs'..you were watching the wrong movie you dimwits. <br/><br/>This is a very good film and not to be missed, it is dark but that's what real life cold war espionage was like.

","A Multiplex offering this to its patrons is not unlike a Hamburg Massage parlour offering its patrons chess. Both are feasible but what would be the point, the respective patrons go to the respective establishments for other things. I have, in fact, just watched it in a Multiplex, one of about ten patrons, most of whom had probably made an effort to seek out the film on the strength of ... what? They enjoyed the book, they remembered the original adaptation on BBC television, or they were responding to the ubiquitous PR. As we were leaving I couldn't help noticing that most of them appeared underwhelmed. If you haven't read the book and/or seen the previous adaptation you're going to have to pay close attention and even then there's no guarantee that some of the nuances/subtleties will elude you. The whole thing is shot in subdued light which is clearly a nod to the twilight world of Cold War espionage and the bulk of the shots are held long after the applicable scene has ended, possibly in defiance of the Bond and Bourne franchises. The acting is up to snuff and that may be to the film's detriment for what comes across is that this is just what it is, ACTING, and that people aren't really dying on both sides of the Iron curtain as a direct result of the debates of these clowns from the 'circus'. It's pleasant to watch, especially if, like me, they couldn't pay you to watch Bond or Bourne but I doubt it will find its audience."

","Once I rate this 10 what more is there to say. The movie could not be better. First, the story is one of the best spy stories ever written - especially about the cold war. Second, the technical aspects are also top shelf. It does help to know the story, to have read the book or to at least have seen the Masterpiece Theater production of the same title with Alex Guiness. Both actors, by the way play the character superbly. But if you have not seen or read the story, then pay attention. Every scene, every dialog is important. Many flash backs and the story is not told in a linear manner. Keep the various time frames straight and you will put the story together as it develops. Do not expect the unexpected...expect that George Smiley will find the mole and will settle many accounts, as will others. Colin Firth is again one of the best actors ever to be on screen. Somehow he can absorb the person he is playing to such an extent, we forget it is Colin. Tom Cruz cold learn a lot from Colin. Not all the dead stay dead so keep your eyes open."

","Technically an excellent film, with good to very good performances by all the main actors. Some of the ""games"" were cute, such as never actually seeing the supposedly beautiful Ann Smiley.<br/><br/>While it is always fair game to re-do a screen story, there were at least a couple of annoying ""improvements"" to both the book and to the 1979 BBC mini-series. The one the sticks in my throat is making the character of Peter Guillam - played robot-like by ""Sherlock"" - gay. Why? It added nothing to the story, unless you assumed that his devoted service to Smiley was somehow sexual, which is absurd. Also in 1973 an open gay would probably be quickly booted out of the SIS.<br/><br/>But I do sympathize with those who complain that the storytelling was ""boring."" There were too many long shots of Smiley walking along a street, for no reason. I lived in London in the 70s, and, while much glitzier today, it was not all the grim, dirty, run down place the director created. That was more London of the (early) 1950s.<br/><br/>Also there was actually no ""puzzle"" for the viewer to solve, as we get only a tiny look at any of the potential traitors.

","The film is based on the 1974 British spy novel by John le Carré, and is a condensed version of the 1979 seven-part BBC series of the same name. <br/><br/>The film's largest flaw is that it fails to inspire the requisite emotional investment needed to care about the characters. It's hard to fit this sort of investment into a two-hour film considering the complexity of the plot. However, with this disconnect from the characters it becomes nearly impossible to care when someone is killed off. It also doesn't help that the film's low suspense level is like heating up a pot of water that never makes it to a full boil. <br/><br/>The stage is set for a great espionage spy movie including a fantastic cast, but it just fails to leave any kind of lasting impact. This is far from your Jason Bourne hollywoodized type of spy films, and favorably takes a realistic approach. However, this red-herring story needs to up the ante by increasing the tension giving the viewer the sensation of suspenseful anxiety mixed with paranoia. <br/><br/>This has to be one of the most overrated films of 2011."

In the end it felt like something may have happened, but I wasn't sure what it was. Most shooting is done closeup. This style of shooting may have contributed to lack of continuity, there simple wasn't enough context shots to lend a sense of place and time. Audio was also a problem, the mix of barely audible dialog and over imposing music, which added little. If you have not read the book, you should think twice before see this movie."

The movie was filmed with an absolute cloak of heaviness and shot well, but I did not see any groundbreaking techniques. What did come across was a heavy dose of despair. They managed to fit all the complexities of this masterful spy plot, but they left ALL character connections DOA. Gary Oldman does his best to convey the character and demeanor of a person that would occupy that station. That is simply not enough. <br/><br/>It was well acted for what was written. Well shot for where and when it took place. But it simply made no connection whatsoever to the characters and the audience.

Gary Oldman is starting to become one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>At any rate, this is a movie about a man that was forced out of retirement, but is asked to investigate a mole in the circle of his former job. George Smiley's former occupation was an intelligence officer. Smiley must find the mole that was in his former group so he can figure out the problem they had in their former operation. Which took place in Budapest, Hungary. This movie takes place in the early 1970's.(Cold War)<br/><br/>I have many thoughts about this movie so please bare with me! This is a movie that is going to be a little boring to some. This is a movie that you have to pay attention to. You may have to watch this movie twice, or even three times! To fully comprehend. Its a little hard to place what is going on at times in this movie. There were times it seems like they were going back in time, but it was a little hard for me to be sure. So there were parts in this movie were I made my first assumption and just stuck with it. <br/><br/>What made this movie a little easy to follow(for first time watchers) was the acting that was done well. Gary Oldman might receive an Oscar for this movie. If you get lost, just pay close attention to what the actors are doing and that should give you a comfortable grasp of what is going on. This movie also has some gruesome scenes that were surprising. There are some parts that make you say ""did that really happen,"" or ""did he or she just say that?"" If you were suspecting a shoot em up bang bang kind of movie, this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>Overall it is a solid movie. The acting is great.

The BBC series is my favourite DVD - I have watched it many times, and this suffers in comparison - to be fair, it had  hours to tell the tale, where the film had only 2. Gary Oldman turns in what could either be described as a beautifully restrained, or merely constipated, performance, depending on how charitably disposed you are to the film. There were some excellent performances throughout, some great casting, but it wears its artifice rather too consciously for my liking. Oldman plays a great Smiley. But Alec Guinness WAS Smiley. And that's the mark of a great story. This was merely very good. Worth seeing, but I won't be watching it 6 or 7 times in the future. Not like the series. If you only have £10, don't go and see this.

","The BBC mini series staring Alec Guinness was a truly great program. The acting was well done, the sets were appropriate and the story was well told. This remake wasn't any of those things. Many crucial aspects of the book that were included in the BBC version were left out, probably due to a lack of time. The actor who portrayed George Smiley, Gary Oldman, was not even in the same class of actors as Alec Guinness and was not able to carry the film as did Guinness when there was not much action nor could he display the range of emotion Guinness expressed with very small changes in expression, such as a slightly raised eyebrow in disbelief or the blankness of face when he needed to show no emotion. In the BBC version, you could feel the discomfort of Ricky Tarr as he was quietly interrogated by George Smiley. I would recommend that a person skip this version and go directly to the BBC version which is available on CD. After viewing that, see Smiley's people, the sequel."

But it was put on like a Broadway version of a Beckett play, lit like a play, and edited by a drama coach worried about losing all of those well rehearsed ""moments"".<br/><br/>Maybe there was a translation problem between Swedish and English on set, and everyone was so desperate to impress each other, and not offend, that they ended up with this...showreel.<br/><br/>This film is wannabe Fincher but unnecessarily beautiful camera angles and ironically, no regard for the cinematic audience. <br/><br/>Hitchcock would have laughed at it. <br/><br/>Suspense = 0 Surprise = 0<br/><br/>Overwrought meaningless stares = 10<br/><br/>Now if Pinter had adapted it, maybe the emptiness would have meant something. We shall never know."
"dfranzen70","5","5","10","14 December 2011"," Unfortunately tepid and listless adaptation
","If you're expecting insurmountable intrigue from this adaptation of the John Le Carre novel, you might be in for some disappointment. The mood is well set, the scenes are well shot, and the thespians are at the top of their games, but the plot plods, so much so that you wind up not really caring who the bad guy turns out to be. Or, if you do care, you find that you yourself had narrowed it down to Him or The Other Guy about an hour earlier than George Smiley.<br/><br/>Smiley (Gary Oldman) is a recent retiree of The Circus, the nickname for Britain's intelligence operations. More accurately, Smiley was forced out, along with the operations' leader, Control (John Hurt) when a mission in Hungary went horribly wrong. But now Britain suspects that a mole has infiltrated The Circus - and it's residing at the top of the metaphorical food chain. Smiley is brought in on the down-low to find out who the mole is and what he's up to.<br/><br/>If it seems like a standard spy film, that's because it really is. Except that in this case, Control has figured out that one of five men - the tippy-top of The Circus - is the mole. Already, then, our list of suspects is narrow. <br/><br/>Because of this, you might expect the movie to include plenty of distracting action, perhaps some crazy chase scenes, people dangling off landmarks, that sort of thing. But it's not to be. Instead, we get a somewhat painful slog through Smiley's endless detective work. There's hardly any action at all; there's a lot of thinking, which is logical given the chess-like nature of the spy business, but it doesn't often make for good cinema. In fact, there are long stretches where Smiley hardly utters a word, even in voice-over. This makes things a little tougher to follow, and I found myself overthinking the plot. The story turns out to be a lot simpler - and more simplistic - than I'd imagined.<br/><br/>The novel was adapted into a BBC miniseries in 1979. I have not seen this miniseries, which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley, but I have to imagine that because it was shown in seven parts, more time was devoted to fleshing out the characters and their motivations. It's a little easier to provide subtle details in a longer format, after all, and this big-screen version skimps on the subtleties and leaves us with dull, somnolent machinations, some of which are obvious red herrings. <br/><br/>Oldman, of course, makes a great George Smiley, and it's interesting how much he looks like a younger John Hurt, who here plays his superior. I don't think of Oldman as, pardon the pun, an old man, and he is only 52 years old. But he adapts a quaint, stooped mannerism to Smiley that evokes a man who's always thinking two steps ahead of his opponents. <br/><br/>But it's not enough, not even with the capable supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. There's just not a lot to figure out, and when it's figured out, it's too tidy - especially the ending, which is so obvious that it can be view from outer space, as the saying goes. Side note, though: this version contains quite a bit more blood than you'd expect (even with so little action); the level of gore in those scenes approaches the overall tone of, say, Seven. So be warned - this ain't for the kiddies.<br/><br/>Overall, the adaptation is a bit of a disappointment, given the source and the talent. It manages to take a spy thriller and remove the thriller part. Less thrilling doesn't taste great."

","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>I've read the book and seen the series, which might be a drawback in appreciating this version. But there were so many things wrong with it that made it a huge disappointment:<br/><br/>1. As others have noted, Benedict Cumberbatch was at least a decade too young to play Guillam and lacked a certain thuggishness that made his attempts to play that role look forced. To my American eyes he looked more like a clerk behind the counter at a Starbucks.<br/><br/>2. Toby Jones likewise was all wrong as Percy Alleline: too timid, too awkward and (pardon me) too short to be a bureaucratic intriguer. And, while I did not travel in those circles in the early 70s (or at any other time), I would have assumed that a functionary would have suppressed his Scottish accent in favor of something more Oxbridgean. Jones looked like he was trying out for the role of Yezhov in some other movie.<br/><br/>3. Colin Firth cannot compete with Ian Richardson, who evoked Kim Philby just by his looks and manner; Firth would have done better as Guy Burgess. Richardson gave us a layered performance; Firth's was completely forgettable.<br/><br/>4. Ciarán Hinds did not look remotely like a leftish academic. And, yes, I know that we don't have to stereotype every character by physical appearance, but can we at least make some sort of bow toward the characters in the book? At any rate, as far as the movie was concerned he might as well have been a piece of furniture.<br/><br/>5. The violence (or, more accurately, the graphic display of torn human flesh and blood that represented violence that had taken place off screen) was not merely gratuitous, but tacky. It only underscored the fact that the director had no handle on the narrative and used these showpieces to substitute for what the series emphasized--what the characters did not know or knew but did not tell.<br/><br/>6. Those tears in that scene nearly at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>The series was engrossing, the movie was boring,"

","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie. I've not read the book, but I did see the BBC series some years ago when BBC4 repeated it. I had hoped they wouldn't turn it into a fast paced, big action, more 'bond' style movie, and they didn't.<br/><br/>The visuals and sound were great, and the acting also. The pacing was pretty good, and they did a reasonable job of compressing it down to about 2 hours. There were some good moments of tension and a couple of shocking moments.<br/><br/>I'm curious how people who know nothing of the story would find it. It seemed like it may be a little confusing in parts, especially the way it ties up at the end. If you like your spy movies to contain lots of chases through alleyways, abseiling into windows, and shootouts, this movie is probably not for you.<br/><br/>Here are some of the flaws I felt in the film.<br/><br/>The main suspects (tinker, tailor, soldier, spy) didn't feel developed quite enough. Kathy Burkes part was weird, especially her voice. There was a weird crow-baring in of some music at one point (I think it was blood sweat and tears?) The ending felt a bit rushed and slightly confusing. Cumberbatch seemed a little young looking for his role (his acting was great though)<br/><br/>It certainly wasn't a wasted trip to the cinema, the film is great in many ways, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This was NOT a film for the cinema... close-ups of a group of (brilliant actors, but nevertheless) middle-aged men shuffling about. The book is apparently difficult and the film was like watching an ITV sleuth drama! Turgid. We had no time to get to know the characters (let alone learn their names). I found this very difficult to watch in the cinema. It was so still you could hear a pin drop (or people rustling, scratching, sniffing and god knows what else, not to mention the booms from other screens next door...). The film has merits on its own: some powerful cinematography and very moody, but not right for the big screen experience is my conclusion!"
"gbrack","Null","7","16","18 September 2011"," What a disappointment
","A book as complex as Le Carré's can't be filmed without serious compression of the plot, but this mess wilfully makes unnecessary changes - look at the character of the Hon. Jerry Westerby, for example, as shown here and as written - and fails to explain some key elements of the plot. The result is that, having watched matters unwind slowly over two hours, we are suddenly led to what looks very much like Smiley having suddenly noticed something he should have seen before. There is absolutely no description of what the men at the top of the Circus do or of their pasts - Bland in particular seems to be paid for doing nothing very much - and some incidents that have lost their point because the story has been changed. One example is the befriending of the schoolboy Bill by a major character.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Mark Strong is convincing as Prideaux, and Gary Oldman does what he can with the part of George Smiley. Tom Hardy does a good job as Ricki Tarr, and David Dencik provides an interesting portrayal of Toby Esterhase. On the other hand, John Hurt plays John Hurt very well, and Toby Jones makes you wonder why anyone with half a brain would give Sir Percy Alleline any position of responsibility whatsoever. This is not the fault of the actors - they haven't been given much of a hand to play.<br/><br/>The film is atmospheric and, I suppose, is an interesting enough film in its own right, but it isn't the film of the book. Whether the book is, ultimately, filmable may be doubtful."
"bajabob8","10","3","5","21 October 2014"," A masterpiece
","People say this movie is too slow or doesn't have enough action. To them I say, go back to watching Transformers or some other such junk. This is a movie for people who think. There is action all through the film, in Gary Oldman's subtle performance, in the understated derring-do of Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy and Mark Strong. The rest of the cast performs their roles better than the author, John LeCarre, could have hoped, especially Colin Firth and Toby Jones.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot may be somewhat hard to follow upon a first viewing. Most of LeCarre's works are difficult the first time they're read. That may explain why I've watched this film some 40 or 50 times, enjoying it more each time.<br/><br/>I love the Jason Bourne movies as much as anyone, but for those who want a REAL spy movie, this is a classic."
"chaotik97","9","3","5","28 September 2014"," Beautiful and mesmerising, it is a masterpiece.
","I have not seen the original mini series that this is based on (At the time of writing this review, I plan to see it) but this film blew me away. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is crafted perfectly with matriculates detail. The look of the film is beautiful, setting the tone perfectly for the film, and showing the style of the era. The All-Star cast of British actors all do amazing jobs in their roles, Benedict Cumberbatch and Garry Oldman stealing the show. One of my few complaints is that John Hurt and Stephen Graham did not get anywhere near enough screen time, as they are both fantastic actors, but that is just nitpicking. There is also a bit of score in the scene where Cumberbatch's character is infiltrating to get a file that didn't fit the scene that took me out of the movie, but is nothing major.<br/><br/>If your expecting a spy film with car chases or big explosions or cool gadgets, look elsewhere, this film is a different look at spy thrillers, and pulls off its goal perfectly. The pacing is great, but for people more accustomed to James Bond-style spy flicks may find it slow, if this is the case, then this isn't the film for you.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy easily gets a 9/10 from me and is one of the best films of 2011 and of the the spy thriller genre."
"siderite","7","3","5","9 August 2013"," Good attempt, but the mini-series is better
","I have delayed seeing this movie until I had the time and disposition to watch the BBC mini series from 1979. Having seen both, I can now compare them. The series was a lot better. It showed the connections between the characters, the things that made the betrayals, the infighting and the revenges so important and so personal. The film doesn't quite make it so.<br/><br/>And look at the great cast. I do feel it was underused. Ciarán Hinds and even Colin Firth shown only in a few scenes, John Hurt has a similar fate. Then there is the story. It follows pretty much the one in the series, but with a lot of the details removed. I agree it is the only way to cram more than five hours into a two hour film, but the choice of the things they left out bothered me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: even having seen the miniseries, I couldn't grasp some of the details from the movie. The cerebral way in which the series was made turned into a glacial and impersonal view of the story in the film. I can't imagine I would have understood the feelings of any of the characters just by watching the movie. Also many of the important bits in the series were completely skipped here, like the power struggle in the Circus or the personal connection between Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon or even the continued humiliation of George Smiley on account of his wife's indiscretions. Even if lower budget and a lot slower paced, I would still recommend the series."
"classicsoncall","8","3","5","18 December 2012"," ""Nothing is genuine anymore.""
","Without question, this is a film I'll have to watch another half dozen times or so to really know what's going on; the first two times just wasn't enough. And yet the story develops so methodically that it's impossible to divert one's attention because you know you'll miss something. Some will complain about the pacing and the non-linear story telling style but I found those elements drawing me in and forcing me to pay attention. Yet there's still that gnawing feeling that the film fell a clue or two short of allowing the viewer to figure out who the mole was sending information back to the Russians. In updated Charlie Chan fashion, Smiley (Gary Oldman) puts it all together but I really wanted to figure it out for myself, and so far I haven't been able to do it after a couple of tries. This is a quality film with excellent portrayals by a talented cast, so I'll be back again at some point. The haunting foreign rendition of ""Beyond the Sea"" at the finale was the icing on the cake for me."
"Arilinn","3","3","5","5 November 2012"," Bleak, confusing, boring, uninspired
","Sure, even in the times of cold war and the iron curtain, your average spy day wasn't filled with car chases, exploding buildings and what-have-you. But this movie hits the all-time high on my boredom scale. Seriously -- no matter how much work you put into a movie: if half the theater is asleep when the end credits roll, you did a really shitty job as a writer, director and producer (unless you have a contract with the tranquilizer industry as well).<br/><br/>The movie earns its three stars for the cast, which does a good (not outstanding) job, and the sets which make the time the story takes place in come back to life. But ""life"" is the wrong word; the whole movie feels like something undead; some zombie resurrected from the grave which should've stayed there instead of haunting the living.<br/><br/>Now, I really enjoy it if a movie takes its time to let the actors perform and the story unfold. But here, a very confusing, yet surprisingly thin story is stretched way too far. You keep waiting for the moment when it all comes together, but the climax is so extremely disappointing (and not worth the term) that you wonder why you have stayed in the theater for that long. Together with the bleak, depressing look of the movie, the scenes which drag on endlessly, no character to identify with, and the lack of activity, this makes for an extremely unhealthy mixture. Not to mention that suspense is as alien to this movie as modesty is to Jim Cameron.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie is absolutely not worth its money, and this time I feel betrayed for almost three hours of lifetime I could have spent with a good book -- or a good movie.<br/><br/>It does not have to be a James Bond flick or some other action-laden movie to make for an entertaining evening in the world of spies and agents, but there are a lot of movies out there which are a lot more fun to watch than this one, which isn't even worth the rental fee."

I didn't get the big deal about this film. I heard such praises for the best film of the year, or the suspense film of all suspense films! I was very disappointed in this film. This is not to say I don't appreciate deliberately paced films that are dramas, like The Painted Veil and The Straight Story, two very different films. But this was just awful. I do admit what made it worse for me, was that I have seen the original Alec Guinness miniseries some years back, and while it was slow-paced as well, it was miles ahead of this. Good actors are saddled with muddy waters and can't get out of it in this adaptation of the John Le Carre story. Don't say you haven't been warned! Alec Guinness, where are you?"
"calijoe24220","1","3","5","14 April 2012"," Hands down this movie is....
","in the top 5 worst movies of all time. In fact, I went out of my way and spent 30 minutes creating an account (when I could be sleeping), just to write the most honest review possible. You will have more fun staring at a freshly painted gray wall, not because the fumes may alter your senses, but because staring into a blank slate until your eyes burn will yield more creativity than what this film has to offer. Not only were the quick shots of the film confusing, some of them had no place in the movie and did not add or take away from the film. Had this footage been properly ordered and edited, 30-45 minutes might have been taken out of the film or at least used to develop the characters and story. <br/><br/>I understand that true espionage today is most likely absent of the car chases and action most movies portray, and I understand this movie was supposed to depict a realistic picture of what the Cold War was like. What I have a problem with is I am certain that there was more drama to the period of time than what this movie portrays. All I was left asking was....this is the best you can do? For all the acting, time, money, editing, writing, re-editing, printing, etc.....if this is the best ""drama"" that the producers could muster then they need to go back to school. Again...staring at a wall may be a better use of time than this film. Essentially, the movie shows how important paper filing and libraries are. Evidently if your log books are not kept in order then a war may start....then again no war did start so it must not have been that important after all. <br/><br/>In short, do not watch the film unless you want to see how boring the Cold War could be. Anyone who says this movie was amazing had to be paid off or sniffing paint before they got to the movie. Literally, if you take mud and smear a white wall with it, some ""artist"" will walk along and say, ""Oh my, the artist really is trying to contrast the darkness of life with the realness of nature"" or something fake/corny like that which they think is deep and meaningful...when they just missed three children playing with the blank space next to the restroom."

","I haven't seen the original mini-TV-series from the UK, so I can't judge the movie on behalf of that nor compare it to it. What I can say, is that this movie has superior acting in it, a story that does condone repeated viewing and just enough ""action"" to make it work. Why do I say the latter? Because there are a lot of people who'll dismiss this as talking heads movie. And this perception is not really wrong, because if you really want to see action and stunts and all that, than you shouldn't watch this movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the talking heads do an amazing job and every nuance in their performance is just great. While you might find yourself struggling to follow the story, it all will be revealed by the end. One of my favorites of 2011, this movie has a lot going for it, tension being one of those things.

","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the epitome of taking spy movies in the wrong direction. Most positive reviews seem to stem out of thinking condescendingly about people who may not have enjoyed the movie. Having a dialog-intense movie with one or no action scenes does not make a movie even decent. This is just the polar opposite of ""Mission Impossible"" they are both terrible movies for different reasons. <br/><br/>The opening credits of the movie really set the stage for the rest of the movie. It was two guys walking through London followed by an hour and a half of boring, monotonous, robotic dialog. It was one mind- numbing headshot after another. Usually this sort of thing wouldn't bother me if they developed character relationships helped made me care about them as individuals...but they didn't...and I don't. <br/><br/>I am giving this movie a two because there was a scene where a fellow was shot to death...that was about as much emotion and excitement the movie contained. I rarely watch a movie constantly checking the time on my phone waiting for it to end. <br/><br/>After it ended I left the theater with my girlfriend and she kissed me on the cheek and I remembered I was still a living breathing human being and not a dead clump of cells.

But the second time, I picked up all the clues I ""skipped over"" in the first viewing.<br/><br/>This film requires serious concentration. If you're snacking on pretzels you'll miss key elements. If you have read the book, you'll be ahead but if you pay careful attention then the film-makers have done an incredible job of condensing a 450 page book into 2 hours. The asides, the background chatter give you the clues to what is going on. If you are a lazy listener, you'll miss all of them.<br/><br/>Yes, the minor characters are pretty 1-dimensional and almost bit actors but all the actors even those playing minor parts are at the top of their game. If you know Le Carre', you know it's all about character and they concentrate mainly on Smiley. And his actions are SO perfect—when he winds down the window to let out the fly, or when he chews on mints while waiting for the mole, it's really telling. The suspense is all so palpable.<br/><br/>Peter Guillam, played by Benedict Cumberbatch is superb—just as I imagined him 28 years ago when I read the book! They nailed his character for sure.<br/><br/>The film is the most non-action action movie. It's all to do with Smiley and the bas%$#@#s he works for.

","It's a sort of endeavor to write a film review for Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy after its premiere month ago. The espionage masterpiece of John le Carré has already got enough comments and analysis, so when it was brought to the wide screen in 2011, I guess most people might be thinking, this film is good. <br/><br/>Of course, you cannot imagine a film ""not good"" with Gary Oldman (see Prada show this year?), John Hurt, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy... And this film is absolutely loyal to the novel, which perhaps is partly because le Carré himself is one of the adapters. We could see a real Circus in the 1960s - 1970s (The Honourable Schoolboy took place in 1976), with a gloomy London sky high above. All the buildings, streets, cars, pedestrians and rains seems clear and gray, and among them, is a group of tired spies. <br/><br/>""Tired"" is the word I'd like use to describe the characters. Those who had been struggled through WWII and lived to the Cold War were easy find themselves confused and tired in the post-war circumstance- it seemed that an old enemy had been beaten nevertheless a new one was created from an old ally. Toby Esterharse and Percy Alleinne were nothing like what the ""old"", ""decent"" espionage. They were more like political clowns performing before the politicians. Meanwhile those who'd joined the Circus before or during the war, seemed to arrive at the crossroad of their life- either to drop out or to work for the superior they were not very approved of. <br/><br/>I am not to discuss the matter of belief and loyalty in that period of history as absurd as singing Soviet Union national anthem in the Christmas party of Circus here, just try to recall the life of spies of an ordinary human being. They were just normal people, despite their brain and profession, nothing more than an elder man abandoned by his wife who had affair with his colleague or a middle-aged public servant who had to be separated from his gay lover, or a young man who met his passion of love and began to dream about family on a business trip to Istanbul. When we look deeper, to reveal the truth beneath loyalty and betray, we might be able to see a group of ordinary people feeling confused about their life and what had long been making up the most part of it.<br/><br/>When the talented Connie Sachs sat next by George Smiley on a typical Oxford afternoon showing the latter photos from the past, she said what good old times, with a younger Control in uniform fighting for his country and what he believed in, and Jim Prideaux and Bill Haydon together for their friendship, who would had foreseen the lonely death of an old man and betray between two very good friends? <br/><br/>With the melody of La Mer, we could see Smiley sitting on Control's seat, Ann coming home again, Guillam passing by Smiley in the Circus, and Haydon shot by Prideaux then a tear of blood dropping from his face. Seems another period of good time had began, if we don' t consider what was going to happen."

","This excellent second adaptation of Le Carre's classic espionage novel, famously adapted by the BBC in 1979-Alec Guinness playing the eponymous George Smiley(a name that is at best a misnomer), followed by Smiley's People in 1982, Death of a Schoolboy never followed due to the Usual BBC budget constraints.<br/><br/>Now we have a real movie version-that stands on its own merits-Gary Oldman takes Smiley and makes him his own-younger than Guinness and far more sinister, he sees and hears everything, Oldman is supported by a brilliant cast-Kay Burke(finally back on our screens) as Connie, Benedict Cumberbatch(in a beautifully rewritten supporting role)the always excellent Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, and Mark Strong, whom is in danger of becoming a major star. Lastly Colin Firth-proving what a versatile actor he is (post Oscar)and Lastly John Hurt as Control--another superb performance of him.<br/><br/>Events are telescoped, re-jigged and we (the audience )are given key information at different times than the original TV series, due to the 2hr running time of the movie. It all works though, from the production design , editing directing and lighting to look like a rundown London of the seventies and Hungary(Checkozakia in the original). Superb"
"becky9789","Null","3","5","19 September 2011"," Confusing.....but I may try reading the book and watching it again.
","Considering the hype and rave reviews from the critics, I was very much looking forward to watching this film - especially because of the star- studded cast.<br/><br/>Certainly, attention to detail was great, and the atmosphere was portrayed very well with some excellent acting. However, about half an hour into the film I realised I didn't have a clue what was going on. I dismissed this as having not quite got into it yet, thinking I was just being stupid. Eventually, towards the end I sort of pieced everything together, but only after dwelling on it and discussing it with others after the film. <br/><br/>It turned out that the 5 other people I was watching with (a mixture of generations I might add) didn't understand it either, so I feel justified in saying that this film is very confusing. I wonder whether I should have read the book or watched the original TV series before I went to watch it, because I don't think it helped that I wasn't familiar with the story.<br/><br/>While I wasn't expecting a fast-paced Bourne thriller and I don't need to be spoon-fed information, I wish there had been more care with relating the story in a film-friendly way. I think if I had understood it, it would have been excellent. There were far too many moments where you are just looking at Smiley having a think with some slow paced music, and the time frame jumped all over the place without much indication that it had. There were also some scenes that to me seemed completely pointless (they probably weren't, it was just that they weren't explained). Some more setting the scene would have been appreciated. The film also leaves a lot of questions unanswered, for example what was the benefit of being a double agent; why was Haydon one in the first place? What was the relationship between the agents?<br/><br/>Anyway, despite it all being a bit frustrating, my next step will be to read the book and maybe watch it again to see if I revise my opinions. I would definitely recommend to anyone going to see it to read up a bit about it first!"

","This film would make your head spin. I still haven't quite figured out how Smiley figured out who the bad guy was, or did he figure it out at all? Did he just lay a trap and figure it out that way? I'd have to watch the whole mess again. The thing is thick with flashbacks, to the point where you don't know if you are coming or going. Here's a good tip; any time you see a Christmas party, that is a flashback. So many confusing aspects! For instance, yes, the guy you see living in a trailer outside the school he is teaching in is actually the guy you saw shot near the beginning of the film; but no, this is not a flashback in this case. How did he get there? Pay attention, and you may find out toward the end of the film. So many other things wrong. In the trailer for this film, you see Smiley and a suspect walking across an airfield with an aircraft landing behind them; the way it is done is gimmicky and unnecessary. Worse, you can clearly see the heat haze rising from the ground; but the men are wearing their coats as if it was the middle of winter! It appears the director strained to squeeze the film into 2 hours, yet the beginning of the film crawls along. I found myself looking at my watch after 1 hour, begging for the film to just move along."

","Another entry into the ""bring together a cast of major stars and still have a bad movie"" category.<br/><br/>This is a spy story set during the Cold War, dealing with a British intelligence agency that was shaken up after a botched operation in Hungary, with top agents being forced out. I wasn't expecting a James Bond movie full of cheesecake, fancy gadgets, or stunts, but I did expect more than a glacially-paced and confusing story involving mostly a bunch of men walking around and talking and shouting at each other. I bailed after a half hour; I couldn't make heads or tails of the story. Seeing the other reviews posted here I realize I hadn't missed anything.<br/><br/>The only good part was the nice, big, and easy-to-read subtitles."
"rmax304823","7","4","8","24 August 2013"," Sometimes You Need A Scorecard.
","I'm giving this production some bonus points for the elegant photography, composition, acting, and the use of sound. Oh, and for being a movie that should be X rated because in all these respects it's a movie made for adults rather than ten-year olds. There's very little violence. Nobody's head is removed with a hedge trimmer. There are a few shootings but never once do we see the shooter and victim in the same frame. The camera doesn't wobble as if held by a drunk and the pallet, though muted, is not drawn from the cadaverous green area. Felicitations.<br/><br/>The story is basically simple. The never-smiling, extremely cool, Gary Oldman is George Smiley, part of some high-up British intelligence agency. It's 1973 and there is a Moscow Mule somewhere in the department. Smiley and one or two help mates finally dig him out. The biggest rat of all gets away -- I think.<br/><br/>However, the screenplay meanders all over the place, with mostly passionless subplots that turn the film into a Cretan labyrinth with no Minotaur, just the labyrinth. You need patience to get through this; and a mature sensibility, not one attuned to instant and complete gratification.<br/><br/>The two most tragic scenes.<br/><br/>(1) Tom Hardy is a young British spy in Budapest who falls for the young woman he's squeezing secret information out of. Hardy himself is handsome, I suppose. He looks like Kevin Costner with Marlon Brando lips. But his girl friend, Svetlana Khodchenkova, is an absolute knockout with her blue tartar eyes. I wish the USSR had collapsed earlier than it did so we could have gotten to know her better, although, come to think of it, she was only seven or eight when the implosion took place. Anyway, she winds up with a bullet through her head. That's tragic.<br/><br/>(2) One of the subplots involves an ex British spy, tortured by the Reds, now a stern teacher in a boy's boarding school. At first arid and unforgiving in class, he forms a friendship with a chubby little kid who is an outsider at the school too. But the teacher is drawn back into ""the circus"" and towards the end, when the plain little social isolate tries to give him a present, the teacher curses and shoos him away, knowing that his peaceful, pastoral existence must come to an end. All of us murderers who work for the state must know how the school teacher feels.<br/><br/>The cast is fine. I was happy to see the craggy face of John Hurt as ""Control."" He gave me such splendid support in the classic ""From The Hip."" I liked him too because he was shorter than I. The rest of the cast is equally good. <br/><br/>Except for what I take to be the Etonian haircut, Benedict Cumberbatch as Smiley's reliable, homosexual assistant, reminds me of Kenneth Williams from the ""Carry On"" series. Incidentally, the brief scene in which Cumberbatch's homosexuality is revealed, there is only one line of dialog that trips the viewer to what's happening: ""If there's someone else --"" Otherwise, as so often elsewhere, you might not know what the hell is going on."

","It's not that the movie was poorly done. It was Oscar bait, so it had a solid cast, with plenty of opportunities for Oldman to deliver strong lines. The script was intelligent, the camera work was good, the scenery was done well, and a great deal of effort was obviously put into making this movie believable and accurate. But it was just...boring. I think this is the most boring spy flick I've ever watched. You really have to pay attention to appreciate the intricacies and twists in this film, and I really had trouble staying engaged. I actually fell asleep twice and had to restart from the last boring scene that I remembered.

","Compared to the BBC version with Sir Alec Guinness, which I strongly advise watching and rate that one a 10, and compared to the book by John LeCarre, another 10, this version is a real stinker. The acting, if you can call it acting, is minimalist at best, deadpan, the development of the characters and plot non-existent. The movie makes no sense as it progresses. It is bland. The BBC version, however, is rich in development, high in tension and sense of loyalty and betrayal all supported by a terrific musical score that enhances but does not get in the way. This 2011 version no nothing of the sort. It is just plain awful in my opinion. Watch the BBC one, you will see what I mean."

","Egads, what a terrible movie! <br/><br/>Fifteen minutes in, I was lost, and never again found my way. The basic plot involves the efforts of the British intelligence trying to root out a Russian spy in their midst, but this film is so preposterously hard to follow, not to mention glacially paced, that I found myself gazing at the decor for nearly the entire running time. Unfortunately, since the film is set in the drab Soviet world of the 1970s, the decor is mostly brown, gray and murky, much like the cinematography.<br/><br/>I can't even tell you whether Gary Oldman, who received an Oscar nomination for his performance, is any good, not to mention any of the other recognizable actors (Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, John Hurt) who make up the rest of the cast. To know whether or not an actor is doing a good job, you have to understand the character he is playing and where that character fits in with the other characters and the general plot. This movie is like watching a bunch of random scenes strung together with no relation to one another.<br/><br/>Here's a tip: if you're going to make a completely plot-driven movie, you better damn well make sure that plot can be followed by someone who hasn't read the book first.<br/><br/>Grade: D"
"alan-of-amersham","4","5","11","27 October 2011"," Fantastic cast but awful script, screenplay and directing
","Overall, I had the impression that plot had given way to a poor (and clichéd) attempt at an 'art' film in which sadly it also failed miserably. Let me state I was not expecting an action spy movie. I was expecting a more real, perhaps even plodding film where slowly Smiley works out who is the mole within 'the Circus'. Sadly we had a film littered with redundant (and pretty meaningless) scenes; at times it jumped around and it certainly over used flashbacks - some are important and some could have added so much more to developing/understanding the characters but somehow they failed; overall it was shot in a gloomy and dull way and in addition the film (and possibly sound) quality was poor - I had thought that perhaps the cinema were using a bad copy or had a projector issue but having read similar comments from other reviewers I begin to wonder. My suspicion is that all these devices were attempts at conveying the gloomy, boring, seedy, mysterious world of spying in the 1970s. To a point that may be fine but instead (and laboriously) they took over the film. With its superb cast and intriguing story this film could have been great. But one gained little insight about the characters who thus ended up one dimensional. And the story got lost. I do not know if I fell asleep at times and missed vital clues but it seemed as though important points (eg how did Smiley find Prideaux?) were skipped over as was most of the real painstaking work (showing someone rubbing their eyes after reading documents all night is simply not adequate). The only decent performance was by Benedict Cumberbatch as Guillam. The rest were stifled I suspect by a poor script and poorer directing. In conclusion what should have been an intriguing film where the mystery is 'who is the mole' simply left one thinking it was a mystery as to why they had bothered making the film."

I sympathise with people who got lost in it all, I too had plenty of issues with it after the first time of watching before realising I hadn't done the film or myself justice, so I watched it again. I then discovered it to be a very clever piece of work, and if you take the time to watch it closely and not let your concentration wander, it becomes thoroughly absorbing and all the pieces fit together wonderfully well.<br/><br/>The cast is impressive and the performances given are memorable.

","I can't believe a spy film about moles in the spy service starring Oldman, Firth, Hardy and Cumberbatch could be this dull. This movie was so boring and so hard to follow and so poorly paced that I had to watch it in two sittings.<br/><br/>Technically the film is nice (some nice camera-work, some harsh sound used to good effect), but I doubt even Deakins or Lubezki could shoot this film well enough to keep my interest. I have never been so bored in the opening credits of a film, they just seemed to go on because director Tomas Alfredson refuses to engage in any story while there are unobtrusive words flashing on the screen's corner. <br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has a pair of interesting spy sequences - the first being the opening sequence and the second being a well orchestrated infiltration by Cumberbatch's character. The rest of the film is extremely dull and mostly involves flashbacks, unnecessary subplots and very long boring stories told by people in British monotones. Narratively this film is jumbled. Its trying to tell the story about Oldman pursuing a spy in the agents. But there's also a story about a mission gone wrong that forced Oldman into retirement in the first place. Then there's the adventures of Tom Hardy. Then there's the story about Oldman and his wife and also another story about a cigarette lighter. Its nigh on impossible to deduce what's going on because the film flashes between events (where everyone looks the same too) without explanation. Why is Mark Strong teaching at a school? Was he released? Is this a prequel? Not until over halfway through the film do we learn that yes he was released. You pretty much need to watch this film with the Wikipedia summary open beside you, and even then it won't help.<br/><br/>The casting is where a spy film collapses. You have to cast suspects of equal standing - either high or low. In a far superior John le Carré adaptation, A Most Wanted Man, the film keeps all the relevant players as unknown actors. Here we have the last year's Best Actor Oscar Winner, a pair of character actors and some guy no one has ever heard of outside Europe. Combine that with the fact that Firth has more screen time than the other three combined and if you couldn't figure out it was him, then woe is you. Toby Jones is horrendously miscast - the man looks better suited for a live action Faraway Tree movie than the knighted head of a spy agency. It was almost impossible to take him seriously.<br/><br/>Positive performances include a chameleonic Oldman (whose perpetually blank expression managed to unnerve me as a viewer), a commanding John Hurt (whose character vanishes with barely a whimper) and some stellar supporting work from Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch (despite his awful wig), the latter two being the only emotional characters in the film. Hardy is fantastic in a character who really could have been relegated to a bit part. <br/><br/>If I were making this film, I'd cut about 90% of the dead air time and ramp the final reveal into something that actually had an impact on the audience instead of fizzling. Then I'd swap Dencick with Hardy and Hurt with Hind, so we actually had a guessing game on our hands. What we actually got literally put me to sleep."

TTSS is one of the few films of its type dealing with some very BIG conflicts yet lacking elements that seem contrived or too much of a stretch. Given close attention, the storyline is lucid enough, has some well-done and believable surprises, and does not just mess with one's head for the sake of it. It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth. <br/><br/>TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd. The large cast of characters is also a bit hard to keep track of on first view. Non-British audiences may need the subtitles due to the heavy accents and use of slang in this film. All the same, TTSS should appeal not only to international intrigue aficionados, but to anyone who's ever been in a group situation of any sort that's full of bad politics, everyone suspicious of everyone else, etc."

","The 1979 BBC series of the same name, starring Sir Alec Guinness has always been considered the final word on this cold War set spy novel. So any film adaption had an uphill task to convince sceptics that it had something new to say.<br/><br/>The fact that this very English story was to be directed by a ""foreigner"", Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, added further consternation.<br/><br/>As the cast was assembled however, it was clear this was to be no ordinary adaption. All stops had been pulled, the period setting nailed down, first class actors in place and a screenplay that had managed to compress this complicated novel into an audience friendly 127 minutes.<br/><br/>The film is set in the early 1970's and centres around the ""Circus"", a lightly fictionalized headquarters of British Secret Service. Every thing is brown, smoke filled, building and information security is almost non-existent, most of the higher echelons of the service are ex-military, plotting and counter plotting against the perceived Russian Communist threat.<br/><br/>The whole enterprise still has an amateurish old boy network feel, although involved in a very deadly game, where torture, murder and clandestine ""wet work"" occurs, albeit largely off screen here.<br/><br/>The film employs many flashbacks and the story is deliberately labyrinthine in complexity, spies spying on spies and paranoia filling every frame. No-one is to be trusted, certainly the US no longer will share their intelligence with the British, as they have a ""leaky ship"", a potential mole within the very top echelons of the organization. Handled by the mysterious and never seen ""Karla"", a Russian spymaster.<br/><br/>Smiley (Oldman) and his boss ""C"" or control (John Hurt), have been managed out into semi-retirement, only for Smiley to be brought back to ""clean house"" and find the traitor. He is assisted by the loyal Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Mendel (Roger Lloyd Pack). Smiley has always been Le Carre's greatest creation, investing by his own admission, many of his own early personality traits into his makeup. Crumpled, anonymous, inexperienced in love, all knowing and yet knowing little, he watches and observes and is never disappointed in man's frailties and flaws.<br/><br/>Smiley has four characters to choose from, if he discounts himself as the Mole, which from an audience point of view, we should not. Tinker (Toby Jones), Tailor (Colin Firth), Soldier (Ciaran Hinds) and Poorman (David Dencik).<br/><br/>The existence of the mole had been hinted at but was confirmed following the liaison of Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) a rogue field operative, with a Russian spy's wife. The film itself commencing with a disastrous ""extraction"" set and filmed in Hungary with Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), proving that moving pawns around is far easier and safer than being one.<br/><br/>To summarise the plot further would be to provide spoilers and would be difficult in a short review. There are occasions where the full story and motivations for characters are difficult to grasp, perhaps the feel and tone of the film is as important as comprehending every story nuance.<br/><br/>Author Le Carre, obviously spring-boarding from his own intelligence experience and the real life traitorous Cambridge five, Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Caircross and Blunt, all of which is well documented elsewhere.<br/><br/>Oldman manages to channel Guinness into his performance without being perceived as a caricature. On occasions the timbre and cadence of his voice sounds similar, however he has made this role very much his own. Oldman has an ability to disappear chameleon like into the role he plays, all different and no doubt nothing like his ""real life"" persona. Donning the famous character glasses, he personifies the Smiley many fans will know and love.<br/><br/>Oldman is assisted with a ensemble cast that reads like a roll-call of top acting talent, all performances are believable and fit the production and tone perfectly. It is difficult to imagine that the interpretation and presentation of the source material could be bettered. Whether the subject matter and realistic approach to spycraft, will appeal to a modern younger audience is less likely.<br/><br/>Smiley is the very antithesis of James Bond, there are no gadgets here, no exotic hotels, no flash cars. Just hum-drum, anonymous people doing shabby, boring, laborious and seedy work, interspersed with occasional acts of off screen violence, amply demonstrating the stakes all participants realise they are playing for.<br/><br/>Was it all worthwhile, the sacrifices made, the threat real or invented. Perhaps only those in the know will ever really be able to judge. In an interview (on the DVD/Bluray), Le Carre suggests that spy's are and always will be necessary but they should be subservient to the democratic process, listened too but not always seen as a panacea for societies ills and acted upon blindly.<br/><br/>So a story that is fixed in time, that is in many ways anachronistic now but a story well told and with the highest quality of acting.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>In many ways an instant classic, with a mesmerizing performance from Gary Oldman and sterling support from a glitterati of mainly English acting royalty.<br/><br/>However, this may not be to everyone's taste perhaps, with little action and a complicated plot that remains largely true to the original very dry and complex Le Carre book, upon which the film is based."

Gary Oldman's performance in this film is unforgettable. I could write and write about his, and all of the other actors performances, but this would turn into a very long review. To keep this short I will just say, the acting from every performer is brilliant and well worth viewing.<br/><br/>I found the story to be phenomenal, and I have never read the book or seen any previous versions. Many however, complain that it is too confusing, and to tiresome to watch and pay complete attention too. I felt the story and pacing was refreshing. To often I find today's pictures to be too repetitive and obvious. The way this story was told was wonderful and real. It interpreted perfectly aspects of Cold War conflict. But, if you bore easy, this film will be terribly long and pointless. A good judgment of whether or not you will be bored by this film is if you are still reading this review. :)<br/><br/>If you love the art of film making, cinematography, lighting, costuming, acting, storytelling, etc, you will love this film. If you go to the cinema to be wowed by CGI, to solve a mystery that you can solve while watching, or to get your lover in the mood, this is not the film for you. <br/><br/>Lastly I would like to say, this film is not dark. (I'm not saying it is appropriate for young audiences, not just because of the rating but because of how bored they would be.) If you upset easily over very graphic, vulgar filled, over sexual films, this one will not upset you. It is pretty tame in those regards. I would still suggest reading the parental guide IMDb offers. Keep in mind the descriptions are very detailed on that guide though, and often make it seem worse then it actually is.<br/><br/>I hope you found this helpful.

However, if you liked The Good Shepherd or J. Edgar, you will find this film as intriguing as I did. This is an intricately laced film about the number one rule of spying: Trust No One. Gary Oldman is superb in this low-key thriller as George Smiley, the intelligence operator destined to become Control. Violence is at a minimum, but the fascinating web of deceit and revelations is worth a couple of hours of your time. Rated R for language and some violence, and subject matter, not necessarily a collectible."

","We do not meet George Smiley straight away. He wears a dispassionate, icily glazed expression upon his face. He is aging: his hair is turning silvery grey, and at first glance, whether it be his reticence, his stiff movements, his thin, tightly pressed lips, or his daily swim in a nearby lake amongst others his age, practising backstroke at a glacial pace while leaves, brown and decaying, blow onto the surface of the metallic water, we may conclude that he is tired and indifferent – not that interesting a character at all. That is our first mistake. For behind those observant, grey eyes of his, magnified a little by his darkly rimmed spectacles, burns a quiet, festering rage, born of unhappiness and the cruel realisation that the cause he may have believed he was fighting for in his youth is a worthless, corrupt, brutal sham.<br/><br/>Yet his cold determination and impersonal, terrifyingly brilliant logic betray him. He knows the rules of the game, has been disgusted by them, and yet keeps on playing. Where most fiction would take a protagonist like George Smiley and simply turn him into some kind of martyr, what we find here is something far more disquieting. For Smiley, in his undercover investigation of a possible mole in 'The Circus' (commonly known as MI6), finds a primitive satisfaction in his success; his own horrible realisation of the reality of his work is long in the past, buried deep somewhere behind those large, grey eyes, and this might be the only source of pride that he can feel as he begins to age. Perhaps he was emotional when he was younger – indeed, in one of the best scenes in the film (one of many, I hasten to add), Smiley tells us of his desperation to save the life of a Russian spy; this venture was perhaps the last straw for Smiley, and fully secured his disillusionment. The film ends with Smiley facing the camera, and we can almost see him smile, for the first time in the film. But this isn't a happy ending, and I didn't leave the cinema liking the protagonist at all; instead, he gave me shivers. <br/><br/>Of course, the source material - John Le Carre's brilliant novel of the same name - is over 400 pages long, and was long ago adapted into an award winning miniseries starring that cinematic giant of yesteryear, Alec Guinness. Gary Oldman now has the role of George Smiley, and safe to say, he excels. An Oscar nomination will doubtlessly come his way next year. It is an exquisite performance – all nuance, body language, gesture. Only once in the whole film does Smiley even raise his voice above his tired monotone; yet the performance is an incredible, unique, vividly memorable piece of art.<br/><br/>Of course, the notion of having Tomas Alfredson as director was always a stroke of genius. Still fresh from universal critical acclaim for his 2008 masterpiece 'Let The Right One In', here he demonstrates once more just how important a director he is, injecting his own unique brand of 'Swedish melancholia' into his brilliant new adaptation. The result is fascinating; Alfredson gives as much weight to files being transported from one floor to the next and stored away in a cupboard to a botched assassination across the seas. Here, the assassins, rather than just being dispassionate, unfeeling cogs in the clockwork of the plot, are terrifyingly human – their hands shake, and beads of sweat threaten to betray their real intent. <br/><br/>Alfredson transports us to a Seventies of grainy greys, browns, blacks, and heavily diluted, artificial greens and blues, executing his palette with such loving, meticulous precision that the oppressive atmosphere of corruption, sorrowful disenchantment and the danger of violence lurking just behind every corner, almost becomes a character in itself. This could well be the most unglamorous spy thriller ever made. Of course, as hinted at before, the plot centres around Smiley's investigation as regarding a mole at the top of MI6, a fact that Smiley's boss and friend, Control (a marvellous performance from John Hurt) was sure of; his determination to discover the culprit led to a disastrous mission in Budapest, from which he was left reeling shortly before his death. Now, the task is left to Smiley.<br/><br/>The bad guy is painfully easy to spot – it shouldn't come as any surprise when the 'twist' is revealed. But that is irrelevant – for where this film excels, and what makes it so outstanding, is in its exploration of the disappointment, cruel disillusionment and suffocating emotional claustrophobia that these characters have unwittingly signed up to: emotional ties are dangerous, and often unsustainable. Smiley knows all too well, and it is another stroke of genius that neither his wife, nor his 'nemesis' Karla are ever seen in plain view – they are obscured memories, slowly decaying in some part of his imagination as his anger and wounded pride continue to fester. Of course, Alfredson has done his homework. He has read his source material and managed to condense it into a single 2 hour film without it ever feeling unduly rushed – indeed, it is actually quite measured and stately. There are countless masterful scenes, including one involving Benedict Cumberbatch in the Government Archives, that is nerve shreddingly tense – Hitchcock would have been envious. The supporting cast is also a dream: a magnificent medley of British acting talent, including John Hurt, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and Toby Jones, to name but a few. <br/><br/>'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is an excellent piece of filmmaking – dark, uncompromising, perfectly measured and alarmingly detached, restrained and cruel. It is, even with its niggling little flaws (personally, I found the climax a little underdone and the outcome predictable; although the stunning final sequence more than makes up for it), one of the best films of 2011. That's saying something!"
"bob-stranks-259-207274","3","2","3","18 February 2012"," How Disappointing
","It's probably an age thing. If you saw the original version then there's no contest between Alec Guinness and Ian Richardson and Gary Oldman and Colin Firth. The latter do their best, but it doesn't get within a mile of the original. No menace and very little drama in comparison.<br/><br/>For those who've penned effusive praise of this version, give yourselves an early Christmas present and see the original.<br/><br/>I was particularly disappointed by the meeting in the safe house. It was confusing at best and unfathomable at worst. <br/><br/>Oscar standard - I think not."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","3","12 February 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
","What a blast. Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who did the acclaimed horror film Let the Right One In, followed up that effort with yet another adaptation of a novel, this time written by the famed John le Carre, who himself was a real life British intelligence operative who left the service to become a full time writer. His name may not ring a bell at first, but he's responsible for countless of stories that involve spy vs spy, and in the last decade had his stories The Tailor of Panama and The Constant Gardener, amongst others, made into movies. His main protagonist of George Smiley is to him like how probably Jack Ryan is to Tom Clancy, and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the first in what would be known as the Karla Trilogy, and I'm hoping the rest could be made as well, if this is indicative of how the rest can be.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the film moves at meditative pace, quite unlike most spy films which tend to focus on either the intrigue behind the politicking, or the action sequences. This is like an anti-thesis to the Bond films, where the figures that lurk in the shadows, stay in the shadows, rather than to blow their cover at each possible opportune. The narrative moves forward and backward very freely, and it's up to your own devices to piece things together in chronological order. But Alfredson does this without alienating or frustrating the viewer, and in fact putting scenes in their place so that they make sense, and provide you with a little bit of fun and work to figure out the complex web of relations and accounts that already exists, putting you in the driver's seat just as George Smiley (Gary Oldman) gets tasked to try and figure out the identity of a mole in the top levels of the British intelligence service.<br/><br/>Assembling a small crack team that he could trust, the crux of the story is like an investigative drama, where suspects and witnesses get paid an imposing visit by the unsmiling (contrary to his last namesake) Smiley whom you know brings about a certain gravitas in his presence, compelling one to cooperate rather than to go against. Gary Oldman, when his character George Smiley is on to you, there's no escape and even without firing a shot his deep stare and monotonous voice hardly betrays any emotion, and will make anyone pee in their pants out of unfounded fear. In many instances one will find it perplexing why he goes about in his investigations in a certain peculiar way, and only when it's revealed much later on that it all made sense, tying in with the way the scenes got presented together, sometimes without very clear answers, relying on your ability to put 1 and 1 together.<br/><br/>To say anything more will be to betray the necessity of the viewer to pay really close attention to every word said, and every scene being played out. There are plenty of thick dialogue in the film that calls for your utmost attention, with failure being to miss out on pertinent clues in this cat and mouse hunt, played out when one has to operate from the outside to probe into an office one held before, to look for clues and evidence without alerting the proverbial snake until the time is right. And playing probable snakes are a myriad of characters, with some of the best ensemble casting that any film will find envious of, such as Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Oldman himself, amongst others.<br/><br/>With the spate of public officials being caught with their pants down in various scandals here in Singapore, this film couldn't be more apt when one thinks about the kind of probes that get sanctioned in order to weed out the rot right at the top, such as the appointment of a commission of inquiry to go in with authority, and with a grave mission at hand to seek accountability. In essence that's what Smiley had to deal with, being tasked out of retirement to do just that and get down to the bottom of things, with what I thought was actually a brilliant masterstroke by the mole to do things in a certain personal way that will cast doubts into the mind of its possible, powerful adversary, thinking multiple steps ahead in deliberately measured chess game. And the fact is that the story is also quite close to real life, being le Carre's novelized account of his own experiences of the 50s and 60s scandal that revealed the Cambridge Five traitors within Britain.<br/><br/>In most real life spy versus spy cases, there's always a distinct lack of pomp or to keep things under wraps for fear of having one's cover blown apart, or jeopardizing the prospects of other agents. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy also subscribes to this mantra that shuns big movement and action, but in its place comes the real treasure of the intricate work done to uncover leaks and spies with tools of utmost secrecy, and diplomacy to a certain extent where deals get cut and made. It's old school spy 101, but has more than enough fuel in its tank to warrant repeat viewings just to catch all the subtleness and complexities. Highly recommended as the thinking man's spy thriller!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the best-selling 1974 John LeCarre' spy novel, opinions on this movie will cover the full spectrum. Many will find it painfully slow and impossible to follow. Others will be thrilled with the subtle clues and reality-based exchanges between British spies in the early 70's. This is no James Bond thriller with exploding yachts, world class fist fights and bikini-clad women. Rather, it's a peek at what real life spies do ... huddle in soundproof rooms and exchange information through stunted conversation where just shy of enough is said.<br/><br/>John LeCarre' actually worked for the British Secret Service prior to becoming an author (also wrote ""The Constant Gardener"" and ""The Russia House""). He based the story around when a traitor was uncovered during the biggest scandal in the history of British intelligence. This story covers some of that and even more. We see how trust and loyalty are so crucial, yet none of these men ever fully trusts the fellow agent sitting next to him. Very little is spoken, but much is communicated through a nod, raised eye brow, a slight cock of the head, or even the adjustment of one's spectacles. Cigarettes and scotch are the common ground from which discussions spring.<br/><br/>Director Tomas Alfredson is from Sweden and delivered the exceptional vampire drama ""Let the Right One In"" a couple of years ago. Mr. Alfredson has a distinctive feel for the look of a film, and atmospheric is a word that fits this movie, as well as his earlier one. The tone, color and texture is key to this world and we are immersed in blues and grays. His camera work is unique and wondrous as he massages the small, confined spaces and allow us to pick up the gestures of all involved.<br/><br/>The cast is a group of wonderfully talented (mostly) men: Mark Strong, John Hurt (Control), Toby Jones (Tinker), Colin Firth (Tailor), Ciaran Hinds (Soldier), David Dencik (Poor Man)and Stephen Graham. Especially enjoyable are Tom Hardy as a rogue agent who breaks the ""mole"" theory wide open, Benedict Cumberbatch as the youngest agent, and of course, Gary Oldman as George Smiley. Oldman's performance will awe many and bore a few. This is a man trained to say only what must be said. You can see the resolve in his eyes. These still waters run VERY deep. Some will compare him to the performance of Sir Alec Guiness in the BBC production, and both terrific and strong.<br/><br/>While a rousing recommendation would be nice, it's just not in the cards. This movie will have a very specific audience ... those who thrive on mental jigsaw puzzles and are inspired by juggling an endless stream of characters and possible plots. If that describes you, then get in line on opening day."

","""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is an espionage film that isn't about action and special effects so much as systematic investigation. There's an analytical process at work, a logical deconstruction of the situation at hand. This isn't to suggest that the film is a cold collection of facts and figures; in its narrative methodology, it's a deeply involving mystery, and at times, it's highly thrilling. We want to get to the bottom of things just as badly as the characters do. And unlike a lot of stories of intrigue, which can be too clever and gimmicky for their own good, this one is genuinely unpredictable. There's no telling where it will go, when things will happen, or how it will end up. How nice that there are still mysteries that actively work towards actually surprising the audience.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel by John le Carré, the film weaves a convoluted yet engrossing tale of intrigue without resorting to romanticized James Bond spy clichés. There are no preposterous gadgets hidden in cufflinks or pens, no fancy sports cars with big engines, no scantily clad women. The agents aren't suave, svelte men in tuxedos with the phony fighting skills of a martial arts stunt coordinator; they work in offices and filing rooms, they have varying builds, they dress in average work clothing, and some of them look as if their years of service have prematurely aged them. This isn't the glamorized world of secret agents, but a daily grind. There are no super villains in hidden underground fortresses. There are only men with guns. And as the story demonstrates, having a gun doesn't necessarily make you the most dangerous person around.<br/><br/>Set during the early 1970s at the height of the Cold War, the film takes place mostly in England and centers on the hunt for a Soviet double agent who has infiltrated the top levels of the British secret service. It cuts back and forth through time, giving us pieces of the puzzle in teasing increments. It begins when the head of British Intelligence, nicknamed Control (John Hurt), sends an agent named Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to Hungary on a mission, only for it to go horribly wrong; Soviet Intelligence got involved, resulting in someone getting shot. The uproar over the incident reaches all the way back to British Intelligence, codenamed The Circus, forcing Control and his right-hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) into retirement. The new chief, Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), is surrounded by agents who have established themselves by obtaining what seems to be high-grade material from Soviet Intelligence.<br/><br/>Smiley is brought back out of retirement when an agent named Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) comes forward claiming that there is mole on the senior staff of British Intelligence, and that there has been for many years. He could only go to Smiley with this information; he has been on the run following a mission to Istanbul, during which he was told about the mole, and the subsequent accusations of defection. As Smiley begins the process of interviewing former Circus operatives and obtaining sensitive yet pertinent information, it becomes increasingly evident that Tarr is telling the truth. Exactly who is the mole? Scenes of the senior staff staring at each other warily effectively add tension. Pay close attention to Alleline's deputy, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), and close allies Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) and Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds).<br/><br/>The discovery of a surprise survivor leads to the revelation of suspect codenames Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, and Poorman (not Spy, as the title indicates), all conceived of by Control. I leave it to you to discover who among The Circus the codenames apply to. There is a final confrontation which is highly enjoyable, and yet it's not because of conventional tactics like a shootout, a daredevil escape, or an explosion; it's simply because the mystery has been solved. Action sequences can be a great deal of fun, and Lord knows I've recommended plenty of movies on those terms. That being said, there's a tremendous satisfaction that comes with nothing more or less than seeing the pieces finally falling into place. We've worked through the evidence and made the connections, and now we have the payoff.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is sure to be noticed for his performance in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" As Smiley, he's not a super spy stereotype, but a dedicated man doing his job. I'm hard pressed to say that he loves what he does; he spends much of the film looking tired, and indeed, it's hard to imagine how a lifetime of covert missions and intense investigative work can be easy on the body. Despite his declining physical status (watch him as he gets up out of a chair), his mind remains razor sharp. He trusts his instincts. He knows who to talk to and where to get information. He keeps calm in every situation. He can get to the bottom of things, and he doesn't even need bullets. He actually thinks before he acts. How refreshing to see a secret agent that gets by on brains instead of brawn.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","Someone at the top of the British Secret Service is a mole, passing information to the Kremlin. George Smiley is tasked by the Foreign Office with unmasking them.<br/><br/>For my money, there are two great (and very contrasting) spies in British literature - Ian Fleming's James Bond and John Le Carré's George Smiley, who is the antithesis of Bond; quiet, unassuming, brilliant, a player of pawns on the international stage. Oldman is just terrific here, one of those mesmerising performances where everything the character feels is in his eyes - he never even has to raise his voice. The support cast is good, with Strong and Cumberbatch both intriguing as Prideaux the captured agent, and Guillam, the young protégé, respectively. The movie is set in 1973 and the attention to detail is excellent with all the right cars and clothes, but more importantly the style - Alfredson's film could just as easily have been made in 1973 and will be just as taut and edgy forty years from now. This is a movie about paranoia and political manoeuvring in a male-dominated world and Smiley is the puppet-master who refuses to lose his cool no matter what the situation, as in the scene where he matter-of-factly accuses the minister of being indirectly responsible for the security leaks or the moment at the Christmas party where he discovers his wife is having an affair. This is a man who doesn't even take his glasses off whilst swimming. There are dozens of brilliant little touches, like the fly in the car scene or the moment of epiphany just as the train points click home, which add enormously to a rich and thought-provoking film. There is also a memorably understated piano score by Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias which drifts around the scenes with quiet intensity. Smiley's history is a little complex; he's a minor character in Le Carré's early books Call For The Dead and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold then the main protagonist in this, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People, but also appears on the periphery in a few other works. This book was filmed previously as an excellent 1979 BBC TV serial with Alec Guinness as Smiley, which is well worth catching if you can. This movie version however is a great old-fashioned thriller and a smashing adaptation of a tremendous spy novel."
"rohansrider","Null","2","3","5 October 2011"," Not as good as I had hoped.
","Interesting views here; terribly polarized. Appears to be a love it or hate it movie and as for me I think I know why its detractors were so disappointed. Given the wonderful ensemble cast I think they expected a stronger plot line and narrative building up to the revelation of the ""mole"". This did not happen and because the film was too short the final few minutes with the ""mole "" revealed were a let-down. I usually love a good thriller/whodunnit but this did not measure up. I challenge anyone to declare that they knew who was the mole by evidence shown. I don't think Smiley was really sure an in any case there were no definitive reasons given for why the ""mole"" was a double-agent. I found Smiley rather tedious and I did have the odd yawn. The flash back technique was at times confusing, and the film feels to be rather pretentious,almost implying that it's very cerebral and if you don't like it then you must be a moron. I am not a moron; I was not expecting an action packed film by any means but this was too slow. The lack of character development was also a mistake. It falls into the category to watch again on DVD and maybe I will appreciate the nuances and tiny clues. As someone already said not suited for the big screen. For me Tom Hardy stood out with Cumberbatch also very competent. Hurt was playing himself as usual, the rest were not that noteworthy except for Kathy Burke's small role which was excellent. It did capture the mood and drabness of the seventies very well and the cinematography was faultless; look out for an Oscar or BAFTA in that category."

","Truly a (underrated) masterpiece.<br/><br/>By far the best movie adaptation of a Le Carre subject IMO. Dialogs, cinematography, acting, settings, storytelling, editing and music are at highest, almost perfect levels, in a harmony seldomly seen.
The slow development of the story with its limited dialogs is the one, most winning point of this production, leaving open the unpredictable resolution up to the last moment. Although the real appreciation of the development of the story probably grows only after a second view, once you are aware of the content. The serie of 1977 with Guinness already was a very valuable production, but here this movie even tops that IMO, although some interesting details in the story are lost in its brevity.<br/><br/>The play of Oldman is stellar, as is the one of Colin Firth, giving the winning, sinister-sympathetically manipulating villain here.

","The Cold War was probably one of the most tense, complex times in human history. Two superpowers and a dozen smaller ones poised perpetually on the brink of nuclear war, each trying to scare the other into giving in to Communism, democracy, and many other things. It was a time of fear and paranoia, a time when wearing a red scarf here in the States could get you twenty-five to life. This is the mood that Tomas Alfredson's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy tries to convey at every opportunity. The entire film is a tense affair filled with hard stares, double crossing, encoded messages and one of the most convoluted plots I have ever seen. Each actor plays their part perfectly, each one seeming to have been worn down by the constant vigilance their job requires. They all seem to have short tempers, and each seems to be all but actively hostile towards everyone else. They all seem to have their own agendas (who didn't back then?), and once the idea that one of them is a mole is introduced, each one is a candidate. The story mainly follows George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman, and his investigation into this matter. Between many meetings in a smoky boardroom with the upper echelons of British intelligence, he contacts his trusted members of the organization to try to gather information about the movements of those suspected. His questionings involve flashbacks galore, some of which seemed to not matter to the overall plot in the least. Or maybe they did, and I just didn't realize it. I really cannot say for certain. This is a film that really could have used a longer running time. There seemed to be something happening nearly every second, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it gives you no time to process the last bit of story before you're being force-fed the next one. As with many stories, I am sure all the details are presented in some way that makes complete sense. Actually, that's probably exactly the case. But having read the book beforehand (which I clearly did not) is probably a major aid in the endeavor to understand this story. Everything else about the film is actually very well done. The acting is terrific; each actor is recognizable, and each manages to make their character feel distinct. The atmosphere is palpable, with smoke everywhere and characters filling the screen with their brooding, suspicious faces. The cinematography is suitably bleak, with everywhere always seeming like the sun is hidden behind a thick curtain of clouds. Alfredson's direction makes for some great shots that add to the tension, reminding us of his supernatural masterpiece Let the Right One In. However, the story is the primary focus of this picture, without doubt. And when the story is this tangled, all the filmmaking skill in the world cannot completely make up for it."

","Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy strays far from the familiarity of other spy films such as the James Bond franchise. This Cold War-set mystery piece sheds the treatment of tense gun shootouts, big-budget explosions and high-octane chase sequences in favor of a more authentic approach to the world of espionage. The story here follows a man with to hunt down the villain using his intellectual skills rather than high-tech gadgetry or firearms, and what transpires is a solidly complex, yet fascinating spy thriller. Taking from the pages of the novel of the same name by British writer John Le Carre, this historical fiction piece offers a layered story of paranoia and deceit that enlisted cultural relevance to the dark days of the Cold War during the 50s and 60s, and transcends into an enthralling tale where action is minimal but the suspense is high. Set in 1974, this film tells the story of MI6 agent Jim Prideaux (played by Mark Strong) who is assigned by head of the department Control (played by John Hurt) on a mission to Hungary. When the mission goes terribly wrong, Secretary Olive Lacon (played by Simon McBurney) learns that one of their agent is secretly working for the Soviet Union and hires retired agent George Smiley (played by Gary Oldman) to uncover the mole. With no one to trust but Agent Peter Gilliam (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley must use his intellect along with classified information by field agent Ricky Tarr (played by Tom Hardy) to uncover the traitor.<br/><br/>Those who go into this flick expecting action and tensions in the veins of a James Bond movie are more than likely destined for disappointment. Inspired by John Le Carre's source material, this Tomas Alfredson-directed thriller opens light on more complicated world of international espionage that many films of the spy genre tend to embellish. Tomas Alfredson presents the film with both a narrative and visual compulsion that strengthens the authenticity of its Cold War climate, the latter of which involves incorporating a limited color palette of brown and gray in give each scene an old timely look from the 1970s. But it is the story that takes the crown on breathing life into the atmosphere. The film follows the lead character as he navigates for clues on who the informer is, and it journeys through a dense labyrinth of character explorations and twists that firmly build suspense for the final act. Everything moves at a significantly slow pace as the most of the action consists of characters engaging in long conversations. As tedious as it sounds, the long stretches of dialogue are actually what contribute to the blistering suspense that steadily pays off as twists and turns are frequently fired at us. It will keep you guessing until the end. While it is easy to grow exhausted by the over-sophistication of the plot, there are plenty of little surprises sprinkled throughout the stretch. <br/><br/>Arguably one of the most celebrated aspects of this historical fiction piece comes from wide cast of A-list English actors who dominate the screen. Stepping in the lead role is Gary Oldman, known for his role as Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy boasts an emotionally stimulating performance in the role, easily one of the best performances he's displayed in his career. Standing by his side is Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the television series 'Sherlock', who does a fair job as MIG agent Peter Gilliam. Simon McBurney also makes for an appealing on screen performance, but perhaps nothing too memorable. John Hurt does his job here as well, but his much of his memorability here is deflated by his short amount of screen time. Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, and Ciaran Hinds make the best of their limited screen time, nothing out of the ordinary. In the end, it is Oldman that stands out among the crowd with his performance. <br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a fascinating Cold War espionage vehicle empowered by a superb craftsmanship by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson as well as stellar performances from an inspiring cast. As engrossing as it is, the film is not an easy one to follow and could require a second viewing for the brain to compete with the narrative complexity. The film is itself may not be the groundbreaking entry in the spy genre it sets out to be, but it does great justice."

","This is a film about a man sent to investigate the identity of a senior member of the British secret service who is in the pocket of the Russians. The film looks great. This is a time before laptops so there is a lot of paperwork, smoking indoors, and suits done up to eleven. The atmosphere of the film is very good. There is a scene where Benedict Cumberbatch retrieves some files. Why he doesn't shove them down his trousers is anyones guess. There is an office party that keeps taking place filmed in what looks like a school hall where the words dress casually have never been muttered. There is also a school that has a very laid back recruitment system that enable's Mark Strong's character agent Jim Prideaux to batter a bird to death in front the class, live in a camper van on site, and allow the pupils to drive his car around on the playing field. Obviously this is a different era when senior intelligence officer's would go and take a dip in a pond on a rainy weekday instead of that swimming pool nonsense. Grime, red buses and telephone boxes, ashtrays, hard liquor, files, neglected corridors and ties are the predominant visual aspects. There is a world weary cynicism that hangs to the garments worn by most of the characters. There is even a scene at the end where an assignation takes place in broad daylight on the grounds of what looks like a school by a man who makes no attempt to disguise his identity. This is a film that really works but also has a lot of aspects that do not resonate with reality."

"q_leo_rahman","6","1","1","15 May 2015"," Technically brilliant but sadly patchy adaptation of a classic spy tale
","John le Carre's spy story TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is one of the greatest spy tales ever told. It traces the search for a Russian spy within the British Secret Service, and exposes the cynicism and emptiness that forms a part of a spy's life. It was magnificently adapted into a TV series in the 1970s, and it was adapted into a feature film in 2011, with sadly a little less success.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is brilliant. It took six months to edit the film together into a stunning presentation; it's filled with flashbacks, long pan/zoom shots, and montages that present the impression of a puzzle seen through a scope, from which the viewers must look in and work out the truth at the heart of the events (and even then they won't get the full story). The production design and cinematography looks suitably bleak and cramped, recreating the wintry feel of Cold War London. <br/><br/>The cast play characters who betray and are betrayed, in various ways and levels. Gary Oldman is a standout as the restrained mild- mannered protagonist George Smiley, and he leads a cast of veteran actors – Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and David Dencik, among others – who do well in the roles they are assigned. If you've read le Carre's novel there isn't anything too special except for Oldman and Cumberbatch, whose roles are slightly different than expected (Smiley is more emotional, while Guillam is a homosexual), which lends depth to their performances.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film falls short where the story is concerned. The story simply needs more than two hours to be told in an appropriate manner; for a TV series this worked out fine, but for a feature film a lot of things had to be compressed, shifted and cut out for the sake of running time, and it overall leaves the story in a sadly patchy, watered-down version of what it used to be and should be. This adaptation has less suspense, is more complicated (at least for those who don't get the story) and feels more hopeless and futile than the book and TV series (which at least presented a ray of hope for things getting better). <br/><br/>The film is great as a period piece, and forms a technically superb work, successfully capturing the cynical and bleak times of the Cold War. But story-wise, the tale is sadly as bleak and disappointing as the film's setting. It's good for a watch once in a while, but viewers are better off watching the TV series."

","Really nicely done but maybe much too light on action for a lot of modern audiences. <br/><br/>They must have poured a fortune into the sets, the period cars, etc. and every penny showed--it was simply luscious. As far as the story, I can't remember if I ever read the book, and while I saw the earlier adaptations, I can't remember them well enough to compare and contrast this version with those older ones. <br/><br/>In any event, I feel that this production can definitely stand on its own, and I like movies that take their time and aren't just ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am,"" so the languid pace was just fine with me. Be forewarned though, that this is mostly a psychological talking movie with only occasional little spurts of action. <br/><br/>I don't know or can't recall the original source material, but I strongly suspect that the minor homosexual side stories were added to make the movie seem more contemporary and up-to-date, and I'm not sure if I really care. I guess this modern twist didn't hurt, but it didn't really seem to add anything either. <br/><br/>So, overall, a slow but worthwhile and pleasant ride, something that is hard to find in modern cinema."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Adapted from the John La Carre novels that were made into a TV mini series in the 70s, the film opens in the early 70s during the height of the cold war, where British Intelligence suspect a Russian spy has infiltraited their ranks. On a mission in Norway, Agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is apparently killed after things don't work out as planned. Now, Control (John Hurt) has narrowed the suspect down to four people and has called in the assistance of recently ousted Intelligence Analyst George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to get to the bottom of the matter. But as he does, he finds everyone around him increasingly harder to trust.<br/><br/>In the heat of the recession era movie industry, where endless, soulless brain dead, big budget popcorn fodder the big movie execs know will rake in the big bucks is the only thing that gets shoved in our faces, it's even more dis-spiriting that here we have another re-make...but a re-make that is of the more high brow, intelligent, sophisticated end of the market, a cerebral political thriller that demands all your attention and makes it's pay off by gripping you right to the end. Given the average movie goer of this generation (me, anyway) has the attention span of an amoeba, given it's exposure to excessive advertising, popular culture and MTV, it may be a flick that will require two viewings in order to take it all in and pick up on stuff you may have missed the first time round, but if you can figure it all out on your first viewing more power to you.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Oldman does what he was born to do, naturally inhibiting the body and voice of an experienced, weary old political hack, whilst Hurt provides reliable support as the eccentric, campy man at the top and Strong raises his profile as the elusive, mysterious agent and that's not to mention support from the likes of Kathy Burke, Colin Firth and Stephen Graham, and with a line up like that you know you're on surefire ground.<br/><br/>Although it's not an original idea, it somehow remains a taut and compelling one that is as dynamic as it originally was (apparantly) and is an encouraging sight given all the meaningless, big budget drivel we have to endure nowadays. ****"
"Wm_Gardner","8","1","1","27 May 2012"," Very well done, lovingly crafted. Great Cold War spy film
","Great movie. It is slow, the action is very subtle, and the plot is complicated. However, for those of us who lived through the Cold War, reading spy novels, and wondering if WW3 was right around the corner, this masterful film is a well-spent visit down memory lane. This is a snapshot of a time in history when tensions ran high on each side of the ""Iron Curtain"", a time period that lasted for decades and nearly disappeared over night. It had become a way of life, a time which many today never experienced and the rest of us often forget ever happened.<br/><br/>The lighting? For the mood and for the time, is spot on. The slow moving plot? Well, this is exactly how the Cold War would play out. Moles, conspiracies, and covert operations were often years or even decades in the making. Until the Reagan/Thatcher era came along, this is exactly how the Cold War played out; it was not like a James Bond movie. To back up this claim of realism, I offer this information from Wikipedia: ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is John le Carré's novelisation of his experiences of the revelations in the 1950s and the 1960s which exposed the Cambridge Five traitors, among them Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, John Cairncross and Kim Philby, as KGB moles employed by the SIS. Karla is modelled after KGB Gen. Rem Krassilnikov, whose obituary in the New York Times newspaper reported that the CIA considered him as such. Moreover, skewing in favour of the latter, Smiley reports that Karla was trained by ""Berg,"" Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov, an NKVD intelligence officer who defected to the West in 1938. The character Bill Haydon is derived from Kim Philby, who, in the late 1950s, transcended SIS suspicions that he too might be a traitor, given his connection with the defector Guy Burgess, and continued as an SIS intelligence officer until defecting to the USSR in 1963. David Cornwell (John le Carré) worked as an intelligence officer for the SIS (MI6) during Philby's tenure, and has said that Philby betrayed his identity to the Russians, which was a factor in the 1964 termination of his intelligence career. Connie Sachs, the Circus's principal Russia researcher, is modelled upon Milicent Bagot."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker,_Tailor,_Soldier,_Spy)<br/><br/>If you are up for a slow, subtle, and artfully presented trip into our not-too-distant past, this is as good as it gets. The plot is complex with many players who may have straddled each side of the fence at one point. Oldman is masterful. If you follow him, his character will lead you through all the smoke and mirrors until you are able to wrap your head around the plot. Great movie if you are one to handle the pace."

It was dark and I felt like I had just been exposed to a series of unrelated clips. Anyone who likes this movie must like drinking fish oil. Like I said, save your money.

","It was a conceit for the producers to think they could do justice to Le Carre's masterpiece in a 2 hour movie. Instead, what they have delivered is a rushed and incoherent condensation of the major plot points of the book which omits most of the backstory, with its petty bureaucratic infighting and backstabbing, sacrificing the dramatic weight of the original. It lacks the sad atmosphere of slow and inexorably building suspense that makes Tinker Tailor such a remarkable story and it's what makes this hurried remake for the attention deficit crowd so ill-conceived. That people have been impressed with this movie only shows how low the bar has been set for movie drama. Oldman's glum, wooden Smiley fails to convey any of the nuanced internal conflicts that were portrayed so brilliantly by Alec Guinness in the 1979 English TV mini-series. Skip this travesty and check out the 1979 production. You'll see what a great dramatization can be."

","""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is a Thriller released in 2011 and the first English-speaking one by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson. It is based on the same-titled novel by the famous author John le Carré. The Story is about George Smiley, a MI6 agent who gets fired together with his friend, the MI6's boss ""Control"", after a failed mission in Hungary. The plot takes place in the mid-seventies so the cold war is the background of the film. Soon after his retirement, ""Control"" dies and Smiley is ordered by a state secretary to investigate the suspicion that there is a mole in the new leadership of the ""Circus"". He is supported by active MI6 agent Peter Guillam, who is very well played by British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Tomas Alfredson has put together an amazing cast, consisting of such great actors as Colin Firth, John Hurt or Mark Strong. They are all playing their roles superbly, but still are all outshined by the unbelievable performance of Gary Oldman as George Smiley. He suits this role so well, expressing the emotions of this very inconspicuous though extremely intelligent character only by using little details, that even the creator of George Smiley, John le Carré, remarked how impressed he was by Gary Oldman. The overall atmosphere is well made due to good cinematography, prop work and soundtrack. The director has an incredible eye for details and this fits the movie very well. He uses a picture language which tells a lot without the audience hearing a single word of dialogue. The film is relatively close to the novel because John le Carré participated in the writing of the screenplay. This means that its pacing is slow. We like it very much because it allows for the building up of a much tighter atmosphere and creates more tension. But that is only our opinion and not everyone may like it. It is neither a James Bond film featuring exotic locations, loads of attractive women and unrealistic gadgets, nor a ""standard"" modern action movie like the Bourne Trilogy. It tells a story that could have happened in the seventies without tons of visual or special effects, without big gunfights or helicopter shots in huge collapsing set pieces. To make it short: You can clearly see that this film is a European production and none made in and by Hollywood. So if you like ambitious stories that may sometimes be somewhat confusing you must watch the film. If you prefer Hollywood-popcorn films don't watch it and be ashamed of yourself.<br/><br/>Christopher K., Jonas P., Mirco K."
"Essex_Rider","10","3","6","4 December 2013"," Requires more than a 30 second attention span
","I loved this adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I think the casting was about as perfect as it was possible to be and the setting of the Circus was grim, forbidding and claustrophobic. Mark Strong's performance as Jim Prideaux was very moving and this movie shows what a versatile and clever actor he is. Gary Oldman was quite simply astonishingly good. he captured the dark brooding thoughtfulness of Smiley to perfection. I really can't say there was an average performance by anyone throughout the entire movie, they all shone, especially Benedict Cumberbatch after Smiley advises him to assume he is being watched. I cannot name the actor who plays the mole in case you have not yet viewed the movie or know its outcome, I'll just say his fall from grace was amazing. <br/><br/>I know some people have complained it's difficult to follow, but the world of espionage is not like the James Bond world, and lets not forget, David Cornwell (AKA John Le CarriÃ©) was actually one of the funny people. He knew the world we never see was populated by intelligent but socially inadequate losers. It is a complex story but I would advise people to watch this movie, then watch it again the next day.<br/><br/>if I could give this 20 out of 10 I would."

Rather the opposite, like putting as much fact as you can in each minute, without thinking it's a film, made for entertaining it's audience.

","This film is deeply disappointing. It may be fair enough to shorten the story for the film but why change strong dialogue in the book into weak dialogue in the film ? Why have all the good actors sitting around staring at each other with nothing or almost nothing to say ? We are told very little about Tinker, tailor etc as characters; in this film they have no reputations.<br/><br/>Almost the only good acting in the movie is a couple of good scenes by Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux. But you could make a pastiche of this movie with a lot of the characters played by shop dummies. Forget this film, just read the book."
"RagingR2","4","3","6","15 April 2012"," No doubt very interesting... but hardly watchable for even an advanced film audience.
","I consider myself to be well above average intelligence and well above average film viewing experience, but I seriously struggled to understand more than just the basic plot (well I got that after reading the plot outline beforehand). If you would have asked me directly after the film ""Give me a summary of what happened there, and who was who and who did what."", I really would have struggled to come up with a sensible answer. <br/><br/>In the end it reminds me a lot of films directed by George Clooney like Syriana. New characters, semi-connected events, snippets from conservations, new locations and different points in time come racing by so fast that it makes your head spin. In hindsight the details of the plot and how everything is connected become (a bit) clearer, and some things made me go ""oh of course, that was connected to this or that"". But because of the rate in which these elements pass by and the seemingly haphazard and minimalistic way in which supposedly logical steps in the plot are portrayed, I really couldn't keep up with it while watching the film.<br/><br/>And much like the film Syriana, this film gives you the feeling that the sense of chaos caused by how intricately complicated things tend to be in a geopolitical/economical setting (Syriana) or an espionage/intelligence setting (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy), seems to be exactly the effect that the film is deliberately trying to achieve in it's viewing experience. Well if their intention was to convey a sense of chaos, congratulations, they succeeded masterfully at that. But that really isn't my definition of a film as a worthwhile viewing experience.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the cast was really impressive, the music and the locations were beautiful and the acting excellent. And I'm really not suggesting that every film has to come in bite-size chunks. But if an intelligent person with an advanced film viewing experience (and I wasn't the only one) is struggling to keep up with the plot, there is definitely something wrong with the film as a 'film', i.e. as an overall viewing experience. <br/><br/>Thoughts that come to my mind are: <br/><br/><ul><li>Wouldn't it have been possible to convey the message or thought that they were trying to convey, with a film with half the number of characters (maximum) that were in this film now? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Could we introduce some sort of warning label for films that have as one of their main goals to convey a sense of the chaos and intricateness of the events and relations that form its setting, so next time I will be able to avoid them? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Or should writers who don't know how to select, compact, trim and condense so to speak, maybe be prevented from trying to make a book into a film?</li></ul><br/><br/>By the way, one might reason that the film might be a easier to follow after one has read the book (which admittedly I didn't), but I have heard from several people that the book is at least as difficult to understand as the film, and what's more, doesn't guarantee at all that the film will be easier to understand then.<br/><br/>Well shoot me for trampling on the impressive achievement that a lot of people seem to think this film is. But as I said, I judge a film by the end results; a film is a viewing experience, intended for viewers; to be viewed, and I suppose also understood by them to a certain point, although apparently I might be mistaken on that last bit. Anyway that's just my opinion, and in the light of the above I really can't give this film more than a 4 out of 10. <br/><br/>If this review makes the blood boil (or worse) of people who loved this film than so be it, but I hope my review will at least serve to warn some other like-minded film viewers before going to see this, just so you know what to expect..."

","To anyone who hasn't seen this: The spoiler in my review is extremely minimal and doesn't really concern you since you should really, really not watch this movie.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, the point I will set out to make with this review is quite simple: style does not make up for substance. Or in this case, a lack thereof.<br/><br/>To put it simply, this is easily the most boring film I have ever sat through. That may seem like a generalization and probably even a bit immature, but I am sorry to say it is entirely true, and if you subject yourself to it I am sure you will agree (that or pretentiously tout it as a masterpiece). The actual film itself is beautiful--the direction and cinematography are top-notch, and the costumes and scenery really set the stage for an intriguing look inside the world of international espionage.<br/><br/>But the rest of the film does not deliver.<br/><br/>Now, before I go on, I should mention a few things. I am not a critic. I am a huge fan of movies and I am not cynical about them; I went into the theatre expecting a good time. I like Gary Oldman and I was genuinely excited to see this movie, but I was sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>To begin, the plot is almost non-existent. The only ""story"" I could derive from the random semblance of endless, plodding scenes was that there was a spy at the top of a British intelligence agency, and then they eventually caught him. And Gary Oldman got his job back, I think. Seriously, that's pretty much it.<br/><br/>The pacing is the real problem though: Constant flashbacks with no indication that it's the past (It may be pandering to show a calendar or some blurry outlines, but you have to tip the audience off somehow), excruciatingly long scenes of dialogue, and pointless cuts to images and shots that the audience has no reason to care about. Why did a poorly rendered, flaming CG owl fly out of the fireplace and get clubbed by a schoolteacher? What point does a scene like that serve? The few jokes and quick shots of gore that are meant to liven up the experience only seem out of place next to long, drawn out scenes of two men staring at each other uncomfortably. There really is nothing interesting going on in this movie. And that is its biggest fault.<br/><br/>Overall I came away feeling very cheated. The acting was good, the direction beautiful and the music was very well done. Really, all the separate parts of this movie are good. Unfortunately a good film really is the sum of its parts and, in this case, it leaves quite a bit to be desired."

","I read ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" some twenty years ago. I don't recall all the details of the book, but I remember it being a beguiling novel (though I think that John Le Carre has written better books, like for instance, its sequel ""The Honourable Schoolboy""). The book is basically about taciturn spy George Smiley being brought back from retirement in order to catch a mole set by his Soviet nemesis, Karla, in the Circus (an alter ego for MI6, the British Intelligence Service). Now comes a film version of the novel, that roughly respects the plot (in 1979, there was a miniseries about the book, starring Alec Guiness as Smiley, which I haven't seen). The recreation of the era (the early 1970s) is fine, but this about the only good thing that I can say about this movie.<br/><br/>First, in this movie, Smiley is performed by Gary Oldman, almost unrecognizable under loads of old age makeup (wouldn't it have made more sense to hire an older actor to play Smiley?).<br/><br/>Second, the movie is at times dull and boring and its tone is ridiculously somber.<br/><br/>Third, almost all the actors here perform languidly, as if they were making a parody of a British gentleman. Now, the cast includes many famous British actors (aside Oldman, we have Colin Firth, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds, and many others that are lesser known). These actors are usually fine performers in other movies, so clearly the filmmakers are at fault here.<br/><br/>Fourth, the movie is virtually impossible to understand if you haven't read the book (understandably so, considering six hours of the miniseries have been compressed to two hours).<br/><br/>Worst of all, the climactic scene when the mole is finally caught (for obvious reasons, I'm not going to say who he is) is, well, totally anticlimactic, to the point where the audience might felt cheated, after all the previous buildup (by the way, it is interesting to see that when the traitor is find, he is initially treated with kids gloves, as if never forgetting that while he might be a Soviet spy, he hasn't stopped being a gentleman. So, in a way, this movie suggests that postwar Britain might have not been very well suited to the ruthless game of international espionage).<br/><br/>So, summing up, a great disappointment, a movie that despite high expectations and high critical acclaim has in my opinion little to recommend for it."

Continuity isn't quite up to scratch either - you don't have to look too hard to spot a traffic calming hump on the road (something that did not get adopted in England until significantly after when this film is set.) Nevertheless, the film is absorbing - if a bit overlong. Somehow the 'tension' doesn't quite build to the strength it ought to and this may be because we see the tale in only one dimension. Smiley's actorly coolness - whilst necessary for the plot is antithetical to the creation of audience excitement.

There was no attempt to bring anything new to the genre, no hint that they might be making some comment about the modern world (or even the Cold War world) or telling us something we didn't know. If you are over thirty (and you're the target audience) you have seen this all before. The roles are not exactly taxing for the actors who get to speak in their usual RADA accents and be as stiffly upper-lipped as possible. <br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty silly (yes, I know it's based on all the Kim Philby type cases but I'm referring to the specific twists and turns of the storyline) and the pace of the action plodding.<br/><br/>It's by no means the worst film ever made, just completely unnecessary and on the whole not entertaining."

","I was sure I was going to enjoy this film, but what a disappointment it was.<br/><br/>The pace is leaden rather than suspenseful, the violence is gratuitous, and the plot is quite inexplicable to anybody who has not read the book. And what the Dickens were they doing turning Peter Guillam into a homosexual? Just what the hell is that all about? And did nobody realise that casting Roger Lloyd-Pack (only known for Trigger in the BBC sit-com ""Only Fools and Horses"") as Mendel was going to blank any credibility of that character? And what were those swimming shots for? (And is there anything more ridiculous than the sight of a man swimming while wearing horn-rimmed spectacles?)<br/><br/>Anybody tempted to watch this rubbish should instead go out and buy the DVD of the BBC serial made in 1979. It will take you longer to watch, but it is more suspenseful, better acted, better directed, better scripted and better paced. Better everything in fact.<br/><br/>And all this Oscar talk..... I'm just baffled. (Just like last year, when another crappy remake (True Grit) got a lot of nominations.) I don't understand it at all."
"cjo1429","2","3","7","16 January 2012"," Wish I knew what happened
","I have a lot of things to say about this movie but will keep to only a few points: <br/><br/>1) It didn't make any sense to me or my friend who I saw the movie with. The dialogue didn't reveal anything outright and instead the characters would reveal important information through their expressions. Though I couldn't understand what was being revealed, you could then tell by the way another character reacted that they both had come to an epiphany. That's great, but please share it next time. Essentially, this movie was almost impossible for someone to decipher who has not either read the book or seen the TV series. (side note: when the big mystery was solved in the end, not one person in a theater of about 100 made a noise. I think all of us were either bored by this point and unconcerned with the outcome or we were simply lost and confused as to how we got to this point - and therefore, unconcerned with the outcome). <br/><br/>2) Even though Gary Oldman portrayed this character well, what a boring character. Just about every scene with him consisted of him staring off, pondering silently. This was even the case when he was having a conversation with someone. When it was his turn to speak, he would wait a good thirty seconds or so before saying two words (that meant nothing to me) and then he would look at the guy very seriously and then we'd cut to another scene. I get that it was a mind-boggling mission that he was on, one that required great thought and concentration, but it was both confusing and boring. <br/><br/>3) The cinematography has been described as being fantastic and though there were some great shots, there were too many attempts at great shots and it was rather distracting. <br/><br/>Lastly, I will say that there was a bright spot in the movie and that was the acting. It's just a shame that the rest of the movie couldn't do it's job around these men."

","I watched this a few days ago and, based on other reviews, was prepared to concentrate, pay attention, and expect to spend stretches of time not knowing what was going on but at the same time realising that things would come together/make sense later on. Perhaps that is what made the difference between me 'getting it' and really enjoying this film, rather than, like many others, feeling underwhelmed, confused, and disappointed. So much so that I came away from the cinema feeling emotionally drained from the moving ending, the complexity of plot, the suspense, and the great acting, etc. I felt very rewarded for having the patience to pay attention and not give up!! This is not everyones type of film, and I think that's part of the problem. I'm not being snobby at all, but some people are just not interested in 'serious' films like this, and some people are.

","I fear that even at over two hours long, it's too short for such a complex story, but has been additionally obscured by extra story lines that have been edited down in the cutting room to mere scenes. Characters with much promise - eg retired Special Branch cop played by Roger Lloyd Pack - have become cutouts. Guilliam is left by his male partner, to his distress, but to absolutely no plot development. That character was specifically hetero in the original - the change is pointless. Told in flashback, but sometimes the only thing that tells you so is that Smiley has different glasses - they even include a short early scene showing him getting new ones to make the point.

"badajoz-1","Null","4","11","6 October 2011"," Boring remake of a boring original - TV movie really
","Le Carre adaptations are usually boring, portentous, critic drooling wastes of time - this one really lives up to form. The worst sin is that it is in cinemas - like other UK films like 'The Kings Speech' and 'Made in Dagenham' they are nice little TV movies that do not require the big screen and all the whoha. I saw the original TV series with Alec Guinness - boring, prosaic, but of its time and therefore understandable, eg The Cold War was still on. But now? Why? What for? To give the next generation of British thesps (at least we did not get Jim Broadbent or Bill Nighy!) a fattish cheque? What was Ciaran Hinds doing in it, except to provide another 'star' to take attention from whether Colin Firth is the mole or not? Yes, it is the old hoary story of whether there is a mole at the highest echelons of British Secret Service, and retired George Smiley (played by Gary Oldman in exactly the same manner as Alec Guinness - fishy eyed and cold) is the man brought in to find the traitor. Of course the even bigger sin of the original was that they gave Alec Guinnes the Best Actor BAFTA instead of Bernard Hill's monumental and iconic portrayal of Yosser 'Gis a job' Hughes!!!!!!!!!!!!! The script suffers because you do not begin to get near the four main suspicious characters - there is little interaction and even less with Smiley. Maybe, I'm wrong but in the original Guiness/Smiley interviewed all four, didn't he? There are gaping plot holes, the direction is so slow I've watched paint drying quicker, and even the introduction of young male eye candy in Tom Hardy does not help. Overblown, of little interest to young cinema-goers (oldies will nod off), and showing a poor representation of 1973 (looks more like 1961!) this film just meanders to a conclusion which you have no idea how Smiley/Oldman worked out the villain, except he had a flash coat and shagged his wife! Oh well, it's conned a lot of us oldies to go and watch. See David Hare's 'Page Eight' for a rip off setting and Ryan Phillippe in a genuine fairly modern Russian spy traitor thriller."

","We went as a group, which included two retired academics (one a Professor), an intellectual woman with several publications to her name, and a medical doctor who is also an academic. None of us could make head or tail of this excruciatingly tedious, too-clever-by-half, pointlessly repetitious dog of a movie. The story is set during the 'Cold War', at a time when paranoia and reciprocal distrust was rampant on both sides of the 'Iron Curtain', for unclear reasons (a paradox which is admirably deconstructed in Hobsbawm's 'Age of Extremes'). It revolves around the squalid world of spies and double agents, whose boring lives are occasionally livened by a murder, or attempted murder, or two. In order to create an exotic background, the scene keeps rotating between London, Budapest and Istanbul which, at the time, may have sounded like destinations on other planets, but are now easily reached in a couple of hours on low-budget flights from Western Europe, and therefore fail to impress. The movie's 'hero' is apparently a secret agent called Smiley, who acts and behaves like a catatonic zombie throughout the over- two-hour-long tedium. It transpires that his wife has been unfaithful to him, yet it would be really surprising if she had stuck to such an unappealing, lifeless individual for more than a couple of years. According to reliable sources, there had been a previous incarnation of Smiley, played by Alec Guinness, who was apparently even more of a zombie. The movie is also marred by a series of flashbacks of unclear significance, some of which are repeated ad nauseam, with the result that the little comprehension one might have achieved is dissipated in the general confusion. Why it should be regarded as brilliant to make cryptic movies which perhaps one percent of cinema goers, if that, may appreciate, remains a mystery. Three cheers for Snow-white and the Seven Dwarfs!

But after 36 minutes of watching people making toast then eating that toast, then walking up some stairs and down some stairs and eating more toast my wife and I got curious about the origins of the Salisbury steak. I don't remember who brought up Salisbury steak or why we got curious about where it came from, but we Googled it and learned that James Salisbury was a 19th century American physician and chemist who advocated for a meat-centered diet to promote health. Dr. Salisbury recommended this recipe for the treatment of digestive problems.
""Eat the muscle pulp of lean beef made into cakes and broiled. This pulp should be as free as possible from connective or glue tissue, fat and cartilage...previous to chopping, the fat, bones, tendons and fasciae should all be cut away, and the lean muscle cut up in pieces an inch or two square. Steaks cut through the centre of the round are the richest and best for this purpose. Beef should be procured from well fatted animals that are from four to six years old.
The pulp should not be pressed too firmly together before broiling, or it will taste livery. Simply press it sufficiently to hold it together. Make the cakes from half an inch to an inch thick. Broil slowly and moderately well over a fire free from blaze and smoke. When cooked, put it on a hot plate and season to taste with butter, pepper, salt; also use either Worcestershire or Halford sauce, mustard, horseradish or lemon juice on the meat if desired. Celery may be moderately used as a relish.""

"dragosu","10","2","4","10 March 2015"," Best spy movie so far
","Well, I know this is an arguable (best spy movie ever hehe). However, I do have some arguments - and of course my totally subjective feelings :)<br/><br/>Seeing the movie, I think this is probably one of the most accurate in terms of how things actually worked back then in the Cold War era. The story is believable - not so say that most likely many similar stories actually did happened.<br/><br/>The atmosphere, the historical conjecture, the music/costumes/decors, the story itself I think give a very good flavor of the times. Also the way the story was structured makes it quite believable and will little by little capture you to the extent you forget to eat the popcorn :). And it is not too ""out there"" - this is something that could actually have happened.<br/><br/>The actors were all well chosen and I think they played their roles magnificently - with the right amount of emotions and the needed subtlety if I may dare say so (they were in the end spies, but also have personal ties with certain people, and were human beings very much aware of what was in play). The way people react, behave or even manipulate others (""I will do my utmost, Ricky"" - Smiley knew the girl was already dead but still needed Ricky) is really in line with the story and the personalities we see. Gary Oldman was really the star in this movie - but honestly all his colleagues did a stellar job as well (even those we hate :)).<br/><br/>I would say this is (unfortunately) a rare pearl that does not follow the classical ""recipe"" for spy movies (more special effects and brawn than brains and atmosphere).<br/><br/>Yes, I would agree there are a few clumsy points in the story (not as many as some say, if you really think about it), but that doesn't change the overall feeling of the movies. IMHO. BTW, I did loved the hint on how Karla decided to attack Smiley - via his wife, which he learned was his Achilles heel while Smiley was trying to turn him.<br/><br/>Also, as a former ""G-man"", I could definitely identify myself with Smiley and his subordinates in some situations - not as an information officer (sorry guys - I'm just a fan of spy movies in this respect), but as a public servant facing the bureaucracy. Those who had such jobs most likely know what I'm talking about :)<br/><br/>If you find the story is not very straightforward, I think it is deliberate - there are clues on the background story, and by the end of the movie it is clear what actually did happened. This is not a Bond movie mind you (well, I do like Bond movies, but they are just not at the same level).<br/><br/>I just hope to be able to change my opinion soon - i.e see an even better spy movie :)<br/><br/>PS To add more context: I'm a 80's kid, and furthermore, I'm from the Eastern Europe - i.e. the former Communist block. So the Cold War is no stranger to me - and this was a reality much more acutely perceived in the former Communist block, for oh so many reasons. This movie brings back memories, but strangely enough makes in a pleasant way PS2 I never believed I would be a fan of a Julio Iglesias song, but here I am now... these movies...

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a best selling novel, turned to an award winning BBC television serial and now a condensed version has been turned to a film with a masterful performance by Gary Oldman at the centre.<br/><br/>The film is effectively a 1970s British noir, a 'whodunit' as veteran spy George Smiley is brought back into the secret service to flush out a Soviet mole. Oldman has to bring a different take on Smiley from Alec Guinness and manages to bring a stillness where you try to figure out what he is thinking inside his head.<br/><br/>Swedish Director Tomas Alfredson brings a stylistic retro view of the past and relies on actors such as Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch to bring out nuggets of their characters as Smiley gets closer to unearth the mole.<br/><br/>The film has its detractors, those who have read the book or viewed the TV series felt short changed as the film had to cut out lot of the material. Karla is unseen and some may view Mrs Smiley being virtually invisible when her behaviour is fundamental to the plot.<br/><br/>However the film has to be seen in its own merits and its a slow, thoughtful and a deceptively good version, finely acted."

A second run through is always good in order to allow an American to pick up the subtle points of the conversation.

From Hurt to Hardy, there is a range of accomplished actors with an appearance from Downton Abbey's Laura Carmichael. The ubiquitous Brendan Cumberbatch is sterling while sporting yet another over-the-top hairpiece. Gary Oldman restores faith in his thespian skills following his Batman roles.

","What a terrible shame. Tinker Tailor looks great on paper; superb acting, brilliant cinematography, authentic feel to the period, all very promising. But the film is simply not good enough. The delivery of the story was shockingly poor and barely watchable. <br/><br/>There were little glimpses of greatness, sure, but it just didn't flow and felt like a big lump of poorly-chewed pie trying to work its way down an overly-narrow throat. As for the characters, I honestly couldn't care less if they lived or died. In fact, the best moment was the end when the overwhelming wave of disappointment came crashing onto the beach of relief. I think 5/10 is quite generous really; that's partly because I'm giving the benefit of doubt to those who have read the book and say that they enjoyed the film (which is often the case I guess) and also that the acting is extremely good in places (which makes it an even greater shame!). <br/><br/>Final bit of advice; if you like this kind of cold-war/communist type stuff then check out 'The Lives of Others'. Yes, it's a slightly different theme, but it brilliantly demonstrates how you can make a slow-burning thoughtful film with excruciating attention to detail of the era BUT still leave the viewer caring for the characters and gripped by the drama."

","In the 1970s, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) comes out of retirement to find the mole in MI-5 British Intelligence, (also known as The Circus), who is upsetting covert operations. Sound easy enough?<br/><br/>The hype over this story was staggering. It is said the story, as presented, is an adult (read Intellectual) version of Ian Flemming and Robert Ludlum spy stories. That sure sounds like Zzzzzzzzz time to me. I just had the feeling I would be looking at frozen facial expressions for long periods of time. The more of those frozen expressions, the more professional critics call it art, intelligent, and thought provoking. Keep in mind these critics only talk among themselves, for themselves in a language only they understand. <br/><br/>Also, we in the audience like to gather clues, but here we had no idea if clues were presented. They probably were but the dialogues were all so low key who knew what a clue was if clue was presented? No one seemed excited about anything so we didn't pay too much attention. Hence, we missed a lot of clues. Who knew?<br/><br/>So here's the thing if you want to enjoy this movie: The mole is someone in the inner circle of the Circus. That is all you really need to know. Everything else is a distraction like a magician who misdirects you. Hey, I didn't give anything away. The problem with knowing where the mole is still doesn't help as we know absolutely nothing about these people. Nothing. So how are we to know about clues when it comes to them? If there was some sort of character development for these people we might have had a chance. Is the mole Tinker, or Tailor or Soldier? OK, so now you know where the title of this comes from. Does that help? No. In the last 20-minutes Smiley puts names to Tinker, Tailor and Soldier. Does that help? No. <br/><br/>For most of us, the most recognizable person within the Circus is Colin Firth as Bill Haydon. Is he the mole? (I honestly hoped he would say at some point: you know, I used to be king -- Little joke here). Perhaps the book told more about the people who made up the Circus, but it didn't happen within this. And, yes, a little humor would have gone a long way to a better entertainment rating. Didn't happen. <br/><br/>This was not entertaining. This was tedious and we kept hoping Smiley would key in on someone to get this over with. The problem was we couldn't read Smiley even a little. How do you read a frozen face? And, it wasn't just him. There were frozen or poker faces all around. And, yes, I was correct. I spent most of this movie watching frozen facial expressions. Not good. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

"Hellmant","7","2","4","26 February 2012"," One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year!
","'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>One of the most well made, as well as slow paced and convoluted films, of the year is this British spy thriller. The film is based on the 1974 novel of the same name by John le Carre about an Ex-British secret service agent named George Smiley and his efforts to find a Soviet double agent. The film stars Gary Oldman (in an Academy Award nominated performance), Colin Firth, Tom Hardy (one of my favorite up and coming actors), Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds and John Hurt. It was written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was directed by Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson (who also directed the popular vampire thriller 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN') and scored perfectly by Alberto Iglesias (in which it also received an Academy Award nomination). On a technical level the movie is near perfect but lacks any true substance or heart to make it a truly great film (that and the fact that it's near impossible to follow).<br/><br/>The film is set in the 1970's during the cold war and begins with a British Intelligence agent named Jim Prideaux (Strong) on assignment in Hungary. After the mission goes horribly wrong the head of the British Intelligence, Control (Hurt), and his right-hand man George Smiley (Oldman) take most of the blame and are forced into early retirement. The true reason the assignment went haywire is due to a Russian agent among the senior officers and Control was on to them (the Hungary mission was actually a plan to identify the mole). Control dies shortly after retirement (due to an ongoing illness) but Smiley is asked to come out of retirement, by a senior officer, and investigate new information discovered by agent Ricky Tarr (Hardy) on the mole. Smiley sees this as an opportunity to clear his name and seek vengeance by bringing the double agent to justice.<br/><br/>Like I said the movie is masterfully made on a technical level, the perfect subtlety of each scene is amazing but the movie is almost too subtle. It takes way too long to get going and is never clear about almost anything. I had to see the movie twice just to fully understand it, paying much more attention to every detail the second time around. I sometimes like to give these kinds of movies credit for demanding a repeat viewing and not spoon-feeding the viewer but there is such a thing as being too vague (as well as being too slow paced). The movie crawls along at an agonizingly dull pace and this is part of the reason the film is too hard to follow; if you're like me your mind will often drift while viewing a movie like this which makes it easy to miss important details thus making it even more frustrating to follow and thus more painfully dull to watch. At least the movie does have a lot to offer in other ways (great acting, beautiful cinematography and a mesmerizing score) but the movie is not involving enough to warrant such craftsmanship. At it's heart it's a routine story with rather dull characters making it yet another example of style over substance (to the fullest extent).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw"

","I understand the need to condense a book down to a time suitable for a movie, and I understand what is meant by ""screenplay adapted from the book by ..."". But some changes make no sense, and in my opinion are an insult to the book author. In TTSS, for example, the Guillam character is portrayed as being gay. But in the book, he is not only heterosexual, but is a renown skirt chaser in the Circus. I do not understand the need for the movie to make this change. It did not matter in the story. Was it done to make it more ""relevant"" to current Hollywood standards? To be more ""PC"". But I thought the movie was excellent. It required paying attention, just as the book did. No insults to our intelligence, no pandering to the teenagers with violence, explosions, car chases. An entertaining movie."

","I desperately wanted to be moved by this film. This is one of the most important pieces of literature in the genre and deserved to be introduced to a newer and younger audience. I was expecting something with shark-like bite, but sat through pickled herring instead. Sadly, it was a colossal failure and in no way measures up to the depth and nuance of the book.<br/><br/>Several key ""actors"" were completely missing from the film; namely WW2, Cold War, Vietnam. The backdrop of the film was completely missing. Without somehow acquainting the audience with the wartime experiences of the characters, they appeared to be drawn from the cast of Glengarry Glenross. These were supposed to have been men and women who had a close acquaintance with death, both through the war and on into the Cold War. Where was the gripping tension of the East West nuclear scrum? Why wasn't the spectre of Vietnam even alluded to? Unfortunately, Gary Oldham is completely miscast here. Smiley is an intellectual turned loose in the fields of war, not a social studies teacher. He trained and ran agents, got shot at, killed people, played the great game, charmed a debutante. The Smiley we got was so retiring that he retired from view.<br/><br/>The biggest shame was not using flash backs to fill in the blanks. So much of this story is understated, with the expectation that the audience is acquainted with Eritish school boy life, the British caste system, military life, de-colonialization, Cold War politics, Cambridge life in the 30's. Somehow those missing pieces had to be brought out. Also, the long and bleak intro just did not make any sense. The frequent cutaways to the trainyard with voice over was completely pointless. Yes, there were trains in 60's London, just as there are today. So what.<br/><br/>I can understand the author's keenness to be involved in the project in order to acquaint a new audience with one of his masterworks. I am sure, deep in his secret heart, Alec Guinness prowls the streets of London with a copy of Grimmelshausen tucked under his arm, his umbrella at the ready as he ruminates on the perils of a Secret Service which couldn't keep it's secrets. Please rent or watch the BBC series to really get a sense of the true depth of this masterwork."

","I watched 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' after discovering Gary Oldman had been nominated for Best Actor in the Oscar nominations. After watching the film I feel a bit disappointed that it was him who received this acknowledgment.<br/><br/>The film itself is very good and I would highly recommend it. However, it is one of those 'blink and you'll miss a crucial moment' films where your attention is needed for its entire duration. The investigative theme of the film is carried out right to the end and you can easily miss one part and be confused instantly. <br/><br/>The performances in this film were all good, there is no actor in this film who I would say performed poorly. The supporting roles of actors like Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch were extremely powerful and after watching this film I'm disappointed their performances were left out of the Oscar nominations as I believe they were far more emotive in their parts than Gary Oldman. <br/><br/>Oldman's performance is good, it's difficult because he is playing a man of few words and a man who doesn't convey his emotions. This makes his presence in the film not as powerful as others. I think he has played this character well as Smiley is supposed to be a man of few words but unlike other characters in this film, you don't feel too much for him. The only part, probably his best scene in the film, is when he discovers his wife is cheating on him. You then feel terribly sympathetic for Smiley, but this is the only instance.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy also gives a good performance showing a wide range of emotions and generating sympathy within the viewer on regular occasions throughout the film. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is great, it's a great story and the performances are excellent. I cannot find any weak link that puts me off the film. I would warn you however that you have to pay attention all the time, it's not one of those films you can really relax to?"

","""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"" is an old-fashioned but solid and well made spy thriller. This is more in the vain of movies like ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", ""The Odessa Files"" etc.<br/><br/>I was thinking of any movies I've seen in recent years which would be in the same category and what came to mind was ""The Good Sheppard"" (Robert De Niro's solid directorial effort) and even ""The Constant Gardener"".<br/><br/>It boasts an all star cast comprising of such notables as Colin Firth, Toby Jones, John Hurt, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hinds with a singularly brilliant and astonishing performance by Garry Oldman (even those tightwads over at the Oscars seem to agree since they nominated him for a Best Actor award). If there is any justice left in the world...Garry Oldman should hands down win the statuette for Best Actor! <br/><br/>For those looking for an action packed flick, this is not it, no James Bond or Salt to be found here. While I enjoy the Bourne movies, this is not it either. On the other hand, if you want an intelligent film which asks its audiences to pay attention to, and participate in the story, not only on a visceral and emotional level, but also a mental and intellectual one, I would recommend ""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"" to you."

","Maybe it's because I'm a part-Swedish native English speaker--or maybe Tomas Alfredson's Nordically glacial and dull TTSS-2011 misses the mark on a more straightforward level, but Alfredson's cluelessness of the subtleties and entendres of spoken English weigh especially heavy on this film.<br/><br/>TTSS is a decidedly British period piece whodunit with a labyrinthine back story and subtext. In order to enjoy and admire such a work (and be interested in each character), the English dialogue and included idiom and colloquialisms *ARE CENTRAL* to the film as plot points and character raison d'etre. The most important and satisfying elements of the piece lie in its character's use of British vernacular and slang (some Brit spy stuff included), and its dialectical delivery.<br/><br/>Le Carre(Novel) and Hopcraft/Irvin (BBC version) got it right, but it's all missing as O'Connor/Straughan, the writers, and the forgivably Swedish Alfredson have ""thrown out the baby with the bathwater"" in condensing this work to a 127 minute film. None of the characters appear to have much to say at all, with the vacuous staring going on, but when they do speak, we get a foreshortened and 2 dimensional view of their motives and place in the plot; As dull and plodding as a real British spy's life could be in the '70s cold war, we need to be interested and entertained by the peculiarities and persona of each character in a film, and with the exception of the fine performance by Tom Hardy, as Ricki Tarr, most of the cast play as gray and flat as the film comes off in whole.<br/><br/>I LOVED the book & '79 BBC version, and lived in London in 1973, so this film should have impressed and satisfied, as much as I would have liked it too upon hearing of the upcoming release in early 2011 - Only it didn't...Other reviewers have praised and extolled the direction, the script, the acting, the musical score, and the photography; And I certainly respect the actors' work in this most subtle and (on the surface) potentially confusing story.

","I've always been a fan of John le Carre's novels. I was thrilled to here that one of my favourite novels had been made into a movie, but until this week it didn't look like I was going to be able to get a chance to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>John le Carre's novels are an intimate look at the day to day work of a spy during the cold war era. Not James Bond, who all the villains know, but real spys. This has no absurd escapes like one would see in the Bourne Identity and no major shot outs like the A team. Its not an action film, its a spy story. <br/><br/>The basis of the story is that control believed that there was a mole in the British secret service and wanted to find out who it was. The speculation was that some one in a position of power in the circus was a soviet agent. The phrase trust no one really is apt in this film. George Smiley, a character who never seems to smile, is asked to come out of retirement and spy on his colleague in order to figure out who is the enemy spy hiding in the British secret service.<br/><br/>Its not an easy film to watch. The film has a grainy quality that gives it the look of a film from the 70's. The flash backs can get confusing and George Smiley spends a lot of time just thinking. <br/><br/>From what what I recall, the book is not an easy book to follow either. But once you are immersed in this world of paranoia and betrayal and intrigue, its very enjoyable. My 12 year old son also enjoyed it. If you like films about intrigue and puzzles, this is the film for you I truly wish they would make more films like this."

","Gary Oldman delivers the most masterful performance of his career in 2012's first five star film. With a body of work that has centred around loud, extroverted and often vicious characters – Sid and Nancy, The Firm, State of Grace, True Romance, Leon the Professional, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – Oldman goes against type with his portrayal of old-school spy George Smiley; he's all subtle looks and measured body language, barely raising his voice and getting a hair out of place. Although undeniably his show, Oldman is not alone; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Ciaran Hinds and John Hurt round out the cast to die for, each and every one of them filling their roles with intrigue and complexity. Behind the camera, Swede Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) brings his meticulous eye for detail and slow-burning shooting style to the proceedings, lending this espionage tale immense gravitas. To cap it all off, and ensure the movie's place in the highest echelon of cinema, the score by Alberto Iglesias is fantastically atmospheric and the soft-lensed cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is outstanding. Tinker Tailor is utterly absorbing and entirely classy – for those who enjoy intelligent thrillers it's near-on perfect."

It is a suspense movie, which does not have CGI or explosions with every camera frame. Sometimes with suspense movies, the director or producer, or casters, will hire one or two big actors, and you can immediately, within the first half hour (depending on the movie, sometimes sooner) , know already who the 'bad guy' is.

"thierrybrewer","6","2","4","17 January 2012"," I feel cheated
","I just came out from seeing the premiere in France. Don't get me wrong, the movie had its qualities. It was original, with incredible acting, and had a genuine feel to it. By reading all the other reviews, genuine is clearly the most used word to describe this film. As all the reviewers pointed out, this isn't a bond film, so I wasn't expecting any action. But what I was expecting was a great thriller, filled with suspense. The problem is that I didn't know how genuine and how close to reality this movie really was. What deceived me the most was the trailer.<br/><br/>In the trailer, they sum up every bit of action and suspense this film has or has not (I will get to the ""has not"" part in just a sec). Add to these seemingly gripping scenes one of the most suspenseful soundtracks ever, and you give yourself a certain image of what this film is about. The way they edited the scenes in the trailer, I felt like this would be the most suspenseful spy movie ever made. It looked like everybody was plotting against each other, that nobody really trusted each other, and that all the characters were paranoid, thus spying on each other. So no, I wasn't expecting any action. But yes, I was expecting suspense, paranoia, some back-stabbing, twists and turns, and a shocking finale. I didn't get any of these. I feel cheated. <br/><br/>The trailer lied to me. It gave me great expectations that just weren't met. The guys who made the trailer used clever editing to make this movie seem to be something that it's not. The scenes they used seem gripping, but they really aren't. For example, the scene where you see Hardy's character in a car with a girl looks like a car chase. Well it's not. They're just randomly driving in a port. In the scene where the elevator opens as Toby is putting on his gloves, Peter appears behind him and you get the feeling it was to kill him. Well it isn't. He just gives him a ride so that Smiley can talk to him. In the scene where Mark Strong's character looks through the scope of his rifle, it looks like he is about to kill one of main characters. Well he does, but only at the very end, after the latter is arrested for being the mole, and was going to die anyways. So it doesn't affect the plot in any way. Even the soundtrack had nothing to do with the movie.<br/><br/>One can argue that this movie was meant to be genuine, and close to reality. But how close to reality can a SPY movie be without being boring? People face reality every day of their lives. And when we go to the movies, it is to be entertained, or enjoy a masterpiece, a work of art. Not to be bored to death. And I don't necessarily need an action packed movie to be entertained. I'm not condemning all ""close to reality"" movies. I really enjoyed ""The Descendants"". I'm just saying that if you're going to make a spy movie, make a damn spy movie! This movie was boring, I didn't care for any of the characters, it didn't have any suspense, you pretty much trust everybody from the start except for TINKER, TAILOR and SOLDIER, and the whole movie built up to a lame finale. The only scene where I was on the edge of my seat was the scene where peter steals the file. I was like ""omg, omg, what's going to happen?"". Well guess what happened: absolutely NOTHING. And in the finale, when the mole tries to explain why he switched sides, he just says ""It was a question of moral. The western world has become so ugly. Don't you think?"". Not only does his explanation feel weak and vague, but he also asks Smiley for his opinion, showing that he isn't even certain of what he is saying.<br/><br/>Finally, what I'm saying is that this movie has a great cast that gives great performances, has a genuine feel to it, but is nothing like the trailer depicts it to be, and is actually quite boring. And I don't agree with those who say that it's a piece of art, or that you need to be intelligent to appreciate it. You don't need a brain to understand this movie. There's nothing surprising about it, no hidden message, nothing is left to interpretation. It's all pretty simple, and all pretty dull.<br/><br/>I gave it 6 out of 10 for its great acting. Otherwise I would have given it considerably less."
"ghost_dog86","8","2","4","15 January 2012"," Pay Attention!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland <br/><br/>This is as much of an action movie as a film about the Cold War could be. Directed in interlinking fashion (with a very dense story-arc) by Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) and using one of the most well adapted screenplays of 2011 from a rather heavy novel from John le Carre (and also a 1979 British TV mini-series), ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is one of the more well orchestrated mystery/crime/spy drama's to come out of Britain in recent years. Containing a who's who of critically acclaimed English actors (maybe the British response to ""New Year's Eve""); including Mark Strong (Kick-Ass), John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Midnight Express), Toby Jones (My Week With Marilyn), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Tom Hardy (Warrior) and Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight), this is a film that while well constructed, well acted and should win some kind of award for cinematography and set design (every nuance of this film reeks of 1970's Britain), may work more to confuse and turn off American audiences who are used to films with ""Spy"" in the title being drenched with high flying stunts, slickly choreographed shootouts and Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>Synopsis: The plot of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is very elaborate, so I am going to attempt to write a decipherable synopsis without confusing too many people or confusing myself. Set in the Cold War of the 1970's, the story centers around an old and weathered British Operative named George Smiley (Oldman), who upon the death of the head of British Intelligence, is forced to retire. When a hired Hit-man, by the name of Rickey Tarr (Hardy), brings it to the attention of the British Intelligence that a mole is thought to be working within the system and is undeniably a high ranking operative, Smiley is brought back to conduct a sort of internal investigation and flush out said mole. Like any well done who-done-it, this film effortlessly leads audiences through a veritable maze of a tension driven plot (like a subdued British game of Clue), only showing the viewer just enough to suspect to wrong person until the very end. And the final twist does work and is very much worth sitting through storytelling that is not only complex but also nonlinear (which will be the complaint by most who find fault with the movie). Suffice to say, there is no way anybody is going to understand every nuance, plot point or British slang code word in this film after seeing it just once, but that doesn't mean ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" doesn't have a quiet entertainment value, which will sneak up on you (if you like who-done-it espionage films that is). <br/><br/>Excellent performances: And my new found love affair with Tom Hardy's acting style continues, after seeing him in ""Bronson"", ""Inception"" then ""Warrior"", as he is excellent in his bit but very pivotal role in this film (and is sure to be bad-ass as Bane in the upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises""). Another performance of note comes from the ever brilliant but at times overlooked Toby Jones , who should not be looked over this time for his subtle and very smug supporting role as the Scot, Percy Allelne. But, as I said before, every actor does some fairly upstanding work here. The fact that Oldman is being lifted up so highly for his performance as Smiley this awards season is something of a mixed bag of emotions for me, because while he does do a respectable job as the protagonist here, he is pretty much really good in everything he does. His chameleon-like ability to become immersed in a plethora of roles, be it Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series or Lt. Jim Gordon in ""The Dark Knight"" or even as Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" is magnificent, but in the end it is not his performance in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" that I didn't find award worthy, it is his character. Despite what many other critics may say, Oldman wasn't memorable here, plain and simple, hence not award worthy. <br/><br/>Final Thought: Filled with superb performances, although none are worthy of an Oscar nomination, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is an elaborate and very well constructed spy thriller, even with the lack of countless shootouts or highly James Bond-esque choreographed chases. To say this is more along the lines of a British (uber-complicated) ""The Usual Suspects"" would be a more accurate assessment. But viewer beware even though I enjoyed this picture, ""Tinker Tailor Solder Spy"" is a movie which will make one work for their entertainment. You have to pay attention for the entirety of the 127 minute runtime!

"caiged","7","2","4","4 January 2012"," A good solid old fashioned spy story
","I'd been waiting forever for the movie to be released and for the most part it was worth the wait. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been handled very well- for one thing it's so much easier to follow than John Le Carre's novel (but Le Carre fans might disagree).<br/><br/>The first plus point is the plot, which focuses solely on locating a traitor at the top of British secret intelligence, which is known as the Circus. It's very hard to pinpoint, from the viewer's point of view, who the traitor is as we never see any of the main characters engaging in suspicious activity right until the very end and for that it's worth the wait. The acting is another plus, with Marc Strong, Toby Jones and Gary Oldman putting in some strong performances.<br/><br/>The downsides are few but worth noting. It's very important not to lose focus of the story because there are times when the plot deviates and it can be distracting and confusing. Also, if you've read the book it makes following the story easier and also the characters because the familiarity will allow you to over come the slowness of the pacing, which in itself is bit of a negative point. For me, colin firth spoiled the casting as I didn't think he offered much to the movie or towards his character. But then again I dislike firth intensely so that's just a bit of biased opinion. I've also seen the original series that starred Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley and I preferred Guinness's Smiley to Oldman's. Gary Oldman felt too stiff, too reserved for me to truly enjoy his performance.<br/><br/>However, all that aside, this is a good movie to watch which sets itself apart from the latest Bond action fueled rubbish. Not all cloak and dagger movies need a requisite car chase or an exploding building to be considered quality. This is a definite recommend to all espionage fans."
"redjackco","7","2","4","1 January 2012"," A Disappointment
","For those who have not read the book or seen earlier versions of the story (like me), I'm sure this film will be a big disappointment. It certainly was for me and for many others in the mostly senior citizen audience in the near-packed theater in Palo Alto I attended, judging from the remarks I overheard afterwards. <br/><br/>The problem is the nonlinear story and the lack of firm definition of all the characters. They are recognizable by face but not by name. Which one is Alleline, Esterhase, Bland, Haydon? We get them by the end, but during the film one wonders who is whom and what's with all these other people? And later, how does Ricki Tarr fit in? And perhaps most of all, how does Prideaux survive his wounds after we saw his body lying in a reservoir-sized pool of blood?<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed and generally sparingly acted, technically it's wonderful. But if the story is confusing to most of the audience — my two companions, one 40 and the other 86, had to ask me what went on — then I can only classify it as a failure."
"jadepietro","6","2","4","29 December 2011"," Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>The spy game ain't what it used to be. That's apparent when one compares the recent arrival of two films of espionage this holiday season. The differences are quite startling. The first offering is Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, a retro look at the spy industry and the Cold War mentality during the 1970's. ( The second entry is Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol, but more on that film next week. ) <br/><br/>Trying to condense John le Carré 1974 British spy novel can be a formidable task, almost as daunting as finding a mole within the hierarchy of agents. Once an award winning seven part miniseries starring Alec Guinness in the lead role of George Smiley, TTSS now stars Gary Oldman as that super spy sleuth. Obviously, this film adaptation is shorter in length. It also sacrifices some important exposition, character motivation, and plot development in the process of revision.<br/><br/>The plot, for those who don't know the original source, involves a double agent working secretively in British Intelligence. Control ( John Hurt ), the head of the organization, has narrowed down and code-named the list of suspects to include: Percy Alleline ( Tinker, played by Toby Jones ), Bill Haydon ( Tailor, a well cast Colin Firth ), Roy Bland ( Tailor, Ciarán Hinds in this role ), and Smiley himself ( Spy ). Also possibly on the list is Toby Esterhase ( David Dencik ). First Contol sends Jim Prideaux ( Mark Strong ) on the mission to track down the true identity of the mole ( if he chooses to accept the mission, which he does ). Things go terribly awry and soon George Smiley is heading the investigation.<br/><br/>Oldman makes an effective Smiley, a man betrayed and unable to trust others within the organization. He is remote and cold, a bit of an enigma himself. Behind his wide frame glasses, Smiley remains a detached observer of the behavior swirling around him. The actor shows off this side of the man extremely well. But as it is written here, Oldman fails to bring out the insecurities and eccentricities of the main character. There is solid support by the aforementioned Firth, Dencik, and Strong, plus Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy as the younger breed of undercover agent. But some of the other supporting characters are given short rift and their lack of sufficient screen time hinders the compelling mystery. Ably directed by Tomas Alfredson, the film's structure and editing needlessly jumps forward and back in time, adding more confusion to an already dense plot. Though the mystery is finally resolved by the end, the moviegoer's journey to discover the culprit becomes harried and exhausting. Yes, the conclusion makes logical sense, but the film's lackadaisical pacing is all too tedious and conventional with the film's episodic format, undercutting any real impact.<br/><br/>By far, the high point of TTSS is the fine period details in its costuming by Jacqueline Durran and the production design by Maria Djurkovic. Female secretaries, fashionably dressed, decode cryptic numerical messages as they listen to wiretapped conversations on large tape recorders, furiously pounding the keyboards on their then state-of-the art typewriters. Alfredson relishes the dated images as he creates a non-computerized world that never fails to fascinate in its atmospheric surroundings. ( A nice touch is the chessboard inspired boardroom at Intelligence headquarters. ) The director also films much of the action, or really the non-action, with distant shots ( ala Hitchcock's Rear Window ), or through grungy windows and narrow corridors to establish the paranoia of the times. The look of the film is so bloody good to watch!<br/><br/>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is just too convoluted for its own bloody good to thoroughly enjoy! GRADE: B-<br/><br/>NOTE: The movie poster, with its clever mix of numbers and words, is one of the strongest thematic designs this year. As Oldman adjusts his spectacles for a closer look, the viewer is drawn into his stare. As we take a closer look, we can notice the changing hues of text that define his character and have hidden clues to the film itself. Just brilliant!<br/><br/>NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com"

","I came to Tinker Tailor cold - I had not seen the BBC series or read the book. I had read a couple of reviews, mind you, so I knew what a terrific movie it was, they had told me so. And it did have the cream of British acting in it, after all. <br/><br/>I'm not convinced. <br/><br/>Let me say, to start off with, that I'm not going to attempt a synopsis other than to say that there is a mole in the British Secret Service and it falls to George Smiley to find out who it is. There is more plot here than in half a dozen other films and, frankly, I found Inception easier to follow by a wide margin. Nobody can be trusted, anything anyone says might be a lie, and you can't even rely on people being dead (or, when you can, you think you can't because it might not be immediately clear that what you are watching might be a flashback). It is, to say the least, a challenging experience, and I am still not 100% sure that I understood who was on who's side or why..<br/><br/>It is beautifully photographed, in shades of middle class, middle aged, non-swinging 60s urban European winter.<br/><br/>I once did some amateur dramatic acting under the guiding eye of an actor with a long and successful career in character work (which included a Star Wars and a couple of Indiana Jones movies), and he said that actors learn to make the most of their pauses. That is certainly the case here: this is some of the most pause-laden acting ever to grace a mainstream feature. I don't say that this is necessarily a bad thing, but the very... measured... delivery is quite noticeable. There is little sense of urgency.<br/><br/>As for Gary Oldman? I love Gary Oldman's work: he is always a class act, fully committed, even in those of his films which have been least credible (koff Lost In Space, Fifth Element koff). Yet, oddly, in Tinker Tailor - despite the critical plaudits which have landed on him - I never felt that his accent sounded natural. He fully inhabited George Smiley in all other respects, but the accent never rang true for me.<br/><br/>This is, indeed, a good film, but I didn't feel it was as very good as advance word had led me to expect."

","This is a very boring film. Seriously, although I enjoy it, it has a deep grey tone to it that is not shaken off at any point.

The acting is very believable. The serious nature of circumstances eventually becomes weighty and of interest. This film is played very straight, and I admire it for that. I also admire its lack of flair, in these times of visual and thematic extravagance.<br/><br/>Many viewers will get bored and switch off, and that is very understandable. But if you manage to get half way through, and still feel engrossed, then this film may well prove to be a gem for you. If you find that you enjoyed it, repeat viewings are essential. I would argue that this film improves with at least three or four."

","At the beginning, British agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is sent to Budapest to speak with a Hungarian general who wants to defect to the West. The general also knows the name of the mole that infests the British Secret Service (known as ""The Circus""). As the arrangement was a Soviet set-up, it goes badly with Prideaux being shot. Because of the disaster, agents ""Control"" (John Hurt) and ""Beggerman"" (George Smiley = Gary Oldman) are dismissed from service.<br/><br/>Out of retirement, Smiley is given an independent assignment to ferret out the mole in the Circus. The top men there are Smiley and Control's successors: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) as the new chief, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) as the deputy, and Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) as the two lieutenants.<br/><br/>Smiley picks Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Mendel (Roger Lloyd Pack) to assist him. Smiley is not the dashing James Bond type of spy with the fast cars, the sexy girls, and the quick gun. On the contrary, he wears eyeglasses, speaks softly, and walks slowly. Smiley is contained and cool, and cunning and brilliant. He absorbs information like a dry sponge on a puddle of water. He rarely raises his voice, and he does so after he has trapped the culprit at the end: ""What are you then . . .""<br/><br/>To complicate matters in a fairly complicated movie, there are sub-stories, like Smiley's wife Ann leaving him. There is another story, with Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) who works for Guillam. Tarr has an affair with pretty blonde Soviet agent Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whom he met in Istanbul. She wants to defect, but the mole tells the Russians, who capture her. Tarr wants her back.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the top four at The Circus, Smiley's successors, have formed a secret organization known as ""Witchcraft"" unknown to Smiley. Witchcraft was created to obtain sensitive information from the Soviets in the name of Polyakov (Konstantin Khabensky). In reality, Polyakov is playing a game as he is a Soviet spy, not really a double agent, who works for the USSR! He obtains good information, while providing little (as Smiley says, ""glitter amongst the chicken feed""). What the United States tell the Circus, will be told to the Kremlin.<br/><br/>Smiley is surprised to learn that Prideaux is back in England teaching a class in school. He lives in a trailer. The Soviets actually returned him after getting all they could out of him.<br/><br/>Control creates a list of mole suspects with code names<br/><br/>""Tinker"" - Percy Alleline
""Tailor"" - Bill Haydon
""Soldier"" - Roy Bland
""Poor Man"" - Toby Esterhase
""Beggarman"" - Smiley (not really a suspect)<br/><br/>Smiley finds out that Toby is a messenger to the others, who are leakers in one way or another. He forces Toby, who may have been duped, to provide Polyakov's Paris safe house address. There a meeting is taking place with Polyakov and the mole. It is Haydon. After being captured by Smiley, Haydon is being held in detention to be exchanged for another. But Prideaux finds out and shoots him with a high-powered rifle. Meanwhile, Ann has returned to Smiley. The last scene shows Smiley heading to work: he is now the new ""Control"" and awaits his new team.<br/><br/>In keeping with the spirit of the times of the Cold War, England is sufficiently chilly and gray throughout. The movie is complicated with many characters, but they are all good actors. The film is based upon the espionage novel by British author John le Carré. He has a cameo: You will catch of glimpse of him at the Soviet Embassy's Christmas celebration singing a patriotic song."

","I wouldn't recommend reading all John Le Carre's books - they can be a bit same-y - but 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', about the uncovering of a mole within the British intelligence services, is a perfectly judged thriller, a spy-cum-detective story set against the backdrop of perceived national decline. The book was also the basis of one of the greatest television series of all time, perhaps owing to the fact that this is an ensemble story, allowing a collection of some of the finest British character actors of their generation to play off each other. Alec Guinness's portrayal of retired secret agent George Smiley is widely considered to have been his finest role; but arguably, Ian Richardson and Michael Aldridge also gave us their best stuff in this series. So one attraction of a remake, this time as a movie, is that it gives another generation of actors the chance to shine. But one question is, what can the film add to what the book and television series have already done? And while the movie doesn't butcher the source material, I fear the answer is not much. Of course, it's hard for a fan of the earlier work to watch with neutral eyes. Where the casting seems consistent with that used previously (John Hurt as Control, for example) everything feels fine; where not (Kathy Burke as Connie) it just feels wrong. More objectively, one can say that the inevitably more compressed format loses retains the mood of the original but loses the broader focus on the whole range of protagonists; when the mole is finally revealed, we care less because we know less about him. One can also note that in places the script departs from the book unnecessarily, but with the effect of losing subtlety and also plausibility: there's no reason for Irina to be shot in front of Prideaux, for Smiley to catch his wife in flagrante, or indeed, for Smiley to take a gun to his meeting with the mole, except to ram home a point that was better left implied. The soundtrack is also peculiarly deployed and contrasts with the unbeatable opening music and introductory credits of its predecessor. This doesn't make this a bad film; but if you watch just one version, pick the other one."

It is dimly lit and everything is brown and shades of rust. It drags along at a pace that is cumbersome and confusing at times, and is as stale as a stakeout. <br/><br/>That is the point, you either climb aboard for the slow-ride and be intellectualized by its layers of Plots and Subplots, vague explanations and cluttered conversations, or not. If not you are likely to throw up your hands and give up, if so, you may be seduced by its subtle cleverness and wish for more.

","This film was good, and really helped to paint a picture of cold war england, but the movie represents what it is about, its a cold war, not a hot one, so if your expecting action or anything else than some stern faces walking around for two hours then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>This film is essentially Gary Oldman trying to find who the 'mole' is in the 'circus', who were one of the main sources of secret information in the Cold War, however although I am a huge fan of Oldman, watching him walk around for hours wasn't exactly what I would call amazing acting, but he certainly did play his character well, and he really did carry the film, albeit slowly and without any real emotion, without him the film would have been nothing. <br/><br/>I also felt that part of the reason this film never seemed to 'pick up' so to speak is the idea that event the music was kind of this constant drone, and it was like the beginning to some god awful American TV sitcom from the 60's, it did give the film that sense of the situation being mundane, where other films about this period would make more exciting. But thats what this film did, it was never that boring, and was never that exciting even when the thrilling conclusion was coming into fruition.<br/><br/>One flaw that I kind of found was that the character 'Tailor' is outlined on the front cover to be the mole, which is kind of annoying, as before the film even started you know who the character was who was the 'mole'. The films acting was generally fair, although for me there were no real, breakthrough performances, which was weird, considering the all star cast that this film had.<br/><br/>The perspective was also a little confusing at times, and I often had no idea were I was in time or space in the story, as well as parts like the end with the death of 'Tailor' being a little anti climactic, and should have been a little more emphasised.<br/><br/>This film is a good representation of Cold War England, but lacks any real breakthroughs on any level, and is merely a snapshot and so your left with many unanswered questions."

","The film has great photography and great understated acting. However, it's hard to follow the large number of characters and fairly complex plot. There's not very much talking, most of the important plot points are introduced visually so you really have to be paying attention to follow what's happening. Also, most of the characters look quite a bit alike: middle-aged white guys in conservative Savile Row suits. From the long shots, it's hard to tell them apart; when you get a shot of someone hacked up and bloody it's hard to tell who it is. I recommend reading the book first, or watching it on DVD while taking notes, because the film is very enjoyable once the plot is clear.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws it is worth watching the film a couple of times if you want to get a real feel for secret service work in the cold war"

","In a deleted scene on the DVD, Smiley fries one egg sunny side up, not scrambled (a la Bond?); crass rock music playing loud. Is it from another apt? After about 30 seconds he lowers the volume a touch and begins frying. He then sits and eats.Tinker Tailor is a visually delicious meal somewhat unusual for England which still eats as though they're soldiers bivouacking; conquering cowboys. <br/><br/>Art on the edge of a bayonet, in England, the terminus of pure masculinity, the current world expression of the Domination Reality, the 'Matrix'. They 'invented' capitalism, our God. The bad God that dreams of humans becoming absolute machines, proving the system's prime thesis that we are an island apart (the inner fear all humans have long had as the lurking Bogey Man in all our philosophies). <br/><br/>Europe (white people) epitomises our only credo: domination by the masculine principle; logical thought only—no marriage with the feminine and subsequent offspring, synergy.<br/><br/>This rule by logic-only, excluding thought's feminine, the illogical, irrational, and definitely excluding the breakthroughs, the synergies, is played out in le Carre''s basic 101 on politics. The hidden part of thinking, lying, works because no one has or uses intuition. Spying is the world created by the artificial layer of lying or secrets; the best we can do with our truncation. It's easy to have this 'black curtain' world—civilization is a perfect straight man this Abbot and Costello, our comedy act. This same approach in finance can create excessive derivatives, visible and not, as we found out in 2007.<br/><br/>le Carre'loves to play with these mechanics in all his books, esp the Smiley Trilogy. Our hero has to decipher the layer creation here involving the double agent. 'Flipping' is the lingua franca in an inductive watery environment. Knowing is up for grabs with verification and trust on shaky ground; having no stability, like an incomplete electron ring. Intuition can't be used because it has been expunged from the system. Looking for lost car keys only under the street light because it's the only place they could be seen, science only works where it works; in fact a very small life raft in the ocean. How can we know the truth? We have to simulate it with checks and balances, eg loyalty, redundancies, tests, et al, which at best are inconclusive. We have to 'hope'.<br/><br/>The double, or mole, has to exploit these jury-rigged methods. Triples, quadruples (double doubles) likewise. We're talking some fun here (for those who enjoy this type of thing). Even the trilogy books don't get all over this stuff enough, but there's a lot more than in either the '79 BBC 6 hr or this one. It's a matter of analysing inductive data deductively, without blinking. Smiley's our master here. He's a personality type rarely seen on screen because he's so internal and not obviously noticeable. But it's this personality that's optimum for dealing with the world underneath; a Prince of Darkness, Batman character. le Carre'gets into it, but more as an observer (he models Smiley after his father). He's trying to apprehend how a Smiley would function. Oldman, same as le Carre', is faking it with exaggerated stillness and intimated 'mysterious aura' substituted for the real thing; Guinness was closer, being more this type in life.<br/><br/>So rare to find examples; try, Elliot Gould in ""The Long Goodbye"" and real life, or Gabriel Byrne in ""In Treatment"" )tv), close, like Guinness. Instead of having power over others, which Oldman seems to have; better would be others yielding to Smiley's vacuum, they co-opt themselves. Smiley, like a therapist, logs all they exhibit or imply and presents it to the one focus; how does it fit with the mole probe. Smiley 'seduces' others act and in so doing see the larger gestalt that it comes from, goes to. This is felt more than thought. Smiley is emotion first, thoughts and feelings always being paired. Emotionless seeming on the outside, he's mostly emotions inside, with incredible refining intellect sandwiching the data inbetween. A giant chewing jaw, God's stomach digesting. Any real question answers itself and Smiley is that process. He enjoys the meal with great pleasure. This ability to see the beginnings and endings of a given piece of data is visioning. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a vision is a thousand pictures. Like Merlin he just has to keep from being imprisoned in stone by unrequited love, the lovely Ann. It's love of humanity, after all, that drives this process and it's here, in Smiley's core that he can be susceptible, can doubt. The genius Karla read this in the India interrogation and instructed Hayden. Beautifully crafted by le Carre', however he came on to it. The sign of artists making theatrics are these intuitive finds—all the great movies have these unintended illogicals. Their passion leads them; we all have all in us to some degree, they see beyond the convention. Holism's a beautiful element in our boilerplate metaphysics.<br/><br/>With Smiley becoming head of the Circus at the end, Karla is next to fall and a sequel is signaled at the end.<br/><br/>Great set design and atmosphere throughout. Fabulous UK actors old and young, with Tom Hardy, the new Steve McQueen (who can act) and Stephen Graham set to take off if not already.<br/><br/>Being an adaptation, the film gives up being anything else, alas. Adaptations, which are a kind of sequel because they sacrifice all for reduction, must add something categorically new or they are a subtraction. The Godfather and French Connection II's are the few examples. Sequelling has been held hostage by the business of film. Contrary to propaganda, capitalism, Domination Reality here, does not spur innovation."

","You know. When you are dealing with a complex writer like LeCarre, you are going to get a complex movie. Unfortunately, to the casual viewer, there's an awful lot that is going on that is grounded in the long dark past. While the story of the search for a mole in the network is a valid pivot point, there are so many intricacies that you are left to guess. Perhaps I am not that bright, but I need a bit more. I guess the question is, do I need a George Smiley playbook or a stack of books to follow this film. If that's the case, how many people can appreciate this? The time period in issue is really in the fairly distant past. I have to agree that so much of what we see is really dumbed down, but when the plots are so slowly developed and depend on so much inside stuff, even the astute viewer is left in the lurch.

"mistabobdobolina","7","0","0","9 April 2012"," Lots of brilliant work here, but over-compressed
","There is lots of brilliant work going on in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Gary Oldman's George Smiley is amazing: quiet, unassuming, world-weary, but totally committed and devastatingly methodical once he gets going. The rest of a very strong cast puts in impressive turns as well: John Hurt is perfect as paranoid old-guard man Control, Colin Firth is memorably smarmy in the role of Bill Haydon, and Toby Jones' Percy Alleline is the picture of a man promoted beyond his competence, full of bluster and low cunning. There are some great structural ideas in the direction, too, like the central flashback scene in the movie, a Christmas party that gradually spools out revealing interactions amongst the characters as the ""present""-day story progresses. And the reconstruction of the styles and colours and sensibility of the early Seventies is flawless.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor is of course a cerebral thriller rather than an actioner, a premise which is embedded in the source material; in an age overflowing with brainless high-volume shoot-'em-ups, we need more of this, and I hope George Smiley comes back for more big-screen adventures.<br/><br/>Having said all that, Tinker Tailor does suffer from a serious problem: over-compression. The original story was sprawling and would always be hard to fit into a feature film, but Tinker Tailor compresses its material so radically that -- while everything you need to know what's happening in a given shot is *technically* there on the screen -- in practice, no amount of laser-like concentration is going to keep you from missing at least a quarter of it on a first viewing. The story moves in laconic, abrupt cuts back and forth in time and place, uses the barest minimum of action to tell its story, and is so reticent about signposting what is happening that I found myself very confused more than once, particularly in the early going. Eventually it becomes easier to sort out what's a flashback and what isn't, and the pieces start to fall into place, but even so it took me multiple viewings to be clear about everything that was going on. That shouldn't be necessary. (This compression, mind you, also leads to some very impressive touches of filmmaking economy, like the establishing shot in the Bill Roach - Jim Prideaux storyline where we see Jim pulling up to his job as a schoolteacher reflected in Bill's glasses. On the whole, though, there's too much of it, and one can't help wondering if an extra thirty minutes of footage would have been out of the question.)<br/><br/>For those of us not watching on high-def plasma screens, the other problem with Tinker Tailor is that it's dark. As in, much of the cinematography is just... dark. It's hard to see things. I had to adjust the picture on my television way out of whack for normal viewing just to get everything in the movie visible.<br/><br/>Having said that, overall Tinker Tailor is a fine film of a type that needs to become more prominent. Hopefully its flaws won't overcome its potential importance."

","Oddly enough, this film reminds me a lot of ""The Deer Hunter"". The reason I say this is because there were many times throughout ""The Deer Hunter"" that I wanted to give up on the film. The beginning of the film is dreadfully drawn out and slow. While watching ""Tinker"", I found myself agitated with the slow beginning. I nearly gave up and turned it off. Much like ""The Deer Hunter"", I watched the film because of quality reviews and recommendations from friends. That is the only reason I stuck it out. I thought that there must be something to this film if it was getting such good reviews and so many of my friends were telling me to watch it. By the time the film was over, I was very pleased with the quality of the story and the deliberate means of the directing and cinematography. Don't give up on this film. Hunker down and fight your way through the treacherous slow start and I think you will end the film with a smile on your face. This is a film that must be absorbed and paid attention to closely. This is a tremendous film and after it was over I felt like rising to my feet and clapping as if I had just witnessed a masterful Broadway performance. The acting is top-notch and Gary Oldman is spectacular. This is the same feeling I had after fighting through ""The Deer Hunter"", and that is where I draw the similarities from.

","I like art films, and I like original movies. And slow films too. I loved TREE OF LIFE-- a very unusual, original movie, and a heartfelt one. But I did not like this re-booting of ""Tinker Tailor"". Admittedly, I read the novel years ago, and then watched the TV series with Alec Guinness, which I enjoyed--even though it had to compress a bunch of the subtler stuff from the book.<br/><br/>But THIS version of ""TTSS"" I did not like--for lots of reasons--the insistence on dreary sets and muted colors--after a while, wasn't it laid on a bit thick? I mean--no contrast to anything else--just hitting us over the head with ""DREARY""--they'd made their point! Also, the main character actors--all chosen or made up to have very strange, unattractive-looking faces and weird-shaped heads. Even the Bill (mole) character has this greasy hair and dowdy clothes--not something emphasized in the book.<br/><br/>But mostly they changed the PLOT from the book and from the first Alec Guinness adaptation. --Instead of being a spy-thriller/detective story with plot resolution--the exposure of the Mole and more important, the SURRENDER of CARLA to the Smiley character, the director turns this movie into a smarmy ""Bromance"" about dumped gay lovers and betrayal of male relationships. And this is presented in very soapy fashion. It's like go from Le Carre to Dougls Sirk! And the film completely leaves out the story of CARLA's daughter and how Smiley discovers this master spy's one vulnerability--his concern for his daughter, and how this ultimately trumps his allegiance to the Soviet State and to his spy craft. NONE of this is in the current movie! Instead of CARLA being vanquished by Smiley's dogged intelligence and patience by the end of the film, we get the unexplained and rather hurried capture of Bill with his handler in the Safe House apartment (we aren't really told how exactly Bill is cornered--we just show that he is). And Smiley's rehiring and promotion as head of MI6.<br/><br/>The whole subplot of Smiley's wife Ann is mostly told off-screen, (and thus we do not see how Smiley's vulnerability to Ann mirrors CARLA's vulnerability for his own daughter)--And the Ann actress and character herself never appear in the film. --Except for a shot of her very clothed rear end at a Christmas party. Even the killing of the traitor at the end is changed from the book and soaped-up with tears, to make a different emphasis in the story.<br/><br/>Is this meant to be a ""Gay"" film? --I don't know. But it's not Le Carre's novel! It's like the director or the screenwriter read the book and could only relate to certain parts of it and then added other stuff more to their own taste.<br/><br/>And--here's a really unpopular opinion from me:--I thought Gary Oldman's performance was more wooden than expressive or exhausted. The longer I saw his face the more I thought how thick his makeup seemed to be. Alec Guinness was not made up with rubber prosthetics for his movie! And at the end of the film the Smiley character is sitting at the ""Boss's""desk --formerly occupied by Control--smiling in triumph and satisfaction, as if he's vanquished his enemies at the office and become ""the winner"" over the other guys. --This again is hardly the point that Le Carre made in his novel, or about the Cold War, or about spies! Perhaps this should be a scene for the Dwight character from ""The Office"" TV show."

It probably takes a film like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand how much our view of the world – and the work – of intelligence services has been contaminated by the glamorous universe of James Bond or his modern, more disillusioned but even more heroic, counterpart Jason Bourne. So we've come to expect a world of action and heroism, of right versus wrong, of shady backroom dealings and deadly plots which are opposed by a few brave and righteous men. The are backrooms and intrigue, there is plenty of violence and a few righteous men here, too. But there is no glamour, no heroism, no glory. This is not a game, this is dead serious and reminds us how, just a few years ago – and in many ways still today – this was where the frontline ran in a relentless though largely invisible war, a war fought in the place of a ""real"" one which nobody wanted to fight because it could not be won. This was never about heroics, this was all about survival.<br/><br/>Director Tomas Alfredson creates – or recreates – a world paralysed by fear, a world which might explode at any moment, in which laughable chess players clumsily try to avoid what seems inevitable. The film takes place in the 1960s, at a time when common sense had it that this earth was doomed, that there would be a nuclear war which would extinguish the world we have come to know. This pale, grey, claustrophobic world seems already dead, almost devoid of color, covered in a sickly greenish grey that has sucked all life from it.<br/><br/>This world's James Bond is called George Smiley, but smile he hardly ever does. He is a grey-haired, stone-faced middle-aged man whose life is over, having lost his top job at MI6 as well as his wife. He is yesterday's man, a relic from a time in which integrity counted for something. Now it is all a game, a struggle for power in which the frontlines are hardly visible and ever shifting. Gary Oldman is Smiley and he gives one of the most memorable performances of his career. There is hardly any discernible movement in his stern face, reading it is like reading between lines and yet all the film happens right there, in those minuscule movements, the slight clouding and unclouding of those unforgiving features. A hard man in hard times for which he is much better equipped than the arrogant narcissists which regard themselves as modern.<br/><br/>Smiley was forcefully retired but is brought back to lead a secret operation aimed at discovering a mole at the highest level of the ""Circus"". Instead of embarking on an action-filled hunt, Smiley hides in a seedy hotel room, studying mountains of documents. This is a bureaucrats' war and it can only be won by a master bureaucrat. And it is won by talking, investigating, thinking, drawing conclusions – and, most importantly, by listening and observing. There is very little movement in this film which mostly takes place in narrow, suffocating rooms, whether it is Smiley's dusty makeshift headquarters, the dreary grey corridors of the ""Circus"" or the antiseptic chilliness of the board room. The film opens with an operation going horribly wrong in Budapest but this war is fought in backrooms. So it is fitting that it's final, completely nonviolent and mostly silent showdown takes place in a dark empty house.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate Anti-Bond: serious, honest, unglamorous, unheroic. For this war is very real and it is not glamorous at all. The methods employed by the two sides are the same and vary only in their level of professionalism. But there is more: Incredulously, Smiley tells the story of once meeting the Soviet Union's top spy who chose to return home expecting to be executing in Stalin's reign of terror rather than defect to the West. Smiley cannot understand this ideological fanaticism which he regards as the Russian's only weakness. He is a pragmatist, for him it is not about ideology but sheer survival. There is no room for grand ideas when you're balancing the edge of an abyss. It takes no hero not to fall, it takes a bureaucrat.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a masterpiece of a spy thriller, full of suspense in which the violence is always dirty, never heroic or glorified. It is a claustrophobic, bloodless world it depicts which has no place for heroism, a world in which no games are played and where right and wrong are no moral categories, although it does not deny the value of decency. The political field on which these shadow armies move is no colorful background, it is deadly reality. In the very end, there is a slight smile on Smiley's face, a brief sign of triumph which cannot hide the fact that nothing is over because it never is. Time to go to work."

","In my opinion this film had a great beginning and a brilliant end (referring to all the aspects music, action, ...) though the middle of the film could have been a lot better but it doesn't get you bored. I also think that the worse thing about this film was the editing, there were some parts were you could not follow the story because we did not know if we are in the pass our in the present. Gary Oldman's performance was very good as well as John Hurt's, Colin Firth's and Benedict Cumberbatch's. The soundtrack was a huge surprise, given it's great quality. The clothing was perfect.

","""TTTS"" could almost be one of those engaging board games, a spy game this one, designed and marketed by the Waddington Company in the UK in the 1960s (the story was actually set in 1973). The objective is to find a mole among 5 suspects, all people with power in the British secret services. Their nicknames, funny enough, align not so much with the characters as with the actors assigned to play them. ""Tinker"", with its ring of devious mischief, is midget-ish Toby Jones who rivalled Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning portrayal of Truman Capote with his own ""Infamous"" (2006), not Oscar-winning but equally brilliant. ""Tailor"" would serve as an allusion to the gentlemanly persona of Colin Firth. And who can be more qualified than Ciaran Hinds to be called ""Soldier"", although he is equally good (maybe even better) as a Russian president. Non-titular, the other two are David Dencik (veteran Swedish actor, seen recently in ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"", in both languages) as ""Poor Man"" and star protagonist Gary Oldman as ""Beggarman"".<br/><br/>Despite the simple ultimate objective, the plot seems convoluted, and not helped by the movie makers' inclination not to dish our easy divulgences you have come to expect from other suspense mysteries (Robert Downey Jr. ""Sherlock Holmes"", for example). But then, if even Ebert confesses to ""I didn't always follow the allusions and connections"", there doesn't appear to be anything that we the general audience need to worry about. On the other hand, to make things worse, there is a proliferation of character in addition to the five mentioned above. Two of them start the movie: John Hurt as the MI6 head who sends out Mark Strong as an agent to Hungary to follow a lead on the mole. Then there is an apparently defected front-line agent played by Tom Hardy (best remembered in ""Inception"") on whose activities the mysteries seem to hinge. Going after him is his immediate supervisor played by Benedict Cumberbatch (veteran British actor seen in a handful of popular British movies). While there are quite a few others, I'll only mention two more, both women, beautiful Polish (I think) actress Svetlana Khodchenkova as a defecting Russian spy and a brief appearance of unknown Russian actress Katrina Vasilieva as the protagonist's unfaithful wife.<br/><br/>Notice I have only used the name of the actors and also stayed away from getting into the plot in any detail. Watch the movie and let things unfold. And I repeat, if Ebert cannot follow everything, neither should we agonize ourselves over trying to do so. A clear-enough picture does emerge at the end and if we miss a little detail here and there, so what? The beauty of this movie is in the atmospheric recreation of an almost dream-like world of intriguing espionage and the uniformly excellent acting, lead by Oldman and Hurt."

","If you've not seen the original TV series or read Le Carre's book then this film may fare better with you.<br/><br/>Technically the film worked well and Smiley (Gary Oldman) was word and gesture perfect - if Alec Guinness' original portrayal was the yardstick. Connie (Kathy Burke) had some depth as a romanticised mother figure for her 'boys' since the glamour of her job as queen of the filing cabinets was otherwise nonexistent. With the pace of a man assembling an orchid using tiny tweezers and a pile of atomic dust, the atmosphere of mistrust unfolded. The dark, tedious smoke-screened world of intelligence gathering was well conveyed. These were, essentially, selfish, backbiting bureaucrats more compelled to burnish their names than get the job (whatever it may be this week) done. Agents are courted, controlled and casually discarded leaving the viewer wondering why anyone would take on such a thankless task and, indeed, if it ever really was like that.<br/><br/>Why this had to be re-made (leaving aside the obvious hunt for more money) escapes me. Though the cast was solid with a very believable Alleline (Toby Jones) and Lacon (Simon McBurney), it's still a humdrum reprise. The original TV series, though it moved turgidly, had more depth. Remakes are rarely an improvement on the originals (though it depends which you see first) and in this case it didn't bring anything new to the story."

","An interesting take on it, but for me the definitive version is the TV series. Gary Oldman is quite good, but Alec Guinness is simply superlative.<br/><br/>The new version is necessarily like an MP3.. highly compressed so that you lose the original flavor yet adding elements which are conspicuously absent and inconsistent with the book. The greenish wash of the post-processing is particularly distracting to me, and it is ironic that the final scene has such an obvious (and to me strange) French theme since the film was a combination of French (and, I suspect, Hungarian) funds with a Swedish director."

","I went to see this at a local cinema but noisy neighbours ruined my enjoyment. I left after 15 minutes, albeit with a ready refund. What I saw looked good and there was a thrilling assignation that went wrong. I awaited the DVD release with anticipation.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Oldman. I've seen all his films and enjoyed most. This is the first one where his participation disappointed me. He was deadpan and mumbling all the way through. There was no character development, no revelation. There are only so many meaningful looks you can take. The one time he seemed to liven up, when recounting an interview with a Russian master spy, it was full of pauses. His expression was one of an Essex botox addict. A shame as it was a waste of talent.<br/><br/>The rest of the crew, mostly major British actors at the peak of their form, in the case of Cumberpatch on the way up but so fast, did their bit and were everything one would expect. But the film itself failed to deliver.<br/><br/>It's saving grace was that you had to concentrate to get the full story. The timelines intermixed confusingly and the triggers as to which were which were not always apparent instantly. This might have been deliberate, if so it was not a good idea. At the end one felt that it had been an effort to watch.<br/><br/>Visually it was very good, the seedy interiors and the depressing exteriors reflecting what is such a seedy and depressing profession. Further, the suspicion that most of us must have is that MI5 and 6 are self serving and this film ran with that. So nothing surprising.<br/><br/>A movie is much more than just moving pictures. The script, which must have taken two people to carry, was good enough but the film didn't engage. There were no lovable characters, none to sympathise with, and certainly no one to envy. It was all very depressing. Even the bits that could have been edge of the seat stuff, like Cumberpatch virtually breaking into MI6 HQ, were very low key. The only exciting bit was right at the start and I had already seen that.<br/><br/>The real test of a film is if you want to see it again and I have to say one that Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is unlikely to pass.<br/><br/>Worth watching but do not expect to be overwhelmed."

Knowing that, I found the movie much easier to follow, and understand than my friend, who had no previous knowledge of TTSS, the back story or the cultural events surrounding when the movie is set.

","This was a great movie. One of the best I've seen in a good while. Alfredson nailed the pace most suitable for a story like this. There are sharp turns and twists (of sorts) in the story, but they're not contrived or overdramatized. If you don't pay attention, they can sneak you by. I love this. So often in movies with intricate stories (or attempted intricacies) they bludgeon you over the head with them. Not so here. And Tomas Alfredson manages this feat without making the movie indecipherable.<br/><br/>The acting was great too, of course. Gary Oldman was in good form. But I enjoyed the other characters the most.

"cattjones","Null","0","0","7 January 2012"," Welcome to the Circus
","This adaptation of John le Carre's book was interesting and somewhat dull at times. I do not generally like period films, but this one is somewhat of an exception. Let me just say to start out with that this was a long film and I was a little anxious to get it over with. If you are looking for the usual action scenes that normally come with these types of films, then you are going to be greatly disappointed. This was a more subtle film with a lot of whispering and back stabbing. The fact that they called their intelligence agency ""the circus"" was mildly amusing to me since that is the way I always think of any government agency. In my opinion the film was very slow to get started and there was a lot of jumping around and flash-backing, so there was no time to have your thoughts wonder or drift into a quick nap. It almost seemed like the director Tomas Alfredsen filmed a lot of little segments and then pasted them together like a collage. There was a sub-story in the film where Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) engages in a friendship with one of his young pupils. I remember thinking at the end of the film that they probably could have left that sub-story out. It did not play to the plot at all. I do have to tip my hat to Gary Oldman (George Smiley) who was very believable as the trench coat sudo-detective weaving in and out of the streets of London. This film definitely had that ""independent film"" feel to it. I found it interesting that John le Carre made a cameo appearance in the film. I guess he plans on being the next Alfred Hitchcock. The story of the film was very good, but I have to say that I miss the action. I am not sure if I was entertained by the film. It sort of made me feel like I was watching a docu-drama about the European Central Intelligence Agency of the early 70s. I think that if you are into slow-moving, however highly intelligent films then this is probably worth the price of a ticket. If you more of a ""Bourne"" action film person, then this might not be for you. As for me, I am the latter, so in saying that, I will not try to perpetrate a cover-up and I am going to give this film an amber light."
"chemingineer","7","0","0","1 January 2012"," The melancholiness of spying
","The pace is languorous, at times excruciatingly slow. The music is sombre and deep, interspersed with long pregnant pauses of complete silence. The lighting is low and casts long shadows. The colours are muted, often grey and blue, but at times amber and ochre. The mood is distinctly chilling and sinister. Welcome to the murky world of counterespionage during the heydays of the cold war.<br/><br/>After a bloody prelude set in Budapest, George Smiley is pulled out of retirement to unearth a ""mole right at the top of the circus"". How the laconic Smiley goes about this assignment is never made amply clear and the viewers are expected to workout the jigsaw puzzle for themselves. There are gruesome corpses, but the killing is mostly off-screen, except for two, one of them stunningly sudden. The narration is elliptical with flashbacks that are short and often confusing. The Russian passages of conversation are deliberately not subtitled. The editing is quicksilver and anticipatory. I am still trying to figure out the Freudian symbols of railway tracks and points, or the fat bespectacled kid.<br/><br/>The movements of Gary Oldman's Smiley are laboured and arthritic. The wry British humour manages to ooze out in a couple of scenes. Through extreme close-ups, director Tomas Alfredson manages to evoke the melancholic world of spies. It is anything but fun and glamour. The atmospherics are brilliant transporting us to a world of ticker tapes and shrill telephones. It was a time when cigarette smoking was uber-cool.<br/><br/>The denouement is deeply disappointing; it comes as a big anti-climax. This is a literary film; unless you have read the books you will not know that Karla is Smiley's Russian archenemy. The film is a must-watch if you are a Le Carré fan; otherwise it will tax your grey cells."

However, when that is the only clear plot detail to emerge in an hour's time, you know the movie is a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Regardless of the who's who of British acting talent in the film, none of them under the misguided director's influence can save the experience from being dull, boring, confusing, and in the end, annoying. <br/><br/>Who are these characters; after an hour you still don't really know. Why are they all so depressing? You don't care because you really don't know them. <br/><br/>This may be one of the SLOWEST paced movies in cinema history. The actors mumble lines in a host of British accents; the musical score is slow; there is a lot of space between speeches; lots of deadpan staring; the director's art house cutting takes us all over the place without helping us to know where we are; flashbacks come and go but your not sure they are flashbacks. This is only part of the frustration of suffering through the first hour of the film. You keep on waiting and hoping for something INTERESTING to happen. You get nowhere!<br/><br/>No one seems to have bothered, and I am talking specifically about the director and screenwriter, to tell the story in this movie to keep the viewer interested; a damning and hideous flaw.<br/><br/>I decided to see the movie based on many of the positive reviews in the press. Well, I admit, to all, I gave up after 1 hour. I have no desire to return and see if things improved after that; doubtful, since the film is so consistently lifeless.

"kellie-christiansen","1","3","8","15 January 2012"," Tinker Tailor Snore Snooze
","Let me preface this review by stating I am an avid cinema-goer who enjoys everything from Spielberg to Von Trier to Van Sant to J. J. Abrams. I'm happy to watch a slow-paced film comprised mostly by dialogue and I'm a fan of several Le Carre books and adaptations. I haven't read the book this film is based on, nor have I seen the miniseries (it was around 20 years before my time) however I don't believe that prior research should be a prerequisite to enjoying a film. I'd watched the trailer with excitement several times and I'm a huge fan of Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy. I expected this film to be an enthralling, intelligent spy movie with a clever screenplay and fantastic character development. However, I couldn't have been more amiss in my expectations (which were perfectly warranted from the trailer). For starters, this film had absolutely no character development whatsoever. I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters and had the mole - the big twist/surprise of the film - picked in the first half an hour. For me, that was the big twist of the film - I kept expecting a more interesting situation to arise, but it really was that straightforward. The utterly drab and meaningless scenes between the first few minutes and the last few minutes had me urgently wanting to leave the cinema and watch something - ANYTHING - else. I am by no means an unintelligent viewer and balk just as easily at action-packed, CGI-heavy offerings, but Tinker Tailor had me craving an explosion, a shootout - hell, even a gratuitous sex scene - anything at all to break up the long, hard stares that seemed to dominate the film (dialogue was sparse and, when offered, it seemed to be outlining points that were already extremely obvious). I felt almost personally offended by this film, especially because I was a huge fan of the director's previous film, Let The Right One In, and have been very intrigued by Tom Hardy after his fantastic performance in Inception and what looks to be another impressive turn in The Dark Knight Rises. However, at the end of the day, it simply didn't matter which actors were in the film, because there was no reason to care about the characters any of them play. There is no real protagonist or antagonist. A few other reviews have stated that the only redeeming feature was the production design or cinematography - I found both of these to be unexceptional. Obviously that era in London was bleak and depressing but there are ways to portray that in a film without it dragging every already heavy scene into the depths of despair suffered by many in those days (see Scorsese's Gangs of New York or Mendes' Road to Perdition if you want to see enthralling yet accurate portrayals of bleak, desperate times and places). As I haven't read the book I'm not sure if it was an accurate adaptation but I sincerely doubt that a Le Carre novel would be such heavy going with so little character development. If you want to see a GOOD adaptation of a le Carre novel, watch The Constant Gardener. If you like slow paced dramas about lies and backstabbing, watch fellow Best Picture contender The Ides of March, which is also a film based largely around dialogue that actually keeps you interested. Hell, if you for some reason like big-budget feature adaptations of BBC miniseries, watch State of Play. Anything, ANYTHING other than this film I can assure will be more entertaining and rewarding. I'm going to watch the original miniseries because I can see how the story may have its merits, but I have to reiterate just how disappointing this over-written, under-acted snoozefest is. Watch only if you need help getting to sleep."

Unless the last hour is a dialogue packed, exhilarating tale of espionage (as it was billed as) this film is at the best, forgettable. Gary Oldman is ""brilliant"" as a boring and morose character to which he feels he needs to add little personality and memories of Cumberbatch's fantastic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes are the only saving grace for Oldman's co-star. As the film began I felt myself embarrassingly confused but the hope that this hazy introduction would act only as a prelude to an exciting and gripping tale kept me watching. That. Never. Happened. I felt - something I thought was impossible - my eyes closing themselves, and tiredness rapidly set in as I heard one incomprehensible Russian name after another. Maybe this was simply psycho-somatic - my mind telling me this was not for me. However I must give hope to all those that feel similar symptoms, there is a cure - turn the film off.

It's moodily filmed, generating a strong and believable atmosphere of real-life espionage, and is, as I would expect from the cast, very well acted.<br/><br/>The problem - and it's huge - is that the film makes very little sense unless you are already familiar with the book (or one of the preceding TV or radio adaptations). Even then, it's somewhat frustrating, because, much more so than prior adaptations, the plot has been tweaked, characters omitted or changed, and the dialogue fairly brutally hacked in an attempted to streamline the dense and convoluted plot. It fails to do this convincingly, in the process making the narrative less believable. Its greatest failure is to dilute the tension of the hunt for the mole, largely because none of the suspects are developed on any level as a convincing character despite the best efforts of the cast with the few minutes allotted to them for dialogue. You can argue that this is a fault of the novel too, but le Carré supplies just enough meat for you to get a convincing sense of motive and action. This is missing from the film. It not missing from either the excellent Alec Guinness TV adaptation or the equally fine Simon Russell Beale radio adaptation.

This is vintage Le Carre (A fantastic novel that I waded through in the late 80's) and its themes of class, corruption, moral uncertainty remain intelligently intact. On the other hand, you may struggle to fathom what the bloody hell's going on. This is a film that assumes it's audience has a brain, in fact it almost insists on it. Concentrate and you will be richly rewarded. The script is flawless, the direction faultless, the cinematography is stunning, evoking a murky 1970's London. The cast is absolutely magnificent. Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Colin Firth, Ciarian Hinds, Mark Strong (playing against type), Toby Jones, the delicious Benedict Cumberbatch, Kathy Burke and the gorgeous Tom Hardy. One of the best movies of the decade. 10/10"
"asgrrr","4","2","5","5 March 2013"," Spy thriller or sexist propaganda piece?
","It is a bit unfair to compare this film with the 80's BBC TV series, suffice it to say that the latter delivers the story infinitely better. What spoiled this film for me was the political message/propaganda contained in it and the message is that men are weak, pathetic, unresourceful and unsympathetic creatures. Almost all (if not all) the male characters are portrayed more negatively than in the TV production, sometimes very much so:<br/><br/>Peter Guillam goes from a turbocharged playboy, physical type to a fumbling, crying, closet homosexual.<br/><br/>Percy Alleline and Toby Esterhazy are both somewhat unsympathetic characters with certain weaknesses, yet with qualities relevant to their profession and in Alleline's case, a commanding presence. Both are reduced to goblins, really, with no apparent redeeming qualities in the film.<br/><br/>Boris goes from a ""Moscow Center hood"", a real tough guy to someone falling over himself as a pretend drunk.<br/><br/>Jim Prideaux is horribly miscast, no longer the ""iron fist in the iron glove"" but looks actually more at home as a teacher.<br/><br/>Bill Hayden was the cavalier and charmer in the TV series, we don't see much of him in the film, except to make it clear that he is the office head lecher if not sexual predator. The wit and charm is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>Roy Bland doesn't leave much of an impression in the film, so is hard to measure on this scale.<br/><br/>The Budapest waiter sweating - more of the same.<br/><br/>Control and Smiley retain most of their personas. The film takes care to show Control's death, irrelevantly, in an unsympathetic light. <br/><br/>The male characters in the film are further undermined by the lack of physical action and resourcefulness. The highly sensitive Budapest meeting is in a public place; Toby Esterhazy is snatched at the front door of the Circus; Ricky Tarr doesn't enter Boris' and Irina's flat solidly trying to talk himself out of the situation but takes on the role of a Peeping Tom instead. Any character of the story would put it like this: ""Where's the tradecraft?"" There doesn't seem to be any in the entire film at all.<br/><br/>Then there's the piece of graffiti on a wall around the middle of the film - ""The future is female"". That's as may be, but why fill this period film with sexist propaganda? Why not try to do the story justice instead? It appears that the whole point of the film is to make the male characters look worthless, incompetent and undeserving of their positions - quite a bit like soviet film making showing us the failings of Tzarist society."

","Maybe it's just me, but for every movie, I expect a minimum amount of things to happen; a lower threshold of scenes which makes it qualify as a 'film'. It might be seven, it might be twenty. But in any case, this movie only had two scenes: the first one when everyone thinks there's a mole and the second one where they find a mole. There's no climax or crescendo, and there isn't any exciting car chases or shootouts. For the life of me I couldn't keep track of the two dozen characters, all of whom seemed unimportant. Despite the conglomerate of great actors, there was nothing to be gotten out of this movie. As I've said before ""based on a true story"" is not a good enough excuse to make a crappy movie.<br/><br/>(PS: At one point, Gary Oldman takes out some Mentos and eats them. What a great scene.)"
"sayloroct","3","2","5","18 November 2012"," Oldman Terrible In Dismal Movie
","Why do producers do remakes of excellent previous movies? All they can do is screw it up. TTSS is another example. It is a very dismal version of the much better series. I mean dismal literally, in like the photography is dark and grainy. Like most remakes, they simply don't understand what made the original so effective.<br/><br/>I knew it would be bad when I heard that Gary Oldman would play George Smiley. And I was right. Oldman is completely wrong for the part. George Smiley is an tired-looking, older , overweight man who looks as harmless as a fly, all the while disguising his razor mind. Oldman looks like trim 50 year old business man. The script doesn't help him since he has barely a word to say and Oldman simply isn't a good enough actor to communicate with the audience nonverbally through gesture and attitude.<br/><br/>The movie also has virtually no character development. You never learn a thing about any of the 5 possible spys. Connie Sachs has been almost completely written out of the story. There are huge gaps in the story. Prideaux is shot and assumed dead. He then reappears with no explanation, until much later. The movie shift back and forth in time with no warning and it is often hard to tell which time period is being portrayed. I'm sure some people think this artsy. I just found it confusing.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movies it it misses the point of the original. This is a story about betrayal: a man betrays his country and also his best friend. Which betrayal is greater? In the original, it's the personal betrayal that carries the power and moves the viewer. This remake so completely misses this that the key relationship in the story between Prideaux and Haydon is barley mentioned.<br/><br/>In sum, this movie is two hours of empty atmosphere. It doesn't understand whst the story is really about. It haspoorly developed characters, almost no story with large gaps, and a very weak ending compared to the way it plays out in the original series and book."

","Based on the 1974 novel of the same name by by John le Carré, 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is a Razor-Sharp & Fierce Espionage Flick, that stands out. Terrific Writing, Fabulous Direction & A Spell-Binding Performance by Gary Oldman, take this recent critical & commercial hit to the winning post. <br/><br/>'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' Synopsis: In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.<br/><br/>'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' kept me engrossed & captivated from start to end. It's a Razor-Sharp, Fierce & Furious Film, that kept me guessing. I wanted to know who the ""mole"" was & why. I was very much interested in what Smiley was doing, to solve this puzzle, that gets so ugly & ruthless. <br/><br/>Bridget O'Connor & Peter Straughan's Oscar-Nominated Screenplay is Magnificently Grasping. It holds your attention & grabs you completely. Tomas Alfredson's Direction is Fabulous. The Filmmaker has executed this ruthless & furious story, amazingly. Cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is eye-pleasing. Alberto Iglesias's Oscar-Nominated Music, deserves distinction marks. Art Design is good.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Gary Oldman as Smiley, is Spell-Binding, a Performance that has earned the worthy actor his Very 1st Oscar-Nomination for Best Actor. Oldman's portrayal of Smiley, like the film itself, is fierce & unpredictable. Oldman is restrained all through, but the intensity he carries in his eyes, is mesmerizing. Oldman is an actor who commands respect, because he has proved himself Over and Over Again! Colin Firth is efficient, while Tom Hardy & Mark Strong have never been so good. The Great John Hurt leaves a terrific impact. Ciiarán Hinds is impressive. Benedict Cumberbatch & Toby Jones deserve a mention. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' Is A Must See. This Is Cinema In Its Finest Hour!"

","This movie is so boring... When I say boring I mean boring you literally to death... You might want to hang yourself off the end of your sofa watching this movie... Everyone in it is old... especially Gary Oldman... He is truly living up to his name! Nothing happens in this movie - ever - so if you are sitting and waiting for something to happen you might as well throw yourself off of the sofa because nothing is going to happen. Even my dad (who LOVES boring movies) thought this movie was boring - and for My DAD to think a movie is boring - Oh my God you might as well move to the Moon for its spectacular countryside views rather than watch this movie. You might like to do the washing up and watch it dry - rather than watch this movie. In fact getting shot in the foot would be way more fun! And exciting! And Entertaining! Watch the kettle boil! Watch paint dry! Watch the sun go down and wait for it to come back up again! All these things are better and more entertaining than watching this movie. Tinker Tailor Snore Snore Yawn Yawn - is a much more accurate title. Why oh why? Even the young and improved Sherlock Holmes actor Benedict Cumberbatch is made bleached blond and rather dull...... Aaaaaaaaahhhhh do not bother to waste your valuable air breathing time - by watching this movie. Stare at the nearest painting on your wall. Or count air bubbles under your wallpaper....."
"newstar877","6","2","5","26 January 2012"," Know it's a cliché but: disappointing for those who've read the book
","I don't know what people who haven't read the book (or any of Le Carre's other spy novels) make of this film, but for those that have then I'm sure they'd agree that the film is a bit of a disappointment. Not because it doesn't follow the plot of the book - it does that fairly well - but because in the novel, the narrative switches from Smiley's thoughtful perspective and laid back pace to the drama of the events that other characters experience quite successfully, maintaining the tension throughout the novel and keeping the reader eager to read further and know more. In this film, however, that contrast between Smiley's scenes and the action, tension and drama of other parts is lost, and everything seems to happen at the slow, silent and thoughtful pace of Smiley. Compare this film with the original ""Day of the Jackal"" with Edward Fox, and you'll see how it's possible to pull off this kind of story successfully on film. Other than that, it's well made, the scenery is great, the actors do a good job. The ending is certainly very poor, missing the confrontation between Smiley and the other antagonists that was the culmination of the novel."
"paul-3013","Null","2","5","22 January 2012"," Tedious - Like watching a snail scurry along a garden path.
","It was the Bourne Identity without any action, suspense, drama, plot or scenery. To say it was glacially slow would show glaciers in a bad light. A glacier would speed past this movie and wave as it went by. It is as obscure as ""Lost in Translation"" and as filled with action as a Bambi cartoon is filled with pornography. To say the plot had twists and turns would be hard as there was no discernible plot. There was a nice view of Istanbul for a few seconds. The rest was dingy squalid offices, At one point one fellow was sitting on a couch and he said something innocuous and another fellow inexplicably launched into him and smacked his head around. The other people in the room barely raised an eyebrow at this outburst and the two protagonists continued for the rest of the movie as if nothing had happened. I think the assaulted fellow was as confused as I was, but he at least didn't have to sit through two hours of wishing his eyes would glue themselves shut. The film opened with an action sequence. which since it was one of the few times in the movie something actually happened, the director milked it by repeating chunks of it inexplicably through the movie. The film also had a strange effect on the nature of time. It didn't matter how many times I looked at my watch, the movie still had an hour to go. ""Drab"" doesn't adequately describe it. For sometime I thought the film was being shot in sepia, then the director let a slip of sky get past his defences. For this to be described as 'drab' it would need Carmen Miranda to waltz in every other scene and do the tropics dance complete with a banana fruit salad hat. The token woman wasn't all that ugly but for her to have contributed something to the film, they would have had to give her some dialogue. What absolutely stunned me was the bit in the end credits when le Carré was given credit for Co-Executive Producer (i.e. he put up some of the money) This means that le Carré had at the very least approved of the general direction of the movie. And although general direction would imply moving from one place to another in some sort of linear motion, not the actual direction of swirling round and round till it finally disappeared down the plug hole of boredom."
"fwhill","3","2","5","22 January 2012"," Disappointing
","We waited a long time to see this movie and were sorely disappointed. It drags on and on and there is little character development of the protagonist, the starring introverted Mr. Smiley. I would skip it.As spy stories go, this one was the slowest, dullest. Even the scenes meant to evoke tension broke down because of a lack of cohesion in the movie. The film flips back and forth without really connecting the earlier events to the later events. There is even a screw-up where a character is shown in a chronologically earlier time in the movie that would not have been possible. The portrayal of the office of British Intelligence was anything but, it was more akin to a shipping business or perhaps a retail chain of sometype. There are some actors, when the story line is interesting, who can command a acene with a look or facial expression: Steve McQueen, Alec Guiness, Clint Eastwood to name a few. Mr. Smiley's character can't pull that off."
"dzlz105","5","2","5","12 January 2012"," Never saw other versions; confused by this one
","I saw this movie with three other adults, including two with doctorates. We watch sophisticated movies and understand them. None of us had seen any other versions of ""Tinker, Tailor ..."" and only one had read the book, a long time ago. After the movie, our discussion centered on ""what happened in this film?"" Evidently, the story had been whittled down to bare bones. I sensed there was much more to know about the three Circus members being investigated - especially the tall one,who, at least in this version of the story, had very little to do.I realized the heavy-set woman in the big ramshackle country home had more significance than apparent from her one scene substantial scene. How about the young man who went to the Soviet Union and fell in love with the blonde --was he a defector or not? We did understand that Ann was chronically unfaithful; that someone told the Hungarians Prideux was coming; that Peter had to give up his lover; and, most of all, that England in the 1970s was a filthy, depressing place. In summary, I do not think this movie stands on its own. A person should not have to study previous versions of the story to understand what is going on!"
"clutchgrant","6","2","5","11 January 2012"," Boring boring boring.
","So, I wrote a really long review on my Wordpress blog. http://grantstevens.wordpress.com. Anyway, I thought the movie was pretty boring and bland. This is coming from a guy who enjoyed The American. Too bad, as I was really looking forward to this movie from the first preview I saw. Like one of my friends said after the viewing, its simply not a story suited for this format. Too much going on, too many names, and too hard to understand to catch everything the first time around, and its waaaay too boring to warrant sitting through a second viewing. The actors are superb, though, so I felt it deserves credit for that."
"Gordon-11","Null","2","5","9 January 2012"," One big confusion
","This film is about the British secret service trying to find a mole among the top ranking intelligence officers.<br/><br/>""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is such a confusing film. There are so many characters, and they are not introduced at all. Even if they were introduced, they are all in codes. I got all the characters all jumbled up, and could not understand the story. What makes it even more complicated is the constant jumping from present to flashbacks, and there is little way to tell which is which. And almost everything is spoken in riddles.<br/><br/>Though I can see how ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is gripping and engaging, I just could not follow what was going on."
"Momcat_of_Lomita","4","2","5","8 January 2012"," Stick with the Alec Guinness version.
","I had such hopes for this movie.<br/><br/>When I heard that a big-screen version of John Le Carre's spy-thriller ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" was in the works, I had mixed feelings. The mini-series, which stars Alec Guinness as the British master of intelligence, George Smiley, was a benchmark in the espionage genre. It was a successful translation to the small screen of Le Carre's very cerebral, short-on-action novel. Alec Guinness nailed the Smiley character. It captured the tone of the story, the feeling of the period. A very hard act to follow.<br/><br/>But the buzz about the new movie version seemed to be good, and although the early reviews were mixed, there was enough good word for me to be hopeful. I went into the theater wanting to like this film, ready to be pleased.<br/><br/>Instead, I was disappointed. And, I have to say, I felt betrayed by some of the liberties taken with Le Carre's story. The fact that Le Carre himself is credited as an executive producer makes the sense of betrayal all the stronger.<br/><br/>Okay, so enough of my feelings: the movie. It's a return to the days when the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the satellite republics was a real and daily event, and everyone took the possibility of the east-west standoff igniting into something more devastating seriously. Constant vigilance, a game of watchers garnering information that the other side sought to hide, covert jockeying for position. This was back in the days when a wiretap or ""bugging"" with hidden microphones was sophisticated technological espionage.<br/><br/>The movie does successfully convey this atmosphere, but to some extent this is to its detriment: the movie is a ""period piece,"" with ladies in 1960's fashions manually transcribing from reel-to-reel tape recorders and nary a computer to be seen; landline telephones of the correct period and fashions and hairstyles all looking unmistakably dated. When we're used to movies of the spy genre dripping with the latest technological gizmos and gadgets and everyone very much in the current style of dress and appearance, it's jarring to see.<br/><br/>The movie is also shot with a muted color palette, tones of grays and browns and blues predominating, which gives it a flatness that's unappealing to the eye.<br/><br/>The acting: well, nobody is going to touch Alec Guinness as George Smiley, but Gary Oldman is respectable in the role. In a way, my heart ached for him: this is a very nuanced role, playing a character who is the antithesis of active and animated. Oldman gets Smiley right and I can't fault him in the lead role.<br/><br/>But he's upstaged by John Hurt's portrayal of George Smiley's boss and predecessor, the head of the British intelligence, service, known only as Control. In the Le Carre story, Control is almost a cameo, a figure not fully fleshed out and seen mainly through the actions of others. John Hurt's characterization of Control is fully realized, three-dimensional, completely believable and alive. Oh how I wish the rest of the movie had been up to the standard that Hurt set! For the rest: Benedict Cumberbatch as Smiley's assistant Peter Guillam in the hunt for the ""mole,"" the double-agent deeply buried in the hierarchy of the ""Circus,"" as British Intelligence is referred to, does a good job with what he's given. However, there's a problem with what he's given. Somewhere in the translation of the book to the movie, a change was made in Guillam's character that is shocking to anyone who is familiar with the character from the books. Suffice it to say there's a point in the movie where you could tell which members of the audience had read the book and were familiar with Guillam's character, because you could hear audible gasps of shock and half-stifled protests.<br/><br/>And therein lies what I would say is the biggest problem this movie has: if you're familiar with the book and the mini-series with Alec Guinness, you're not going to like the liberties that have been taken with the story. So much so that you're probably going to ""buy out"" of the story and not like the movie at all.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with the book, you're going to find the look of the movie stodgy and dull, and there really isn't a lot of action to what is essentially a very cerebral story. That means you're going to find yourself not caring about the movie or the characters enough to remain interested, and will probably find yourself wishing you'd gone to see the latest shiny glossy polished contemporary spy thriller, something like ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" or yearning to watch a re-run of one of the Bourne movies on cable.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie to people who are hard-core fans of Le Carre's book, because they aren't going to like the liberties taken with the story, especially with the Peter Guillam character. I can't recommend this movie to people who enjoy movies in the spy genre, because frankly when taken as a whole, it isn't very good.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of John Hurt and his work, I would suggest that you might enjoy the relatively brief time he's on screen. And if you have an academic interest in comparing Gary Oldman's characterization of George Smiley with Alec Guiness' characterization, you will appreciate the movie. But for anyone else, I would suggest that you wait until the movie comes out on cable and you can watch it without paying $10 per ticket to see it. Don't waste your money seeing it in the theater.<br/><br/>...But I can recommend that you get the DVD set of ""Tinker, Tailor"" with Alec Guinness as George Smiley. Stick with that and read the book; avoid this current version because I don't think you'll like it."
"jacksflicks","6","2","5","5 January 2012"," Watch the miniseries first!
","If you only see this movie without having seen the Alec Guinness miniseries, then you're doing yourself an injustice. Le Carré is about people as much as plot. We know what an intelligence service does, but what kind of people do it? Both sides have an overriding interest, to gain an edge over their adversaries, on behalf of ""the higher good"". Le Carré's theme in all his books is, Is it worth it? The miniseries gives us a chance to explore this theme -- the movie does not.<br/><br/>In the Harry Palmer Michael Caine vehicles the hero is a cynic, but because he's still young he's not beaten down. In le Carré, everybody (except ironically the villain) is beaten down, either figuratively or literally. You get a sense of torpor, or moral exhaustion. But in the miniseries, you understand why. In this movie everyone and everything is just SLOW, including the camera work.<br/><br/>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold successfully depicted the le Carré malaise, because Richard Burton was an expert at the worn-out protagonist. (See Night of the Iguana and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.) Actually, Gary Oldman is pretty good as George Smiley. He's not quite the cipher that Alec Guinness was, but he's close. Unfortunately, director Tomas Alfredson has Smiley doing this stage business with the glasses, which is just that -- stage business -- while with Guinness, the glasses serve to make Smiley opaque. <br/><br/>I hate to think the makers of this movie are making a word play of Smiley's name, because throughout, Gary Oldman sports a frigid smile. Are they goofing with the audience?<br/><br/>And then there are the Tinker, Tailor, Soldier...characters. The point of the exercise was a classic whodunit cliché: Lots of suspects, now who is the perp? The story examines each candidate, and it's up to us to guess who. Everybody has an ax to grind, a conventional setup. Problem is, in the length of a movie there's no time to make us care about them.<br/><br/>Maybe this is what makes Alfredson approach Tinker Tailor the way he does. Perhaps he understands that most of the audience already knows the mole, because they read the book and/or saw the miniseries. So, why should they watch it again? To see how the human beings are dehumanized by their, at the time, very important work. But this really doesn't happen in this movie, because there isn't enough time. The characters were certainly dehumanized, but it's like they were just parachuted into their roles.<br/><br/>If you haven't see the Alec Guinness miniseries, then see it first. If you have seen the miniseries, then be ready for a letdown."
"agacyb","5","2","5","16 December 2011"," Soporific snoozer, for espionage diehards only!
","Although I normally love deep-digging dramas, this one may well be the very slowest movie I've ever sat through.<br/><br/>I was drawn in by some great reviews of this movie, undaunted by warnings that it was NOT an action film, since Bruce Willis and Nic Cage are not my cup of tea. But I actually did fall asleep twice because the pace was that numbing.<br/><br/>I can't say this is a bad movie, per se, but it simply PLODS soooo slowly. In addition, the film is dark and old-looking, recreating the 70s in Europe, I suppose, and this added to the soporific effect.<br/><br/>Complicating matters further, it was difficult to follow the details of what was going on and keep the large number of players straight. Who are the characters? Great actors playing a whole lot of unattractive old white men (yes, even Colin Firth becomes a smarmy middleaged white guy). I think there were a couple of women in there, one of whom was a bright light with the amusing line, ""I don't know about you, George, but I'm feeling seriously underfucked."" Could have used more of her...<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard espionage fan, you will probably like this. Otherwise, pick something more lively."
"unklechunkle","10","2","5","25 November 2011"," A worthy contender for Best Picture!
","Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one of the best British films for a long time and perhaps my film of the year. There is not much I can criticise about the film, the plot, adapted from the best-selling novel by John Le Carre, is top-notch; Alfredson's direction captures the Cold War perfectly and there is certainly nothing to criticise about its performances.<br/><br/>This film has some of the best British actors working today, with Gary Oldman leading as George Smiley, an experienced spy with a troubled past, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy as operatives caught up in the hunt for a Russian mole, who could be a number of high-ranking men in MI6, including Colin Firth and Toby Jones and, as John Hurt's Control may suspect, Smiley himself.<br/><br/>I recommend this film not only to people who enjoy espionage/ cold war thrillers but anyone who appreciates film in its excellence and a showcase of Oscar-worthy performances."
"nickeyboy_94","Null","2","5","2 October 2011"," Exquisitely directed, beautifully executed with an all star cast. Genius
","Gary Oldman has recently become a fascination of mine, the character of George Smiley is one of the finest pieces of acting I have seen. Oldman plays the reserved spy perfectly, to add another dimension of mystery to the sophisticated yet thrilling master recreation of Le Carre's novel.<br/><br/>Along side an all star cast, Oldman captures the drama and the panic of 1970's cold war Britain perfectly. Oldman always looks in control of his character, allowing him to work perfectly in harmony with Firth and Hardy to create a British masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is hard to put into words how the film has effected my outlook on Oldman. Having not seen much of his works until seeing this film, I am now transformed into a huge Oldman fan as I can appreciate his genius in the character and the man himself, who makes one feel like they are watching the real George Smiley himself, and not just Oldman acting in the mannerisms described by Le Carre.<br/><br/>No film is completed by one character. Hardy plays the troubled spy brilliantly to unveil more of the plot to the reader. Hardy and Oldman work brilliantly together in the scene in his home to demonstrate to the viewer the tension of the situation with Moscow. Colin Firth is also a credit to British cinema with his acting in the film. Ever impressive, he captures the role perfectly and with the other characters in the circus keeps the viewer guessing until the end.<br/><br/>There are several highlights of the film, one being the film in its entirety, however Oldman's monologue/Shakespearian style soliloquy, where he stares into the camera to replay a conversation he had with the mysterious 'Karla' has to be one of the finest bits of acting I have seen to date, which is almost worthy of an award in itself.<br/><br/>Worth the watch 100%,and having seen it twice myself, worth a second watch more-so than watching first time, especially if one comes out scratching their head after a first viewing.<br/><br/>Guaranteed awards, guaranteed enjoyment. 100% attention is required throughout, so watch after a good night's sleep!"
"ajs-10","9","2","5","2 October 2011"," A slow-burner that really hits the mark!...
","Having seen the critical acclaim this has got I had to see it when it finally landed at The Picture House, my local cinema. I remember the TV adaptation of this John le Carré novel, starring Alec Guinness, being aired, but I never really watched it at the time. So it was all new to me and I have to say I was impressed. It's not for everyone, it has quite a slow pace and there are no frenetic fight scenes, chase sequences or gun battles, it's all very calm. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>It is the 1970's and the cold war with Russia is at its height. Control has had word that there is a double agent at the top of the organisation and decides to leave, taking George Smiley with him. Some time later, Control is dead and George is asked to come back to find out who the mole is. He enlists the help of Peter Guillam, an agent, and former Special Branch Police officer, Mendel. The suspects are; Percy Alleline, Bill Haydon, Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase. The investigation begins by looking at an incident in Budapest involving another agent, Jim Prideaux, who was shot by Russian agents. Another source of information is Ricki Tarr who comes to George wanting to trade what he knows for the life of a Russian woman he has fallen for. There are plots within plots in this very complicated story and there's no way I'm gonna give the game away or the Spoiler Police will have me marched off to Siberia as quickly as I can say 'spy'.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot with really sharp imagery, I'm always impressed by that when I see a film on the big screen. The incidental music was good, but, for me, there wasn't enough of it many long silences in the dialogue. Moving on to performances, well, I have to say that Gary Oldman as George Smiley was superb! He really nailed it and went up a great deal in my estimation. I also thought the performances of; Tom Hardy as Ricki Tarr, John Hurt as Control, Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were all most excellent! I really hope at least one of them gets an Oscar if not a BAFTA. Oh, it was also nice to see an appearance from Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, this film will not suit everyone, it had a very complicated plot and it's one you really have to concentrate on or you'll miss something. Concentration was quite hard at the viewing I was at because it was quite hot and stuffy in there. Not to worry, I stayed awake for the duration and really enjoyed what I saw. It's the kind of film, I think, you might have to watch a few times to get the little nuances put in there, little clues to the identity of the mole. Some of it is told in flashback and it can be a little confusing at times figuring out whether it's a flashback or not It certainly keeps you on your toes! I will certainly be seeing this again at some point. So, for those that like a good cold war thriller, a slow burning plot with many twists and turns, then this one comes very highly recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 9.1/10 IMDb Score: 708/10 (based on 2,892 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 97/100 (based on 38 reviews counted when this review was written)."

","Retired British Intelligence officer George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is forced out of retirement to investigate a possible mole in the system. Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy), a spy returning from overseas, confirms the suspicions after having a brief affair with Soviet Agent, who revealed that an insider was passing information to the Russians. Assisted by Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley must investigate his former colleagues, dubbed by his former boss Control (John Hurt), as 'Tinker' (Toby Jones), 'Tailor' (Colin Firth), 'Sailor' (Ciaran Hinds), and 'Poorman' (David Dencik). Also on his list of interviewees is school teacher Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), who is a former agent that was shot and captured by the Russians in a previous bungled operation, and has now been cast out by the agency nicknamed the 'Circus'.<br/><br/>After the Harry Potter series ended earlier this year, it's great to see that a stellar British cast can still be assembled. And what a cast it is. The danger, obviously, is that with such talent on display, some people can get left behind or the film can feel over-populated. But, with the exception of Ciaran Hinds, each actor gets their chance to shine. The notable stand-out in my opinion is Hardy, who with his recent back catalogue, can only be described as the best young British actor around. He's a world away from psychopathic jailbird Charles Bronson in, er, Bronson, which is his greatest performance to date. Here, he's a damaged and emotionally-torn grunt who is dealing with the fact that the woman he's possibly fallen in love with has disappeared and most likely dead.<br/><br/>With Alec Guinness making the role of Smiley his own in the BBC adaptation of John le Carre's book, Oldman faced a challenge. But of course, this being Oldman, he makes his turn as the bespectacled, brooding and miserable super-spy into one of his best performances. He's not the over-the-top bad guy or the larger-than-life personality that we're used to from the likes of Leon, Sid And Nancy or The Fifth Element, but he is quiet, dutiful, and ponderous. I believe in the years to come he will be remembered as one of the finest actors this country has ever produced. The whole film is a tour de force of acting, and mention must go to Firth also, who demonstrates once again why, at the age of 51, he's getting more work than ever.<br/><br/>The film itself is sensational. Every frame, sound, and line of dialogue looks carefully considered. Just like the collection of grumpy spies, the film is slow-moving. It's a film of tone and mood, of greys and browns. This is portraying 1970's Britain, and from the looks of it, it was a miserable and paranoid place to live. The Cold War was in full flow, and Britain was in danger of being left in the wake of it's American allies. The characters reflect the mood of the country, it would seem. The spies are the people that must risk torture, murder, or arrest, all for the apparent safety of Britain, and they must do it all in the shadows. They are unhappy, and have every right to be.<br/><br/>It can be confusing, but when the credits roll after an exceptional closing and lively montage, and all the pieces come together, it's apparent that it's a relatively straightforward plot that has been arranged in a complex manner. It doesn't feel like this was done to make the film seem more intelligent than it is, but a way to keep the narrative interesting, and allowing us to learn things as our protagonist does. It jumps back and forward in time as the various players tell their story, or Smiley finds another piece to the puzzle, and credit must go to director Tomas Alfredson, who directed Swedish vampire masterpiece Let The Right One In, for keeping a firm grip on everything. Just a wonderful film, and one that will surely get plenty of recognition come next years Academy Awards.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"soxlade","Null","2","5","22 September 2011"," Fantastic slow-burning future classic
","From its slow, languid, unfussy titles through to its half focused final shot Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is an exercise in classy film making. It possesses perfect period feel and the best cast of the year all delivering a masterclass in film acting.<br/><br/>This is a slow burning story, played out predominantly in stuffy, over bright rooms laced with smoke and questionable decor. It is a game played across countries, by arrogant men with questionable morals and poor manners, deciding the fate of men and women in order to get what they all want: Treasure.<br/><br/>With MI6 still reeling from the exposure of the Cambridge spies, shut out from the American Intelligence sources and desperate for a win in the game. Control (John Hurt), convinced of a Soviet spy in the intelligence service, is losing respect of his younger division heads. When an operation in Bucharest, known only to the highest echelons of the Service, is disrupted by the Russians, Control's enemies seize their opportunity and force the old man and his confidante, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) out. Now an outsider, Smiley is the perfect person to investigate on behalf of a suspicious bureaucrat (Simon McBurney) who begins to think that there may be something in Control's paranoid theories after all.<br/><br/>As so the plot goes, twisting and turning, the pieces slowly coming together in the mind of Gary Oldman's Smiley. A quiet man, not into grandstanding like his contemporaries, instead he quietly and methodically collects information, building up the story. How do we know this? It's written on Oldman's face. Smiley is not a showy role, it demands subtlety from its actor. Oldman is not the first choice, given his scenery chewing roles in Fifth Element or Leon, but he is simply magnificent. In every twitch of his mouth, or long stare into the middle distance, a little something more is revealed about Smiley. What he thinks, what he needs, what he wants. It's all written there on his tired, unsmiling face.<br/><br/>This is not a spy story for the Bourne generation, it's closer to a genre thought long dead - the true cold war thriller like The Conversation, though I kept being reminded of The Odessa Steps or Day of the Jackal. Its pacing is perfect throughout, similar to The Wire in it's slow unraveling of a story told through a lot of disparate characters and from a lot of different viewpoints.<br/><br/>That's not to say there isn't drama or tension here, it's just a very different sort of drama. The most tense moment involves the theft of some papers from a cupboard. It doesn't sound like much, but it is a gripping sequence, full of fear and paranoia.<br/><br/>We've mentioned Oldman, who must be in for an Oscar nomination, but the rest of the cast are all superb, with Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy especially impressive.<br/><br/>Huge kudos to the production department for their recreation of early 70's London and all the grimness that entails. From Smiley's glasses (actually sourced by Oldman himself) to the awful Christmas party held by the Circus staff which, as a flashback, anchors much of the plot the detailing is perfect, especially when shot through the roving long lenses of director Tomas Alfredson.<br/><br/>For all the sumptuous detail, consummate acting and magnificent pacing, something had to give, and unfortunately the final reveal of the mole is not the sickening gut punch it should have been. ""It was him, of course it was him."" It's a problem with this being a film, there isn't enough time to give all of the characters equal attention, keep that ambiguity going to the end.<br/><br/>But this is a very minor quibble in two plus hours of sumptuous high quality mature entertainment. Perhaps my face resembled that of Smiley's at the end, as the montage of the winners and losers flows by, as he's finished putting the case to bed, as the betrayed come to terms with their situation. Smiley's plain features show the faintest ghost of satisfaction, of a man pleased with his work, and of a game well played."

","By the time we got to the ending I knew what was going on but was a little confused as to how we got there. Other than that everything is top notch.

I think the only other movie I was genuinely confused in was Godfather 2."
"andrewfleming-57891","4","2","6","6 August 2018"," Dull and emotionless
","This film is extremely disappointing. Its set in cold war London which gives the film a feeling of complete doom and gloom for its entire duration, except for the upbeat song at the end which really has no place in this film. <br/><br/>The characters arent very well or introduced and most of the film feels as if the director never really expected to land so many big names and now has nothing to give them to do. John Hurt does steal every scene tough. <br/><br/>Its poorly directed and the plot is very difficult to keep track of. The opening credits last over five minutes but are just pointless shots of Gary Oldman walking through his London neighbourhood. His monologues during the film are too long and overly theatrical. They would be more suited in a Shakespearean production. <br/><br/>The cinematographer and set decoraters do a good job in creating a gloomy feeling through their use of greys and browns. However, this alone cannot carry a film as boring as this one. Its a waste of time."
"winopaul","4","2","6","8 October 2016"," Better than Ambien
","Watching the DVD put me asleep in 20 minutes. Thankfully the IMDb reviews tipped me that the movie is incomprehensible without reading the book and watching the 1979 mini-series 4 or 5 times. Its a spy thriller that you can only appreciate if you already know the ending. <br/><br/>Read the Wikipedia plot summary. And blog posts,(tinker-tailor-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/). Be sure to turn on closed captioning. They will put the name of the speaker in parentheses on occasion so you can figure out who the heck is talking.<br/><br/>Every time I read a spoiler I was amazed at how how sloppily the film was put together. No, I did not notice the sign for Bidabesto n the subway wall since there were a couple walking down the stares and the gal had a big floppy afro and that got me thinking how she got cast and if hair like that is hard to care for and how it looked silly flopping as she descended the stairs.<br/><br/>Just like there were always some Indians that lived near the fort, there are always some fan-boys that think its great you have to have read the books and watch the 1979 miniseries. Heck, even the director notes you should listen to his commentary in order to understand what is going on. His tone told me there were recording the commentary after the theatrical release where everyone was staggering out the theater asking ""WTF just happened, I want my money back."" Listen to Milos Forman commentary at the beginning of Amadeus, where he beats himself up worrying that audience will not understand who the guy running across the courtyard is. Read about Hitchcock arguing with Carry Grant, who did not ""feel"" his character would look across the street when he exited a building. Hitchcock exploded, ""Its because I want the audience to understand what building is across the street!"" A director's first duty is to clarity, not the narcissism of the actors or the autism of the writer. He serves the viewer, rather than condescend to us that we are so stupid we cannot understand his masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Wikipeda plot summary shows you this really is a simple plot. There is not a lot of stuff going on, once you take out the self-indulgent peacocking of having to watch files being lifted in a little dumbwaiter. There are two activating events, a botched defection in Budapest and a blown cover in gosh knows what city where a some British dolts get killed and a Russian traitor girl gets kidnapped. Needless to say, these don't come at the beginning of the movie since that would make sense. There are handfuls of flashbacks, but you can tease out the change-- when Oldman is staring into space one minute, and then he is somewhere else the next second, well Elmer, that thar is a flashback. The thing is there is so little context for any scene transitions, you get lost and everything is a blur.<br/><br/>That lack of context is telling. See, I am sure le Carré is autistic. He pretty much admits it, talking about his social awkwardness in the featurette. Having worked in tech for decades, and being pretty far up the spectrum myself, I can see how le Carré loves to dive into details, but stitching things together-- not so much. The books offer up a flood of semi-relevant details, so that critics read their own deep profound interpretations. Another Asperger feature is the lack of context. People like le Carré and myself just assume you know every single thing we know, and that you have had the exact same life experiences, and that like Ayne Rand, if you don't like Strauss and tap dancing, you are a worthless idiot.<br/><br/>Autism is fine for a novel. le Carré just churned out a torrent of words. You can flip back and forth in the books. He eventually reached coverage and connected the details together. I am sure his editor did yeoman's work trying to get a comprehensible story written down.<br/><br/>Now we come to this movie, and rather than feel sorry for a fellow Aspergiac like le Carré, I have to feel the director is just f*&ing with my head, like Thurman Murman was doing to Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa. I remember way into the movie thinking ""Who the heck is Alleline?"" And then a quick trip to the IMDb listing and I realize, ""Oh, they mean Percy."" Introducing people by first name and then switching to surname is a stupidity that they do in the series Vera, and all the more reason to have your 12-year-old daughter writing down the characters and plot points on a 8' x 12' white board you have rolled up next to your recliner. Maybe force her to read the book too-- ""No daddy, its so booooooring!"" <br/><br/>OK, too many details and no context, and a director who might be a narcissist sociopath since he like making moves only the chosen few can understand. Why he is so special, you should welcome spending 90 dollars to see the movie 9 times. But adding to this is the implausibility of the plot, and how Oldman catches the bad guy. None of this rings true, and looks like the fever dream of a clerk typist in MI6 that dreams of what real spies must be doing.<br/><br/>On top of that is the dreariness. It looks like they were shooting in Pompey after the pyroclastic ash cloud. Everything gray and dirty and depressing. When I watched the commentary track, I had a Mrs Fisher Murder Mystery episode playing without sound on the second TV. Quite the contrast. This film was just ugly, everything about it, plot, characterization, cinematography, is ugly. Glad I got the DVD for free from the library. And do get the DVD or unlimited streaming, you will need a few watches if you have not read the book."
"flipshoes","Null","2","6","25 October 2013"," Watching grass grow
","I'm a bit amazed to see that so many people seem to really like this movie. To me it is just a more-than-pretentious, rather pompous fake and fails completely on nearly every level.<br/><br/>Now, I am fully aware that le Carré novels tend to be far more realistic and, thus, slow-paced than, say, James Bond movies. Nevertheless, the pacing of this film was so abominably slow that I had the feeling I was watching grass grow until it finally came to an end after long, long,...VERY LONG two hours plus. What really annoyed me all the time, though, was the filmmakers' meticulous obsession with the retro-style look of the whole film. They should have really paid a bit more attention to the on-screen story-telling (preventing the audience from falling asleep) than just celebrating the 70's look of every scene (starting from the hairdressing to clothing, dull 70's housing and cars, etc.). <br/><br/>In one scene you witness an insect flying in the back of a stylish Citroen DS (why?), in another - key - scene an aircraft is landing in the background and menacingly approaching the characters in the foreground (why??); in one of the (luckily deleted) scenes featured on the DVD you can watch Gary Oldman preparing and enjoying a fried egg for (I guess) some two minutes (why???).<br/><br/>This is, as I mentioned above, extremely pretentious, artsy movie-making. If it weren't for some of the good actors, some of the nice camera work and Alberto Iglesias's decent score, I would say: Simply forget it and READ le Carré instead."
"epat","6","2","6","11 January 2013"," The casting left me dead cold.
","When a well-known novel is brought to the screen, a large part of the audience is bound to be made up of people who've enjoyed the book. For that reason, if not for artistic integrity, I think it's important to try to recreate the original characters as close to their book descriptions as possible. The casting in this film left me dead cold; none of the characters seemed at all right.<br/><br/>Much as I admire Gary Oldman — an actor capable of brilliance in a wide variety of roles — I felt he wasn't able to do justice to the role of George Smiley. It's impossible not to compare this film unfavorably with the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guinness, whose bland self-effacing — almost bumbling — Smiley defined the role for all time. Oldman projects far too much presence for Smiley & just doesn't seem able to damp it down. The renegade Ricky Tarr comes off way too contrite & nowhere near rebellious enough; David Dencik is another actor who comes on too strong for his assigned role as perennial pleaser Toby Esterhaze, Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke) was neither blowzy nor bumptious enough; & the very idea of a short plump Jerry Westerby (Stephen Graham) is ludicrous to anyone who knows & loves the original John Le Carré novels. The only casting that really hit the mark was John Hurt, who captured Control perfectly.<br/><br/>The fault here lies squarely with the casting rather than with the actors, who did the best they could in ill-suited roles. Having read & reread the novel as well as having watched the BBC miniseries, it's hard for me to judge how clearly this film gets the story across, but I suspect quite a few moviegoers walked out of the theater scratching their heads.<br/><br/>Big books need more space. Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove, for example, was turned into a brilliant 6-hour miniseries. Nothing less could have done it justice. The original BBC version of Tinker Tailor was done the same way for the same reason. I'd like to see a lot more such miniseries; I'm still waiting for someone to do justice to ""Jeremiah"" Johnson that way."
"ScarletSpider87","1","2","6","22 July 2012"," This film was mindblowingly awful
","On the DVD cover it said that this film was a ""spy thriller."" Oh boy was that deceptive. I have watched very few films that are as boring as this one. The pace is so slow that you start making up comments like in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 just to make watching it barely tolerable.<br/><br/>The acting is poor, the cinematography is sub par, and the whole film is a jumbled, confused mess.<br/><br/>Most of the film consists of people staring off into the distance, or staring at each other, with no dialogue whatsoever. ""Ok, now this guy is staring at this guy."" ""Alright, now the second guy is staring back at the first guy."" ""And now the first guy stares back again."" Most everything that is mentioned is unexplained and disconnected from the surrounding scenes.<br/><br/>Please save yourself from wasting two hours of your life on this turkey that has about as much life in it as a corpse."
"realitycheck-673-809680","1","2","6","7 March 2012"," Muddled and slow does not intellectual make!
","I picked this movie because I like Gary Oldman and because the title sounded very intriguing, indeed. Also, I had read a review which said that the movie required a thought process and offered an intellectual experience rather than lots of shooting and explosions. I adore intelligent movies because there is such a dearth of them, so I sat down prepared to see something extraordinary.<br/><br/>All I can say after seeing it is: ""Where did the whole great idea go wrong?"" The movie focuses on finding a mole at the very top levels of British intelligence during the Cold War in Europe. Halfway through the movie, I realized that I didn't care who the ""mole"" was anymore and this must be saying something about the extremely poor execution of the original idea.<br/><br/>One of the most frustrating things about ""Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"" is the storyline jumps from past to present so many times that at one point you don't know where you are anymore – but what's even worse, you stop caring. That's because the movie fails to create any emotional involvement with the characters. The otherwise excellent Oldman does nothing but sit looking thoughtful all the time.<br/><br/>What a waste of talent because the movie is full of so many great actors! Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Colin Firth all seem wasted here. I can't even believe that this movie managed to generate any kind of Academy nomination and I have no idea what the reasoning behind this decision is. One more example of why the Oscars should never be trusted as guides of quality."
"Apteris","4","2","6","29 January 2012"," Not understandable without prior knowledge
","I used to think playing with your phone during social events was the height of rudeness. What a bleak epiphany, then, to watch this movie in good company and not be able to resort to any means of alleviating my extreme boredom and confusion.<br/><br/>I have no in-depth knowledge of British espionage circa 1973, and this plodding movie sure didn't help with that. I was never clear on what exactly was going on. I was never sure whether I was seeing a flashback or not. I never could work out who was more suspicious at any particular moment. I watched it with two friends, carefully and intently, and at the end we were, still, individually and jointly, unclear on what exactly had happened and why. Even the official synopsis was but a dim light to cast among such shadows.<br/><br/>It's entirely possible the experience will be wholly different if you've read the book or seen a previous adaptation. Perhaps also if you re-watch this movie, again and again. I couldn't say, as the unintelligible storyline coupled with the drab, bleak, saddening setting (which, to be fair, was the goal) moved me to antipathy. It's not easy for a boring movie to induce antipathy, but this one did.<br/><br/>It's incredibly frustrating to watch such a stellar cast in such an uninspiring production.<br/><br/>Any work of art requires a certain background to be appreciated. To all those who were able to enjoy the movie, more power to you. Yet I would ask, when one is trying to tell a story, is it not one's duty to make oneself understood, rather than the audience's duty to try to understand them?"
"linda-tillman-1","1","2","6","22 January 2012"," If you haven't read the book, don't go
","I hadn't read the book, nor had I seen the TV series. I was totally clueless as to what was going on throughout the movie. Obviously it was announced that they were looking for a mole within the organization but that was the extent of any clarity about the plot. I loved the sepia tones of the film and the tone of the set decoration, etc., but the plot had way too many characters and no hints as to what was connected to what. There's a device for carrying records within the Circus that is shown over and over that looks like an oven/elevator and I never understood the reason it got so much screen time. There's one scene in which we are with Smiley as he catches a quick glimpse of a woman I assumed was his wife, but we'd never been exposed to her except by name and I couldn't see enough in the glimpse to understand what I was supposed to get from the shot. Many times there were flashback scenes that were probably meant to add to clarity about the plot but the editing was badly done and I often didn't realize it was a flashback until a few minutes into the scene. I stayed for a little more than 90 minutes of complete confusion and then my friend and I walked out. She had read the book and still didn't know what was going on - it was her idea to leave. I've only walked out of one other movie in my life and that was about 20 years ago."

","It may not be the flashiest movie of 2011 by any counts, but for my money, I wouldn't be surprised if it remains the BEST.<br/><br/>The information and dialogue in this movie is staggering to be totally honest, but the movie's confidant pacing gives the audience time to piece together the narrative puzzles as the movie goes along. The script is pure brilliance, utilizing perfect blends of tension, intrigue, suspense, paranoia, chills, thrills... the list goes on, and the food for thought is incredible. Even after having seen it a few days ago, I still can't get it out of my mind.<br/><br/>Tomas Alfredson paces this movie with precision, crafts it with a perfect eye of detail, and hits us with mistrust for on screen images in a way that continues to heighten the suspense factor. The cinematography and editing are pitch perfect, as is the Art-Direction.<br/><br/>Most impressive is the cast, quite possibly the best assembled of the year. They're all as integral to the tension as the screenplay is, with sparks flying all around, and any one of them could not be who they say they are. The acting is not all flashy, but lies more within eye movements and vocalization to give a deeper, believable depth. Some of the excellence is owed to that of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt, Mark Strong, and Tom Hardy. Standout notice must go to human chameleon Gary Oldman, perfectly embodying George Smiley, and not just with his fine hair and makeup. He excels in this movie with his controlled emotional layers, impeccable timing, and flawless line delivery. Gary, you've done it again!<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that Tinker Tailor improves upon multiple viewings, and the result is a film that can be called nothing less than flawless.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

I found it was confusing, but not due to a complex narrative, or fast pace (which it lacks), but because it makes no sense at all. You might come out of the theater thinking, yeah there was a spy and it was difficult to catch him, and the storyline was dark and twisted. Actually it was pretty straight forward. It was a little bit foreseeable, and to make it worse many scenes added no meaning whatsoever to the plot.

The manner in which the flash back sequences were incorporated in this film are not very effective, and rather than answer questions a viewer may have, they create more questions. Key points were not especially emphasized, and could easily be lost on the viewer. More than once, I found myself wondering what exactly was going on, and I was familiar with the story before hand.<br/><br/>Yet another film that wastes the talent of some fine actors, and fails to live up to its potential."
"michael-harris-3","4","2","6","9 January 2012"," Tries too hards to be different and looses the plot
","After reading a number of the reviews and comments film the overriding impression is one of confusion from all but a few reviewers, who treat the rest with disdain (downright contempt on the part of certain).<br/><br/>If you have read the book, or watched the 1979 TV series starring Alec Guinness, then the confusion is lessened but replaced with annoyance with the director for his treatment of a past classic. It seems that in his determination not to remake the TV series Tomas Alfredson has modified characters and changed the sequence of events (or at least the moment in the story where things are revealed to the audience) to such an extent that he has created confusion where there should be none.<br/><br/>The plot of the novel is tortuous (necessarily so given the subject) and Mr. Alfredson has only two hours in which to tell it, however this is no excuse for playing fast and loose with the time-line, the location of events, and the characters to such an extent that final work bears only a passing resemblance to the original story.<br/><br/>The relationship between Smiley and Karla, which runs through all the Smiley novels and is extremely important to understanding Smiley reactions, is completely lost in this film. Karla appears to be just another kleptomaniac Russian spy-master who nicks cigarette lighters!<br/><br/>The death of Prideaux is a further example of Alfredson's clunky departures from the novel. Alfredson storyline requires that Smiley ""find"" Prideaux, though in the novel Smiley never ""lost"" him. Contrary to the novel, we are deliberately given the impressions that ""Prideaux"" was killed and then later we are allowed to discover that he was brought back to the UK secretly. How, as Control's second in command at the time of the ""Hungarian fiasco"" (Control's resignation follows this event), could Smiley not be aware that Prideaux actually survived? Last, but by no means least, why is it necessary that Peter Guillam become homosexual? It is not in the novel and adds nothing to the storyline. Is Alfredson trying to be all inclusive? <br/><br/>I recommend that you read the novel and (if you can find a copy) watch the 1979 series; both are infinitely better than this film."

Without his linguistic magic, the type of spy plot that Le Carre pioneered by now seems hackneyed and unimaginative.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman, cast against type, seems virtually catatonic as he mumbles and stumbles his way through this ponderous script and leaden direction. He is simply not a good enough actor to overcome this miscasting. The others get no real opportunity to show anything.

"micz81","5","2","6","2 January 2012"," Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.... actually... you just don't care
","I went to see this, encouraged by numerous positive reviews of my friends and critics. I'm hugely disappointed. And I think I know why.<br/><br/>First thing: this movie is advertised as a THRILLER, but in fact it's a MELODRAMA. Thriller should thrill, should make You bite your lips in excitement. And I'm not talking here about slow pacing, that this movie has - there are many slowly paced thrillers which manage to develop intense pulsating nerve (No Country for Old Man for example). I'm talking about the way of presenting the story. About intention behind it. <br/><br/>TTSS has I think no intention to thrill, to lead viewer trough meanders of some MYSTERY characters are unveiling. It's major intention is rather to expose the emptiness of espionage mythology and to reveal the real-people-at-the-unreal-desks reality of this kind of work. In other words - ""see this? This is a REAL spy-life. Full of everyday routine, full of 'I-hate-my-boss' moments, full of hidden romances, etc., etc. It's a bit like your life. The only difference is the 'undercover' factor."" The same intention I think lies in the background of ""The Lord Of The Flies"" - everything is OK, those are 'just boys' playing war on an island.<br/><br/>BUT Lord of the Flies (both movies, and a book of course) makes You care about the characters. They are human containers for stories. Here in TTSS those containers could be filled with absolutely anything and it would make to you - the viewer - no difference.<br/><br/>And this is the second flaw of this movie - even being a melodrama, it's still not so good, because You just don't care about any of the characters involved in the plot. You just don't identify with those personas. I don't know why!! Everything looks fine - master-class acting, costumes, long shots to be filled with meaning. And all of the sudden you see yourself don't giving a sh*t about who is the mole and why Gary Oldman is so sad.<br/><br/>So this movie is a weird one for me - every aspect of it is brilliant, but the sum of all those diamonds gives me... nothing. Excellent cinematography - dark, majestic, sad shots. Beautifully arranged sets filled with deep meaning (chandeliers standing on the floor in close-to-final scene, or the hidden cafeteria - in the shadow of dense, jungle-like garden in one scene, and overwhelmed by huge buildings in another). Very elegant way of editing - sharp or calm, when needed. And finally - quite distinct directing, setting this whole story in bizarre, sadly dark world of nuances. It should be a brilliant movie, right? ...But it's just boring.<br/><br/>So beware - it's not a thriller. And beware again - it's not so good melodrama either. But beware last time - You SHOULD see this movie, 'cause there's definitely SOMETHING in it."

","'Lingering close-up shots of seemingly insignificant objects and shallow focus shots constantly evoke the nature of mystery and intrigue which surrounds such clandestine organisations'... said by another reviewer with absolute truth.<br/><br/>I cannot agree that this was a stunning film and I would really have liked to as I was looking forward to it. The atmosphere of seedy grey rooms and streets, suitable to the genre and era, was perfectly realised. What it lacked and caused its downfall was the absence of passion. Each character has a different passion and the film entirely failed to show this; the bond between Prideaux and Hayden was barely even hinted at. Smiley's Anne was a shadowy figure with nothing to explain the emotions and betrayal surrounding her which are key themes of the story.<br/><br/>As I was watching all I could think was that, despite good performances from Strong, Cumberbatch, Hurt and Hardy, the TV series was so much better. Oldman is without doubt a talented and chameleon actor who, perhaps due to the director, delivered an Alec Guinness impersonation instead of making the role his own. Colin Firth was bland, uncharismatic and miscast. All in all, despite a stellar cast list and story, this film misses by a mile and I'll be buying the Alec Guiness DVD.<br/><br/>Tomas Alfredson has a lot to learn."

","""Every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century - without exception - has either been crushed, overthrown, invaded, corrupted, perverted, subverted, destabilised, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one was permitted to rise or fall on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard."" - William Blum (""US military and CIA interventions since World War II"")<br/><br/>This is a review of Martin Ritt's ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" (1965) and Tomas Alfredson's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011), two films based on espionage novels by John Le Carre. <br/><br/>Arguably the finest spy movie ever made, ""Cold"" was directed by Martin Ritt. As he was loosely affiliated with various left-wing movements, Ritt was blacklisted in the 1950s. This period saw the US government putting the squeeze on worker movements, unions, civil rights activists and communist groups within the United States, as well as embarking on a (thus far) 100 year campaign to murderously eradicate the same in over 80 countries across the world. Coupled to this is/was a covert war against both independence movements and any and all threats to capitalist profit (everything from Catholic priests to Bittorrent websites). Covert US actions against Indonesia, for example, would see some 3 million killed, and the outright murdering of both the Indonesian communist party and those who supported it. Total deaths incurred over the last century, in similar actions, total more than ten million, with hundreds of millions more dying to the policies, death squads and puppet regimes subsequently erected in these targeted countries. John Stockwell, former CIA station chief, would sum up such actions thus: ""Nothing we were doing in fact defended US national security interests. Genocide is genocide. We are responsible for doing these things, on a massive scale, worldwide."" <br/><br/>Martin Ritt is yet another American director who did his best work in the 1960s and 70s. His filmography as a whole can be divided into at least three groups. One group tends to be preoccupied with watching as characters, who represent a very modern ethos of predatory capitalism, come into contact with their opposites (""Hud"", ""Brotherhood"" and ""Hombre""). Another group focuses on the lives of the marginalised, often African Americans (""Sounder"", ""Conrack"", ""The Great White Hope"" etc). Yet another group tends to deal with movements or organisations being infiltrated and undermined by the literal or figurative foot-soldiers of either communism or capitalism (""Norma Rae"", ""Molly Maguires"" etc). <br/><br/>""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" belongs to this third group. Filmed in moody blacks and whites, the film stars Richard Burton as Alec Leamas, a British Intelligence officer who embarks on a relationship with a young communist in order to infiltrate Russian Intelligence. Ironically, and to Leamas' dismay, the film climaxes with Leamas being betrayed by British Intelligence and his young lover being assassinated in order to protect the identity of a British agent. ""Return to your own side,"" a loudspeaker warns, our heroes falling prey to violent demarcations which allow for no physical or ideological crossover. For John Le Carre, there is no moral difference between West and East, and little ideological difference between the capitalist Empires and the state capitalism of a supposedly ""communist"", post-monarchist Russia. But while Le Carre skewers all idealism and belief, Ritt will not let go of personal idealism. ""Americans fight for ignorance, we for truth and societal growth,"" he has characters say, and his Soviet Union is presented less as a bogeyman than as a hangdog family that is perpetually hounded from outside.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, ""Cold"" represents Ritt at the height of his powers. Antonioni with cloaks and daggers, the film treats us to several wonderful long-takes, and is obsessed with literal and symbolic borders, doubles, barriers and crossings. Elsewhere everyone in British Intelligence has an opposite number within the Soviet Union, East and West playing shadowy games rife with feints and parries, bluffs and double-bluffs. And like all of Ritt's films, ""Cold"" is haunted by the possibility of the mole, the double agent, ideology always paranoid and fearful, not only of its own inadequacies, but of contamination.<br/><br/>""Cold"" (1965) recalls Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Army of Shadows"" (1969), but works best as an antidote to the James Bond movies, which opened in 1962. Where Bond is the product of a culture of commodities and swollen egos, ""Cold"" does everything it can to portray the West as a shadowy prison-yard of anguish, rage and malaise. This quiet suffering is conveyed well by Burton, whose casting recalls the spiritual and emotional currents of Britain's class conscious New Wave movements, as well as his own role in Antonioni's ""Red Desert"" (1964), released one year earlier.<br/><br/>""Cold"" is slow and demands attention, but ultimately rewards its audience. Less satisfying is Tomas Alfredson's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", an interesting film which tries a little too hard to mimic Ritt's aesthetic. Revolving around George Smiley (Gary Oldman), a British Intelligence operative who comes out of retirement in order to find a mole responsible for leaking information to Russia, the film is less a witch-hunt than a depressing procedural in which East and West debase themselves in the name of what one character calls an ""arbitrary aesthetic choice"". ""Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"" Smiley outright says. Without Ritt to temper such moral equivalences the film then ends on a note of nihilism, but a powerful one nonetheless, secret agents faking embraces and playing games of seduction at midnight dances.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""<br/><br/>10/10 – ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"""

","I'm going to be perfectly truthful, I didn't understand and absorb all the information that was thrown at me during Tinker Tailor Solider Spy. It's sometimes a mess to keep the characters straight and a struggle to keep yourself engaged, but your forbearance may be worth the pros Tinker Tailor Solider Spy has to offer. It does have an interesting spy story, a mysterious mood orchestrated by the director, and it boasts the performance from Gary Oldman. It's the best male performance of 2011, so naturally filled with a character that has a lot to say. His monologue Oldman delivers is easily the highlight of the film. The technicals are well executed, too, they create a marvelous mood. Tinker Tailor Solider Spy is well directed, contains more- than-quality acting, an interesting story, but for some reason it almost puts you in a comatose state in frequently during its duration.

"donuthaters12","9","1","2","2 July 2013"," Solid film with a few issues
","Coming off the heels of his highly acclaimed film, Let The Right One In, his next film would be very highly anticipated and the expectations would be higher as this would be his first English film. This film was also my introduction to his works as I have not seen any of his previous films but only have acknowledged it. I have owned this film for quite some time now and I have watched it at least 3 to 4 times. Each time I watch this, I understand the film's plot and the characters a little more; and at the same time not losing it's entertainment value.<br/><br/>In the simplest terms, the plot of this film is for Smiley (Gary Oldman) to identify the mole, that is suspected from Control (John Hurt), within the 'Circus' (MI6). The film was based off John le Carré's novel and rewritten for the screen by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan. I cannot say whether their screenplay is faithful to novel as I have not read it but I can definitely say that their work is fantastic. So much of the dialogue speaks so much about the characters and story is unfolded in a way that doesn't feel forced. This film barely consists anything action, and when it does, it's more heartbreaking rather than pumping you up. If the dialogue didn't work then the film would collapse. I hoped that the film ran a bit longer to explore more on the suspects to prevent predictability on who the mole may be but the result was not too bad and definitely still enjoyable. My main issue with the script is that there are some plot holes that can be resolved either by knowing the source material or having a sequel that explores it further. These areas are revolved around Karla as not much is explained about it but rather it is an important piece of the puzzle.<br/><br/>Not a bad way to start your English film-making career. Alfredson successfully created something that is suspenseful and engaging. Alfredson wanted this film to be slow, not for pretension, but rather giving us time to take in the new things that are fed to us by the conversations. This film is done stylishly that fits well with the setting and tone, rather than something that is obvious and forced.<br/><br/>The way this film was edited is a bit confusing, especially in the first viewing, but after the initial run through, the subsequent times this is watched will not be at all confusing as it starts to become a little cohesive. It is still a chore though, in trying to follow and takes you out of the film for a bit. It didn't bother me as much it did with other people but I did notice it and I did find it slightly annoying.<br/><br/>Hoyte Van Hoytema has had experience with Alfredson in his previous film, so they both have an understanding with each other. Hoytema also directed David O' Russell's 'The Fighter', which was a favorite of mine. In this film, Hoytema has employed a slick style of photography in order to have that classy and mysterious feel to it. He uses shots that move quite slowly and sometimes uses zooming as a tool to avoid the feeling of stillness, that would definitely make the film even slower than it already is. Hoytema did a terrific job for this film and deserves a lot of credit for this film.<br/><br/>The score of this film, by composer Aalberto Iglesias, is not something that I took notice when watching this and is not very memorable to me. I can say that it did suit the style that Alfredson was going for but I hoped for something a little more than what he did for this film.<br/><br/>The cast of this film is amazing, and something that any director would die for. Each one brings their best and each one should be somewhat awarded in some way. The most notable ones are Oldman, Hurt, Cumberbatch, Strong, Hardy and Dencik. It is either they all have some sort of chemistry with each other or that the director demands these performances out of all of them. I like to believe it was both. It was nice to see that there was more to these characters than what was expected from them.<br/><br/>This film needs to be watched more than once as, most likely, you may have missed important information that adds to the story and the characters. A film that has a style of its own supported with an appropriate score and a moving photography. It has a wide and award deserving performances from almost the entire cast. Not something to be ignored, give this film a watch."

","In seventies England, the Circus, the nickname for the British Intelligence Agency, has taken a hit. In Hungary, a top official was to give some important information to the Limies. But, something went wrong and folks ended up dead. Therefore, the leader, Control (John Hurt) is asked to step down and so is his right hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman). However, it becomes apparent that they were wrongly blamed for another government official suspects a ""mole"", a double agent. On the sly, this man comes to the retired Smiley and asks him to re-enter the Curcus quietly, to seek out this traitor. At first, Smiley is very reluctant, for his dismissal stung. Yet, he agrees to do it. Traveling from Hungary to Russia to other venues closer to home, Smiley learns how to untangle a very elaborate web of deceit. Along the way, George hears of lovely Russian ladies who risked their lives to help, logs that have pages ripped out, and former spies hiding in plain sight as school teachers. Can he do so before other lives are lost? This film is a quietly impressive work but, it is so complex that one would need to view it multiple times. The cast is a large asset, with Oldman leading the way indeed. Colin Firth, Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran hinds, and many others give great performances, too. Also, the movie has an atmospheric quality that has to been seen to be appreciated. It re-creates the seventies well and shows that most agents try to stay as ""invisible"" in their jobs to the point of blandness until a crisis occurs. Yes, there are various settings, too, but sometimes these are not the best the countries featured have to offer. Most importantly, the story is worthy of much praise, in its twists, turns, and revelations. An ending scene, where an agent is gunned down silently, is most sensational. One must honor the director, too, for taking a difficult book and bringing it to life. All in all, here is a film for those who aren't afraid to watch a tale that has hidden depths."
"SerpentMage","9","1","2","17 January 2013"," Very good movie where I could not guess the ending...
","I watch many movies, and for the most part movies are fairly predictable. I can usually see the ending coming a mile away. The fact that I can does not detract from enjoying the movie since some movies while being predictable are rather well made.<br/><br/>This movie is different. It is made in the classical English style, even thinking this movie was made in the UK. Real UK movies are not North American movies as evidenced by say 4 Lions, or the series Utopia. Real UK acting tends to be slower and works the mind both in laughter and in seriousness. There is also less reliance on effects and props to tide the movie through.<br/><br/>Having said all that Tinker Tailor Solider Spy was a good movie. I enjoyed it and was thinking, so who did it, and why. The twists and turns were very nice and made you think quite a bit about what would happen next.<br/><br/>This movie is not a Bourne style movie (even though I thoroughly enjoyed those movies). It is closer to something like the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in revealing its plot. Overall I enjoyed the movie."

Nevertheless, I had a very difficult time following the plot of this film.<br/><br/>The 2-3 pages worth of User Reviews I just read seem to be split between high praise and full-out criticism.

","The critics were certainly correct about the tense atmosphere and the rather morose feeling engendered by the drab, brown, smoke-filled rooms that feature so much in this film. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy evoked the atmosphere of my youth to a degree, probably more so than the TV adaptation. It is apparently set in the 1970s although I took the drab colours as being more indicative of the 50s. <br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good from a stellar cast and the story gradually unfolds with the director maintaining a felling of tension throughout. It is a good yarn well told. <br/><br/>However, there were a few things that I did find a little bit disappointing:<br/><br/><ul><li>The dull brown settings which were so interesting to start with, became rather tedious after a while. I am, not convinced that everything was brown in the 70s.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After over 2 hours, I really did not feel that I knew any of the main characters (even Smiley) other than at a very superficial level.</li></ul><br/><br/>-The frequent use of flashbacks was rather disorientating and I am not convinced that some of them added anything to the storytelling.<br/><br/>I was initially worried about seeing Gary Oldman in the George Smiley role, so brilliantly portrayed by Sir Alec Guiness in the TV series. It turned out that Oldman was well up to the task and made a very credible Smiley. Was it as good as the TV series? Possibly not, but then the TV series had the advantage of having 3 times as long to develop the themes and characters. But it was a creditable effort."

","I suspect that if you've read the novel, or seen the mini series, then Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a thoroughly enjoyable watch. For my sins, I have not, so my review is from that perspective.<br/><br/>I'll admit that knowing the plot outline of George Smiley needing to root out the mole from four suspects, and seeing Firth, Strong, Cumberbatch and Hardy on the cast list, I was excited. It's possible that my assumption that there was correlation in the fours was part of my issue. However I don't think so. Perhaps the characters played by Hardy and Strong are the most charismatic, or have the most interesting story in the original source material. However when squeezing it all into a two hour movie, you need to reduce things to the bare bones. Ultimately from that respect, this movie spent far too much time concentrating on two characters who weren't really that relevant to the main plot. The result was that we had very little screen time with the suspects and were given little opportunity to join in with George on his investigation.<br/><br/>In the end, due to the way the story was cut down for the movie, it played out that two very simple steps from George revealed the culprit. Steps which he actually could have taken right at the start of his investigation.<br/><br/>The acting was superb as you would expect (Oldman's subtle performance against type was particularly impressive), and the sense of time and place at the height of the cold war was captured perfectly. Ultimately though, this came across too much like a film solely for existing fans of the book. And to be honest, what's the point of that?"

Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.<br/><br/>Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense.

However, that is exactly what I watch Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy for - to experience the complexities and the scale of the plot itself. If it was not so complicated, then the very idea and point of the film would be defeated. A war of espionage would never be simple and straight forward. A highly intelligent story is combined with a simply marvellous choice of actors. Gary Oldman and John Hurt are outstanding. I dislike the reviews that many people submit - stating that it has completely destroyed the original. It was never designed to be the original in a film context - it was designed to present the story in a new light. <br/><br/>Another admirable aspect of this film is the authenticity - that feeling of Britain in the 1970s - having lost an empire - trying to find a place in the world.

How on earth could anyone possibly have worked out who the mole was, except by guessing. There was virtually no background at all on any of the characters. There was no suspense, no excitement no anything. No I nearly forgot, there was a moment when Benedict Cumberpatch is required to illicitly steal some information for Gary Oldman (George Smiley), but that was pretty much it."

","There is a lot of spoilers a review for a film like this can provide but i will try my best not to spoil anything. <br/><br/>The plot of this film centers around an intelligent agent trying to find a mole which is high up in the ""circus"" (a fictional MI5 agency). Saying that, the film is way more complex and confusing then the one line synopsis i wrote and has so many layers for us, the audience to explore. <br/><br/>I love this film so much i can write a novel praising this film but there is a character limit. <br/><br/>Firstly, if you haven't read the book, you are not at any disadvantage for not knowing it in depth like some other books i am not going to name (Harry Potters).<br/><br/>First of all, the directing is just amazing and i think is the star of this star studded film. The way we feel like an outsider peeking in to this world of betrayal and deception. <br/><br/>The acting is just phenomenal from Gary Oldman who i think was robbed from an Oscar because he inhabited the role and Lt. Gordon or the corrupt cop from Leon disappeared and he has now developed another iconic figure in his legendary career. This has got to be the best British cast in a film and if you are looking at this review... Then you probably know who is in it.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is highly recommended and is a fantastic watch, but if you are looking for an action, adrenaline rush. The go to Blockbusters and rent Transformers. If you want a fascinating, brilliantly made film, then give this one a shot."

","""Tinker, Tailor"" reflects both a past era in real life and in cinematography/film life. Magnificent photography and an all star British cast manage to bring back to life the - not so long ago - era of the Cold War. When all is said and done the viewer realizes he just bore witness to an evolving spider web, where actions, looks, pauses, even clothing and style speak much more than words. What is said is not only secondary, but some times it is also beside the point... And when ""La mer"", written by Charles Trenet, is heard during the final sequence of the film, everything becomes clear. The sea of oblivion, kind to some, ruthless to most, will crash onto the rocks on the shore and leave behind only an echo in time. Those with the ""correct"" ears can still hear it and those with the ""correct"" eyes, like Smiley, can still see through the looking glass."

There are lots of names (also nicknames) and events can easily confuse minds because we are lack of character descriptions. When reading the book, I guess all the characters were picturized well so when a dialog comes through about who is doing what than we could understand the situation easily.

"gradyharp","8","1","2","21 March 2012"," Intense, Relentless Intrigue
","TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a challenging cinematic interpretation of John le Carré's novel of the same name, This is not an action movie: this is a quiet study of how the intelligence operations of several countries function - slowly, quietly, secretly, mesmerizingly, and occultly. To fully comprehend the complex story it would be best to read the novel first: the film condenses a long tale into just over 2 hours and for the uninitiated this can result in a conundrum of semi-fleshed out events. But if you are in for an intense psychological drama that requires 100% of your attention then this is a movie to savor.<br/><br/>One aspect of the confusion that accompanies this film's story is the random uses of time changes - some things are shown in various stages of their development as they affect the story and some remain in the present, giving a time travel feel to the film. Odd little bits of action clarify this for the viewer: in the opening of the film George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is fitted for new glasses (a very fine bit of photography form cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema) and that is the clue that when he is wearing his new glasses we are in the present and not in a flashback.<br/><br/>As for story it is fairly well known: we are in the Cold War in the 1970s and Control (John Hurt), the irascible Head of the British Intelligence resigns after a botched attempt to ferret out a mole in Hungary by sending Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on a mission. Prideaux is killed. Convinced there is a Russian agent serving as a mole Control brings on George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to investigate a story agent Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) feels compelled to share. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding the mole. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco. And on it goes with the resolution of events offered to the viewer behind the same sort of shady gauze that hides much of the work of Intelligence.<br/><br/>The strong cast includes key roles by Toby Jones, David Dencik, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth and Simon McBurney. Though Gary Oldman's performance is definitely worthy of the praise he has received, it is the performance by Tom Hardy that sets a level of excellence to which all the other actors must strive to achieve. Have a good night's sleep that night before viewing, a couple of strong cups of coffee, and stay hyper alert: the film is well worth exploring and digesting. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"flundran","9","1","2","9 March 2012"," Subtle and classy
","A spy thriller by a director who trusts the skill of his actors, the strength of the story, and - not least - the intelligence of the audience. Wow! The acting is subtle but convincing - the performances are so good all around that it's hard to pick a favourite. Alfredsson's storytelling is minimalistic. He doesn't offer contrived scenes with characters explaining the plot at length; this movie requires its audience to pay attention in order to catch the fine detail, which is often only hinted at.<br/><br/>The movie seems to move along quite slowly, but the story is actually told at a tremendous pace. I was particularly struck by the absence of gratuitous violence - the few violent scenes are brief, and brutally realistic. In this movie, violence isn't intended to entertain, but to horrify.<br/><br/>Add to all that a great photo, and the result can only be top marks - this is a great movie!"
"myungjahigh","7","1","2","28 February 2012"," confusing but interesting
","While watching the movie, I was so confused to understand how the story goes. Also, as a foreign audience, i had some troubles to remember and tell the characters' last names, first names, secret code names, etc. I had not read the books, and maybe that's the reason why i felt this film is quite hard to follow... my brain went through the tough time.<br/><br/>However, I also think that it is very worth to watch it, because I might have unconsciously felt that movies on spy are supposed to be splendid and full of visually thrilling stuff. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy actually broke the stereotype, and i'm grateful. Besides, in fact there are lots of scenes which make my palms sweaty even though the movies go so calm and silent all the time. This is very interesting and brilliant. I think this movie is one you should watch if interested in spy genres. Though the movie seems to struggle to carry the whole story of books in it, i would like to applaud the director and the writer for their talents in telling the story. Also, all the actors did so great jobs in this film. I loved their works."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","2","24 February 2012"," Slow-paced Drama, but Enjoyable Nonetheless
","There's a right and wrong way to do a remake. For example, you don't take a creepy, slow-paced Swedish film called Let the Right One In and hand it off a year later to the creator of ""Felicity."" Instead, you take a classic TV drama made over 30 years ago (plenty of time to bottle age properly) and hand it off to the brilliant director of a creepy, slow-paced Swedish film.<br/><br/>Like all spy movies, there's a mole and it must be trapped. Why can't there be a spy movie where everybody is who they say they are and you can trust everyone? Hmm? I think it's called a Western. Anyway, it's the Cold War era and there's a Soviet spy in MI6. George Smiley is Britishly coaxed out of retirement to take care of the situation, and (SPOILER) he does.<br/><br/>As spy movies go, this one isn't high on drama. It's a very well crafted, clever film but did not have me on the edge of my seat. That's what Mission Impossible movies are for. This movie was also pitched early as a ""thinking"" movie and I completely disagree. Sure, it wasn't laid out for you in every detail, but the investigative work done by Smiley makes sense and has good results. Story-wise, I didn't see it as being a great choice for Best Picture©. Where the movie really got my attention was the characters. I swear this movie had every great British actor since ever. Their attention to detail on the subtlety of the characters, especially by Oldman, convincingly put the movie its proper era – a time of tense distrust and unease.<br/><br/>I also thought the film had a nice high-grain look that lent itself to feeling like you were watching a period film. Hoyte Van Hoytema, the Cinematographer, was the fine gentleman that shot The Fighter as well as Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In (can you tell I'm a fan?). Add to that great costuming, nice hair, and you've got a realistic piece. Just once I'd like to see costume design win an Oscar for a movie depicting 20 or 30 years back instead of Victorian or Elizabethan times.<br/><br/>All in all, an enjoyable film. I have not seen the original series or read the source text, but it seems to be a crowd pleaser from that respect. I'd probably get better insight into the subtleties of the characters, but it would also ruin the ending so that's my defense of going in to a remake unprepared."
"Gilliam123","8","1","2","16 February 2012"," Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
","This film never came to local cinemas, but I thought it looked great, so when it came out to rent I got it straight out to watch. For anyone who doesn't know it's based on a John LeCare novel in which detective George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is brought out of semi-retirement by Control (John Hurt) to find the mole in the British government out of 5 liable suspects(Bill Haydon, played by Colin Firth, Roy Bland, played by Ciaran Hinds, Percy Alleline, played by Toby Jones, Toby Esterhase, played by David Dencik and Smiley himself). The film is exquisitely directed by Thomas Alfredson, who obviously knows LeCare's novel very well. It's a line up of an acclaimed Swedish director with a collection of the best British character actors, and it pays off. Smiley gets straight on with his investigation, being assisted by younger detective Peter Guillaum (Benedict Cumberbatch) and young apprentice Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), who has recently returned to Britain after receiving information about the mole while being in Istanbul. The suspects themselves, are very one-dimensional, and aren't given very much time to shine. Despite this, I liked that by the end of the film, you are almost certain who the mole isn't, it turns of to be them. All the performances are strong, but for me Cumberbatch and Oldman carried the film. I've never seen Alec Guiness play anyone buy obi-wan Kenobi or Prince Feisal, but I imagine his shoes would be very hard to fill, but Oldman does it so well. Benedict Cumberbatch's character is the youngest main character, and gets all the cool ties and a Beatle's haircut. As they have said in proper reviews, TV's Sherlock is Smiley's Watson. Mark Strong also appears as a betrayed teacher who becomes a primary school teacher, a 2nd plot line which helps cut away from the heavy detective work. All in all, TTSS is a very powerful, well made and entertaining film which contains almost no guns (with the exception of one scene), blood, swearing or sex and is definitely a DVD purchase for me. The ending of the film is perhaps my favourite part, and sets it up nicely for a sequel film, which Oldman said he would be interested in making. Can't wait!"
"JohnRayPeterson","7","1","2","13 February 2012"," A cerebral film, pleasure for the connoisseur
","There are at the very least two good reasons for choosing to see this movie. First, it's a John le Carré novel based movie; those who are fans (countless), need no further explanation. For those who don't know the works (not literary inclined), you may have watched other movies based on his work, such as 'The Tailor of Panama', 'The Russia House', 'The Constant Gardner', and for the more mature crowd, 'The Little Drummer Girl' and 'The Spy Who Came In from The Cold'. The works, except for only a few, are espionage thrillers, but not the Ian Fleming/James Bond sort; these are more psychological thrillers than action thrillers. They are cerebral and require a reasonable attention span, well maybe a bit more. The pay-off for those who like these works is simple; at the end, you feel satisfied much in the same way as if you had solved a puzzle or won a game of strategy. If you're a bit geeky, you might say, you get a 'rush', okay .The second reason to pick this movie is the outstanding cast; Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth are first rate in any movie, any, and Tom Hardy is no slouch either. If that wasn't enough, the director Tomas Alfredson does a superb job of getting maximum effect from that cast. I've seen just one other movie by that director, 'Let The Right One In' and he can navigate the realm of the dark with a certain flair.<br/><br/>You can expect some ambiguous scenes, a necessary form to maintain the audience in captive mode, and great if you later reflect on them or discuss the story with friends. You will not forget such movie. None of the characters escape unscathed in the stories, and in this one in particular, thus the movie feels real, not a fantasy. The characters are like pieces in a chess game and in this film the metaphor is even used with brilliant subtlety. No surprise le Carré fans love his work. I could go on and on. If what I've described sounds the least bit interesting, then see it. Don't just take my word, read a few other reviews and critics; you'll see."
"runamokprods","8","1","2","9 February 2012"," I liked this. A lot. But I wish I could have outright loved it.
","The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this passive. But this man is very actively passive. He may not move physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc. <br/><br/>And the film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige and brown mazes. <br/><br/>But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are (intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into the emotional or unshakably memorable either. <br/><br/>I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker, Tailor"" has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation. Paradoxically, by not having to rush through a story this dense, there was room to really feel and experience it, instead of just working to keep up with it and take it in. <br/><br/>But all that said, this is a refreshingly smart, adult, well-made and challenging film in a world with far too few."
"dfle3","7","1","2","8 February 2012"," A slow burn mystery...
","As with the last film I saw at the cinema recently (Hugo), this is another movie which has a leisurely, if not genteel pace. In my brief notes for this film I make a faux pas...I assumed it was based on fact. Not sure why I would think that...I've never seen any version of this story before, but maybe some names from it had seeped into my consciousness, like ""Smiley"", perhaps.<br/><br/>Even though this is an English spy story, it's unlike the kind which are usually brought to mind by that phrase (such as the James Bond series). There are some moments of shocking violence in this movie or the aftermath of same, but they are spaced at long intervals. If you are patient, the main 'hook' of this movie is guessing who the mole or double agent in the highest reaches of Britain's secret service is. However, I don't think that this is a 'proper' whodunnit movie, as in the viewer being presented with clues which allows one to deduce who the mole is. <br/><br/>That's the thrust of this story...after a British operative is killed in an overseas operation, none of the senior spooks of 'The circus' (the name the spies give to their organisation) are immune from suspicion. So, a recently retired spook is brought in to find the traitor.<br/><br/>Personally I found this a bit hard to follow...if I'd made my faux pas here, I would have said a documentary form would have been a better way to know what happened, assuming one was interested in the facts of the case. Some of the senior spooks seem like likely candidates for the mole...I'd often find myself looking to one or other spook and hypothesising them to be the mole. In a sense the clues are 'red herrings', but in another sense they are merely misdirections, as the suspect could have legitimate reasons for acting in a way which may cast suspicion on their motives. Anyway, my hypotheses did get a bit silly at times!<br/><br/>The movie itself looks like it could have been shot in the late 1960s or into the 1970s. The narrative is told in an elliptical manner...certain events and details being returned to, on occasion. <br/><br/>There are some interesting titbits in this movie...be interesting to know if they have a factual basis...e.g. the staff of The Circus singing the Soviet anthem! (I think that that's what it is!) and what we learn of American torture techniques, which sound ghastly. Also liked the line in this movie about choosing sides in the Cold War ""It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one"".<br/><br/>One of the failings of this movie, I think, is that it's not always clear what is happening in it...there's one scene where the man investigating The Circus for the mole - George Smiley, I believe, played by Gary Oldman - is upset by seeing a woman fondled by another man. I had no idea who the woman was and perhaps the man touching her either. I can presume who she was and the man too, but really, the audience should have been explicitly shown who these people were so that they would know why Smiley was upset. If details were given, then due to the leisurely pace of the movie, one could assume that we would have forgotten this information...hence a reminder being given to us would have been useful.<br/><br/>Some irrelevant observations: <br/><br/>Toby Jones - played by Percy Alleline - reminded me of the actor Dick van Patten! <br/><br/>Peter Guillam - played by Benedict Cumberbatch - reminded me of the actor Glenn Robbins...in Kel mode...or the guy who did the daggy dancing in the Fast Forward sketch series, I believe! I think it was Guillam who gave me this impression...didn't make a note on it...and it relates to my point of feeling in the dark about these people...difficult keeping tabs on all of them...who they are...what they do etc.<br/><br/>Was amused by the use of the song ""The second best secret agent in the whole wide world""...might be interesting to look these lyrics up!<br/><br/>Anyway, I was glad I didn't make the faux pas of including in my notes the observation that it was ""odd"" that the film had the usual disclaimer at the end credits about it being a work of fiction...PHEW!"

There was no chase scenes, shootouts-and thank god because I find now a lot of movies are under that genre and it's almost too straightforward at times.<br/><br/>At the slower pace, I was able to pick up the subtle clues presented, such as the look on the character's face, or the way they're dress (to indicate if it was a flashback or not. The suspense was wonderful that it wasn't a boiling point like some movies, it unfolded as you were reading a book.<br/><br/>I would see it again on DVD because-I loved it, and also to pick up on the clues that I did miss.

"leif.hellstrom","Null","1","2","6 February 2012"," A major disappointment
","There is no two ways about it, this version was a disappointment. The production values were top notch but somehow it seemed to skip over the story with no real substance.<br/><br/>What I found particularly frustrating was the total lack of character introduction and development in most cases. This was particularly noticeable with the four main suspects, a couple of which hardly have speaking parts at all. Half way through the film, I was still trying to figure out who was who in some cases. It would have been nice with a simple shot of each person, with someone addressing them by name, or something equally simple.<br/><br/>And why have some of the book's locations been switched, apparently for no good reason. Thus Prague has become Budapest, and Lisbon has become Istanbul. Perhaps it is just a case of filming convenience.<br/><br/>The film is shot for cinema (obviously) and this means it doesn't always work that well on CD. It can get murky and rather distant. And don't get me started on the miniature subtitles.<br/><br/>Sorry, but even allowing for the constraints of a film rather than a miniseries, I think this was only a so-so-effort."

I do understand that some people found this to be a dull movie, if you are mentally unable to understand the plot you will not like this as it doesn't have big explosions or BS dialog between would be actors.

","The international espionage seen in most of movies is basically car chases, action scenes and shootings. This one on the contrary, based on a John Le Carre's novel, is totally different, full of weary and normal men, having meetings in sealed rooms and strange conversations in obscure corners of London. Everything's perfect with this direction (Tomas Alfredson) and this screenplay. The camera moves in a sinister fashion, rooms are full of smoke and fear, and - overall - all the characters are real. ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is exactly right, faithful to the tone set by the novel. The viewer will see a huge number of events, characters and possibilities. Usual and ordinary spy movies have scenes that keep audience oriented, that's why they end up not looking real, whereas in this story every piece of information is mixed and meshed, forcing the viewer to think and making every performance believable."

It was hardly confusing--there are 2 story lines which intersect eventually, and flashback scenes which you can tell are flashbacks by watching Smiley's glasses. <br/><br/>The slower pace allows you to drank in the seventies London scenery and permits the tension to build immeasurably.

","This is an excellent movie, don't get me wrong. I loved the cinematography and the acting was superb. To fully review all of these points you would have to write an article that would be too long for this review.<br/><br/>What I want to write about though are the changes from the novel-Version. And I don't refer to the fact that George Smiley was always described as a little overweight...<br/><br/>The Scene, in which Smiley refers to his encounter with the Soviet head of intelligence was explicitly narrated in the novel, whereas in the movie version, it was just a short narration of Gary Oldman. Although the movie generally uses lots of flashbacks, this is where I really missed it! (Although it is great that you never see the antagonist...this could have been achieved differently).<br/><br/>Other more substantial changes have been made to the story of Jim Prideux (Mark Strong) that did in my opinion not help the movie-version. It even left out a lot of action-scenes which could have made the movie a little more thrilling. I get it that this is not supposed to be a James-Bond clone, but you kind of expect a little action in a Spy-Thriller, don't you? Although it is possible that by my high expectations (I really loved the novel) prevented me from making up a balanced opinion, I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, if I had not read the novel I doubt that I would have understood it completely on first viewing...<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is still an excellent movie, but it should have stuck a little closer to the novel."
"TooDrunkToWalk","7","1","2","9 January 2012"," An Unflattering Remake of the original
","I have seen the TV Series and while there are some variations in the story, they are very minor ones, and the movie is essentially a scene by scene copy of the TV series. Sure there are some differences and the scenes have been made smaller and all that, but every scene is there in the TV series in one form or the other.<br/><br/>However this is not why I am saying the TV series was better. Given the scenes are same, there is a better effect in the TV series, than in the movie. The performances are so much better in the TV series. Percy Alleline in the movie is not even anywhere close to the Percy Alleline of the TV Series. Control, a one man empire, who was fast losing control of everything around him, and who took an all or nothing gamble is just way better portrayed in the TV series. Control in the movie just comes off as arrogant, and fails to gain any sympathy from the audience. The TV series control even though he was even more of a sod, always had sympathy from the viewer. The conversation between Bill Hayden and Smiley, at the end is just so much more meaningful and deep and poignant in the TV series, and is one of the highlights for me, it just seems so pointless, in the movie. It would make no difference if it wasn't there.<br/><br/>Take the individual scenes, for instance, take the scene where Peter Guillam has to meet, the four after he has stolen the log file, and if you compare the scene in the Series, and in the movie, the TV scene comes off a thousand times better. In fact I can't remember one scene in the movie which comes off as better than the TV series.<br/><br/>The entire power struggle between Control and Alleline, which makes us understand why a desperate Control, the head of British Intelligence, would take such an all or nothing gamble, as gone missing, and really Control's actions, in the movie make no sense to me.<br/><br/>Even Oldman as George Smiley is only a shadow of Smiley's TV Verison. The Smiley in the TV Series never raises his voice, the look in his eyes change and thats all you need to convey to you that he is angry, happy, stern or amiable, and he could move between one to the other almost at the flick of a switch. Hearing Gary Oldman raise his voice and shout is just plain not George Smiley. Bill Hayden in the TV Series, as laughing and amiable agent, is so much better than the movie one, even though this was played by an Acedemy Award winning actor.<br/><br/>The four main characters Alleline, Hayden, Control and Smiley are way better in the TV series than anything I saw in the movie. Even the supporting cast, Prideaux and Guillam, happen to be way better in the TV series. Though two be honest, Prideax and Guillam are the ones who come closest to emulating their counterparts from the TV series, but still fall some way short. Benedict Cumberbatch does his growing reputation no harm, and for me he is the stand out performance in the movie.<br/><br/>As for Tom Hardy, I wonder why he took the role at all.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the TV Series, then you will no doubt like the movie and perhaps rate it at 8, but having seen the series this would be nothing more than a 6.7 at best for me. Though I admit that would be a little harsh on the movie, as I am letting my TV series experience in the way.<br/><br/>I will therefore rate it at 7/10.<br/><br/>Last word, if you have not yet seen this Movie, then I suggest you watch the TV series, its the original product and the movie falls well short of getting anywhere near it. If you have seen the TV Series, then I suggest don't bother watching this rather cheap imitation."

","The night I saw ""Tinker,"" four people walked out halfway through it. Another person was heard to say, ""This movie sucks."" So it's not for everyone. But for the right viewer, it is two hours well spent. Each scene is brisk and highly polished. Skillfully assembled, the whole really shines. Perhaps its most effective storytelling device is a series of flashbacks to an office Christmas party. These, largely wordless, fill out the tale. And ""wordless"" is key. Many of the scenes don't have a lot of dialogue, and when people do talk, every word counts. So what this film mainly requires is attention. Without it, you will miss one of the best things about ""Tinker"": Gary Oldman's microscopic performance."
"Reel_starz","8","1","2","8 January 2012"," Tinker, Tailor spins tangled web of intrigue, betrayal and frosty brilliance
","In a way, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is one of those movies that's easier to admire than to love. From a technical standpoint, it's pitch-perfect with a top-notch cast of actors who effortlessly burrow into their parts without any of the usual ""look at me!"" theatrics, sets and costumes that meticulously recreate Cold War Europe and subtly elegant cinematography, all blended together with precision by a promising, up-and-coming director. Yet, it's not the type of film that will inspire feelings of warmth or ecstasy from many moviegoers, more likely to leave them wandering out of the theater deep in thought than giddy or excited. In most movies, the stern aloofness that pervades Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy would be a drawback, preventing the audience from connecting with or caring about the characters, but in this case, it works, effectively creating an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust where the viewer is as wary of the characters as they are of each other.<br/><br/>Based on the well-respected novel of the same name by former spy John le Carre, Tomas Alfredson's adapation manages to strip down le Carre's book to its bare bones – every scene, line of dialogue and gesture feels absolutely essential to furthering either plot or character, often both – without sacrificing its complexity or nuance. The story is elaborate, though its basic premise can be boiled down to ""there's a mole at the Circus"", code for British intelligence agency MI6, and as condescending as it sounds, it requires the audience to not only pay attention, but to think. At the center of it all is the famed George Smiley, played by Gary Oldman in what is probably the most low-key performance of his career, a stark contrast from the deliciously over-the-top grandiosity he has developed a reputation for over the past three decades. With his large, plastic-framed glasses, nondescript suits and soft-spoken manner, Smiley is reminiscent of an owl: outwardly, he's passive and remarkably still, virtually blending into the background, but there's also an aura of wisdom, the kind that comes with age and world experience, surrounding him; you can sense that he's constantly thinking, observing. Oldman conveys all this perfectly, easily inhabiting a role that should, but likely won't, earn him a long-awaited Oscar nomination. He's accompanied by a stellar supporting cast of some of the best British actors working today, including veterans John Hurt and Colin Firth, rising stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy, the always reliable character actor Toby Jones and Mark Strong, whose role here is the best he's gotten since first appearing on most people's radars in Ridley Scott's decent but otherwise unremarkable Body of Lies.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is a lot like the character of Smiley. On the surface, it's positively serene, but underneath, there's so much going on that it can be hard to keep track of it all as tension quietly builds toward the gripping climax, which features not a shootout or frenetic car chase, but a waiting game. It's a labyrinthine mind puzzle as tightly constructed and methodical as the clocks ticking in the background of several scenes. Making his English-language debut after receiving much acclaim for the vampire coming-of-age movie Let the Right One In, Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson proves himself to be a master of silence, of revealing everything using virtually nothing. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the definition of a slow-burner, but for those willing to be patient and attentive, it offers ample rewards."

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one of the most cautiously filmed films of 2011. It is tightly woven together, with some incredible editing, cinematography, and set design. It plunges you into the atmosphere of the Cold War days, and has a screenplay worth discussing and really digging into. It's also one of the most interesting films of the year, if only because it has such a carefully-plotted story that requires multiple viewings. I was never once bored by the film, but I didn't really get lost into everything that was happening. I was sort of watching it from a distance, and feel that a rewatch is in order, for very soon as well. But this also makes it stand apart from many other films I have seen this year. The entire cast is great, and Oldman is a strong lead with his carefully-moving eyes and meaningful face expressions. I honestly don't feel as if I can say any more. This is definitely worth watching, but for those wanting to have an easy viewing for once will be disappointed. It's one of those films you respect more than you love, but I think there's plenty worth digging here."

","I wanted to love this film, but found it quite frustrating from the start. Having not read the book, I avoided reading too many reviews--and found the story to be very interesting overall--but painfully complex. We never get a real sense of the characters--thus we can appreciate none of them personally and we don't really get much clarity about what is going on and what relationships are driving peoples' actions. The story would be much more interesting if the director gave us more to attach on to. But we both felt weary with the long and laboring plot and faded old school Brit characters to ever appreciate what could have been a great spy film. I have 100 questionsvand little emotion other than frustration after seeing this highly lauded film--Oldman may charm the Academy with his subtle character, but it's hard to care when it feels like you are watching a wax museum of spy films. We tried to enjoy, but left the theater with angst. Great story, painfully plodding and complex direction muddies it up!"
"SPLeo","Null","1","2","3 October 2011"," Two-pace movie
","I can understand why people have difficulties with this movie: it has dual-pacing. There are sequences in which important plot points are covered and gone in less than five seconds (what happens to Control, the vital knock on Smiley's door etc), which means that if you're not paying attention, you lose your grip on the story and are unlikely to retrieve it. But then there are long, languid scenes which convey the dreary essence of day-to-day espionage. These are the sequences which, I suspect, lead some in the audience to think that the movie itself is slow and boring. Keeping track of the blink-and-its-gone stuff and coping with the long, soporific stretches mean that Tinker, Tailor demands a lot of work from the audience to get the best out of it. Not everyone is prepared to work that hard, I guess. Should they have to? Your call. One major relief is that it isn't a film filled with explosions and car chases, tailored to the tastes of 14-year-old boys, who generally can't tell the difference between a good movie and an empty movie."

","If you've seen the 1979 TV series or read the book, you are likely to remember from the outset which of the quartet of suspects is the Kim Philby character, the 'mole' at the heart of British Intelligence in the middle of the Cold War. If you haven't seen the series or read the book - and maybe even if you have - the labyrinthine story and the opaque Pinteresque script of this new cinema version probably won't make much sense.<br/><br/>A lot has had to be left out. The key character of Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), damaged spy turned schoolteacher, and George Smiley's dogsbody assistant Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberpatch) are the only ones to have much depth to them. The four suspects are as shaded as the world they inhabit. Smiley himself (Gary Oldman) is the enigma at the heart of a mystery; his wife Ann is barely glimpsed, yet she has a vital role to play in the denouement.<br/><br/>Good to see Kathy Burke back on the screen, although the part of Connie Sachs has been cruelly condensed and allows her to make little of the impact Beryl Reid had on TV. But the movie - like the book - belongs to Gary Oldman. His interpretation strongly evokes Alec Guinness - a bleary eye for the clues lurking in the background, the dogged determination to ferret out the truth of the treachery that threatens to undermine the 'Special Relationship'. This is up there with Joe Orton and Lee Harvey Oswald as one of Oldman's finest performances.<br/><br/>The world of espionage has rarely seemed so shadowy. Most scenes are shot in dimly lit rooms and corridors. Outside meetings take place on sunless days. There is no sunlight in this movie, which has the darkest of themes: betrayal of your country, betrayal of your friends.<br/><br/>But - BUT - for a more vivid, more up-to-date, more thrilling take on spooks, the series to watch is SPOOKS, just re-starting on BBCtv for what we're told will be its final outing. Good acting, punchy scripts and plots that belong to the complex international affairs of the age we live in now: these spies make Le Carre's look decidedly old hat!"

","I can see this film dividing audiences, as it has divided me into actually questioning whether it is any good or not.<br/><br/>There's no denying that ""Tinker, tailor, solider, spy"" is well made, and has one off the best casts I've seen in anything for ages.

As art it will probably be a masterpiece too all off those over 50's I seen taking up 90 percent off the cinema audience I was in though.

Secondly, I really got tired of watching filing, shuffling of papers, and scenes of men sitting in chairs over and over without any real action. The cuts back and forth are confusing, the actors look extremely unattractive, and most of the scenes are of men sitting down and talking. Or not talking. They stare, they stare again, they mutter. I found this film to be toxic it was so dull. And if the scenes are from the 1970s, how about sideburns on the men? Or double vented suits? This film was a terrible disappointment."

","I love all of these actors, mainly Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, but the story didn't really work as a film.

Complex story lines can be extremely interesting, such as in a film like Inception, but it doesn't work if the characters (that we should care about) aren't put into more harrowing situations.<br/><br/>Overall, this doesn't change my opinion of any of these actors, whom are all extremely talented, but I think people in the industry need to stop assuming that hot-selling books are automatic crowd pleasing movies, especially when the script is as slow as Tinker Tailor."

"RagingDraugr","6","1","3","28 September 2019"," Competent But Obtuse.
","If I could wrap up my feelings on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in three words, it would be ""competent, but obtuse"". Because there's a lot I liked about it for sure: the acting was pretty decent (Hardy, Oldman and Cumberbatch were my favourites as I think they did the best job and had the most development), the sets, costumes and props all looked great and seemed to fit well into the Cold War era atmosphere. Plus the cinematography is great with a lot of variation in shot composition, colour and lighting - with its usually dark and oppressive environments with cold sterile walls and harsh shadows (again, fitting as a Cold War era film, an era with much uncertainty and looming threats around every corner). However, there are just a lot of things holding this movie back from being anything truly special. For one, the narrative is very confusing. It demands so much of your attention, which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But I often found myself being bewildered by the arrival of seemingly new plot elements and characters that the movie, I feel, didn't do an adequate enough job of setting up.<br/><br/>And there's so many of these major and minor characters that you need to be aware of. But the movie doesn't spend a lot of time on building or developing many of them...which leads to much of the cast being bland, unmemorable and very similar to one another despite the overall quality of the performances. Also, the reveal of the identity of the mole inside British Intelligence was very underwhelming considering the immense amount of tension that was being built throughout the course of the film and especially in the last fifteen to twenty minutes. I noticed a lot of plot inconsistencies or discrepancies too, like ""Why did Jim Prideaux act nice to that school kid and then yell at him to go away just before he shot Bill Haydon (Firth), who was the mole and his old friend? Was it because he didn't want to get the kid involved in what he was doing or trying to preserve his innocence? Early on the film, did he think he could learn to be better and integrate himself back into society, but discovered that he couldn't and thus tried to shut the boy out of his life? Either way, his aggression seems out of character. Why was Bill at all allowed to wander around outside and along the fence freely considering his status as a high profile target? Did Peter (Cumberbatch) ever make up with his lover/family member/something else (Again, the nature of that character is not really established)? He kicked him out of the house to prevent him from being targeted, presumably. If the answer is no, that he didn't meet up with him again, he seems remarkably chipper about it at the end. If it's yes, it certainly wasn't included in the film. Are we just supposed to intuit that he did? Speaking of which, Tom Hardy's arc just ends, the last time we see Hardy is a closeup of him in the rain, looking somewhat sullen. That's...one way of ending a character's story, I guess.""<br/><br/>Overall: Maybe I'll like it more on a repeat viewing, now that I have a decent grasp on the story. But for now, the best I can give it is a 6/10 - mainly for its cinematography and performances. The rating could be lower, more so than it could be higher."

Quite what younger audiences, those who did not live through the Cold War, make of this opaque period piece is a mystery.

Based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carre, this film has a great screenplay that I must say is great as a screenplay but it's very technical at the same time. This film begins with mole in the circus, now what is mole and what is circus here, to get that itself, I had to sit through the whole film and well, it was not such a pleasant revelation either. <br/><br/>Well, in this very film we have actors such as Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and the Sherlock guy Benedict Cumberbatch along with Gary Oldman at the helm. So we have got the best ensemble cast in recent years for a movie. About their performances, everyone does it with such rare understanding of their roles that even I as audience was astonished as to how was that emotion conveyed, when we have not known much of him yet. <br/><br/>The production design is awesome and so is the art direction, above all I liked the background music and the sound design, wow kudos to those guys, and cinematography was right in every place as the scenes are well composed. The performances keep you glued, the direction is great and the whole look is great I must say. Yet, there is something that is missing, there is something that is just not right, I can attribute that to editing as I do for other movies, but for this I can't say even that coz all those details are absolutely necessary to conclude the story. So the missing element is the story in itself, it's a story that's specific to an age, to an incident and it's not very universal either, Despite that, it's an intense brain exercise that may even make you watch multiple times just to understand it. <br/><br/>There is very little action, rather mostly words and dialogues that are tough to decipher. For me, I had no knowledge of such spies and this story and it came as a bouncer in the first viewing, I took the help of few links and then a second watch made me admire this. So for all the guys who are interested in the cold blooded, spy films this may be it, for others, they may of may not like it. This is a test for patience and fizzles out soon if one is not aware or admiring such stories. But if you know or even have a faint ide of what this film is about, you may fall in love with it. Now, thanks to wikipedia that helped me learn a good deal about this movie.<br/><br/>So, I can appreciate this movie yet I may not just recommend for everyone. So, a 4/5 for a good movie that's great in it's own way but needed a prologue and epilogue to help a layman understand."

Like ""Russia House"", this is a movie that aims to stimulate your brain, and to give you a tiny glimpse of how dark and cold the Cold War really was for those who experienced it first-hand."

","This film really is my cup of tea. I loved the acting, I loved the pace, I loved the story, in short it was, for me, 2 hours 7 minutes of cinema heaven! That said, I can see it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>I did not catch the BBC TV series, and have not read the book but, I had no difficulty with the plot. The understated direction and lack of Jason Bourne style action was refreshing and undoubtedly a lot closer to real-life espionage. Another reviewer described the pace as ""glacial"", that's probably fair but, a glacier is one of the most powerful and majestic forces of nature, you just need a bit of patience to see the massive impact it can have.<br/><br/>If you're an action-film-only fan then best not bother with this one. - though, if you already have, don't be too harsh (like saying nobody should ever watch it) but, instead, try and appreciate there are horses for courses. Personally I have time for both Smiley AND Bourne but Smiley is just a bit more my style."

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about MI6 trying to find a mole within its ranks. Things are somewhat convoluted as even the question of the mole isn't all that clear. It's based on a ""story"" that some ex-employees told, and even within the government isn't believed. But ""Control"" the guy in charge of MI6 thinks there's something to it. And somehow concludes the mole has to be one of the 5 senior officers on his ""board"". After a botched operation, he's forced out and so is his right hand hand--Smiley--who is the the main character of the movie as he is asked by the government to find out who the mole is. He recruits an agent to help him, who in some of the more exciting scenes has to steal information right out of headquarters.<br/><br/>From various sources now Smiley confirms that there is indeed a mole, and that this mole would be one of his former colleagues, some of whom are now in charge. Meanwhile they are working with the blessings of the government on an operation called Witchcraft supposedly gaining information from a Russian informant to then pass it on to the Americans. But Smiley realizes that the operation isn't as successful as it's claimed to be. His nemesis is called ""Karla""- the Russian spymaster pulling strings. Smiley met him once in the past and tried to recruit him but realized that he was a fanatic- a trait that will also be his weakness.<br/><br/>Eventually, Smiley finds out the house were the mole passes on his information and discovers the codes used for the meets. He sets up a sting operation to catch the mole.<br/><br/>While it should be somewhat of a surprise or at least of interest who the mole really is, it isn't. And that is the main weakness of this movie. The five candidates don't get a lot of screen time. We learn very little about them. The great Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted in a thankless role, but so are all the others possible moles. We should really have spent more time with them so that the revelation becomes meaningful. As it is, it's more about the journey and reaching the destination wasn't much of a payoff. Still, this movie is excellent. It's set in the 70s and also feels like it was filmed back then. It has the right tone, although at times you wish for Smiley to be a bit more ""alive"".<br/><br/>Overall, the cast is outstanding of course, but Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Smiley's sidekick stands out among them all. The story is fascinating, but it could have used more focus, and leave out some extraneous elements."

","A horribly slow and boring movie. And if that weren't enough, I hadn't a clue what was going on. Every scene felt like the same thing repeating itself. There was no suspense or drama added to anything. It was like watching the average Joe go about his day. Most of the movie is just people talking to each other in slow, low, monotone voices that are barely intelligible unless you're from the UK. I had to put subtitles on! After about an hour, I just turned it off, and I still had no idea what was going on. In my humble opinion, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

","For those of you who don't know, a 6 part BBC Miniseries of this Le Carre novel was aired in 1979. It does an excellent job of relating a story who's characters are as complex as the plot, if not in fact completely entwined with it.<br/><br/>This film does not.<br/><br/>I'm not a professional critic so I'll say it as I saw it: The acting is bad, inappropriate for what Le Carre is trying to convey. The actors themselves don't seem to have had a chance to immerse themselves sufficiently to seem real. They are obviously acting - and whenever that starts happening in any film, it starts haemorrhaging points... badly.<br/><br/>The 6 part series is gritty and real, the rooms and desks very typical of the time and place. Whereas the film is stylized, as though some arty period consultant had done the whole thing - ridiculous and insulting.<br/><br/>Such an absurdly enormous fuss was made of Oldman (who I like. and is better suited to 'Leon' etc.) who plays Smiley. Once you have seen the Mini-series and seen it done by the then Alec Guinness, you will see what he's meant to be like. Why did Oldman try to copy him? That was doomed from the start anyway.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know why they bothered with the whole thing at all and have a suspicion that a big fuss was made about the film generally because it was rubbish and they were driven by financial fears; it had very slick 'damage control' written all over it. The only alternative is that they are all completely loopy. (Probably a bit of both)<br/><br/>The reviews on here which are positive about the film can only use phrases like 'it's really good' and fail to explain in plain English why it deserves watching, let alone nominations.<br/><br/>The mini series is still very watchable.<br/><br/>This sort of tale really isn't suited to re-makes and films and all that sort of thing. Just leave it alone - why spoil such a good thing?"
"roger-pettit1","10","1","3","17 April 2012"," A superb screen adaptation of a classic Cold War spy novel
","This is one of those occasions when, having read some professional reviews of the film before seeing it (something I usually try to avoid doing), I am happy to report that my high expectations have been more than matched. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is an excellent, almost faultless film. <br/><br/>The basic plot is as follows. George Smiley (Gary Oldman) reluctantly agrees to suspend his enforced retirement from the British Secret Intelligence Service to investigate the impact of an earlier botched exercise in Soviet-controlled Budapest. That incident had brought about his departure from the ""Circus"", the top echelon of the Service to which he had belonged, and that of its Control (John Hurt). The failed exercise had resulted in the capture and torture of one of the Circus's agents, who had been sent to Budapest to obtain information about the identity of a Russian mole who was believed to have infiltrated the highest sphere of the British Secret Service. The powers that be consider Smiley to be best placed to undertake such an investigation because Control has since died. Smiley's investigation necessitates his spying on his former colleagues at the Circus, one of whom is believed to be the mole in question. <br/><br/>Perhaps not surprisingly, given that this is a film about Cold War espionage, there is much more to what is a very complex plot than that brief description suggests. Indeed, just about the only reservation about the film that I have is that its plot is so labyrinthine in nature that it requires one's total attention at all times. I found I had to rewind the DVD on two occasions to check that I had understood a plot development correctly and to ensure that I hadn't missed something crucial. (That luxury is not, of course, an option if one is watching the film in a cinema!) ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is brilliantly acted by all involved (the cast is made up of a stellar array of British actors) and expertly directed. It is beautifully shot and lit and atmospherically evokes what I imagine to be the shady, secretive and seedy world of spying. I have not read the novel on which the film is based - although I am now keen to do so - but I assume that it cannot have been an easy task to capture its rationale and its complexities as successfully and as reasonably accessibly as this film seems to do. So, great credit must also go the writers of the screenplay. The original music, by Alberto Iglesias (any relation to Julio, I wonder?), is also top-notch.<br/><br/>""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is intelligent, thought-provoking and rivetingly entertaining. Indeed, it is one of the best films I have seen for a very long time. A must-see. 10/10."
"sanddragon939","10","1","3","16 April 2012"," Beyond James Bond...a Harsh Look at the REAL World of Spies...
","Expect none of the mind-numbing action of The Bourne Ultimatum, the exotic locales of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, or the suavity, wit and charm of James Bond, Her Majesties' most renowned fictional secret agent. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', adapted from John Le Carre's novel of the same name, offers a far more realistic and cynical look at the world of spies and international intrigue.<br/><br/>The setting is London in the mid-1970's, in the midst of the Cold War. Retired spymaster George Smiley is called back into service for a crucial assignment-to identify the Soviet mole buried deep in the highest echelons of the British Intelligence organization known as the 'Circus'. What follows is two hours of spellbinding intrigue as Smiley uncovers layer after layer of omission and deception. Covert operations across the Iron Curtain, bureaucratic infighting and power struggles, and even infidelities and indiscretions are all but a few of the elements of this, one of Le Carre's most intricate plots.<br/><br/>While the film is a very good adaptation of the novel, its treatment of the plot is overly complicated at times, and therefore, it may be on such occasions be mildly incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read the novel. Where the film really stands out though, is in the performances of the actors. Gary Oldman delivers a masterful performance as George Smiley. Though Oldman's Smiley is far more dapper than the character described in the novel, he is still the 'anti-James Bond' in every sense - mild-mannered, soft-spoken, middle-aged and bespectacled, above all a thinking man rather than a man of violence. Tom Hardy and Mark Strong likewise deliver solid performances as field agents Ricky Tarr and Jim Prideux; the former being closest approximation this film offers to the glamorous, womanizing secret agent of the James Bond mold, and the latter being the very portrait of a burnt out and betrayed spy. Colin Firth also delivers a powerful performance as high-ranking Circus agent Bill Haydon. The creation of atmosphere is another one of the film's great assets-where the world of James Bond is defined by exotic locales, night clubs and casinos, prolonged chase sequences and fight scenes...Smiley's world is comprised of suffocating board rooms, secret archives, English country houses and even a school playground.<br/><br/>'Tinker Tailor...' is first and foremost a cerebral film; and certainly not your destination for cinematic thrills. But it is undoubtedly an intellectual 'treat' to watch nonetheless..."
"ekuznetsov","3","1","3","2 April 2012"," I want two hours of my life back
","I must admit, I haven't read the book, and this must be part of why I've been so baffled by this movie and by all the glowing reviews.<br/><br/>Pacing is glacial. People walking in and out of buildings. People getting into cars. People staring into the camera without blinking. Shots of stacks of papers slowly transported from one floor to another by a special paperwork elevator. On multiple occasions. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that redeems the slow pacing, it's the fact that, without all these pauses (allowing you to try to figure out what's happening), the movie would've been incomprehensible to the point of being completely unwatchable. The director does not really bother trying to explain what's going on. Characters are dropped in the middle of the movie without any preparatory work or attempt to explain who and what they are. The movie randomly switches from the present time to flashbacks, without any effort to differentiate between them visually or even to mark transitions. <br/><br/>The whole plot of the movie is basically about uncovering a Soviet mole in the ""Circus"", or the British Intelligence, among a group of 4 high-ranking officials. (This last part, by the way, you don't get to learn until at least halfway through the movie. Until that point, it's just vague references to a mole somewhere in the organization.) Aside from the fact that the four are played by different actors (and one of them is banging protagonist's wife), the four are thoroughly unremarkable and lack any distinguishing features. If I remember correctly, two of them never even appear on screen except in group meetings.<br/><br/>You don't even get enough information to associate faces with names. I've managed to figure out 30 min into the movie that Gary Oldman was ""Smiley"", only because he was mentioned so often. I wasn't sure who or what ""Alleline"" was until well into the second half.<br/><br/>There are two sub-plots, involving an incident in Budapest and an incident in Istanbul. The Budapest subplot is thoroughly perplexing because most of the things happening as part of that subplot make no sense, and, ultimately, the whole subplot turns out to be virtually disconnected from the main story line (except in the beginning - where the main character of the subplot is betrayed by the mole) and to lead to nowhere. For example, the character of Bill Roach appears on screen on at least three occasions but I can't find any reason why he was part of the movie at all. I got the feeling that the sub-plot must have been somehow important in the book and the director couldn't dispose of it completely, but ended up butchering it enough to lose all meaning.<br/><br/>This all merely begins to scratch the surface. If I were to list all the things that make no sense or were inserted into the movie for no apparent purpose (except maybe to serve as artistic sketches, objets d'art, so to say), I'd run way over the 1000 word limit. I should stop here."

The story while seeming interesting after all is said and done, but the execution and way the story is portrayed in the film couldn't have been more slow and boring. There was only maybe two parts in the entire film I actually enjoyed, one being ruined by the events in the story, and the other being short lived. That being said, the movie has a great lineup for the cast, and the acting on their part was quite good. Some may argue it isn't good, and my rebuttal would be that the acting was great, but rather the direction was poorly done. The cinematography was well done, and the set designs, props, and costumes were exactly right for the early 1970s. None the less, the film left a dry staleness to my mouth much like one would get after being served a platter of cold grits with no sides, or condiments. Unfortunately this is not a dish that can be spiced up, it is a film that must be taken for what it is.

","Over the years it is fair to say that whenever someone comes out with the words ""spy"" and ""thriller"" we instantly picture Sean Connery rescuing the damsel in distress and driving an Aston Martin into a bad guy. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is completely different! This movie does a superb job of keeping an audience gripped in a slow moving and very intelligent and well thought out story of double agents, conspiracy and the world of British Espionage. Based on the best selling novel by John Le'Carre who was indeed a former spy in the British Intelligence this movie brings home the realism of the work of the British Secret Service through the cold war period and I'm sure things remain similar today. Gary Oldman brings to life the character of George Smiley. Smiley is a veteran spy who is called out of semi-retirement by Control (John Hurt) to track down a mole who has managed to infiltrate ""The Circus"" and has remained there for years and is feeding secrets to the Russians and the other communists. Oldman simply shines as the calm veteran who has seen it all and just gets on with the job at hand in a calm and professional manor. The superbly crafted cast also feature Benedict Cumberpatch, John Hurt, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Tom Hardy do a fantastic job of bringing home the drama and throughout the movie the audience will be gripped as Gary Oldman uncovers all of the information and we get to know each of the characters in turn and in detail allowing us to feel the tension of the story. As the film unfolds and plot grows ever deeper the audience will remain on the edge of their seats and want to see the outcome of every investigation into the members of ""The Circus"" and remain that way right up until the credits role following an epic conclusion which I will not divulge to those of you who are yet to see this movie. In conclusion I loved every minute of this film and I urge anyone who has not yet seen it to do so. trust me this is the new benchmark for spy thrillers everywhere and you will not be disappointed. Move over 007 and make way for Smiley!!!"

","I saw the critics reviews of this film and thought I should make the effort to watch it, even though I do find John le Carré a bit impenetrable. I think it is the job of a director to make the difficult approachable, and in this film, it seems to me exactly the opposite is achieved. The characters are never introduced or there relationships explained, and the plot is full of flash-backs which are often very short and have no distinguishing indicators (bring back the wavy lines?), so that the viewer can't grasp if we are in the present or the past. I found the first part of the film unbelievably dull, and gave up at the half way point, almost abandoning it. I did go back to it though, and found the last hour slightly more interesting, which I suppose is why I'm not giving the thing an even lower score. I didn't find any of the characters had any, well character, I never latched onto the story, and in the end, I didn't care. I suggest you read the synopsis and then skip through it to see what it looks like, otherwise you are wasting two hours you could have been watching reruns of the Muppets, or something else more useful."

I kept waiting for it to get going, but it didn't. We were being constantly introduced to characters without really knowing who they are, or what relevance they had to a story that I was really trying to piece together. <br/><br/>The character development in Tinker Tailor was very poor for a film that is held in such high regard. Colin Firth included, very little is told about any of the top MI6 agents that we are lead to suspect of being the mole, nor any of their motives.

Unfortunately I found it to be overly confusing, and coupled with some 'major' characters non-existent development, hard to follow at times.<br/><br/>It got to the point where I almost felt they randomly chose one of the MI6 agents to be the mole without any reasoning being his motives. Maybe I missed something in the second half after being bored by the first half, and perhaps I needed some prior knowledge, but I honestly couldn't have guessed who it was because nothing that happened would have lead to believe one way or the other.<br/><br/>I sense that it could be a film I could enjoy a lot more on a second viewing, but the first hour was far too dull to bring myself to watch it.

Sitting through the tedium and pretense of sparse and uninteresting dialog waiting for something finally to develop and take hold eventually devolves into revealing a 'who cares' ending.

I like movies that hold me in suspense, but the suspense shouldn't be about ""who the hell is that, where is he, and what's going on?"" Worse, the editing of many scenes seems designed to enhance the gratuitous confusion--abruptly cutting a scene just as I might have the slightest inkling of who that is, or what's going on. Am I just stupid, is this a gimmick, or did the film's director and editor simply make some consistently poor choices? I vote for the latter. Ultimately, I was left with this profound question: why should I care about a Cold War plot, 20 years after the Cold War is over, when they don't even bother to tell me who is who? There's lots of good acting, wasted, just like my evening watching this."

It is not a bad story, but could have been developed much better. Still, I am giving all the credits to Gary Oldman and his acting in the movie. I am thinking to myself, if there was no Gary Oldman, I would have badly regretted going there! Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not a bad movie, but it is not a good one, either.

Actually I have watched it several times as the style is so different one misses the odd bit of dialog or a momentary glance or look in the eyes which actually builds a myriad of little pieces which joins up to make the film a whole. In fact the seemingly straight forward twist in the plot actually takes hold at various points in the film, so it is easy to not understand it completely, begging a second, or fifth, viewing; snaking around ideas of double and triple agents whilst reminding us of the deeper Britain."

I will enjoy watching this film again in the future as well as enjoying the BBC serialisation and reading the book again. Perhaps it helps to have been alive in the UK in the 50s and 60s and to have been aware of the politics of the time which saw the exposure of Philby, Burgess and Maclean.

"classicalsteve","10","1","3","4 February 2012"," The Spent and Dark World of Spies as only Le Carre Can Tell It--007 Could Never Conceive It
","The idealized world of spy adventure which is the trademark of the James Bond books and films really has nothing to do with foreign intelligence. Unlike Ian Fleming (who wrote the James Bond novels), John Le Carre's vision of the world of spies came directly from first-hand experience. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Le Carre worked for British Intelligence and the British Foreign Service, taking part in wire taps, break-ins, and defector interrogations. This is a world of shadowed corners, darkened rooms, uncomfortable headsets, and endless transcriptions, not ski resorts and casino hotels.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman offers the performance of his career as the older intelligence genius, George Smiley, assigned to find the ""mole"" inside a branch of British Intelligence code-named ""the Circus"". A mole is a double-agent, someone pretending to be on one side but in fact working for the other who has burrowed himself inside the upper-reaches of the organization, allowing for easy access to classified information which can be leaked to the other side. When a younger agent, Jim Prideaux, is sent on a mission to Budapest to meet with a general supposedly defecting to the west, it becomes obvious the other side knew almost immediately about the meeting. The meeting point is at a café which turns deadly when even before the meeting has begun, he is shot at. In other words, someone in British Intelligence had informed the other side of the meeting. Also, a another young low-level agent goes to the east and befriends a young woman looking to defect who claims she has knowledge about an intelligence mole.<br/><br/>Smiley goes on a kind of murder-mystery-like investigation to determine why the Budapest meeting became a fiasco and simultaneously uncover the identity of the mole. Each of the witnesses give their understanding of the story, how they are involved, and how each story fits into a larger mosaic of intrigue and betrayal. Part of the trick to navigating this film is understanding when flashbacks are occurring and when the film is in the present moment. The top suspects are all high-ranking British Intelligence agents, and given code names: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poor Man. When he identifies the perpetrator, instead of indicating them by name, Smiley will simply offer the code name.<br/><br/>An outstanding, if darkly atmospheric film which is a much more realistic portrayal of the shrouded world of foreign espionage. Some younger viewers may be frustrated because of the lack of action and the less than straight-forward linear progression. Each piece of the puzzle takes time to come to the fore. This film is more of a subtler suspense thriller rather than an action movie. Early on, many incidences are revealed without explanation at first. But if you can be patient, the film really starts to kick in at about the 30 to 45 min mark. <br/><br/>What we really learn is that the world of spies is ultimately about secrets. Who has them, who doesn't, and who doesn't want which secret to be revealed to whom. And all of the participants are haggard, spent people, not the glamorous icons portrayed in Hollywood spy thrillers. The skis, cocktails, waitresses, and roulette tables are strangely absent. Dim halls, unkempt studies, and damp cells are where these people reside."

","** read more at filmdebate.wordpress.com ** <br/><br/>THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE: I'll start with a question. Throwing an audience into the deep end, leaving them to piece together what's going on, can be an effective way to heighten the suspense and mystery in a movie, as the audience struggles to figure out what is going on at the same time learns about the movie's universe and its players. But when does it go to far? At what point is it a crutch used to gloss over the tricky work of introducing an audience to the movie's universe and the characters that inhabit it? <br/><br/>THE PROFESSIONAL: Well, if you are implying that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has gone too far and made itself too confusing for audiences, I must disagree. This was perhaps my most anticipated movie of the year, not least because Gary Oldman, the GREATEST LIVING ACTOR, plays the main character. But I haven't read the book, nor seen the six-hour miniseries. I purposefully stayed away from all reviews and plot summaries, and I firmed myself up to have realistic expectations and a semblance of objectivity. I was not immediately blown away by the film, but the more time passes, the more my appreciation of the movie truly grows. This is a fine example of SHOW, DON'T TELL. There is no voice-over narration, no introductory Star Wars scrolling text. Audiences have to actually pay attention to what is going on and not be spoon-fed exposition. The plot was surprisingly simple - no real twists or double-crosses. The story was straightforward, but presented in a way that produced uncertainty and paranoia - just like somebody working in such intelligence services during the Cold War might actually feel. 'Tinker Tailor' is the anti-James Bond, the anti-24, and the anti-Mission Impossible, if you will.<br/><br/>THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE: I understood what was going on, and thought it was suspenseful, thrilling, and well-acted. I think the reason it was surprisingly simple (and the reason your appreciation was delayed) is because most of your mental energy was focused on putting the story together, rather than reveling in its impact. I enjoyed it, and think I would enjoy it even more the second time. But I can imagine that with some ""tinkering"" with the structure of the movie, it could have had even more of an impact without sacrificing the suspense or resorting to a ""Star Wars scroll""...<br/><br/>** read more at filmdebate.wordpress.com **"

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is set in 1973, during the Cold War era in Britain. Two elderly men are being sacked from the head of MI6. They are George Smiley (Garry Oldman) and Control (John Hurt). Their dismissal comes from the bungle of a meeting a year earlier where Jim (Mark Strong) was meant to meet a General who would tell him the name of a Russian mole who has infiltrated British intelligence. In flashback we discover that Jim was shot and left for dead. In the present day he has resumed his life, living in a caravan and working as a school teacher. When Control passes away, Smiley is asked to return to the 'Circus' to help track down the mole. Amidst some of the suspects are Ricki (Tom Hardy), Bill (Colin Firth), Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch), Roy (Ciaran Hinds) and Percy (Toby Jones), some of whom have been likened to the pieces on a chessboard by Control. <br/><br/>You will have to see Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy twice. There are several reasons for this. Foremost, it is an impeccably made thriller from Tomas Alfredson, the Swedish director who gave us Let the Right One In (2008). This is a director who knows how to tell a story in what is sadly regarded as old fashioned terms. He is not interested in elaborate chase scenes or action sequences, but rather in building tension through selective pacing and a dense, compelling atmosphere. He was an inspired choice for this project because as he showed with his vampire epic, he understands that less is more. He has focused a significant amount of attention on the film's set design. Many scenes are photographed from a wide angle, realising the high levels of detail in the film's mise-en-scène. This enhances the film's realism and authenticity because each room feels tangible and involving, with a distinct amount of weight and gravitas. This is coupled with Alfredson's specificity of images, like the sweat on the waiter's brow dripping onto the table, to build an unbearable level of still, burning tension. The period looks and feels right too because the film doesn't make a point of it. It's shot in grainy, muted shades of brown and grey, reminding us that this is a period of control. The interior rooms are often lit with deep shadows over the faces of the actors, further contributing to overall sense of paranoia. Many of these aesthetic devices make the film as chilling and mesmerising as Let the Right One In. As a reward for this authenticity, moments of violence are more impacting and emotionally involving. There's some upsetting vision of a mutilated corpse and a brief assassination but Alfredson refuses to linger over these moments. In terms of direction and aesthetic control, the film is faultless. <br/><br/>Thematically, this is a thriller of such breadth and endless complexity that you may not initially grasp how all of its intricate stands come together. This is assuming that, like myself, you have not read the novel or seen the BBC series. It is a challenge on an initial viewing but what can be drawn from the crux of the narrative is a series of anecdotes, concerned with the dissatisfaction of the British Empire. Smiley visits a woman he used to work with and she describes how the Second World War was the last honourable moment for British intelligence. There is also a riveting story of how Smiley tried to convince a man to return to their side but he was more content with returning to Russia to die. Equally fascinating is to consider the film in regards to generational change. Throughout the film Smiley is photographed swimming with old men and Control's sudden death is an ominous reminder that he is at the end of his run, forced out by much younger men too. We learn that his wife Anne left him because she was having an affair with someone younger, which also raises questions of loyalty, addressed in the film's plausible revelation. On loyalty, one of the best scenes in the film sees Peter returning to the circus to steal a file for Smiley. It has one of the most unforgettable long shots in cinema: the glass windows of an entire office, along with each floor, placed into the one frame. True to a lot of the film, it's a gripping scene for what it implies, rather than what eventuates through action. It almost breaks Peter, having to spy on his own people. For as many of those who are displeased with the Empire, there are still those who want to believe in it. The entire cast is well chosen, charismatic and sometimes funny too. They give us reasons to feel for these men. I like that they chose distinct British actors who are easy to recognise too. Oldman, even with minimal dialogue, strikes a visible level of intensity in his quiet work. Through the most ordinary lines like, 'Then what happened?', he has an affirming grip on his character. Firth is another standout, this time playing against type and he's terrific. Although I am still not confident in how many of the story lines come together it is a testament to the filmmaking and the performance that I'd like to see the film again to find out."
"markdroulston","5","1","3","18 January 2012"," Impenetrable Stillness
","Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson is nothing if not ambitious. Following the success of 2008′s Let The Right One In (one of the finest films of the past decade), the director turned his attention to John le Carré's beloved novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, previously adapted into a highly regarded BBC mini-series in 1979, for his English language debut. All of the pieces seemed to fit: a supremely gifted emerging director, the huge potential in the source material, and a cast assembled from the top tier of British acting talent. Surely Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy couldn't miss, right? Not quite.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of retired intelligence agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman), tasked with discovering the identity of a traitor in the upper echelons of the British secret service during the Cold War. Told largely through conversations which serve as launchpads for a number of flashbacks, Tinker Tailor is, from a technical standpoint, flawlessly crafted, and Alfredson's meticulous attention to detail rewards viewers who can keep up with the level of concentration the film demands. Oldman gives a stunning performance as Smiley, one which will rank highly alongside his absolute best, not least of all for the level of restraint he displays. Where many of his best characters in movies past required some level of mania or unhinged-ness, with Smiley he is so still and expressionless that it's something of a revelation. Smiley is an observer, and Alfredson cleverly devotes much screen time to close-ups of Oldman's face and eyes, framed beautifully with his enormous bifocals (which also serve a more important, audience orientation purpose in the flashbacks). He conveys so much by doing so little, and while the supporting cast are all excellent, it's unquestionably Oldman's film.<br/><br/>So Tinker Tailor certainly has a lot going for it, and the look and atmosphere of the film are something to be admired to be sure. So why was it that I walked out of the cinema so confused and frustrated? Clearly, setting tone is something that is important to Alfredson, and the moodiness and creeping sense of dread in Let The Right One In is one of that film's greatest strengths. With this film however, Alfredson devotes so much to generating an appropriate mood that, in hindsight, he possibly shoots himself in the foot from a narrative standpoint. Tinker Tailor takes its time to build a wonderful tone, yet the story progression is all but impenetrable. Perhaps reading the novel or seeing the BBC series would make the film more accessible, but for those of us who haven't experienced either it can be incredibly difficult to fathom exactly what is happening for the bulk of the running time. Added to this, Alfredson refuses to use technique to assist the viewer, with the exception of the aforementioned glasses gag. Tinker Tailor demands so much from its audience that many people may find themselves, like I did, frustrated at not being able to closely follow the plot. Films that challenge you to keep up without holding your hand are all to rare, but maintaining such a level of concentration over 127 minutes is not easy for even the most perceptive film-goer, and while it's encouraging that Alfredson assumes a level of intelligence in his audience, he may have pushed it a little too far with Tinker Tailor. But then again, perhaps I'm just not as clever as I'd like to think.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"st-shot","6","1","3","13 January 2012"," The unglamorous world of espionage.
","Director Tomas Alfredson and company do their best to deglamorize the surly double dealing world of counter intelligence in John Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor soldier spy. Drained of color and muted in every way ( tan and gray seems to be the fashion choice for everyone ) it is a long way from the jet setting action packed world of James Bond.<br/><br/>After a mission goes very bad in Budapest the head of a British Intelligence branch, Control ( John Hurt) is forced out along with agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) of the bureau. When it's discovered that a mole is operating within the agency Smiley is brought back in an attempt to expose him.<br/><br/>Without the fast cars, gadgets, babes and things to blow up TTSS is a pretty somber and low key affair that has an intriguing enough start. The agents are mostly surly, cynical and distrustful and suspects are numerous. The narrative itself is a series of confusing flashbacks and dark shadows however and the film soon begins to drown in convolution bogging down in excessive wordplay and the occasional shock incidental.<br/><br/>Oldman as Smiley looks and moves with a convincing world weary persona of a man who takes his work seriously, maybe too much. Director Alfredson's intent to keep things low key drains the life out of most of his characters, especially Smiley and by extension the picture itself. His direction overall is erratic at best as his juggling act of adding peripheral characters and placing more importance than needed on superfluous scenes only serves to make matters more distracting and confusing. Sober as it is most of the way Alfredson tacks on a mawkish denouement with a touch of happily ever after summed up in natty threads and an expression of smug satisfaction which deviates in a jarring way the film's mood and tone over the previous two hours."
"UncleTantra","10","1","3","8 January 2012"," Tinkers, Tailors, Soldiers, Spies
","I don't see how I can review this film without also reviewing the 1979 BBC version of the story. Especially because I prefer the new version.<br/><br/>And that is nigh unto heresy, if you know the original. That version starred Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley, and his performance in it is often referred to (and rightly) as one of the pinnacles of his illustrious career. So my preference for this new version should in no way be construed to mean that I prefer Gary Oldman's performance to Alec Guinness' in the same role. That's not the issue. It's that the STORYTELLING of the new version of the film is better than the storytelling of the older version. It's simply a better movie, on almost all counts.<br/><br/>The reason for this IMO is that they hired Tomas Alfredson (the Swedish director of ""Let The Right One In"") to helm the making of this movie version, and hired two talented writers (one of whom died during the production) to pen it. And the three of them done good. Real good. With only 127 minutes in which to tell their story, they did a better job than the best BBC directors and writers of their era were able to do with the same story in seven hours.<br/><br/>The plot is as classic an example of Cold War Spy Storytelling now as it was when John Le Carré penned it. ""Control"" (head of the British Secret Service, played in this film by John Hurt) learns to his dismay that there may be a mole in the top echelons of the ""Circus."" He sends an operative to Budapest to find out who it is, but that operation turns disastrously and publicly sour, and Control is forced to resign, taking his top aide George Smiley with him. Fast forward a couple of years, and the notion that there is a mole resurfaces. Control has died and the four people he suspected are now in charge of the Circus, so Smiley is brought out of retirement to find out who the mole might be. The twists and turns are exquisite, Smiley personifying a master spy more akin to Bobby Fischer than James Bond. It's been many years since I last read the book, so I can't say for sure, but there is a possibility that this latest retelling of the story may be better than le Carré's original novel.<br/><br/>It should be mentioned that Gary Oldman's performance in this film is as understated as many of his past performances have been overstated, and that's a good thing. But the bottom line for me yet again -- a growing trend in TV and television -- is that if you want a classic British story told well, hire a Swede to tell it. Tomas Alfredson even looks like George Smiley."
"howard.schumann","7","1","3","5 January 2012"," Murky and enigmatic
","Until now, I thought a mole was something like a small permanent mark on the skin, or a spicy Mexican sauce (molé), but I discovered in Tomas Alfredson's spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy that a mole is also an individual who has infiltrated a high-level organization in order to provide its highly guarded secrets to the opposition/enemy/other side. Murky, enigmatic, and often confusing (if you haven't read the book or seen the TV series), the film is supported by an outstanding ensemble cast that includes Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch, and manages to be worth figuring out, but the ride is not always illuminating.<br/><br/>Based on the 1974 novel by John le Carré and the 1979 television series that starred Alec Guinness, the current adaptation by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan has less time than the others to capture the essence of the byzantine narrative yet, in the end, it probably doesn't matter because the film is more about mood and character than plot. Set in Britain in the 1970s at the height of the Cold War with the War in Vietnam still in process, the head of British Intelligence named Control (John Hurt) as well as senior agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced to resign after a botched operation in Budapest, Hungary (under Soviet control at the time).<br/><br/>In the operation, Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) tries to track down a rumor that the ""Circus"" has been infiltrated by a Russian agent, believed to be one of four key figures in the agency. His job was to bring in a Russian general who allegedly wanted to defect and could provide the name of the infiltrator but Prideaux was gunned down and there was no defection. It seems apparent that Prideaux has been killed but later, when we see him teaching a class at a private boys' school, we are shown in flashback how he was able to survive. Smiley, a close-lipped professional diplomat who has a look on his face that suggests many hidden secrets, is asked to come out of retirement by the new Circus clown Percy Alleline (Toby Jones).<br/><br/>His new job is to track down the mole in order to protect his own operation which he gives the dubious name of ""Witchcraft."" The plot gets even thicker when Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) another British agent, appears on the scene telling Smiley that he had met Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who is married to a Soviet delegate, professes to know the identity of the mole. Additionally, Smiley's visit to Connie Sachs (Kathy Burke), another colleague who was forced to resign, leads him to the Russian spy Polyakov, who turns out to be a very important player.<br/><br/>It is soon clear (if anything is worthy of that description) that the mole can be only one of four people codenamed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, or Spy. These are Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hands), and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), along with Tarr, who some suspect is a traitor. Smiley works with an agent named Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch), who he sends to collect information, often from the same British intelligence agency for which he is currently working.<br/><br/>Like the 1966 Richard Burton film, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the spy business is shown as cynical and ambiguous, where loyalty and betrayal can be two sides of the same coin, and where both good guys and bad guys operate in the same moral parameters, meaning do whatever it takes and ignore ethical considerations. While individual scenes succeed in building tension and paranoia, putting them all together requires work, and the effort does not always produce results. When we do find the name of the culprit, the discovery lacks any real emotional impact. When Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy works, it has some wonderful engaging moments that resist the temptation to sensationalize, but unfortunately, these moments are few and far between."
"ticket_for_one","Null","1","3","25 September 2011"," One of the best for 2011
","Never read a le Carre' book. Might just start reading them if this film is anything to go by. An intelligent post cold war spy thriller from Tomas Alfredson who made the brilliant Let The Right One In. Alfredson is atmospheric and stylish with his direction which gives Tinker, Tailor a very musty nostalgic look of the 1970's. So who is the mole? Not giving that away! But what I will say is that the film's pace leading up to the end is tense as well as exciting. Performance wise everyone does a stand up and job but there are two actors who I thought were exceptional. Firstly Tom Hardy, who has been receiving a lot praise for his performance in Warrior. He's excellent in this. Loved his character, a spy on the run whose been accused of defecting. He brought emotion and a charismatic swagger (if that makes sense) to this film; it's one of the best performances this year. He's been dubbed the British Brando, which I think is a bit much. But once he's on screen he demands your attention and I have no doubt he'll be around for along while to come. Gary Oldham however, is truly awesome in this film. Playing the Smiley character which was first brought to life by the great Alec (Obi Wan) Guinness. He owns every scene. Some say it's a direct copy of Guinness' portrayal of Smiley. Whether it is or it isn't (I haven't seen the original TV series) he's brilliant nonetheless. He was dressed like a school headmaster, but had the mind of a superspy. A very human performance as well, showing that the job had taken a lot out of his character and almost cost him his life. Throughout the years Oldman has played sinister characters, from Stansfield (Leon) to Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg, (The Fifth Element) he gives everything to his performances. The Oscars are around the corner. Do not be surprised if Mr Oldman's man is among the nominees. The script is smart, witty and easy to follow as is the story, plot and flow of the film. The only problem I had with this film is the ending, which I thought was a bit of an anti climax. Other than that, it's a great film. Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman do their part as does Tomas Alfredson whose direction is assured. This is one of the best films of the year. GO SEE IT!"
"thependragon-1","9","1","3","23 September 2011"," Is It a masterpiece of just boring?
","I'm in two minds about this film. It's either a minor masterpiece full of great performances and with a craftily told story or in some parts a boringly paced film that tries to be far too clever for it's own good.<br/><br/>I found the first 30 minutes quite turgid, but made the decision to stick with it and as the film went on the characters became more and more interesting. I was impressed by how the director managed to provide the otherwise cold and calculating Smiley with vulnerable humanity. For me there were two key scenes. Firstly the moment when Smiley come across a liaison between his wife and Haydon and later when he recounts how he loses his lighter (a present from his wife) to the man who would become something of a nemesis. Both are testament to Oldman's great acting ability and I think show how well the director understood the source material.<br/><br/>There are also some other great performances by actors who seem to understand that their character's motivations should be open to interpretation by the audience. Mark Strong's performance as Prideaux is almost haunting, although I disliked the decision to have him shoot Hayden rather than strangle him, which I think had less impact.<br/><br/>As a fan of films such as 'The Conformist' and 'The Lives Of Others' which deal more with the motivations of spies rather than Bournesque style thrills, I was always going to take something from this. However, I quite understand how many cinema-goers will despair at the film. With funding from France and a Swedish director at the helm the movie in far more in line with European cinema drama than the spy thriller that some of the audience would have been hoping for. A mainstream audience are going to find it hard going and perhaps not as rewarding as it should be. Personally I was left with admiration and frustration in equal measure."
"eoias","Null","1","3","19 September 2011"," Devil's in the detail
","I had been eagerly anticipating this film and I was definitely not disappointed. Gary Oldman deserves at least a BAFTA, a SAG, a Golden Globe and a couple of Critics' Circle awards for his role. He is a superbly cool George Smiley. That being said, the who's who of British talent never fails to thrill and enthrall. <br/><br/>Not much can be said about the talent of the cast; they were all superb as expected. Mark Strong was a particularly tender Jim Prideaux, especially with Colin Firth's Bill Haydon. David Dencik as Toby Esterhase brought out the fear of the Iron Curtain brilliantly and Tom Hardy was as soft as he was cocky as Ricky Tarr.<br/><br/>The music, however did not quite live up to expectations. A lot more could have been done to dramatise the climactic scenes in the meeting house in London, much the same as Hans Zimmer did in Inception.<br/><br/>But the one thing viewers should note is that this is a film which should be watched minutely, as the devil really is in the detail."

Gary Oldman is Smily all the way and hes now on the hunt, all of the cast definitely give their all...
But<br/><br/>The story is a mess, Its easy to tell the story when its a book or TV mini series but the makers of this flick flat out failed to tell a story.<br/><br/>I mean it there is no overall story here!<br/><br/>The situation is that there is a double agent in British Intelligence and Smily is tasked with finding the mole. There are four suspects code named Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Spy...
but<br/><br/>of the suspects we only ever see the one suspect and the others are hardly there, so suspense is kind of out the window. Even if you haven't read the book or seen the TV series its obvious who the mole is.<br/><br/>In just over 120 minutes it is difficult to cover the four suspects equally if at all and this is aggravated by the director shoving in his favourite scenes from the book despite the fact that these scenes add nothing but confusion to the story as there is no time for any context or cause and effect.<br/><br/>As I said at the start the actors are great and are the only good thing here but as great as the individual scenes are practically non of them flow in a coherent manner. You have a great scene but there is no cause or affect here, its like a bigger film just had a random number of scenes cut out and then stuck together.<br/><br/>With a film limited to 120 minutes some things have to be dropped from the source (in film-making its called ""killing your babies"") and this wasn't done, they wanted every thing and thus ended up with a mess.<br/><br/>I must mention the thing you cannot ignore which is the Tribble perched on poor Benedict Cumberbatch's head pretending to be hair. Seriously it looks like a cross between a mop and a small bail of straw. All of his excellent acting ability was wasted as you are gut laughing at the Monty Python sketch perched on his head. I mean this, people in the theatre where laughing at him as he looked utterly pantomime every time you saw him everyone was just laughing.<br/><br/>Well whoever made this pigs breakfast needs to learn at least some discipline, considering the talent on screen this should have been way better, its like a bad film school project and its a fail!"

It is over-stylised and over-designed, the story is fractured and hard to follow, much of the dialogue is reduced to one-line fragments, gloomy music seeps out of the sound track like rising damp, and we see so little of the four principal suspects that it is very hard to care who turns out to be the traitor.<br/><br/>It is done as a period piece set in the 1970s, when the novel was written, but I was around in the 1970s and I never saw an office anything like the Circus as portrayed here, still less a London hotel like the one where George Smiley stays to carry out his investigation. It may be that the film makers were trying to create an atmosphere of nightmare, but this is to misrepresent Le Carré: he may be pessimistic, but he is not Kafka.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman was an unexpected choice to play George Smiley as we are used to seeing him in much more flamboyant roles, and I didn't find him convincing. I thought he took Smiley's inscrutable reserve to the verge of caricature, as well as being too young for the part. The other actors were largely wasted even when not miscast.<br/><br/>The only scene I enjoyed was the Christmas party where the boozed-up staff of the British Secret Service join in a hearty rendering of the Soviet national anthem, led by a man in a Lenin mask and a Santa suit. John le Carré appears as an extra in this scene as well as being credited as co-producer, so he implicitly endorsed the film, but I find it hard to believe that he was satisfied with the finished product."

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is slow. Sometimes that's a bad thing, but, on this occasion, it's deliberately so. It takes some of the best British actors (and Colin Firth) and uses them subtly as spies and spy-catchers in an interweaving spy story. I might use the word 'thriller' to describe it, but I don't think it's meant to be particularly thrilling.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not James Bond. It makes no bones about that. Don't expect car chases or Bond girls (the best you get there is Kathy Burke!). Instead, you have a more realistic portrayal of spies in the midst of Cold War Britain, showing us the 'old boys' network that lurks among the corridors of power in British politics.<br/><br/>If you like your mysteries deep and your performances intense then this is the film for you. It's already received rave reviews and award nominations for its cast. Basically, you're looking at either a 4/5 rating of even a 5/5.<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm a philistine and I crave noisy explosions, exotic locations and bikini-clad lovelies collecting shells on sandy beaches. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy bored the hell out of me and I turned it off on about the hour mark.

","I usually don't give reviews, however, couldn't resist myself to review this title. In simple words, this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Spy movies are supposed to be thrilling, but this one is nowhere close. The actors have tried their best to keep the audience (in this case me) gripped to the movie, however, the story itself is very vaguely presented. There were some thrilling moments initially. But don't let it fool you. The story itself is confusing at times and its like i am trying to put together the puzzles. Having said that, if you have the patience then go ahead. Stay away if you hate slow movies. This one is super slow..."

","I will say upfront I'm a mystery-suspense-spy fanatic. If a film has any of those elements, I've seen it.<br/><br/>""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a story that has been around a long time, but one that has escaped me. When I tried to read the book, I couldn't understand what the heck they were talking about and had to stop. I may have tried to watch the Alec Guiness version, but I'm vague on it. I have a feeling I just couldn't follow it.<br/><br/>So I approached this film version with some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a very straightforward story, if underplayed, about Smiley (Gary Oldman) and his search for a mole inside the ""circus,"" the top echelon of the British Intelligence Service.<br/><br/>And what a cast - Colin Firth, Cirian Hinds, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch (who seems to be everywhere except where I want him to be, in front of a camera filming another season of Sherlock Holmes), and Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>The film is set in the 1970s, and locations include Budapest, Paris, and Istanbul.<br/><br/>Though I believe this film could have used better editing - it slips in and out of the past and present very awkwardly, which makes it confusing - I liked it. It's very British in that it moves slowly but it still manages to be absorbing.<br/><br/>""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" isn't your typical spy movie. It's not James Bond, it's not Jason Bourne. You won't be breathless from the excitement or special effects. But if you want a good story and good acting, you'll enjoy it."

","Yes, this gets off to a somewhat promising start, with the shooting of the intelligence agent in Budapest. Yes, there's an attempt to keep the viewer interested as we try to untangle the mystery of who the mole is. Yes, there's a Russian agent high up in British Intelligence. The problem is that between the shooting and the revelation of the mole's identity, there's very little here that holds your attention. It's an unfair stereotype I know, but this movie fits the stereotypes of Brits perfectly (and I'm of British descent, so ...) - dull, staid, not especially emotional, rather deliberate and always quite proper. The problem is that the stereotype doesn't make for a good movie. There's uninspiring dialogue, a story that meanders just too much and loses you in the process, and - to be honest - not a single performance in this really stood out to me as outstanding, or even as notable, making Gary Oldman's Oscar nomination for Best Actor inexplicable.<br/><br/>This also goes down as one of those annual mysteries about why certain movies receive Best Picture nominations. I can only assume that because they have to nominate so many now, a few duds are inevitably going to slip through. This was one. (2/10)"

Couldn't really connect with any of the characters except Peter Guillam played by Benedict Cumberbatch.

And the pace & the slow expose of the mole within MI6 felt just perfect..<br/><br/>So, overall: The BBC 1979 series with Alec Guiness **** out of ***** The 2011 movie with Gary Oldman **1/2 out of *****"
"LloydBayer","8","1","4","16 January 2012"," Powerful and thought provoking, yet scary
","Let's get one thing clear right from the start- This is neither a James Bond movie nor a Jason Bourne movie. There are no fancy cars or high-tech gadgets, no cheesy introductions or unstirred martinis. In essence, this is a true espionage thriller and feels very authentic right from the plot down to very minute details.<br/><br/>Adapted from the book by John le Carré, a fictional novel that spawned a seven part mini-series in 1979, this 2011 theatrical release chronicles the hunt for a Soviet mole within the highest ranks of MI6, a division of British Intelligence. Set during the cold-war era, the head of the British Secret Service, Control (John Hurt), sends agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to Budapest to buy information on a sleeper agent implanted in MI6 by the KGB (Russian Intelligence). The mission is a disaster and repercussions forces Control into retirement. When allegations of the existence of a mole persist, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is brought back from retirement. Smiley has always been suspicious of standing chief Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) peddling bogus Soviet intelligence files to the Americans in exchange for important US intelligence; or project 'Witchcraft' as it is called. Now onboard with three high ranking agents, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), Smiley can trust no one and must follow the trail when he learns that Witchcraft is also being sold to a Soviet diplomat. <br/><br/>Watching this movie, cinema goers will be split into two very distinct groups ― one section of the audience will love this movie in its entirety. The other will see the movie in bits and pieces of a fragmented plot, and may walk away before the story begins to unfold. Yes, the story here is complex and may require a second viewing for some. However, watching it unfold is a reward in itself. With a little attention to detail (and there is a lot of detail), a vast majority of the audience should have no difficulty in following its narration. <br/><br/>This is the first English film by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson but one that is soon to be his golden ticket into mainstream Hollywood. There are so many ways in which this film excels that I don't know where to begin. What I find most compelling is for a dialogue dependent movie, there are very few scenes of character interaction that are extensive in verbal exchange. All other scenes with dialogue are short and sweet while giving away vital information in bits and pieces. This brings me to Alfredson's best moments in the film ― the use of silence. You learn more about what's happening when characters don't speak; their eyes do a lot of the talking as does their body language. These scenes are so perfect that you can almost read their thoughts or hear the phantom conversation between two intentionally mute characters or tells you something is about to happen without anyone actually saying anything. Another technical aspect is the camera work, which I find an uncanny aid to the plot. There is a lot of zooming and panning, and stationary close-ups of certain objects like the still of a drop of sweat when everyone is wearing warm clothing. It is scenes like these that put you in perspective of what it must be like to be a spy ― to put your finger on something odd, to trust your instinct and sometimes why it is important to trust no one. Characterization is another area of excellence with solid portrayals from everyone. Oldman does not have many lines in the movie but his eyes do a lot of the talking. From judging and probing to emotions of fear and sadness, he conveys a lot without actually saying anything at all. Except for Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", Oldman has hardly ever played a leading role; neither has he ever been nominated for an Oscar. If seeing is believing, then I think he has a good chance for at least a nomination, come Oscar season 2012. Supporting roles are also flawless from a huge lineup including John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and of course Colin Firth― 2011 Oscar winner for Best Actor. <br/><br/>I have not read any of John le Carré's novels, but in comparison to Ian Fleming's super spy, Alfredson's rendition of Le Carré's world is very convincing. I always assumed that a spy would have to be a lonely person living a desolate life. This is so true in the movie with many characters looking over their shoulder while living in vast emptiness. Even so, it brings to light that these individuals have chosen to give up a 'normal' way of life so that you and I don't have to."
"richt76","10","1","4","15 January 2012"," It is actually...
","too short. IF you have read the book and seen the BBC's dramatisation of Le Carre's work then you'll see things that aren't there which added to those tellings of this fabulous story; HOWEVER, this is masterfully acted by Oldman. He is nuanced, from twitch to smile, from silence to noise in the very way Alec Guinness played Smiley. Jesus, he is George Smiley as played by Alec Guinness. Even the voice at times, exactly the same. Absolutely brilliant. The sets, the scenes the attention to detail of the 70s spot on, again, lovingly crafted. The film is paced just as the book / BBC, a slow burning crescendo realising Smiley's quiet genius. I love this film but for me it'S only failing is its fast run, omission of scenes, play, intrigue. Can not WAIT for the rest. Who will play Karla, other than Smiley of course! (Get it?) If you don't get drawn in, held and suspended by this film... get back to Arnie, who's MOVIES I do relish by the way. <br/><br/>Gary, again, thank you for such a great act."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10","1","4","14 January 2012"," Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)
","Anyone familiar with the novel knew this was going to be no easy task. The novel is complex and dense, as is this film. With Alfredson at the helm, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy captures everything that's great about the book. The film follows George Smiley, a man recently forcibly retired from British Intelligence. He's brought back in after an allegation is made that one of the top 4 men is a mole for a Russian operative known as Karla. Smiley's job is to flush out the mole. The reason this becomes so complicated is that nobody is sure who to believe. Each of the men within intelligence is slightly twisted or broken. They all have their weak spots, which are exploited throughout the film. Smiley is forever faithful to his disloyal wife. Tarr is a young thug also hypnotized by a woman. Alleline is an ambitious fool, and so on. Each character is played to perfection. Oldman is stoic but trustworthy as Smiley. His understated performance comes to a crescendo as he sees his wife being unfaithful. Upon re-watching it and knowing the importance of the photo frame, by just sitting still and staring, Oldman gives us plenty to think over. Hardy is a tough but lovable rogue. His mannerisms as he talks to Oldman show him as a nervous schoolboy type character. Firth is slimy but charming as the seduction machine, Haydon. His sexuality and loyalty to his colleagues is up in the air, and like Oldman, he can convey a lot in a single look. Everyone brings their A game and there isn't a single weak link. Every scene is well though out and economical. The film is bogged down with needless exposition. Alfredson prefers to use visuals where he can. He also uses excellent little cinematic metaphors to define his characters. For example, as a loose bee terrorises those in a car, Smiley bides his time, and waits, before opening a window. Unlike Cumberbatch's Peter, who swats at it and gets angry. Cumberbatch later does the same to Hardy without getting the full story. It also looks beautiful, with every frame being a loving re-creation of the 70's. I'd also like to address the so called confusion surrounding this film. You don't have to be smart to get it, but you do need concentration. There are dozens of names, code names, names of operations thrown around, and Alfredson doesn't patronise us with flashbacks or sleuthing montages. Nor will you hear Smiley go off on a Holmes like ""elementary"" rant. If you lose your place, it's going to be hard to find it again. Fantastic on all accounts, with a haunting musical score to really make it haunting."
"seggerman","9","1","4","2 January 2012"," sucker for gay love stories
","Well, so it ends badly. But in all seriousness, Le Carre (who has a small role in the film so he's still alive) once described his book as an exercise in betrayal, which would not make Smiley the main character. The Haydon-Prideaux relationship in the book and TV movie were described as going back to school days - I don't think the movie indicates as much. It does have that glance at the party, just before Haydon seduces Ann Smiley, and the illusion to their night together before Prideaux goes off to Hungary. Interesting that a film would make a character gay that wasn't in the book (Guillam) when in US moves it is always the other way around."

","OK, let me start off with if you didn't read the book or see the mini-series then you might have a difficult time understanding who's who but more importantly the significance of certain scenes. That much I'll give people.<br/><br/>I knew the story well, I literally finished reading the book about a week ago, so it was still fresh. I'm thinking even if I didn't I for one didn't find the movie that terribly hard to follow. To be honest the film doesn't follow the book page for page. For instance, the opening scene in the book isn't shown till about 20-25 min into the movie. Also, there are minor changes in the dialog.<br/><br/>Of course I wish they would have given more character development to the other characters, other than that I have no complaints. I think it was beautifully made and I agree Gary Oldman was amazing. Colin Firth, wow three for three in these past three years. I'm serious, that guy has the golden touch (we won't mention Main Street) A Single Man, King's Speech and now this, all are awesome.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in Brooklyn, NY, it was PACKED and no one left the theater and everyone seemed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>If you read the book, you'll love it... just a couple changes..."
"JvH48","Null","1","4","17 October 2011"," Almost perfect George Smiley book-to-film transition. But who is waiting for another Cold War spying story??
","This was the opening film of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. I saw it on the 2nd night, luckily without photo shoots around celebrities walking over the inevitable red carpet. The venue (378 seats) was completely sold out, after promising announcements and positive local TV reports after the 1st night.<br/><br/>The story is based on one of the famous George Smiley books by John le Carré, hence is all about spies in times of the Cold War. The announcement listed a star ensemble of actors. What can go wrong given these prerequisites?? Aforementioned TV reports talking with 1st night attendees had some warning signs already, due to the word ""complex"" that I heard too many times. I ignored those red flags, however, deeming them no experienced readers of detectives and thrillers like myself. How wrong I was! Throughout the 127 minutes we were bombarded with new characters, appearing out of the blue, most without getting introduced who he was and his role in the story. And while the story unfolded with several unexpected turns of events, we did not get any nearer to some solution or purpose.<br/><br/>Further, with the Cold War over for many years, we cannot feel ourselves involved in spy stories like these. It all seems so silly to us nowadays, knowing how we presently go along with those same countries. We also observe a formidable waste of resources in the form of protocols to restrict knowledge on a ""need to know"" basis, to protect field workers from exposure. These same protocols were circumvented a few times without many problems, as we saw demonstrated in the film. A little bit of modern surveillance equipment would have obsoleted most of these precautions anyway.<br/><br/>I'm wondering who is waiting for the umpteenth version of Cold War spy stories, without any modernization attempt that transfers them into the changed world of today. The universal concept of a ""mole"" hidden in your own ranks, is not time bound and offers ample opportunities for such a transition in time, while still keeping the core ingredients of the original story. Outweighing everyone's acting performance with all the missed chances to create a modern version, I gave an ""average"" mark (3 out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater."
"HelenMary","7","1","4","16 October 2011"," stellar performances
","Brilliant film... Stellar performances from Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Tom Hardy. Everyone actually - it was a real ensemble piece. The pace was slow and back and forth, and that added to the overall style and gritty realism of the film. The silences and un-answered questions were tantalisingly intriguing adding to the mystique of the spy genre, I felt I was investigating too... Having not read the book, I am ashamed to say, I didn't know what to expect of course. Lots of homo-erotic subtext, which added another onion layer to the piece, which I understand wasn't in the book, and I felt the cinematography, and spirit of the film was very in keeping with the era. The film was graphic in an emotionally gripping way, not in a gratuitous way, and there were so many scenes that will stick in the mind for various reasons and for the brilliant way they were portrayed; a certain bullet hole... the love scene... tears when a partner leaves etc. Smiley was always known as being invisible, a grey/brown character and the perfect spy and the whole film sort of took on that mantle. Superb film. Tom Hardy adds again to his chameleon status, he really was incredible. I don't quite know how he does it!! There will be gongs a-plenty for this!"

And by that I don't mean reading the book - simply reading a review would provide all the information necessary.<br/><br/>First there was James.<br/><br/>Then Jason.<br/><br/>And then there was George.<br/><br/>This film is as much a reaction to the ""spy"" movies of recent times as it is an adaptation of a classic novel. The reality, as portrayed in this fascinating movie, is the a good spy does not go around blowing up cars and killing scores of people... it does not assist in staying incognito. The spies all work in drab, grey government buildings. Flashbacks to the a Christmas party help to portray the ""Circus"" as just another workplace.<br/><br/>And yet there are killings in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Graphic, horrific deaths. But it is not the deaths themselves but the tension and the feeling of dread that precedes such moments.<br/><br/>This is a film for grown ups. You have to watch, listen and take it all in. Not just sit back and wait for the next fight scene or car chase to keep you engaged.<br/><br/>It is not a film without flaws. Many of the characters are introduced too quickly so we have a litany of names and faces but difficulty in matching them up. This does not aid in interpreting what is a considerably complex plot.<br/><br/>But there are great performances from an all-star British cast and from the set designers who portray Cold War-era London in all its oppressive greatness.<br/><br/>See this if you are willing to engage your brain."

For example anyone of any intelligence, and the service tries to recruit the best would make excuses not to attend the Christmas office party. The nature of the subject matter and the risks involved require intelligence. If the employees need a special spy proof box to hold meetings in then they obviously not intelligent enough to know when and what matters. The original TV adaptation brought out how serious security affairs are handled in a moderate and intelligent way. This is more true to life in the seventies than this film displays. A crescendo could of been made of the ricky tarr affair, smaller crescendos could of been implemented in the circus infiltration. The brief homosexual reference of peter Gilliam whats the point?

","I was very much looking forward to this film. I am a big fan of the book, and an even bigger fan of the TV series from the late 70s. I was utterly gripped by the TV series; mainly because I was so fascinated by the character of Smiley (as played by Alec Guinness). As far as I remember, Smiley was someone in whom almost none of the other characters had any genuine interest, nor had any love for. All his colleagues were tripping over themselves to betray him and each other. His wife treated Smiley like dirt, and was carrying on an affair with one of Smiley's colleagues, but I (the viewer) loved Smiley and his quiet determination, I hung in there, episode after episode, in the hope that Smiley, the underdog would have his day. The moment this film began and John Hurt appeared, wildly overacting, my heart sunk. It continued to sink as the camera lingered on the appalling overacting of all those other usually fine lead actors, and rejoiced in the drabness of 70s England and its civil service interiors. Gary Oldman, who plays Smiley seems so determined not to overact that he's overacting at under-acting. He is so self-consciously withdrawn, he seems to be screaming 'look at me being enigmatic'. He has no character whatsoever, except that of a quiet, smug man in a raincoat, who notices things. I didn't care about him at all, or about anyone else, because I didn't believe for a second in their reality so I didn't care whether Smiley found out who the mole is or not. The story moved so slowly with such an inflated sense of its own importance, that I fell asleep and woke up just as someone was being shot. It doesn't matter who."

Gary Oldham imitated Guiness's facial expressions and quietness but without the richness and depth of emotion and humanity that Guiness portrayed. Didn't like--the anti American slap implying that Americans torture by pulling out fingernails- I thought that was the Japanese or Chinese in WWII or the Viet Cong? Turning two of the characters into politically correct gays. Must that agenda be continually forwarded to the public? There was not much depth of character development or plot development. The film had a confusing story line which not surprisingly many people couldn't follow, and added gratuitous sex and violence, such as killing the nursing mother. This movie just didn't live up to the promise with so many stars nor the hype of the movie world. Was quite disappointed with most of the actors including Colin Firth.

Starting with the school-boyish obsession with talking in code (where the title comes from) to the ho-hum Russian characterizations and overly stuffy and bureaucratic view of the British intelligence structure, ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" becomes as dramatic as a chess move with a dramatic name.<br/><br/>While I was watching the movie, I caught myself thinking about different things, my thoughts wandering because there is just so much space between what goes on. As we get more characters and sub-characters, each one played by as recognizable an actor as the other, all the alluded bombast, gravity and grandeur of the espionage world just boils down to what seems like petty personal bickering. The old cold war character templates, the beautiful Russian girl and the sadist torturer, just feels tired and one-dimensional and personally, just reminds me of the moldy smell of old paperbacks more than anything. <br/><br/>The huge hype around the movie got me to see this but while perhaps enjoyable in its atmosphere and music, it's probably the making of simple things overly complicated that made the movie feel hollow and pointless."

(Oh, I did my best to follow the plot, but, in all honesty, I was put off early on by remembering 'Spies' from Fry and Laurie, with, respectively, their own Control and Tony: 'Control, I hear Firefly's been taken', etc.) That apart, and other irrelevant thoughts that came into my head (about agents and double-agents in relation to much-inferior products such as Salt), I congratulated myself on realizing what had really happened to one character (if only by twigging that it had to be the case with someone of Mark Strong's billing), and seeing the significance of how regimes in all sorts of workplace can change for the worse.<br/><br/>Looking for secret folders and smuggling them out reminded me of Kate Winslet implausibly getting away with it in Enigma, but, for the life of me, I couldn't understand why John Hurt's flat would not have been stripped of the vast assembly of material there (unless it was, despite being transported elsewhere for Gary Oldman's Smiley to look through, just some unrelated hobby of his): it is the first thought on Colin Firth's mind to get to another character's property first and take things from it, when he is reported killed.<br/><br/>What counts, though, as came out in response to the question that I put to Gary Oldman (and others) at the end, is what the characters are experiencing at their deepest level, which, for Smiley, was felt as his wife's infidelity: I had asked what scene (or series of scenes) was central not to the story, but to his experience of the emotional core of the film, and this seemed to be how it would feel, in the circumstances, to need to hear another's account of becoming involved with a woman, what she meant to him, and what he would do to seek to protect her.<br/><br/>Not bad for an opening night!"

The biggest detractor and the chief cause of the dullness is the central performance. The usually watchable Gary Oldman shows us his limitations in depicting Smiley, this ordinary man with extraordinary primness. His stiff-lipped almost lisping attempt at middle-upper classness is as false as any waxwork - which it most nearly represented. Then to eclipse the whole performance with the loss of accent in the only moment of emotion right at the end of the film - ""Bi-oo-l"" he says, in pure London area working class diction.

","I'm a huge Le Carre fan, but had read mostly his post-Smiley novels. When I heard that Tinker...was being remade I thought it a good time to read the novel first. Familiar with the extraordinary success and reputation of the original Alec Guiness presentation, but having never seen it, I was impressed with the initial reviews given the film. Boy, am I glad I read the book first! The book was incredible, clearly a masterpiece and a paradigm of the genre. The characters were multi-layered and their complexity was in clear contrast to those in other familiar spy novels. However upon seeing the film my disappointment was palpable and profound. Although any film must make compromises due to the limitations of time, here it appeared the director was banking on the belief that the audience had read the book first. In my humble opinion, there was no way one could have have followed the storyline haven't not had some prior knowledge of the book. After reading Ebert's review, it' s clear he also appears to have similar reservation, stating he had his own problems following the narrative ( little wonder considering the lack of scaffolding in the script )of the film. Now I'm not a director or screenwriter, but in a book which draws on innumerable flashbacks, would it not have been advantageous to have more flashbacks with narrative voice-overs ( a device well adapted in the film ""Spy Games"" ). Instead we're given meaningless looks at the past with no guidance to their significance,in indistinguishable,drab location in order to create a vision or atmosphere the director surmised as artistic. Humbug!!! I also found that despite its preeminent cast, some of Britian's A-listers, they're given little in the way of a script. So we find sketchy,facile characters in lieu of vivid and memorable ones. Take Ciaran Hinds, an extraordinary character actor,whose films include ""Munich"" and the highly touted HBO series "" Rome"", in which he brilliantly portrayed the savvy Julius Caesar, he barely speaks a line in the film. Unfortunately, we are given what amounts to smirks or frowns at the camera and we, the audience, are to glean from these facial expressions their individual traits and personalities. In summation, this movie was over-hyped and never really got the essence of the story and the complexity that make it such a timeless treasure. I look forward to seeing the serialized BBC version which must have understood, at the outset, the draw-backs of making this novel into a feature film."

","As a fan of the book, and having read it recently in anticipation for this forthcoming film, my expectations were high before sitting down to watch this version of John LeCarre's classic story. This film doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman takes the lead in this film with an outstanding performance as George Smiley, a retired English spy drawn back to work to find a Russian mole that has been hidden inside the Circus for years.<br/><br/>Tomas Alfredson does a superb job in directing this film, successfully encapsulating the mood, tone and look of both the book and the era. The story itself is complex and slow paced, therefore it will not be to everyone's taste, yet patience is rewarded if you can keep up with LeCarre's story as it unravels. My biggest question on one change in the film from the book was to make Peter Guillam's character a homosexual, a strange decision in my mind, and a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional, and it is thrilling to see so many great actors on the screen together. Oldman's performance really steals the show, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong for me are the pick of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Whilst this spy film is in stark contrast to that of action packed Bond and Bourne films, the strong characters and clever plot is what really makes this film special. For me there are two things that stops me from giving this film a 10 - firstly watching this film, at times, does feel like hard work. You have to watch this film when you are feeling awake and switched on. My second issue is that the finale is rather anti climatic. When the mole's identity is revealed you cannot help but think 'was that it?'.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this film is very special and is a definite 'must see' film, especially for the quality of acting on display, only make sure your brain is ready for a mental work out."

However, I felt in the all the cleverness and the capturing of subtle movements, information and glances something was lost. It does really project the air of confusion and mistrust that I'm sure spys of the time dealt with and also the little cultural references to the late 70's early 80's such as a Wimpy is well done.<br/><br/>It may be the case that the world has just moved on a little and our spy films are more along the lines of Bond, Bourne and Spooks and we are expecting an explosion and a killing every 20 mins.

","In a game of chess, strategy must be dictated within a minimal set of moves in order to establish a victory plan. Observing the opponent's mindset and how they operate the various delicately crafted pieces. Divulging in deception, chess is a tactician's game. A set of rules that enable each player to extrapolate a weakness from one another. The Cold War, a historic elongated period of time revolving around geopolitical tension, pitted nations against each other in regional conflicts known as proxy wars. No large-scale battles took place, but rather instigation through gathering of intelligence. The Soviet Union would send KGB ""moles"" to the US and its allies to monitor governmental movements, allowing the former to proceed with advantageous military arrangements before other nations.<br/><br/>Author le Carré had worked for both MI5 and MI6 during two decades of the Cold War, and thus utilised his experience to produce espionage novels, one of which was Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. A story revolving around the hunt for a Soviet double agent nestled within the top of the British secret service. Participating in a secretive operation known as ""Witchcraft"", which sees the trading of intelligence between the CIA and the Soviet Union, not realising that it's all just a front for the former. Five members of the ""Circus"", a colloquial term for the head of British intelligence, are suspects. Alleline (""Tinker""), Haydon (""Tailor""), Bland (""Soldier""), Esterhase (""Poorman""), and the feature's protagonist Smiley (""Beggarman""). Having been forced out of the Service, Smiley decides to investigate the proposed theory as a solo endeavour. To find the mole.<br/><br/>The arresting aspect to director Alfredson's first non-Swedish feature, is undoubtedly O'Connor and Straughan's screenplay. Adapting a le Carré novel is challenging, given the cryptic language utilised and hesitant time period of the plot itself. To minimise and compress its contents into a fragmented narrative structure that reveals crucial minor details one minute at a time, is nothing short of masterful. Expositional dialogue is limited, consequently retaining an authentic accuracy for the meticulously constructed world and the characters that populate it. Some may find the plot difficult to follow because of this, subsiding into a purposefully slow pace with zero action. Others, including myself, will prefer the periphrastic approach. It showcases linguistic talent to supply taut thrills from words alone. The characters, aside from Smiley whose personal complexions with his wife power his motives, are non-relatable. There's no emotional connectivity with any of them. Just intelligence operators doing their jobs. And that's why it works so well! Going back to the chess analogy, the characters are simply pieces on a regional board that, when moved correctly, are able to progress with the game at hand. A meticulously constructed screenplay that does not garner enough acclaim.<br/><br/>Alfredson's employment of flashbacks and non-progressive scenarios does cause the narrative to meander slightly, particularly when depicting Tarr's backstory in Istanbul, however manages to retain the central plot strand fully grounded. Bolstered by van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography that implemented noir aesthetics and Iglesias' smooth score musically exploiting Cold War-era styles. Accompanied by an outstanding list of British cast members, especially Oldman as Smiley who incidentally performs one of the best character monologues in modern cinema, that maintains an urgency for the central plot.<br/><br/>However, Alfredson falters at the last hurdle. This adaptation's conclusion, including the spy's/spies' reveal and the proceeding montage of events for each character as they move on from the investigation, was utterly underwhelming. Smiley confronts the suspect(s), only for the tension to instantly dissipate when it cuts to a new scene the following day, which sees the accused splurge a multitude of confessions. The tautness that powered Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy had diminished, with an abhorrently rushed conclusion that relinquished two hours worth of investigation. It may be perceived as realistic, yet the overall editing execution during this climax ruined its chances at being impactful. Frustrating, really.<br/><br/>Much like the sending and receiving of delicate intel, Tinker Tailor Solider Spy relishes in authentic spy tropes allowing viewers to decode its contents without the extravagance of Hollywood thrills. It's an adaptation that projects its intricate screenplay to the forefront, allowing the ornate words to perform the feature's duties. If only the conclusion had the same level of care, this could've been a Cold War masterpiece."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","0","3","9 January 2020"," Great premise, but ultimately quite a disappointment
","""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is a British film from 2011, so almost a decade old already now, and this one runs for slightly over two hours. This may sound a lot, but taking into account the original release was a miniseries back in the 1970s that ran for almost 5 hours, it puts things into perspective. I also can see why they struggle here because honestly content-wise it felt as if they weren't even close to elaborating on the characters the way they should have to make this a satisfying, let alone great, watch. Anyway, first the basics: The director is Tomas Alfredson from Sweden and I absolutely loved his earlier work ""Låt den rätte komma in"", which is probably still his most known work, but then this one here follows. TTSS is based on a novel by John le Carré and he was (despite his then already old age) also an executive producer for this movie, so I suppose he was happy with the outcome. At least critics liked it, more than the average imdb voter for sure. And so did awards bodies because this one was nominated for three Oscars (lead actor, score, screenplay), but it did not manage to win any. Well, I would say it did not even deserve the nominations. The screenplay nod is probably the worst (come on, it is two writers they should have seen how this went all kinds of wrong), but also Oldman was not really as good in here as he has been in other projects. I like the man and I am glad he won an Oscar, but here he was not hitting the right notes all the time. Also pretty embarrassing that I read some people say he should have won. The score nomination is maybe the only one that is not entirely undeserving. As for the cast, it is a pretty spectacular list. I will not mention them all as you can check the names out for yourself, but let me say from my subjective perspective there were actors in here I quite like (Hinds, wish he had more screen time) and others I did not like (Cumberbatch). It's maybe not the worst performance of his career, but I thought he was weak as always. Of course the script also did not do him any favors. Come on, are we really supposed to believe this weakling dares to and manages to punch a hunk like Tom Hardy. I mean Hardy was not Bane level back then yet, but still really ridiculous. As for Hardy, he was somewhat the only one I felt was a bit out of place because this is a very English movie and I mean he looks Russian, maybe French, and feels American , which is pretty strange because he is English. But I never saw him as an actor to the Crown. Still his story with the girl he falls for is among the film's better inclusions, but also really only because this film has many really weak moments and not because these scenes are particularly good.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is an actor I am always pretty unsure if I like him or not. He has great recognition value and this film was made right after he won his Oscar for ""The King's Speech"". He is okay overall I guess, but like almost everybody else in here, he does not have too much to work with. When in the end we find out he is the one they have been looking for, i.e. the rat, it went all kinds of wrong. It felt they just picked him because he is the most known cast member. And like I said neither him, nor Hinds or Jones (another actor I like) etc. get the character elaboration they deserve, so it felt like basically just the audience waiting until Oldman's lead character is kind enough to reveal the identity of the black sheep to us. Like how we find out that he knew very early who did it. But there is no audience involvement whatsoever. The character does not take us on a journey with him as he gets closer to discovering the truth. Instead we get constant character interactions that sometimes drift completely away from the subject and the script feels just so messy. This applies as well to Strong's character and his story line about seemingly being killed, then still being a major part of the film constantly. The longer it goes, the more prominently he is featured. But he adds literally nothing, be it when he kills the bird in front of all the children or bonds with one kid, who is an outsider too, only to push him away in the end. And the worst is probably his killshot at Firth' character. Now that was really when the film hit rock-bottom. I have rarely seen an ending that feels so shocking for the sake of it that people leave the theater with this spectacular moment in their minds and maybe forget about all the mediocrity before that. It was just bad. Still, in-between it was alright here and there thanks to some scenes and pretty cool (nick)names like Control and a female first name synonym for the enemy, but even when it comes to the latter, they messed up in the end and failed to deliver an interesting solution or at least explanation there. Like I said in the title, this film really had some nice potential I think in terms of the cast, but also in terms of the story. What they turned it into is really disappointing. In-between, I occasionally had moments during whichI felt that maybe if it stays as solid as it was this exact moment, then perhaps I can give it 3 stars out of 5 and a positive recommendation, but at the end it wasn't a close call anymore because of how they messed up again. I can see why this film is moving closer to the 6 left of the comma here on imdb. And that would still be too high I believe. I have not read the novel this is based on, so not sure if I just don't like the base material or the approach they took here. Oh well, like I said le Carré was involved with the production here too, so I cannot go too easy on him in any case. I just believe that for one average-length movie it is very difficult to turn the base material here into quality and maybe I will check out the old miniseries at some point to see if that is better. I am actually not sure if this was the the first time I watched this movie here, could be that I saw it back then briefly after its release, but the fact that I am not sure already shows you that I did not find it memorable whatsoever back then either (if I saw it at all) and it sure does not get better on rewatch. I give it a thumbs-down. Not even worth checking out for an Oldman fan like myself. And normally I even like spy thrillers too. But they messed up too much here. Attention to detail can be seen on some occasions, but if the core story is so shoddy and lacks focus this much, attention to detail when it comes to minor aspects cannot save the film. Watch something else instead."

With this version of La Carre's novel, the beginning even provides an exaggerated parody of sophistication as the movie pans carefully on each character and supporting cast, forcing the audience to suspect every person of possible collusion in some nefarious espionage plot when in reality by the very nature of espionage such behavior would actually be much more subtle and covert. The movie than turns suddenly into a much more confusing and sometimes almost unnecessarily artful movie with shots that seemingly have little relevance except to attempt to portray underdeveloped human characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps much more direct but yet indirect by deliberate disinformation which maintains a sharper and much more heightened sense of artistic, dramatic confusion can be found in such movies as The Three Days of Condor (1975) and the well richly underplayed but riveting espionage film The Russia House (1990) that captures the slow, non-action but emotive spy drama. Spy Games (2001) also had the high intensity, misdirection and graphic espionage drama that offered the audience a mentally riveting and challenging plot line that balanced both the action and mental substantive machinations of espionage. Other espionage movies that retain both the more underplayed but effective dramatic presentation include The Good Shepard (2006), Spartan (2004), Breach (2007).<br/><br/>Tinker, Tailor almost needs unnecessarily a decoder ring to really enjoy and understand the movie, the movie itself become captured in its own cipher."

Because I came prepared to the second showing the mind was more free to concentrate, not on the differences, but on the story, the acting, and the essence of the film itself.<br/><br/>On that level it was, as Le Carre himself has said, fairly masterful. The plot is not lost by the time reduction; on the contrary, it's very clear, if one knows it, and the acting was good, as one might expect from that cast.<br/><br/>Oldman dominated the action with surprising presence and power. Not once was he upstaged by any of the others nor by the direction, as sometimes happens. However, I have to say I wasn't convinced. He's not Oxford (he admitted having trouble with the voice) nor an academic, probably the very essence of Smiley who was based on Vivien Green.<br/><br/>For die-hards and connoisseurs like myself one had to accept it was a new version and not a rehash. It is unquestionably different. At times it has an art-house feel which some might think would conflict with the subject of the Cold War. Personally I don't think it did because the mood and tension is largely underlying and psychological, the very stuff of some art-house movies.<br/><br/>Anyhow, as I said, it definitely took some rethinking because I was so steeped in previous versions and the lore of the Smiley novels. The new writers haven't betrayed that lore, they've reformatted it, if that's the right word. It might not sit well with Le Carre purists but it sort of works on its own level. And, as quite a few reviewers have pointed out, they should probably follow it with Smiley's People.<br/><br/>But, to be honest, I can't say I liked it. Le Carre supported and praised it liberally but I happen to know he thinks the Guinness version was the quintessential one. It's possible he was supporting it because there was nothing else to be done."

","I've never read the book but have watched the television series with Alec Guinness several times. The film is nowhere near as good. It is bitty and spasmodic, the action jumps around rather too much with little explanation and following the plot is far from easy; if I didn't already have a good idea of it, I'd have been totally bewildered. It may be a style of film making that appeals to a younger generation but that says more about the limited expectations of the younger generation than it does about the quality of the film.<br/><br/>John Hurt as 'Control' has little part to play but is fine; Gary Oldman makes a good Smiley but there the plaudits must end. The rest of the cast drift in and out without really making much impression which is very sad given the people involved. Toby Jones, as Alleline, and Benedict Cumberbatch as Guillam are the only ones to have much to do, the rest are almost superfluous. Colin Firth and Cairan Hinds as 2 of the major characters are almost unseen and for Kathy Burke to appear seemingly just so that a couple of naughty words could be included makes no sense. Few of the characters are on screen long enough for any development and most seem more like cardboard cut-outs than real people; there's little passion from anyone.<br/><br/>It may be that attempting to condense what took more than 5 hours of television time into just 2 hours for the big screen was not possible or it may be that the makers simply weren't up to the job. Either way, this is a poor effort and both film and cast are a long way short of the excellent serialization in 1979. The sad truth is that they just don't make them like that anymore."

","For those seeking a thriller this movie is dreadful: hard to understand, hard to follow, boring and unexciting. For those interested in the nature of the British upper classes and their proclivity for treason, whether on the Right or the Left, this is a brilliant movie. Le Carre knows the upper classes well and how susceptible some of them are to treason, particularly in favor of the USSR. But most viewers of spy stories want action not lugubrious interior monologues and for them this movie is a decided failure. It takes several viewings plus reading the novel to understand what the heck is going on, and why. After which, you may no longer care at all."
"CinematicInceptions","6","0","1","20 May 2016"," Complicated spy thriller, but has potential for boredom.
","I was kind of disappointed after watching this, but it does have a fair amount of strong points. It's one of those movies that gets a lot of Oscar recognition and nobody wants it in the running but we aren't surprised that it is. The performances and the way it's directed feel like, for lack of a better term, Oscar bait. That aside, it at least gives us a spy movie that is not based off of James Bond with lots of explosions and invincible characters, but rather examines what actually goes on most of the time within the Secret Service.<br/><br/>I must admit that I don't understand how the plot all works. If you had difficulty following the first Mission Impossible movie, you will be very confused by this. There are too many names that go with lots of people and you need to know the names to follow everything. Sometimes a confusing plot is okay, because knowing how everything works makes you appreciate it more. But with spy movies, it really doesn't advance any themes or anything like that.<br/><br/>However, the basic conflict is that there is a mole in the middle of the Circus whom George Smiley (Gary Oldman) must search for. He has very little personality or evident drive which is not uncommon among spy characters. However, his character is kind of exposed by the story since there is a degree of emphasis on the friendship between all of the members of the circus in that one flashback party scene. But despite this friendship, Smiley does not hesitate to find which of his friends is the mole. This speaks volumes for his character, because it shows that he values the integrity of his job and the security of his nation over his social relationships. Perhaps this is cold-hearted, but perhaps it is courageous. Whichever it is, I doubt that it will trouble you much since there is so much more to keep your mind occupied if you don't decide to give up and turn it off.<br/><br/>Technically, it feels very well done. The camera-work feels very deliberate and artsy, but not in a Quentin Tarantino way. The acting, again, is Oscar baiting. This does not suggest that the all-star cast is molding their delivery in search of awards, but the performances are very low-key, which awards judges seem to like. For this reason, I would suggest that you not watch it because of a certain actor. I like several of the prominent actors, but I didn't really think they made it a better movie. The lighting is rather notable with its off-tone color scheme and dramatically deep shadows.<br/><br/>If you want a traditional action spy movie, this is not the place to look. But if you want a bit of a brain puzzle that involves logic, this is good. The material barely meets the requirements for its R-rating, but it's definitely an adult movie for a more serious middle aged audience. This doesn't mean that it's necessarily boring, but many young movie fans will think that it is. Overall Rating: 7.2/10"

I enjoyed Tom Hardy's contribution and Benedict Cumberbatch was as good as he always is.

","I first watched the original 1970s TV series starring Sir Alec Guinness after hearing all about this film version, previously featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I hoped it would be worthy of this placement, from BAFTA nominated director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In). Basically, set in the 1970s, during the Cold War, following an operation going badly wrong in Budapest, Hungary, Control (John Hurt), the head of British Intelligence and ex-spy George Smiley (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Gary Oldman) are brought out of forced retirement. They are given information that there may be a spy from Soviet Russia, a mole, at the very top of the British secret service, also known as ""the Circus"", the Hungary operation, which was disastrous due to the shooting of Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), was an attempt to identify which one of four senior figures was the mole. Slowly Smiley starts an investigation into who is the mole, Control had codenamed the four men suspected, using the nursery rhyme, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor"", ""Tinker"" is Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), new Chief of the Circus, ""Tailor"" is Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Alleline's deputy, ""Soldier"" is Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds), a close ally, ""Poorman"" is Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), a close ally, and Smiley code names himself ""Beggarman"". After much assistance provided by Ministry of Defence worker Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and retired Special Branch officer Mendel (Roger Lloyd-Pack), many interrogations, including with Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), an MI6 operative thought to have defected, the mole is identified by the end of the film, and Smiley is restored to the Circus as its chief. Also starring Kathy Burke as Connie Sachs, Stephen Graham as Jerry Westerby, Simon McBurney as Oliver Lacon, Konstantin Khabenskiy as Polyakov, Katrina Vasilieva as Ann Smiley, Christian McKay as Mackelvore, Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina and Philip Martin Brown as Tufty Thesinger. Oldman gives a really good performance, the supporting cast including Firth, Cumberbatch, Jones and Hurt all give good performances as well, I have to admit I did prefer the television show to this film adaptation, it was a little harder to follow also, but it thrilling and intriguing in the right moments, and a terrific spy thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Music for Alberto Iglesias, and it won the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Sound.

"hkauteur","9","0","2","2 September 2013"," HK Auteur Review - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
","I cannot fault you for not liking Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It demands that you keep up with it wholeheartedly with 100% undivided attention. Once you put in all the work the film is demanding and fully immerse into its hypersensitive world of subtleties, it becomes a rewarding experience. A blink feels like a gunshot. A facial tick becomes a car chase. Everybody is looking behind their backs.<br/><br/>Director Tomas Alfredson does nothing to make it easy either. Let's list the things: 1) The story has a non-linear plot structure that the audience needs to piece together. 2) There is no explanation for the spy lingo. 3) The audience must play detective along with George Smiley, tracking who said what to whom, matching it to what was said in a previous scene to deduce if they are lying. Lying is an art form in itself. Are they lying entirely? Or just omitting a detail? What motivates a lie?<br/><br/>The film completely functions on a thematic level. Gary Oldman said in an BBC5 interview that director Tomas Alfredson doesn't even think he made a spy thriller, which confirms my point. This is not a story about espionage at all. No, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about mistrust. It's about these men confined in tight spaces perpetually spying on each other and how it alienates them apart. Humanity is a weakness and compromises their survival as spies. Every character in the film battles with their own humanity to survive. There is a great scene where Gary Oldman's George Smiley lies to another character with a perfect poker face. The bleak coldness that he exudes is intense and shocking. The subplot with Smiley's wife artfully gives insight to the Smiley character. We never get a good look at the wife because she exists as an idea - she is the deal he has to make with the devil. Home is where Smiley is at his most vulnerable and we see the consequences of Smiley's commitment to his cold-hearted profession.<br/><br/>Since I'm a Sherlock fan, I loved seeing Benedict Cumberbatch rise through the ranks into films now. He's great as Gary Oldman's younger sidekick who is still wet behind the ears. I look forward to seeing him in the next Star Trek movie. Please don't make him play Khan. It would be a waste. Toby Jones' face screams red herring. Alfredson films Jones in a way that makes him look like an evil leprechaun, similar to how Sergio Leone's penchant for filming faces as if they were landscapes.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, this film has great cinematography in that it tells the story. The film is about discovering truth amongst a cloud of lies and the cinematography really serves that idea visually. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema has managed to find layers of shadow in places that I didn't know exist, like the backseat of a car. The camera moves, like the pan shots, really give a sense of place that constructs the moody, smoky, morally ambiguous atmosphere. With the long lenses, the audience is looking into the lives of these spies seated in tight spaces, as if we are watching them suffocate.<br/><br/>Something really noteworthy is how they utilized is Gary Oldman's glasses as a plot device. Yes, Hint! Notice George Smiley's glasses in every scene. It's used like Maggie Cheung's dresses in In The Mood For Love. What's genius about is it forces you to look at Gary Oldman's eyes, which both guides your eyes to his performance and immerses you along with his investigation of what's going on as he interviews each suspect.<br/><br/>Hands down, Gary Oldman should win the Oscar. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. How does an actor underplay a role to this degree and still manage to be this engaging? Due to the Academy's usual taste of rewarding showy loud performances, it seems unlikely Oldman will win the gold statuette. It's a subtle performance completely constructed around what he's not showing and what he is not saying. But at least the Academy recognized the brilliance of his performance. It's a step, right?<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/"

","I do respect the spy suspense flick ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", and I am glad I was finally able to tinker with it. But be ready to put your complete attention to this movie, or else you will be thinking that the movie is a ""stinker, failure, duller, please die"" type of film. Do not think that this British spy thriller is filled with Martinis, Aston Martins, tuxedos, gadgets, and all those Bonderisms. This is not that type of movie. ""Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy"" stars the masterful Gary Oldman as George Smiley, a semi-retired British espionage veteran who is forced back into the spy game by a government official to investigate who is a Russian mole in a high-intelligence British bureau called the Circus. Smiley doesn't smile much throughout the picture, and he just wants to make his mark in uncovering the mole, and then nonchalantly leave the Circus. The members of the Circus are a trapeze artist, a lion tamer, and a juggler. Oops! Wrong Circus! Just being a Clown! They really are Percy Alleline (Tinker), Bill Haydon (Tailor), Roy Bland (Soldier), and Toby Esterhase (could not catch his nickname). So who is the Mole? I will let Agent Spoiler tell you, it is.... Kidding! I will not let him commit that devilish cinematic crime. Director Tomas Alfredson does not construct an entertaining movie in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", but one that is very cerebral and converts you to Thinker by trying to grasp all of the details of the picture, and make sense of it in order to go along with Smileys' uncovering-spy mission. Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor's screenplay was one that is a head- scratcher but at the same time is also a head-catcher,whatever that means; actually, what that means is that it's confusing as hell but keeps you thinking about it. Sadly, O'Connor passed away last year before the film's release. Oldman was phenomenal in his Oscar-nominated performance as Smiley. There was high-intelligence acting work also from Toby Jones as Alleline, Colin Firth as Haydon, John Hurt as Control the retired head of British Intelligence, Mark Strong as agent Jim Prideaux, and Tom Hardy as cleaner Ricki Tarr. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a thinking-man or thinking-woman's movie, and the mission to watch it should not be abandoned by anyone up to the challenge of capturing a complex flick. **** Good"

","In a world of James Bonds and Jason Bournes, George Smiley and his lot are hardly the most outwardly provocative offering in the spy genre, but that is not the game here. The character previously of John Le Carre novels, then television series is a spy for adults. So is this movie.<br/><br/>Everything about Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is measured. Director Tomas Alfredson has painted his film with bleak London scenes and flat 1970s tones. He shoots through the bars of fences and the frames of windows, immediately entrapping us in the dark, claustrophobic world that was the Secret Intelligence Service during the height of the Cold War.<br/><br/>When Control (John Hurt), the head of the ironically referred-to ""Circus"", is forced to retire in response to an operation gone wrong, he takes his right hand man, George Smiley, with him. We find George (Gary Oldman) a slightly sad man who continues a routine of swimming and leaving his estranged wife's mail on the table, keeping track of the sort of little details a man who has spent his life in the spy trade would come to value. But while he was forced out, he is compelled back into action to pick up the trail of a mole in the organization. As someone on the outside, Smiley is uniquely to look in.<br/><br/>Given an agent, Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch), to assist his investigation, one of the first things Smiley discovers is that an old colleague, Connie, was forced out as well. As they look through photos of the old days, she remembers fondly the old days, before the secrecy and dealings of the cold war.<br/><br/>As Connie seems so keen to do, we bounce back to the past, and from England to Hungary and beyond. Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy), a young spy who is accused of being a deserter, appears suddenly in George's home with a fantastic story that opens our investigators to another world of treacherous possibilities.<br/><br/>The film is filled with brief scene-setting shots—some mundane, but others filled with detail and plot. The viewer is left trying to put together these sporadic glimmers of story as more involved scenes roll on. The result is an occasionally frenzied attempt at thought in a film otherwise as austere with pace as it is with revelations. And, while these two hours are packed with well-cultivated tension, there is little relief. There are many twists and turns, but very few bring with them as much intensity as may be expected for such a high-stakes game.<br/><br/>The acting is superb from a cast of British elites—most especially Oldman, who is convincing in both his advanced age and quiet desperation. We see that no one is innocent of treason. We watch as friendships, relationships and solemn oaths fall victim to the pursuit of the greater good. And everyone, even the ultimately-revealed mole, believes what they do to be the right thing.<br/><br/>After two hours of restrained acting, music and even colors, the ending comes together laced heavily with scenes of a past holiday party, smiles and laughs and overwhelmingly cheerful music. Resolutions for all and such an upbeat finale seem to break somewhat from the tone and delivery of the bulk of the film. After being snubbed of a true dramatic climax, it seems a bit dishonest.<br/><br/>Walking out of the theater, however, what lingers about Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the meticulousness of it all: the acting, the attention to detail and the use of metaphoric imagery. Despite this being his first international foray, director Alfredson's confidence shows in every minute. He has created a film that will linger with the viewer long after the credits stop rolling."

","While very well done considering that it tried to condense 6 hours into two. As a result it was unable to develop the characters to its fullest extend which will hamper any attempt to develop this into a series. The entire LeCarre suite needs to be developed without regard to time. Either do the Quest for Karla or make each individually. It would help to begin with the Spy Who Came in from the Cold and move forward. LeCarre is not James Bond, but is more realistic than what Ian Flemming portrayed. Espionage is not clamorous or is without bloodshed. It is a dangerous game that often results in good men going to the wall while idiots get promoted with dangerous regularity."

","I guess I must be one of the very few who've not read the book or seen the TV series; I came to this completely cold, attracted by what appeared to be a stellar cast. Despite watching with considerable concentration, this movie confused me from start to finish. Whispered dialogue, flashbacks and returns transitioned so quickly and so frequently, all continuity was lost. Are we in 1955 now or 1973? Characters' motivations are barely suggested, long, drawn-out silences that only served to prove how long Gary Oldman can keep his eyes open without blinking. One of the main characters dies early on but due to the poor continuity and little frame space given to it, blink and you'd miss it. One character who we are told is dead is in fact alive, or is he? Is it important? Only if you want to know what's going on. This is no James Bond car-chase and explosion-filled extravaganza. It's a brooding, 1970s brown-out, and would be tension-filled if the poor viewer unfamiliar with the story was given half a chance to comprehend it."

I understand subtlety and how effective a slow build can be in film, and i know there's lovers of this film out there that will claim anyone that hasn't enjoyed it has A.D.D, but for me, the director placed little emphasis on making his film compelling and pandered more to a certain 70's style of film making. In summary i'd say Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was a well acted but plodding tale told at a one gear pace with little in the way of character depth or discovery. As a fan of the director of 'Let The Right One In' i was expecting something to really shake me in much the same way as 'The Usual Suspects' did, but sadly it made little lasting impression. Dull."

One can only imagine all those Brits had a leg up from the viewing the well-regarded BBC series, or that they intuitively resonate with 1970s Cold War cloak-and-dagger machinations literally hashed out over the tea table, or perhaps simply tend to read more spy novels. 21st Century American sensibilities, however, generally lack these advantages, which should not be an impossible feat of cinema to overcome. Period espionage films like The Third Man (1949) by British director Carol Reed continue to pack a powerful punch. This flick, however, is somewhat less thrilling than canned peas, which, appropriately, the cinematography's consistently muted tones closely resemble.<br/><br/>The aptly named Hardy and Strong are the sole actors showing any signs of testosterone in the bloodstream. Tinker Tailor comes alive during Tom Hardy's brief scenes wherein he radiates a palpable sense of the extreme jeopardy entailed in playing for high stakes. (Hardy would make a really interesting Bond, come to think of it.) Mark Strong similarly emanates an aura of danger and consequence, yet both players are hamstrung by the script's failure to delineate neither the stakes nor the consequences. <br/><br/>The remainder of the consistently saturnine, mostly male cast are not only as uniformly bland and boring as British cuisine of the period, but appear to be suffering authentic gastro-intestinal consequences, as well. Colin Firth fails to demonstrate a range stretching the distance from A to B, while Gary Oldman never strays an inch off A. His is definitely a contender for the most everlastingly drab one-note performance outside a Mike Leigh movie in the entire depressing history of the British cinema."

","There are slow boilers and then there is this film. This film looks like a film from the 1970's. The film is grainy the scenes are filled with earth tones, people wear ugly ties, everyone has a bad haircut, the look of the film is a nearly perfect summation of 1970's cinema. That being said I wish I had brought a pillow with me when I went to review this film so I could have caught some shut eye. The sad fact is this film is duller than dishwater.<br/><br/>This film needs an injection of vitality in the worst way. I am not advocating Michael Bay type explosions by any means. However, this films positive elements are betrayed by a plot that moves like a turtle. Also I am not sure what Alfredson was up to with his use of extreme close up and slow pan out again and again.

"magferguson","9","0","2","2 April 2012"," The essence of spying
","The movie will disappoint, if you expect Bond/Bourne. It is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"". <br/><br/>In general, you could say it is a sort of spy-as-a-profession piece, much closer to what it actually means to work in the intelligence than any of the spy-action movies: lots of talking, office work, reading, thinking... and as a result people die, and sometimes wars get started.<br/><br/>As the one who has read the book, I could follow the plot. I suspect that if one hasn't seen it, it could be hard sometimes. A lot of background detail from the book is omitted or only sketched, leading to some of the things appearing to have no reason. <br/><br/>I appreciated the slow burn of the movie and subdued violence hanging in the background. <br/><br/>What I did dislike was that the climax and last part of the movie seemed to be too rushed, lacking the necessary exposure/preparation. I got the feeling that the movie should have been about 15-20 minutes longer to explain/show more of the actual preparation for the finale and fill in background.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me was that the trailer music never appeared in the movie. The film's music is good, but since it is as low key as the movie itself, it subtracts from the suspense, while the trailer music would have added to it and sort of helped to tie the plot together.<br/><br/>Despite all that, yes, 9/10 for me."
"gelman@attglobal.net","8","0","1","31 March 2012"," Fair Comparison?
","Comparing this film version to the 1979 TV series with Sir Alec Guiness as George Smiley may not be appropriate but it is inevitable for anyone who has seen the earlier rendition of John Le Carre's classic spy novel. Unfortunately for the movie, it isn't playing in the same league with the series. Gary Oldman is quite good as George Smiley; Alec Guiness was superb. The film, being far shorter than the series, covers the complicated story in a much more compressed fashion. Le Carre is well known for concealing outcomes as the plot develops and for creating characters with morally ambiguous motivations. In compressing the plot, the movie is occasionally confusing and the confusion is amplified by dark lighting in many scenes, leaving the viewer wondering at times what's happening and to which characters. By all means, anyone who loves Le Carre's novels needs to view the series.<br/><br/>Having said this, the movie is nonetheless pretty good. Oldman can't touch Guiness but he's more than competent as Smiley. Colin Firth as Bill Haydon competes quite well with Ian Richardson who played that part in the series. John Hurt, with his lined visage, inhabits the role of Control and Ciaran Hinds, Toby Jones, David Dencek, Kathy Burke, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch all acquit themselves quite well. Despite occasional confusion, the story line comes through and tension is nicely maintained even if you already know the identity of the mole the Soviets have planted at the top of the Circus. Too bad there isn't enough room for more thorough character development, but the medium in this case conceals the message.<br/><br/>I gave the series 10/10 and the movie 8/10 which is still a strong ranking."

But in this movie, all the usual suspects are played by more or less famous actors.<br/><br/>This is not a spy movie like 007. There are no action fights, car chases, etc. It's more like watching a drama. What makes it worse is many unfamiliar characters are involved, and the timeline is sometimes played out of order.

Maybe it is due to the time constraints placed on a film. By comparison, the mini series had the benefit of more hours available to tell the story. I think the story did a decent job up until the climax. It was from that point on that I felt there was a rush to tie things up. The last 10 minutes of the film left me unfulfilled.

","This movie is set in 1973, but it seems rooted in the Sixties, like a nostalgic period piece about the gold times of Cold War. Photography is bleak and ""dusty"". Not a single bright, saturated colour in sight. Equally bleak are the main characters.<br/><br/>The byzantine plot revolves around finding a mole nested at the top of the British Secret Service – code-named the Circus. The mole is very good at covering his tracks, since he receives first hand info from Karla - the elusive head of Soviet intelligence - every time a communist agent decides to escape to the West to spill the beans.<br/><br/>The Circus is composed by a bunch of middle-aged, unglamorous spies, who look more like average civil servants than like James Bond. Besides, they all are busy keeping up the appearances while living a life of deception, being it about their sexual preferences, drinking or actually working for the Russians. They all have some little dirty secret.<br/><br/>Even Smiley, our agent in the Circus. He is middle aged, silent, not aging gracefully and his wife is sleeping around. After having been forced into retirement by a devious scheme, Smiley is put back in the game to work independently from the Circus.<br/><br/>Enters Ricky Tarr, an agent allegedly gone rogue in Istanbul who is actually the key to finding the mole. Tarr is the only sympathetic character in the whole plot and the only one who is not a failure – yet – at living a meaningful life.<br/><br/>He is also the only one who speaks at normal speed. Somebody must have heard me complaining about how tiresome it can be to follow fast, long conversations. Here we have the total opposite. Dialogues are next to non-existent.<br/><br/>Smileys could easily have found himself at home in the silent movies, as he speaks perhaps four lines of dialogues in the whole movie, except for a long and boring monologue about his meeting with Karla.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, lack of compelling dialogue and the slow pace undermine what classic spy movies are about. No suspense is built in any scene, or curiosity about who the mole might be. When the mole is discovered, the anti-climax is complete.<br/><br/>Even if ""Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy"" may be very realistic about the life of spies during the cold war, the cinematic results are quite disappointing. Not a bad movie, but brace yourself for interminable pauses, unexplained scenes and non-stop zigzagging in the temporal line."

","Can you really say that you liked a movie even if you do not fully understand the story it just told? After watching this latest film incarnation of John le Carre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", I fully agree with several reviewers who said that they know they have seen a cinematic masterpiece, yet cannot grasp the complicated story that just unfolded on the screen. <br/><br/>I caught this film mainly because of Gary Oldman's Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He is very subdued, but very good in his characterization of retired agent George Smiley, who was called out of retirement to flush out a Russian mole within their spy organization. The way Oldman really disappears into his roles, I am not really sure what he looks like in real life! In my opinion though, this movie was more of a ensemble cast acting, rather than a showcase for a single actor. Colin Firth, Mark Strong and especially Tom Hardy all shine in their respective roles, which I cannot really label as merely ""supporting."" <br/><br/>The film was beautiful to watch, with those imaginative camera angles, the energetic editing (but an slam-bang action film this is NOT), the stark colors of the 1970's set design. Is it the director's fault then that I, who had not read the novel nor seen the Sir Alec Guinness TV- mini-series, did not get the whole detailed story right away? I am reserving my right to judge this film with finality on my second watching."

","This movie adaptation of John Le Carre's classic novel is an average spy movie. Gary Oldman inscrutably plays the role of a semi-retired MI6 spy rehired to uncover a mole in the Circus, ably assisted by Cumberbatch (our TV Sherlock). There are many other great actors in the movie, but their roles are quite small and forgettable (except Firth, who leaves some impression).<br/><br/>The screenplay is good enough, but is quite emotionless and doesn't get you much involved. It's quite slow and unexciting for a spy movie.

You really get to know the characters in the BBC version which is brilliantly performed by everyone. When the conclusion comes about in this film it is difficult to see why anyone would really care. Gary Oldman just seems too bland and the use of an open plan warehouse for an office has an out of place contemporary feel. A bit of period cost saving I think. Not a bad experience in the cinema possibly but not worth buying the blu-ray/DVD as the BBC version blows the film away. Barely adequate against sheer class."
"dromasca","8","0","1","11 February 2012"," The Film That Comes from the Cold
","A few weeks after coming to Israel as a new immigrant in 1984 I started to borrow books from the public library in Lod. The first book that I ever read after becoming a free man was John Le Carre's 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Obviously the sophisticated world of Cold War espionage viewed from the perspective of the West was not the kind of theme that would allow books to be published in Communist Romania. I fell under spell from the first pages, and this was the beginning of a log term relationship of adulation and frequent reader mileage between me and Le Carre.<br/><br/>I missed the very well made (as I hear) BBC series, so the film directed by Tomas Alfredson is the first screen version of the novel that I see. The principal lines of action and the relations between the characters are well kept here, and for most of the duration of the film the deep feeling of incertitude, the Britishness of feelings well concealed under manners, the foggy fights were the concepts of good and bad need to be found deep inside the hearts and minds of the characters receive appropriate translation in the language of cinema. The interior flow of Le Carre prose gets an equivalent in a series of short scenes, some happening in the present, other being flashbacks that get a pace and fluidity of themselves that make of the film a captivating thriller despite the lack of real action scenes. The Byzantine relations between the members of the secret services are translated into dances of characters that move and look to each other, or avoid one another like in sacred rituals. The Cold War atmosphere is put on screen using 70s-like effects, all blurred in smoke of cigarette, fog and frost.<br/><br/>Some nuances get lost, and this is probably inevitable. Some characters get new dimensions or different perspectives. The sentimental aspect of the story (the relation between Smiley and his wife) is told, but loses in the context of the film the emotional importance it has in the book. On the other hand Gary Oldman builds a Smiley perfectly fit for the screen translation of Le Carre's intention. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is one of the best adaptations of a novel by Le Carre that I have seen to date."

","What a superb film. The feel of the 'time' was captured wonderfully, so much so you could smell the cigarette smoke. This is a film which requires a large degree of investment from the viewer as you cannot miss a scene, do so and you will be lost. You need to be tuned in to the fact that this was the end of the Cold War and all the protagonists were looking towards a very unsure future, all of which adds to the underlying paranoia. But the clear winner for me was the outstanding performance of Gary Oldman - measured, understated sheer brilliance. It's not just what he says its what he doesn't say that is marks his performance: its the gestures, the glances and the silence, yes the silence which at times is deafening. It is amazing to me that this is his first Oscar nomination for best actor. Compare this performance with LEON and particularly STATE OF GRACE which are totally different but serve to emphasize the versatility of his acting talent. Good luck Gary for the Oscars. Go and see this film but be prepared to 'pay attention'!"
"damiengcummings","8","0","1","8 February 2012"," A marvellously English cold war thriller
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is without any doubt a wonderfully crafted film set in a recreated 1970s London that exudes a certain eerie realism, from the bare light bulbs to chain smoking it creates the perfect atmosphere for the retelling of John le Carré's classic novel.<br/><br/>Tinker tailor soldier spy is in essence a cold war thriller but gone are the explosions and gun shots and heroics, this is a film of internal war. It tells the story of a mole inside the British intelligence service, nicknamed quite aptly 'The Circus', leaking secrets to the Russians and the quest of one old retired spy to find the truth whilst remaining unknown to the upper echelons of the circus. With a quintessentially English feel, from dinner at the wimpy to the disgust that darts across Oldman's face at the slightest sign of unbecoming activity which goes a long way in adding to the Oxbridge old boys characters in the film.<br/><br/>One thing that you notice as you watch the film is the fantastic casting for which we have Tom Alfredson and co to thank as it truly elevates the film to a level that could not have been achieved by other actors and strikes a real chord with le Carré's novel. Not simply is this laid at the feet of Gary Oldman (George Smiley) who is in reverence to the book, a man of few words but inspiring presence. Oldman plays Smiley with a majestic manner in which he, much akin to an Oxford old boy and a gentleman, does most of the talking with his unflappable demeanour and patience which for any actor would be a challenge to put forward so much by saying so little but Oldman plays it quite masterfully and reveals Smiley's insecurities with a marvellous intimacy that truly brings Smiley to life from the pages. This film is acted wonderfully throughout, from the ever dapper Collin Firth (Bill Haydon) with his confidence and authority to the gruff military manner of John Hurt (Control) that to any reader of the book will see a near perfect portrayal and anyone who watches the film will see an extraordinary performance.<br/><br/>Further note should be given to screen writers Bridget O'Connor and , Peter Straughan who do an excellent service in taking le Carre's mass of characters, plot lines and at times circumlocutory manner and streamlining it into a film of only 2 hours whilst retaining the bulk of the plot and emotion in the book. This is however where to a fan of the book the film falls down as the relationships are all hashed into one scene of a circus party where all the emotional interaction between characters is forced into one room. Which leaves the complex nature of the way Bill is thought of by every character in the book sadly underexposed so too is the character of Jim Prideaux who loses a lot of his depth as a character.<br/><br/>Overall however, this is a wonderful film with very little to say against it other than no lover of a book is ever completely happy with its translation to film but in this case it is a damn near perfect job and well worth a watch."

","Well...where to begin? I eagerly anticipated watching this film, having read the book and being old enough to remember the Alec Guinness portrayal of George Smiley on the BBC in the late 70s and having listened to John Le Carre (not his real name) being interviewed. <br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. The plot is not really that complex, so no excuses for dragging it out unless you can hold the audience's attention: mine lapsed a number of times and I felt that all I was doing was making coffee and watching the DVD timecode. It felt like it was directed by the same man who made the third of the Swedish-made Dragon Tattoo films, which is a truly Scandinavian experience on the same proportions as watching a washing machine spin its cycle for 2 hours. <br/><br/>So - back to the story - there's a mole at the top and he needs to be rooted out. Only Smiley (a wonderful name for a non-smiler) can do the rooting, helped and hindered by HMG. Each of the 'middle-aged' characters (Firth, Oldman etc) codenamed Tinker, Tailor etc is as well- developed character-wise as the little paper headshots taped to their chess-pieces. Gary Oldman was just too enigmatic for me. I quite liked the way he moved so slowly, but then he seemed to be playing someone much older than himself, so it sort of worked. <br/><br/>John Hurt, as 'Control', plays himself very well. Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch seem like they're both itching for a bit more action, as if the director's holding them both back. I like Kathy Burke's fleeting role (basically one scene) but she, like Colin Firth, was grossly under-used. <br/><br/>Too much of this was filmed in isolation:two people talking. Then one staring. Then two talking. I feel that a more unified approach to the story and the film-makers would have been beneficial. I did, regrettably, feel that the real story was going on somewhere else. <br/><br/>So: it's probably worth a watch, but only if you prepare yourself. Perhaps my expectations were too high."

","The period of 1973/1974 is very much Britain's darkest post war days: IRA terrorism, inflation, strikes, football hooliganism, police corruption. And on top of all this the Cold War cast its dark nuclear shadow over everything. It was the age of decline and pessimism. John Le Carre's 1974 novel TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a book very much reflective of the nation's post-war decline.<br/><br/>Now, the novel has been turned into a major British film by Thomas Alfredson and is the best Le Carre adaptation since the BBC's SMILEY'S PEOPLE back in 1982. Central to the film's success is quite wonderful production design which evokes the era of 73/74 with remarkable precision, particularly the low-tech London HQ of the Circus (Le Carre's name for MI6)- a pre-digital world of dial telephones, shelves full of paper files, reel to reel tape recorders, cine film all housed in a large warehouse type building where the main conference room is a sound proofed portakabin.<br/><br/>Head of the Circus is Control (John Hurt). When a mission in Budapest to uncover a Soviet mole in the Circus is blown and the agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) shot and captured, Control and his aide George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced into retirement. However, the months pass and Smiley is called upon by the Home Office - there really is a Mole in British Intelligence. They now know this via an AWOL Circus operative called Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) whose affair with Irina - the wife of a Russian agent in Istanbul - leads to him learning about the Soviet infiltration. However, as soon as he alerts London his message is intercepted, his senior murdered and Irina kidnapped and shipped to Moscow and killed.<br/><br/>The film is very complex and key events told through a series of flashbacks. Yet it's full of 'moments' which lodge in the mind. We see something I've not seen on screen before - a British Intelligence Christmas party with all the key personnel attending. It's also full of wonderful performances such as Kathy Bates in a marvellous scene as ex- intelligence analyst Connie Sachs and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillame, Smiley's man on the inside. However, they key role of Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is surprisingly underwritten. The end of the movie feels rushed. <br/><br/>At the centre of it all is a commanding piece of screen acting by Gary Oldman as Smiley. He never speaks for the first 15 minutes of so of the film and it's a quiet and restrained performance. At one point he delivers a monologue to Guillame about how he once met his Russian opposite number and nemesis Karla and it holds your attention for the sheer force of acting. This is Oldman's tour-de-force confirming him as one of the great British actors of our generation."

Leading an ensemble British star cast, Gary Oldman delivers a brilliant performance that can easily land him an Oscar nod this year. The star cast also includes Benedict Cumberbatch(Sherlock, War Horse, The Hobbit), Colin Firth, Tom Hardy (Inception, Warriors & The dark knight rises), Stephen Graham (Public Enemies, Boardwalk Empire), Ciaran Hinds (The Debt, In Bruges, Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life), John Hurt, Toby Jones, Mark Strong (Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood).

The movie is based on a novel by John Le Carre, which talk about the spy trade craft between the British and Soviet Intelligence during the early 1970's. The story follows the hunt for a Soviet double agent who is sitting at the top of the British Intelligence. The story kicks in a languid pace in the start but very soon it grabs your attention as you enter the world of George Smiley (Oldman) and how he maneuvers the chess board, piece by piece, until he strips it down to the intended target. The era of early 1970 is brilliantly recreated with authentic sets, costumes and a haunting score which add to the mood of the entire experience. Tomas Alfredson directs with a steady hand, never letting it slack, and allows Oldman to breathe the character of Smiley. Give the movie the attention it deserves for the first 15 minutes and I promise you, you would want to see it to the end."

","This film is without doubt a credit to British cinema, the fact that it had superb competition in the form of the king's speech, proves to me that this film has lived up to its potential.<br/><br/>This film truly brings out the concept that film-making is truly an art, films that been released recently, (and I'm talking since 2000-2011), have destroyed the true meaning of a film, pointing a camera at things they consider good, where as tinker taylor soldier spy is packed with beautiful shots with terrifying realism that, without exaggeration, make you seem like you are part of the movie.<br/><br/>The kings speech without a doubt was going to be hard to top, mainly because of the unusually thrilling performance from Colin Firth and the possible career high performance from Geoffrey Rush, and obviously I cannot fault the consistent and more than acceptable performance from Helena Bonan Carter, But there is no doubt in my mind that the acting in tinker taylor soldier spy has a spectacular performance from Benedict Cumberbatch of sherlock who hasn't yet kicked his movie career off. Gary Oldman peaked with his acting in this film, his performance is so vivid and believable, he plays a character who is strong in his skills but as a person very unsure with who he can trust. Throughout the majority of the film his tone of voice is very calm and reassuring and in a way lures you into a false sense of insecurity when he starts to show he means business later on in the film. There is only one scene in the film were he raises his voice and when I witnessed this scene, I for the first time in my life shivered at the tremendous execution of the line.<br/><br/>Another asset that this film brought to my attention was the way the villains were portrayed, they were shown as the slimy parasites that they were built up to be, despite not knowing there motives you truly hate these characters with a passion which again enforced the realistic vibe of the film.<br/><br/>Without doubt this film has made me proud to be British and I would without hesitation recommend this film to anybody that is considering viewing this film, it truly is in my personally opinion, revolutionising cinema.<br/><br/>Britain 1, America 0."

"daveinpublic-279-224878","8","0","1","30 January 2012"," Well-made movie, but the plot wasn't as good as you think it will be
","I think the cinematography and acting made the movie seem more intellectual than it was. I never read the book, but unlike others, I was still able to understand the movie. I don't think it was intellectually challenging because of the plot's depth, but from a lack of explanation and splicing elements from the entire time line in random order. Some scenes, like the main investigator, Smiley, wading in a pond outside, were never explained or integrated into the plot.<br/><br/>I had a hard time understanding some of the plot, not because it was too complex, but because it didn't make sense. To recap, Ricki Tarr is sent from the British Intelligence Agency (the Circus) to investigate a Russian guy Boris on a routine job, who is really just a sort of Soviet decoy. Ricki Tarr falls in love with Boris' 'wife' Irene who happens to be a Soviet operative. Firstly, why would the Soviets send a Soviet operative with this kind of sensitive information along with a decoy? Tarr finds out that there is a spy in the Circus from Irene, which is the mother load of all mother loads - yet, he doesn't keep Irene in a safe place (she gets caught, tortured, killed), he simply sends it by wire to anyone who will receive it at the Intelligence Agency, where he knows the spy is. Tarr, ""I know there's a spy somewhere in the Intelligence Agency,so I'll send a wire to the Intelligence Agency letting them know."" Then, the record of that wire was removed from the books alerting Smiley, the future investigator of all this, that there really is a spy. But, what motivation did the spy have to remove that from the books? It was sent by wire, everyone knows it was sent, but the spy risks confirming the validity of the claim by removing the record of the wire? But, after the Circus are aware that there is a spy, a guy by the name of Jim Prideaux is sent by the Circus' ringleader to learn the name of the spy from a Soviet general willing to sell the info. When you find out there's a spy, you find the name of the spy by paying a willing person on the opposing side, easy stuff, not exactly mind bending. This would have solved the mystery, and the movie would have been over. So, Jim Prideaux does one last thing before he goes to find out the name of the spy in the Circus, he tells his best friend in the Circus, Haydon!... Why not? They're friends, I mean you can tell that because they're both smiling in a picture together at one point. And I'm sure they watched Winston Churchill on the TV all the time, too. Too bad Haydon was the spy. I guess that's what happens when you tell your friend who has a 20% chance of being a spy that you're going to find out if he's a spy. Of course Prideaux did this because he subconsciously was trying to save Haydon, hmmmm. Haydon tells the Soviets about Prideaux and they grab him and torture him. Then, for some reason, he is presumed dead because he was shot once. A few months later he withdraws money in one of his code names. Later on this will alert Smiley that he's still alive. Now Smiley is getting smart! The twists and turns aren't too complex. Some of the Circus is restructured after this 'fiasco' where one agent is killed, Smiley is let go, and other people are fired. The people who are at the top now are people who have established a name for themselves by creating project Witchcraft, an organization that trades sensitive information about each others countries under the auspices of being double agents, but are actually triple agents? Apparently everyone gives up on trying to find the spy at this point. So to recap, Tarr learned of a spy, they send an agent to find the spy's name, that agent is killed, and they give up after that. Time passes, and Smiley is brought in to investigate the people fired around that time. Smiley is actually a suspect himself because he worked at the Circus when all this happened, so why did they have him investigate? He learns what I've just said through interviewing people. Then he has an idea that project Witchcraft is not just a place where we give 'chicken feed' Intel in exchange for incredible Intel, it's where the spy from the Circus gives 'chicken tenders' or real deal Intel. I don't how he got that idea. Once he thinks that the home where project Witchcraft is located is the place where the Circus spy gives sensitive Intel to the Soviets, he does the old, feed them Intel and wait for the spy to transmit the Intel. To me, the plot wasn't too deep. Someone finds out there's a spy, they send an agent to find the spies name, that doesn't work because the agent happened to tell the spy before he went and found out the spy's name. The new investigator feeds intelligence and waits where he thinks the spy exchanges information. I feel like the story is aggrandized by the cinematography, atmospheric England, acting (though I expected more). The plot was a little thin, had holes, didn't introduce anything new. Maybe that's why they had to make it difficult to follow, to hide the imperfections.<br/><br/>I still can't help but like the movie. It was a mental exercise to follow the plot, which gave me the same kind of enjoyment I get from playing Sudoku. I'm a fan of some of the actors. I really liked the locations - the smoky party room, the odd orange padded walls of the intelligence agency. The director took his time with the movie. I think between him and the actors, the movie still worked."

","I love this type of genre where the story, plot, and acting is valued greater than action. If you've read the book or seen the TV mini-series, you'll probably like this at about an 8 level. If you haven't been exposed to the story, it will be a confusing and boring experience.<br/><br/>Like the TV series, the emphasis is on limited dialog, plain locations and spaces, and acting space. Some would call it dry, but there is power in the silence as the characters share meaningful looks and furtive glances. If the TV series dialog was measured, the movie dialog was more rationed. I think there were a solid five minutes George Smiley (played by Oldman) said a word after his first screen exposure.<br/><br/>The general plot is not that hard to follow, but this is a story based in subtleties. Nuances are difficult to interpret if you don't know where the story is going. Suffice it to say, everything you see is important and sometimes you don't realize the importance until later. Following the high level agents takes attentiveness not usually needed in a wide-release film.<br/><br/>Still, I like the style and substance of the movie, even if it is difficult to catch all the meanings of each plot step. Several people nearby me mentioned that while they liked the movie, they were confused about certain events. One told her spouse they needed to pick a simpler movie to watch next time it hurt their brain."

This is not a kind of movie which will thrill you, or even entertain you its more like a game of chess which can be interesting for some and boring for rest. I don't think Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy utilized the talents of the great cast it assembled to its full potential. This movie didn't had any moments which takes your breath away. There were lot of complexities but at the end it disappoints you and climax was disappointing too.

","NO No no no no no, please no. First, Oldman is probably one of the best actor in the world if not ever. Becomes most characters with ease. in this case, there was nothing left for the audience. I understand what the film maker is trying to do. Story driven, real plot, no car chasers, real writing. The film is over written, it labors. It is a period film that spends most of the time in flash backs. The director has tried too hard! It's brechtian without the drama, or story or plot. it is so boring and slow, you just pray that maybe some more people get killed or shot, or something, anything. 99.9% of most Hollywood films are rubbish, with too many car chasers and no story and are becoming computer generated junk for the most. But this films goes too far the other way. Did the producers have their own money in this film? it looks a lot like it. Art first, audience 100TH! I understand and I was genuinely looking for this. But smiley also has Witt, charm and he is smart as a whip, according to the book. Oldman was paying tribute to Sir Alec, and although he can do any accent in the world, Oldman really struggles with a posh British accent. he can't do Hugh Grant's voice. Mainly because for those of you who don't know, his real voice is somewhere between a drunk Peter cook doing an impersonation of Steven Burkov. but he is the best. But the audience was left out of this one. Darcy tried, and mark strong is always the good actor in really bad movies, I thought at the end of the film that he and Darcy were gay lovers, don't ask me why! i saw the producers of this film bagging the Oscars the other night. if i produced this film, i would mostly be bagging cinema as an art form, sometimes directors, fellow actors and writers are too close and respectful of each other and the material. The producers of this film were just a bit too close to the material. it is amazing, if you were able to stay awake, by the end of the film they were putting on a Harry potter, looking for sequels. Maybe there will be more, lets just forget about this one, and put Bond in the next one and Jason for good measure. British cinema please! my goodness, what a bunch of git's. Hello Hello Hello, whats going on here then? del-boys playing the toffy geezer, up the old bill in slow mo backward rainbow, dear dear deary me, get your hand off it. if you do have to watch it, might I suggest crystal meth for the first half hour, if your still there, crack open the hard core please please please 20 mill, I just hope Gary got 19.5, he probably needs it. The other real star of this film was whiskey! Every character, in every scene is drinking whiskey or about to pour a glass. Maybe this is the real British intelligence. And windows, for some reason Oldman spends about a combined half hour of the movie staring longingly out windows for some reason, he's thinking! about what! all of the films sub plots were meaningless, because the film itself had no plot to begin with. the film needed intrigued, little bit of Richard Burton and maybe some shots of check point Charlie. The film-maker doesn't understand that most young people, even thirty something people know very little of the cold war and its tension around the world. the actual game of cat and mouse. films have to be able to justify themselves. This film had no pace, no meaning, no beginning, no middle, no end. It tried hard to persuade us there was tension, but by that stage you just didn't care. Le carre is not Shakespeare, none of these characters were even the slightest bit 3 dimensional. but he is better than this, oldman is better than this, but he has made real duds over the years and this is up there. This film will cause depression, erectile dysfunction, drowsiness and if you are a little tired before you watch it, you will fall into a coma."

","Hope you guys read the official storyline.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the cinematography, the cast, the direction, etc were all very good.<br/><br/>Though there are a lot of people telling this movie is awesome, I was not too happy. The movie is set in old Britain, and that part was good, its 'very' authentic and the high res HD that we are now watching in, we can see so many details that make this movie a treat to watch.<br/><br/>But, a big but, the story though it seemed complex, as they don't do too much spoon feeding, and tries to make us think, its actually very simple. Hence the need to make it seem artificially complex. We realize this only after the movie, when we sit and think about it, and then we sort of feel cheated.<br/><br/>Think of novels from Agatha Criste, Alistair McLain, etc.,such a story is wonderful as a book, as your imagination fills out the voids, makes it coloufull and you become intimately aware of the many many details, and because you are 'reading', the brain figures out the mystery and its exciting to us. Again - 'But' as a movie, somehow the whole things feels boring.<br/><br/>Another problem was that, they somehow assume that we the audience is intimately aware of the politics of that age. I think they are forgetting that its now 40yrs since that and most of us are relatively too young, never grew up in that era and so have no awareness of the nuances of that age. Not even the broad cold war thing seems important. This movie might have been brilliant if it had come out in the 1980s. But now, it feels bland, and insignificant.<br/><br/>I would blame the movie itself, as I saw 'The Help', and its able to drag us into that early 1900s age and empathize with its characters. Even Kungfu Panda 2 was so much more fun to watch (though in a very differnet way). So thats how this movie compares with others released recently.<br/><br/>Still, I would say, go watch, as its nice to see those 70s, its sort of romantic. :-)..............."
"joebloggscity","7","0","1","18 January 2012"," Old spies like they were in the Cold War era...
","Tinker Tailor has made quite a name for itself. A classic novel by Le Carre it spawned a much loved BBC TV series and various sequels. This film is a modern adaption of the book and comparisons will be inevitable. I've read the book and was intrigued to see how the film compares. <br/><br/>Our lead spy is brought out of retirement to hunt out a mole in a highly secretive and important British intelligence unit. This being the early seventies Cold War epoch, you can cut the atmosphere with a knife, it's that taut. <br/><br/>If you're looking for heavy action, zooming cameras, wild chases and good cop/bad cop relations, then this is not for you. The story flies in the face of Hollywood movies, and can be more old men in smoky board-men meetings and the tension between them. It's all spoken word. Action is minimal. This depicts the spy world in a more mundane light than we've been led to believe but probably is more realistic for it. It's a very intriguing world.<br/><br/>The ensemble for the film is the best part of it all. Gary Oldman is wonderful in the lead role as ""Smiley"" and is joined by a great cache of other top notch actors (mainly British) young and old who feel perfectly suited to their roles. <br/><br/>The settings are very evocative of the old era and there are enough old references (esp for the British) that really bring out the old settings perfectly.<br/><br/>However, despite the great acting and filming, the film is actually very difficult to follow. It will likely require repeat viewing. The question is whether you were interested enough to want to do so again. Personally, I will but saying that I'm not as in love with this as others. It's a very slow film at times but will keep you intrigued. There's so many characters that on first viewing you can't help but be confused trying to keep tabs with them all, especially as most of the action is verbal rather than physical. It can be hard going.<br/><br/>A good film with a very strong intelligent story. Hard to keep up with it all, but the excellent cast and setting will definitely keep most intrigued and interested, others will likely just switch off. Each to their own."
"zauberzerao","8","0","2","16 January 2012"," Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy — 85/100
","The consensus going round my movie-going friends is that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was a big let-down, and that the acting alone is gives it the amount of worthiness requisite for you, the wary customer, to cough up nine dollars at the box-office. My assessment is slightly different (More about this in a bit.), but I actually have to agree with what my fellow movie-enthusiasts have said.<br/><br/>The plot is not terribly confusing, but the three of us who arrived roughly six minutes late after the trailers had somewhat of a difficult time figuring out what is what. Simply put, there is an English agency knee-deep in espionage (No surprise there.), and it is recently discovered that there is, and has been for some years now apparently, a mole among its constituents. Smiley (Gary Oldman) has a straight-forward task ahead of him: find the mole working with the Russians and get rid of him.<br/><br/>Plot aside, the biggest weakness Tinker has is its lack of tension. As one of my friends said, he was never ""on the edge of his seat."" Something like that is indispensable to spy movies: the story is well crafted, the characters are given enough definition, and the plot is there to fill your head with questions—and while it does, at the same it doesn't take you by the collar and rattle your brain. The climax was, like everybody else mentioned, a tad anti-climatic. The problem, I gather, is: while our characters are given sufficient definition, we never really have any emotional attachment to either. So come the big surprise, we're left with a paltry ""Oh, okay?"" response. This could have been easily fixed if, perhaps, the latter portion of the movie, or at least the content that is revealed therein, could have somehow been worked into the movie pre-revelation. In order for that to work, without spoiling the finale, the story would have had to examine the other constituents of the ""Circus"" in depth. This would throw us off in several tangents, but the upside to it all, of course, is we would learn so much more about a group whom we know so little. Esterhase gets a bit of this treatment his way, but by then I suppose it is too little too late. Despite this, the acting is tip-top quality. If you're in the mood for a low-key movie couched in superb performances, then Tinker will foot that bill.<br/><br/>As for me, being a rabid Colin Firth fan-boy made all the difference. While I can certainly see where everybody else was coming from, I certainly was ""on the edge of my seat."" Simply put: I did not want Haydon to be the mole! Sadly, a tincture of suspicious behavior coming from Haydon in key plot points that must have been placed there for some reason gave me every reason to believe that he was, in fact, the mole. Colin Firth, in my view, is the good guy in every movie. That's probably not the most flattering thing to say about such an accomplished actor, but I certainly can't help myself. I think he is a swell fellow, and for him to be ousted as the bad guy puts me in a very discomforting state. So, when the big secret was finally revealed, and while everybody was still recovering from a massive let-down, I on the other hand was screaming ""Noooooo!"" to the top of my figurative lungs and still asking the screen ""Why? Why? Why!?"" as the last minutes of Tinker were coming to an end.<br/><br/>Obviously, I had a different, and more rewarding, experience than my companions. None-the-less, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a superlative acting ensemble, a well-crafted plot, and—supposing you've the same estimate for Colin Firth as I do—an ending that is fitting and rather upsetting all at once.<br/><br/>Zauber Zerão, die zauberkatze"

"artisticengineer","9","0","2","14 January 2012"," A superb retelling of a Cold War Classic
","This is a retelling of the novel of the same name. It is NOT a remake of the 1979 film starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley. The 1979 film was not actually a film; rather it was a mini series with over 12 hours of material (the UK version was, in fact, slightly longer!). Hence the reason why I consider this is a retelling; not a remake, as it is much different than the original screen adaptation. <br/><br/>The 1979 version was filmed during the cold war; when actual Russian actors were not available for use in Russian roles. Remember the 1965 movie ""Dr. Zhivago""? A true classic, set entirely in Russia, yet none of the actors were Russian - heck, the title role was acted by an Egyptian!! Same problem existed in 1979; when even the filming for the East European location of Czechoslovakia was actually done in Glasgow, Scotland! Nowadays, Eastern European locations can be filmed where set and the Russian roles can and are portrayed by native Russians, and this version (2011) has done precisely that. This adds a considerable amount of authenticity to this film. Also, the London shown in this film, is shown as the grimy, still somewhat war dirtied, place that is still was in 1973. It was quite an achievement to show it as that in the film as the London of today is actually a very clean and modern city that has been restored to its height of empire glory.<br/><br/>If you want a ""James Bond"" type spy movie-this is NOT it. This is a spy movie based on actual events (the Kim Philby scandal). The actors do a good job of portraying fear and nervousness as anybody involved in these types of actual events would be in a not inconsiderable state of anxiety until everything was resolved. A mole has been detected, but not identified, in the highest realms of British Intelligence. Or, is there actually one?? And, if there is one, how could one possibly find this mole? To find out, watch the movie. Don' trust me or anybody else, see the movie yourself to find out!"

The movie has a brilliant cast, all of whom deliver good performances. For me, that's where the good part ceases. After watching the film, I felt that it was an OK sort of film and I do watch a lot of offbeat films and films in general. The reason why this movie disappoints are the following: -Poor musical score- The trailer is awesome with a great score. Don't expect that in the movie though.Some good tension building music could have really made this a much better movie. -I knew who the mole was at the beginning of the movie. I mean, choose somebody who's not so well known as the mole. Once you have a big name amongst the options, it's apparent that he is the mole( why else would he take the role?) -In an attempt to make it 'spyish', the movie fails to keep the audience engaged. -Lastly, when the mole is shown to the audience, there was no drum roll, no suspense. It was so boringly revealed. That was the whole point of the movie, Mr Alfredson.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie deserves a 5, nothing more."

I actually think it is a good call - Oldman's performance was the best part and he was rightfully nominated.

This a tale that requires flashbacks, for if the tale were told sequentially, it would strike the audience as tedious. And while it's true that the PBS rendition used all six hours to enjoyable purpose and never bored the viewer, this movie failed, not because 130 minutes was not sufficient to tell the tale, and not because it used flashbacks. This movie failed because it moved at a snail's pace to no valid purpose. This movie failed, not because the viewer was confused, or because the characters did not emerge fully formed and with known history, but because it dragged to the point of irritation. The director totally misused and wasted wall clock time in filming and cutting this tale. A better director, a better editor, could have conveyed the dreariness of ruminating in the circus over bits and snatches of not much and a sense of thoughtful tradecraft on the part of Smiley, and others, without forcing the viewer to watch Smiley swim in a pool on three occasions, stare at chess pieces with faces taped to them without explanation, watch Smiley and Guillam stand in the middle of Control's flat rather than search it, and on and on and on, scene after scene where nothing, literally nothing, happens that advances the story or conveys mood. It is unlikely that this movie will be held over for a second week and even less likely that ten years from now film enthusiasts will be going back to it or discovering it for the first time."

","Having seen the BBC series of this book, it is difficult to cut a break to a 2 hour movie. And I don't intend to. Peter Jackson realized that TLOTR could not be made into a single 2 or 3-hour movie, similarly the director of this film should have realized that 4 hours would be a minimum to convey such a complex film, but 4 hours of slow pace would not have sold well at the box office, at least in North America, where attention spans and intellectual prowess of the movie-going public is akin to that of a dead slug. The performances in general are very, very good. It is clear that many of the actors have seen the BBC production as some performance snippets are almost exactly as the series. Not a bad idea. The plot is disconcerting as there are changes from the book that simply do not make sense. why move it from ""Cheko"" to Hungary? I see no value to it. Why move it from a forest cottage to the middle of a city? This one really does not make sense. If you are planning a clandestine meeting (or kidnapping) you don't set the meeting up at a café in a bazaar. Control died, not quit, and Smiley was turfed, not resigned. No value in that change either. Tarr did not call Lacon, but Guillam, and he never went to Smiley directly. It would have been a gaff of colossal proportions since Smiley was one of the suspects so this is another senseless change. The minister was NEVER directly involved. None of these changes seem to add anything to the story except set it apart from the Brit mini-series. Another problem is continuity. Unless you have read the book, you will not make any sense of the story. no scene comes to any rational conclusion, but is left for the viewer to magically figure out what it was about and what happened in between before the next scene. The title of the story is central to the actual plot as it sets the stage for Control's private enterprise, but is casually mentioned in the film.And what is it with the party scenes...?<br/><br/>I read that LeCarre was impressed with the script. Doubt it unless he has gone dotty. The whole key to the story are the Cheko scandal and the Irina story, both of which are glossed over far too quickly. Nonetheless, John Hurt makes a great Control and Gary Oldman a great Smiley. If you have not read the book and can follow the story, big kudos to you. If you have read the books, you will be somewhat disappointed with the watering down of such a suspenseful story."

Also, the protagonist, played by Gary Oldham, is not the most engaging of characters and it is unclear as to why any government agency would want to request his services. It is one thing for a story to include all kinds of twists and turns, but not to the point that it becomes confusing. A who-done-it format need not be confusing. Aklso, the premise of the story is not plausible. At the highest government level a mole will stick out like the proverbial sore thumb. It's one thing to have a spy operating in some office; such a spy can maintain their cover for years. It's another thing, however, to maintain one's cover at the ministerial because at that level everybody knows everybody too well and anonymity is impossible.

If just for the scenes in which Mr Oldman is a better Sir Alec, than Sir Alec himself. THe closing scene is a gem. Although one needs knowledge of the book to get up with the speed of it all. Anyway, the first of my top 10 for 2012. Absolutely."

","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the exact opposite of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. There aren't any stunts and the protagonist acts his age. This is an old school, plausible tale of espionage. I don't even recall the Tom Cruise of this movie running.<br/><br/>George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is a recently retired British intelligence expert called back into duty to expose a double agent at the top of MI6. Some of the work has been done for him by his former boss Control (John Hurt). With the field narrowed to five individuals, Smiley gathers information to determine who is giving information to the Russians.<br/><br/>The paranoia within the circus is widespread. No two people can trust each other. A simple scene shows Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) entering an elevator within the compound. The camera lingers on him and a sign that stresses the importance of closing the door after use so that others can call the elevator. Of course when Peter exits there is no thought of closing the door. It would have been traditional for a number of characters voice their concerns, so this far craftier conveyance deserves praise. But the story doesn't end there. Subtext overpowers the actual narrative. There are so many moments of termite art that one can lose focus on the spy hunt. <br/><br/>Suspense isn't all in the reveal; that's something director Tomas Alfredson can't seem to grasp. In Let the Right One In a vampire is created only to die at the moment of that realization. The payoff: a fiery effects death that removes what could have been a formidable character while adding a scene that has no impact on the story. In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy there is a book full of characters thanks to John le Carré, a few too many for a concise film. Despite wonderful spotlight moments, few thrillers are this boring. Not to say that there's a lack of action—which is true—but any plans of action are kept secret from the audience. What should be a climax is simply a scene leaving the audience with questions. It's anticipation that builds suspense, not the resolve. <br/><br/>The film carries the aesthetics of Masterpiece Theatre. It's hard not notice how some scenes are shot with an unacceptable amount of noise, which would have been fine had it been consistent. There's no effort at spectacle whatsoever. Even the sluggish music sounds like it was culled from a bin of discounted tapes. The set decoration and costumes are true to the early '70s , offering the visual appeal for the movie.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is believable and understated. Perfect for the role. I don't want to get into who else does what as spoilers can be easily dropped. Let me say that the cast is effective.<br/><br/>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy leaves the viewer with a path to the correct interpretation. It's not the easiest read, but it appears the story is sound."
"douglas_brown14","7","0","1","6 January 2012"," Good Spy Film
","I was prepared to be blown away by this film, given its stellar cast, its great pedigree and the rave reviews. However, I felt a tad disappointed. But I think the reason was I have not read the book. I got the distinct feeling that if I had read the book, I would have enjoyed it more. In my defense, the director was liberal with the use of sudden flash backs, which were sometimes interesting but other times hindered the flow of the film.<br/><br/>In any case, I still enjoyed the film. As always, Gary Oldman was outstanding. He is my favorite current actor, he has amazing versatility and commitment to the role. Moreover, the remaining cast was great and the set design and cinematography were top notch. For that I give the film a A- overall. I intend to read the le Carre book and then rewatch the film, at which point I imagine my grade will move to an A."

","It's the cold war era and there seems to be a mole in the top level of British intelligence.<br/><br/>Billed as a thriller, there are no thrills. There is no sense of urgency. An excellent British cast marches calmly on with British restraint.<br/><br/>The movie is long slow and dialogue driven. Perhaps it is accurate depiction of the spy business but it is not what most people expect and enjoy in a spy movie. Hard to care about any if the characters. <br/><br/>If you like to curl up with a good book this might work for you. If you like movies because of what make movies unique you will be bored."
"stever-42","8","0","2","26 November 2011"," Even if you have never read the book....
","A remarkable film. I know the book well, and thoroughly enjoyed following all the tiny references. But all the way through I was thinking that my wife, who's never read Le Carre, would find it convoluted and impenetrable, if not just boring. I need not have worried; she loved it too, but I'm still not quite sure how they managed to serve two quite different audiences.<br/><br/>The acting, direction, and cinematography were, of course, superb. Gary Oldman, like Kevin Spacey or Johnny Depp, only seems to make memorable films. John Hurt was a perfect Control. To my mind, Simon McBurney didn't quite match the oiliness of Anthony Bate's Lacon in the TV series. Firth's Haydon, a bit more subdued than Ian Richardson's, helped to keep the suspense going. Toby Jones made a fine Alleline. What have the Scots ever done to Mr Le Carre?"
"paudie","8","0","2","3 November 2011"," Great thriller but were the 70's this grim?
","Firstly I don't remember the BBC TV series of the John Le Carré novel so I won't compare this movie to it.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it portrays the rather seedy goings on behind the Cold War.<br/><br/>George Smiley had been a senior figure in British Intelligence but he was forced to retire along with his boss when an agent is killed on an unauthorised assignment in Hungary. However rumours of a Soviet mole at the top echelons of Intelligence (known as the circus) have persisted and the Minister in charge decides to find out whether they are true once and for all. Smiley is chosen to do this as he knows the spy business and all the suspects very well but is no longer working with them.<br/><br/>The plot is quite complex so I won't describe it in detail. Smiley has his suspicions and slowly but surely he gathers all the information he can to get to the bottom of the mystery. He is the ultimate ""low key"" spy, gleaning information from subtly interviewing people. Gary Oldman is excellent as the world-weary but still determined Smiley.<br/><br/>For me one of the best things about the movie is that it shows that despite the Cold War being apparently between two rival political philosophies the individuals involved are motivated by such basic emotions as lust, jealousy, greed and ambition. This applies even to Smiley himself.<br/><br/>While Smiley is the main character the supporting cast including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Toby Jones are outstanding. Swedish director Tomas Alfredson does a great job in bringing to life the grey paranoid world of the Cold War. He distills the novel into a slow moving but very satisfying movie."
"Waerdnotte","Null","0","2","30 October 2011"," A Bit Of A Throw-Back
","An old fashioned espionage thriller, beautifully shot by Van Hoytema and intelligently directed by Alfredson, the art direction is faultless and everything about the film screams 1970s, even the grainy feel to the movie's image. Gary Oldman is intense and brooding as Smiley, around whom the film revolves and support comes from a stellar cast including John Hurt, Colin Firth and Toby Jones. The narrative flits around, flash backs and complex plots mean a good deal of concentration is required to keep up.<br/><br/>However, for me it never really moves beyond what it always has been - a John Le Carre spy novel, albeit a great novel. It is a period piece, and shows a world that we barely recognise or even care about any longer. This is the kind of stuff UK TV supplies for its older viewers on a Sunday evening, recollections of a bygone age, when the British still thought they ruled the world. These days, I expect a little more from a movie than reminiscing about the ""good old days"". This is the 21st century. Where were the strong roles for women? where were the black faces? OK, so a little bit of homosexuality is hinted at, and extra martial affairs are an important part of the story, but you can't escape the fact that this is an old-fashioned story littered with characters from the British public school system who still saw the value of Empire.<br/><br/>Oh and Tom Hardy was seriously miscast as Ricki Tarr, his wide boy swagger really wasn't believable and Kathy Burke's Connie was equally unbelievable. However, it is worth watching."
"a_chan","Null","0","4","24 October 2011"," James Bond this is not; John Le Carre will be proud
","I have not read the book nor seen the 1979 landmark series that garnered so much acclaim for the BBC and Sir Alec Guinness, but such contextualisation is not needed to recognise that this version of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a masterful re-telling of John le Carré's seminal work about British espionage during the Cold War. An early scene really encapsulates the whole tone and mood of the film. A retired George Smiley (played majestically by Gary Oldman) is sitting at home and enjoying a documentary about Winston Churchill (which seems suitably apt for a man of his former position) when his doorbell suddenly and unexpectedly rings. His head turns slowly to the left in the direction of the impudent sound and the instantaneous look of sheer effrontery and disdain on Oldman's face will leave you chuckling as his peaceful reverie is rudely disturbed. Such scenes like this leaven the film with humour but ultimately this is a chamber piece; expertly played by the cream of British acting talent headed by Goldman and Hurt (who incidentally could also have been a great George Smiley) and told with a languid verve that unravels the complex plotting in a series of tableaux vivants laden with mystery and suspense, but which also acts as important plot points and clues.<br/><br/>The film is about the hunt for a Soviet 'mole' in the highest echelons of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6 but fictitiously known as 'The Circus') by George Smiley, an intelligence officer who has been brought out of forced retirement by Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus. Through a love affair with the wife of a Russian intelligence officer, a British agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) discovers that there may be a high ranking Soviet mole within the Circus. Aided by Peter Guillam (Bendedict Cumberbatch) who is Tarr's handler, Smiley sets about uncovering the mole without the knowledge of Circus leadership, anyone of whom might be the mole, headed by Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) and his deputies Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) – the 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' of the book (codenames assigned by Control, the Head of the British Secret Service).<br/><br/>The director, Tomas Alfredson, established his reputation with 'Let the Right One In', an icy Swedish romantic horror that dealt with relationships and this too, is a film about human nature, moral dilemmas and relationships – friendship, loyalty and betrayal on intimate and grand scales with personal and national implications. Like 'Let the Right One In' Alfredson imbues 'Tinker, Tailor', Soldier, Spy' (his first English language feature) with somnambulistic pacing and mood that requires the audience to be patient, but this is richly rewarded with scenes, shot after shot, that ravish the eye and heavy with period atmosphere and drama. James Bond this is not and George Smiley has more in common with Harry Palmer than Ian Fleming's vigorous secret agent. Indeed, Robert De Niro's admirable treatment of the early history of the Criminal Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 'The Good Shepherd' (2006) has a similar cipher in Edward Wilson – a 'grey man' whose very ordinariness renders him invisible to counter espionage and thus makes him the perfect intelligence operative. A raised voice towards the end of 'Tinker, Tailor' is as excited as Smiley gets but for those not familiar with the story the ending will leave you with a broad smile of satisfaction as the 'grey man' (note Smiley's grey hair, grey face and grey suit replete with over-sized glasses and shambling gait) of the secret intelligence service wins the day.<br/><br/>The screenwriters, Peter Straughan and the late Bridget O'Connor, have done an exceptional job in condensing down what is clearly a labyrinthine Cold War thriller into a classic two hour film without losing any of its exposition, characters, and plotting. John le Carré and his fans will be proud. This is a thinking man's film about a period of recent history that is as murky as it is exciting and relevant today with its eternal themes of friendship, loyalty and national security. There must be many more stories of espionage to mine from both sides of the Iron Curtain and I do hope this film kick starts a renewed interest in telling the stories of the Cold War warriors who shaped the modern world"
"freemantle_uk","9","0","1","27 September 2011"," An intelligence period spy thriller
","In recent years we have seen an expansion in the spy thriller genre, whether it is the new Bond series and the Bourne trilogy, the action-originated films like the Mission Impossible series and Salt, to contemporary affairs like Body of Lies and Rendition. This new adaptation of the John le Carre novel sets out to be a much more complex and grounded affair.<br/><br/>In 1973 a failed operation in Budapest, Hungary forces Control (John Hurt), the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (better known as the Circus) and his loyal deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to resign in disgrace. A year later, the new head of the Circus Sir Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) believes the time is right to share intelligence with the American about their top source in Moscow, Witchcraft. But a returning agent, Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) reports that one of the top men at the Circus is a Soviet Mole. Smiley is brought from the cold in to investigate these claims with Circus handler Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) and ex-police officer Mendel (Roger Lloyd-Park). He digs deeper to find out a secret that could rock the British intelligence establishment.<br/><br/>Coming off the back of Let the Right One In Tomas Alfredson makes a very complex, slow burning thriller. The mystery is unveiled gradually and Alfredson shows a stark, cold world of espionage. Even the interior of the Circus' headquarters, is a dark, soulless place particular because of the historical exterior. There is no glamour in this world, action is kept to a minimum and when it does happen it is very quick and brutal. This stark tone is established early on with a slow, tense build up, with a subtle score knowing something is wrong and results with an innocent woman getting shot in the head. Alfredson and the writing team certainly capture the plot of the novel and the tone of realism whilst making some chances to make the film their own.<br/><br/>The cast is great, it is like a Harry Potter film, get some of the best British actors around. Everyone is natural and capture their characters. Oldman is not quiet the Smiley in the novel, who is described as having a frog/toad like appearance, chubby and betrayed as a nice if cool and lonely man. Obviously Oldman does not look like and his version of Smiley is that he is a harsher person and very internal, but he is still very intelligence, focused man and the best man to solve this case. Hardy makes out that Ricki Tarr to be a very softly spoken and seemingly meek, who just happens to be an MI6 assassin and field officer. He is almost like a lost boy thrown into a complex world as he is thrown into something he could rock his world. Jones developed a strange accent as he is very accurate to the character in the book. Firth too gives a strong performance as one of the few people at the Circus who shows competence. Cumberbatch shows why he is an emerging actor and pretty much has the second biggest role in the film.<br/><br/>The plot is loosely based on real-life double agent Kim Philby and le Carre's experience with him. The actual plot seems simple enough, the Soviets have planted a double agent who was able to rise high up into the upper epsilons of MI6 and able to feed them fake intelligence. But there is so much more to it in the way this mystery unfolds. Whilst it is impossible to show all the character backgrounds and internal politics that was described in the novel but Alfredson did what he could do to show it. Some of the characters were pushed aside because of it but Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a strong adaptation of a film that is both a smart spy thriller and a period piece."
"rosencharlie935","8","0","3","27 September 2011"," Excellent adaptation - but suffers from length
","I thought Tinker, Tailor, was shot beautifully and the acting was of the incredibly high standard you would expect from such stalwarts. The script was good, and I enjoyed the (deliberate) pacing - certainly took its time. I watched it at the Cambridge Film Festival.<br/><br/>I do have a couple of minor points though. There is a terrific scene (the droplet of sweat on the table - for those that have seen the movie) - it really showed the tension and paranoia I imagine someone in the profession must live with every day. That level of paranoia was relaxed after the scene and I don't feel it was ever regained, which is a shame.<br/><br/>I also thing the film suffered from its length - oddly enough it was too short. If you were not familiar with the book or the Alec Guinness mini-series I imagine it would be very hard to follow the film. I understand that if they had released a 3-4 hour film with this pace, it would of been difficult (and uncomfortable) for cinema audiences. I do feel that, although, it is absolutely cinematic, it would have made a stunning mini-series (again!). Perhaps there will be a longer version on DVD?"
