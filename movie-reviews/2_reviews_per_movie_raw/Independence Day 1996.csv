"ExpendableMan","7","215","279","2 September 2007"," Look at the size of that thing
","Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.<br/><br/>Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90's audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences, it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.<br/><br/>Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks, it's an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again."

","I don't usually comment on this, I don't like to portray a movie as being good or bad just on my opinion, as everyone has their own tastes and needs when it comes to cinema. But god damn, why do so many people hate this film.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is not a serious film, it has never happened nor will it ever. This film is just damn good fun to watch...the explosions, the suspense, the cheesy one-liners...its not trying to tell you that aliens are coming to blow the s**t of of us...its entertainment. To all the people here that have said this is the worst movie ever...you guys need need to watch more movies, because if this is the worst movie ever then im Santa clause! To put it simply, this is 2 and a half hours of fun filled, edge of the seat (occasionally have a laugh) action...and nothing else. <br/><br/>Why cant people just enjoy a independence day for what it is (as mentioned above)...not why its improbable etc etc etc we all know that duh! This film is entertaining, full stop!! and thats all its supposed to be."
"g-bodyl","10","156","233","7 August 2008"," A Great Blockbuster!
","What's the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 10/10."
"BaronBl00d","Null","285","444","26 May 2001"," Suspenseful Feel Good Fun!
","I am just shocked at all the negative reviews by pseudo-intellectuals saying the film was heavily flawed, incomprehensible, devoid of any merit, and ""lame"", to quote a few.  What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it.  See Starship Troopers(a great film).  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff, lots of action but little substance. But whatever it may have as its faults, it is a fun, happy, sad, charming, engrossing film to watch...time and time again."
"Aaron1375","8","217","355","7 May 2003"," Fun summer blockbuster that some just took to seriously.
","I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like ""The Two Towers"" where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it."

","Never mind the stereotypical characters. Never mind the non-existant logic. Never mind that the dialogue is inane and bordering on idiotic. THIS IS GREAT ACTION! And there's no point in denying it.<br/><br/>First of all: I love to watch destruction. Preferably in larger scales. You get fed an enormous amount of it here. Second: I love alien starships the size of New York. And you sure get that too. And third: I love dogfights. You get that too. Forth: I don't take it seriously.<br/><br/>This films is one of the best of the decade, not simply because it works so well in an all-over scheme, but it provides some kicks that no other film had up to then (1996). Aliens arrive in gigantic spaceships and blow up a bunch of major cities. That's all I need.<br/><br/>How to grapple with the fact that logic takes a backseat - please spare me. There are worse films than this one."
"faraaj-1","8","105","179","11 November 2006"," One of the better high-concept movies..
","As a rule, I don't like high-concept movies. However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.<br/><br/>However, its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdy-cool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the clean-cut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday, but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.<br/><br/>The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you."
"Chimera-5","10","23","34","20 February 2000"," What's not to like???
","Remember the posters 6 months before the release? Remember the previews during the Super Bowl? Remember how long you waited in line and how packed the theater was opening day? Remember the audience ""ooohing"", ""aaahing"", screaming, and cheering? Remember the exhiliration and astoundment you felt as it ended? I sure do. And it was one of the best times I've ever had for a night out on the town. And it didn't cost 0 or involve getting drunk. That says alot. This came out the summer I had graduated high school. It was the second biggest highlight of 1996 for me. Oh, if this young heart could talk...<br/><br/>Rating: A monumental, romanticizing 10 out of 10."
"tho-3","10","201","367","22 November 2006"," Independence Day - outstanding work of the cinematic art
","Personally I think this is the best movie of the 90's.<br/><br/>But then I think South Park is the best TV show of the 20th century. Followed by Twilight Zone and Star Trek tying for second and third place.<br/><br/>While there's no accounting for taste in art, I can make reasoned arguments for my choices.<br/><br/>The people here on IMDb who hate this movie and provide negative comments probably have their reasons too, but mostly they say stupid things. For example, the one vituperous reviewer who lambasted the film's ""less-than-impressive CGI effects"". Well, duh, they didn't use very much CGI as far as I know. They did special effects the old-fashioned way. This schmuck is complaining about reality not being very realistic?<br/><br/>And if box office is any indication of excellence, then the stats are on my side and prove the nay-sayers are tasteless boobs. Make that witless, tasteless boobs. Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies in history, worldwide sales topping a billion.<br/><br/>Admittedly ID4 is one of those semi-rare movies that people either love or hate. And in this case hate with a passion. Why? I'm still trying to figure that one out, but so far I believe the whiniest critics are just your stereotypical jaded art critics: self-centered pseudo-intellectuals with attitude who pounce on any flaws in anything they personally don't like just to show off their own vapid superiority. What do they want? Yes, the movie has flaws, but it also has a lot of plot, a lot of heart, and a lot of action. Dialog? I make fun of the dialog myself... so what? The worst criticism I can lay against the writers is that a lot of the dialog is inane... just like real people talk! That just makes it more realistic. Have any of these critics on here ever listened to how real people talk? In some cases the dialog is sooo frigging inane in ID4 that I marvel at it's brilliance. Or chutzpah.<br/><br/>""What happened, mommy?""<br/><br/>""I don't know, baby""<br/><br/>As for the Apple-alien hook-up... my god, have we become so inured to the miracles of science that we calmly overlook or accept miracles like anti-gravity and kvetch instead about mundane technicalities? Yes, the Apple-alien computer hook-up is a plot hole... so what? I can easily explain that away a billion times easier than I can explain anti-gravity. I happen to know a bit about both.<br/><br/>Again. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.<br/><br/>And you know what? These film makers did it with a hint of humor. Not bad at all."
"Dario_Gino","8","62","105","21 August 2008"," Still a great flick
","This movie is TRULY one of the best and names itself the Science Fiction version of ""Top Gun"". The actors were great. Will Smith got ""jiggy with it"" as a hotshot F/A-18 pilot in the movie; Randy Quaid (the older brother of Dennis Quaid) proved to be the comic relief; Bill Pullman's character transformed from a President with the problem of a nation into a reborn veteran; and Jeff Goldblum became more brilliant than ever! The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots. Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen. Buildings explode and men die in beautifully choreographed fashions that raise the bar for many modern action films today."
"creedrock2003","1","220","410","23 April 2005"," The President Flies a Fighter Plane at Alien Spaceship
","If this alternate title had been chosen, I would've avoided the loss of two hours of my life and had an extra $9 in my pocket. If you set aside the fact that the aliens in this movie use Macintosh-based computer systems, the Prez hops into a fighter jet AS THE PILOT, and Will Smith punches an alien unconscious in his downed spaceship...this movie is still horrible. Aliens come to earth to sap it of it's resources,a nd to accomplish this, of course, the aliens have to destroy earth's inhabitants. The enormous spaceships gather above major cities around the globe and WAIT THERE DOING NOTHING FOR DAYS. Then, they start to blow up stuff we recognize (not military targets, just useless tourist attractions that will make us sad). Does blowing up hte White House really accomplish anything? Does it terrify Earth's inabitants? the giant spaceships do that just fine. How about attacking military installations capable of fighting back? They can't be stopped...or can they? What's next?...Not Six Flags over Nebraska!?!?!?! <br/><br/>The solution to Earth's dilemma lies in the Apple Corporation's operating system for home-based computing. Simply walk into an Apple store, grab a Powerbook, fly into the enemy spaceship (how, you ask?....naturally by piloting one of their spacecraft 200 years ahead of earth technology on your first try), mess with their hard drives using an earth laptop computer (I'm not kidding), and wham-o!!!...Aliens start dropping like flies! Not an ounce of creativity, or originality, or brain-power was used in writing this drivel. I enjoyed all the stereo-typical characters brought together to fight...the drunken former pilot, the hotshot young stud pilot, the computer geek, the kid, and the most powerful man we gots...the PRESIDENT OF THE US... YEAH BABY!!!It plays like a 10 year-old's idea of ""a really cool thing that happened once."" Horrible. Don't see it."

","Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen. Buildings explode and men die in beautifully choreographed fashions that raise the bar for many modern action films today.<br/><br/>The film is predictable, and none of the characters are particularly memorable - you aren't really bothered whether they live or die. The plot is so much like War of the Worlds, with more sky battles and aliens, that you may feel that it is just another remake under the same title.<br/><br/>But Roland Emmerich (the director) deserves to be called the undisputed king of action movies - he beautifully directs his films, and the special effects and sound in his films are truly stunning. This was his biggest success, and deservedly so - though The Day after Tomorrow was just as spiffing.<br/><br/>The script ain't strong and the plot ain't great, but this is an action-epic film, and on that scale, Independence Day delivers. It is an extremely memorable experience, and beats action flicks that are being made ten years on. A stunning job that deserves to be called a huge success (in the box office, of course).

"ssssh-915-947755","1","80","147","8 December 2010"," Roland Emmerich makes Paul W.S. Anderson look like Andrei Tarkovsky.
","If Ed Wood ever had any money, Roland Emmerich would give him a run for it. This film is the ultimate summary of everything wrong with Hollywood. It's as if Roland Emmerich deliberately tries to place every single cliché he can find in his films. And as another reviewer said, he's one of the few directors in Hollywood (along with Michael Bay and Paul W.S. Anderson) who have everything they need to make a decent blockbuster. A great cast (JEFF GOLDBLUM!), decent effects, and enough money at their disposal to feed Africa for a month.<br/><br/>OK, now the film.... Horrible No redeeming qualities to speak of. If six-year-olds were capable of having wet dreams, this would be it. Here's the entire film: Aliens arrive, Aliens attack, Will Smith's girlfriend, child and dog escape a massive fire-blast that kills hundreds of people in a subway (but the dog made it, thank god!....seriously, that must be the most cringeworthy cliché ever committed to film) a wooden door protects them from the nuclear heat blast, Will Smith beats up an alien and drags it around the desert for a bit, (I'm not sure who was in more pain during that scene, me or the alien.) they go to Area 51 where they meet some hermit, chronic- masturbator mad scientist, some other stuff happens, then the President of the United States gets up in a jet with the all the rest of the boys to take out the alien ship threatening the American way of life. YEE HAH!<br/><br/>The people who have a hard-on for this movie will tell me that I took it too seriously, but it's actually impossible to take this film seriously. It's like a bad joke, so bad that it's funny how horrible it is and then you pause and think about it and all of a sudden you realise how troubling it is that something like this ever was green-lighted by a major studio. If you haven't seen it, don't. If you have seen it and were as troubled as I was, you're not alone. If you saw this film and enjoyed it you probably laugh your ass off whenever you fart in a bathtub.<br/><br/>I heard that Emmerich is directing an ""Avatar style"" adaptation of Asimov's Foundation.

"writerasfilmcritic","1","127","243","10 November 2006"," Worst Movie of the Decade
","Sometimes you wonder just how bad a movie can be. Don't wonder any longer. Just rent this colossal piece of manure and strap yourself in for perhaps the worst movie viewing experience you have ever tolerated. This overlong, overblown, ridiculous cartoon has one redeeming quality and that is the buildings being blown up once the aliens FINALLY launch their attack on the world. Prior to that, and trust me, it takes awhile, you must tolerate scene after scene of reaction shots to the approaching alien craft. The cast aren't really looking at anything because the computer animation hasn't been added yet. Ho-hum. Between these scenes and for a long time afterward, the people featured in this story have a peculiar tendency to go on with their lives as if there is no particular hurry trying to deal with everything suddenly turned upside down. There's all the time in the world to say goodbye, eat a bag of chips, drive to work, go on a short vacation, or do whatever else you want. That's when you realize just how boring and absurd this thing is going to be. We must admit those effects are pretty good, the giant explosions and the flying cars and trucks squashing the running crowds as they attempt escape. I'll give this horrendous pile a ""1"" just for that. Soon enough, though, we're right back to the sappy, dreary, meaningless dialog. You can almost imagine one of the actors on the set acting confused and asking, <br/><br/>""Wait a minute. What's my motivation here?"" The cast and crew crack up, knowing just how silly his remark is, but the actors actually must pretend this farce is poignant. For example, there's Will Smith trying to tell his girlfriend he loves her while choking back the emotion, or was it the other way around? I don't quite remember but who gives a rat's. Then Will's dragging an alien across the salt flat and hamming it up. It's painful to watch. Then there's Jeff Goldbum and his dad (Judd Hirsch), who play chess in the park as a regular thing. Jeff is well-educated but lacking in ambition, so he's a cable guy. His appraising gaze is often fraught with smouldering sensitivity, belying the supposed depth of his character. <br/><br/>Go grab a snack or take a pee and don't bother with the pause. You won't miss anything worth seeing, except perhaps a rather silly excursion into the character of the ""president,"" who is seen at the helm in the midst of this crisis. Gee, he looks kind of young to be president. As the aliens wipe out most of the world, he seems paralyzed with indecision, but never fear. Finally, realizing the invaders are beyond redemption and the human race is about to be annihalated, he gives the order to ""nuke 'em!"" <br/><br/>Wait a sec, we almost forgot. it doesn't matter what you hit 'em with because nothing will penetrate their shields. Sounds familiar. The prez gives a stirring speech and hops into an Air Force fighter jet. He wants a piece of them, himself. Whaddya mean that doesn't quite add up? Pretend you're six years old. <br/><br/>Goldblum and Smith fly into space (never mind how) to rendevouz with the mother ship and download a virus into it's computer banks, using Jeff's trusty notebook computer. This, he thinks, will screw up the alien ""signal,"" our only chance to save mankind. Once this brilliant maneuver is executed, it will take down the shields from all the giant craft and we will be able to shoot them down, at least for a few precious minutes. The armed forces of other countries have been contacted by Morse Code and are ready to act in concert. <br/><br/>The ridiculous virus strategy worked, of course, and Jeff and Will are heroes. So is the president, and so is the drunken crop duster pilot who makes the ultimate sacrifice. Too bad the First Lady took some shrapnel in the ass early in the flick and went down to defeat. Anyway, that's a wrap, people. Let's sling this piece of cheap dogfood into the can and go home. There's gonna be a cast party over at Will's house and attendance is mandatory.

Then show people fleeing in terror from this force. Enter some young, handsome/beautiful protagonist who, unlike the herd of fleeing people who are unceremoniously slaughtered, survives the onslaught by virtue of, I don't know, their box office drawing power. Finally we come to the inevitable ""climactic"" conclusion where our hero manages to overcome/defeat this force by way of a completely implausible plot contrivance(in the case of this movie, a computer virus created by an earthling on an earth computer being uploaded to and working on an alien computer system). In order to enjoy these movies you have to forget all the movies exactly like it that have come before it and disable your higher reasoning abilities.

I particularly enjoyed that bit where the British soldiers were sitting around, apparently twiddling their thumbs, until, lo and behold, here comes salvation draped in the Star Spangled Banner with a matching ""Independence Day"" cup from McDonald's. Apart from its thinly veiled pseudo-patriotism, this film had many other annoyances, not least of which was the miraculous compatibility between a Macintosh and an alien computer from 90 light-years away.

"vip_ebriega","10","43","82","26 September 2007"," The definitive summer blockbuster.
","My Take: Perfection in its own silly, explosive, action-packed way. A highly entertaining blockbuster. <br/><br/>I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.<br/><br/>I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.<br/><br/>Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).<br/><br/>Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.<br/><br/>INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.<br/><br/>Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

Then the drunk and the President decide to fly around a little and destroy those big ships.  The Americans have won again and tell the rest of the world how easy it really is.  Just recruit the local neighborhood drunk and send him straight up into the weak spot (never mind that the ship is as long as Manhattan Island and has  death rays that can obliterate an entire city in seconds).

At the same time, I sat through the entire movie, transfixed in horror at how terrible it was. Worse, years later, I was compelled to watch it again, knowing precisely how awful it was the first time around. It didn't get better with the second viewing. The only thing artful about this movie is how they managed to appeal to the primitive portion of our brains that revels in inane stupidity. The sad thing is, I somehow doubt this was their intent.

"gmcvay@patriot.net","1","44","89","19 December 2005"," Mothership Connection? Not so much
","**Possible spoilers** A significant number of the comments already posted here say quite defensively that this movie isn't meant to be Shakespeare, that it's just a Big Dumb Action Flick (hereinafter BDAF), that, in effect, if you just stop thinking, this is a really fantastic movie that showcases all-American values, goddamnit.<br/><br/>If you want to see a BDAF, though, there are so many that are done so much better... and ID4 steals from most of them. And if you want to showcase American values, there are so many that are so much better than segregation. Yeah, the Dynamic Duo here is half Will Smith (and describing the plot sounds like the setup for a bad joke: ""A Jew and a black guy walk into a spaceship...""), but the love stories -- a massive weak point, and that's saying something, because this baby is rife with weak points -- are neatly segregated: Will Smith with Vivica Fox, Jeff Goldblum with the red-haired shiksa. There was no way we were going to get a ""Space Monsters' Ball"" scenario with Fox playing the careerist ex-wife and what's-her-name playing the stripper. (The Hispanic kids only get screen time at all because their dad is Randy Quaid.) A white guy entertains Smith by making fun of Jesse Jackson (mercifully, the character bites it shortly after), and there is a tasteless joke about violent Los Angelenos; on what planet is that supposed to be funny?<br/><br/>When I watch a BDAF, I expect certain things from it, and one of those is good directorial judgment about which characters get screen time. In a BDAF about aliens, we paid good money (actually, I watched this on cable, but you take my point) to SEE THE FRICKIN' ALIENS. The ones that get the most time on screen are dead! The only live one we see (other than the incredibly stupid ones in the mothership) gets punched in the head, then awakens conveniently right in the middle of an autopsy at Area 51 (of course), where Brent Spiner reveals that these guys don't look like Alien-Predator hybrids at all; the Alien-Predator thingo is just a ""bio-mechanical suit"" (H.R. Giger would cry) covering up a much more boring alien inside. Actually, Spiner's brief performance was the one thing about the film I can say without reservation I liked. After all, geeks have spent many years dressing up and pretending to be Spiner; it's only fair that Spiner should return the favor by dressing up as a geek. (Question: If the alien is communicating by resonating the late Dr. Okun's throat, where is the deep, booming voice coming from? Dr. Okun doesn't sound like that alive... oh, never mind.) <br/><br/>I'd also like a BDAF to be a bit less, well, homogenized. Even the dog that outruns the tunnel fire is the most boring and domestic breed in existence: the yellow Lab, a staple of minivan and SUV commercials. Bill Pullman is suitably bland, if too young and brain-dead for the part. Even the Token Gay is played by the safest, cuddliest gay guy in US entertainment: Harvey Fierstein, who has been assimilated by the mainstream-culture Borg in much the same way as Smith himself.<br/><br/>Throw in a bit of product placement for Coke and Apple (although the laptop does appear to be running a very specialized Linux interface, one with helpful dialogs like ""Uploading Virus""), and you've got a completely forgettable movie. At least, I hope to heck it's forgettable. I would hate it if my brain actually bothered to store this.<br/><br/>Of the many things wrong with this movie, though, perhaps the most disturbing on a bent-reality level is how much Jeff Goldblum, in rumpled hair and nerd glasses, resembles a young Allen Ginsberg. That's just wrong. In the ex-wife relationship-confrontation scene, I expected him to burst out earnestly with, ""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked"" etc. It couldn't possibly be sillier than the actual dialogue."

","When ID4 was released I certainly didn't think it was a movie I'd be going out of my way to see due to its reputation as being overly jingoistic along with being a shallow story with no substance so I waited to catch it on network TV and when I did I was fairly blown away by its quality . The first half of the movie is nail biting as whole cities across the globe are vapourised by the invaders who can't be stopped and it's not often we get a blockbuster that starts off in such a pessimistic manner . As for the "" American nationalism "" that some people hated it for I suggest you avoid watching every American war movie that doesn't have Sam Fuller in the credits . Here is a movie that only celebrates the Utopian dream of multi racialism in America ( Unfortunately that's all it is in reality - a dream ) but also the international community where Arabs , Israelis and the RAF can all join together to take on the alien menace <br/><br/>While the multi ethnic / international idealism holds up to repeated viewing I'm afraid other aspects do not . I saw ID4 again tonight about five years after I first saw it and I'm sorry to say that it was nowhere as good as I remembered it . Yes the first half is rather bleak and pessimistic and what could been a very serious , intelligent movie that mixes downbeat drama with commercial appeal starts to shoot itself in the foot in the second half . I've no idea how I noticed this on first viewing but the dialogue is rather bad while the plotting is ridiculous . The president of the United States leads the remnants of the USAF into battle ! You might be shocked to know that allegedly Bill Clinton thought President Whitmore was based on him ! so goodness knows what Dubya thought about Bill Pulman's performance . I guess the major problem is that by making the aliens so invincible the screenwriters have painted themselves into a corner to how humanity can overcome the invaders , I mean when Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum entered the mother ship I was expecting the Colonel from MONTY PYTHON to jump out and say "" Stop this at once this film is getting far too silly "" <br/><br/>There is another slight problem that wouldn't appear apparent in 1996 but is noticeable in 2005 and that is the breath taking advance of special effects . Nowadays it's nearly impossible to watch a film and decide what is a special effect and what is real . I'm afraid that in many action sequences like the F-16s attacking the alien ship you are aware that blue screen projection and CGI explosions are being used , it's not bad enough to condemn the film of course and at the time these sequences must have seemed awesome but the FX haven't stood the test of time very well <br/><br/>Okay I'm in a charitable mood and I'm giving this movie 7/10 . It's a film of two halves with the doom laden first half easily beating the second in terms of tension and drama . It's a great pity the producers couldn't keep up the momentum"

","Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.<br/><br/>The plot is so simple it's hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich's direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman's brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.<br/><br/>The best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above.

Bill Pullman's career should have ended right there and then. He is a pretty lame actor, but this was beyond bad---I have honestly seen better performances in middle school plays. The rest of the cast was mostly rubbish, too, although it's difficult to say because their characters were laughable. But nothing hurt as bad as Pullman's baby face affecting toughness, and failing. He is not alone, though, even the extras overact in ways that oscillate between really annoying and outright laughable.<br/><br/>Another reviewer here explains the score of ""only six"" by assuming that most people here saw the movie on TV, when it should be seen in the cinema. I suppose that might be true for someone who is mainly interested in special effects, grandiose camera movements, and lots of explosions---there is lots of those in this movie, and they are most likely better enjoyed on a larger screen.<br/><br/>From my perspective, a score of more than six is hugely overrating this nonsense production, which is not best viewed in the cinema but rather not at all---at least for those of us who enjoy actors acting, and who think that ""suspending disbelief"" does not mean shutting any brain activity whatsoever.<br/><br/>Good things?

Even as a young adult, I found this to bee too stupid to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't live in Hollywood - wait, I did then...for a few months.<br/><br/>However, this movie is so full of American propaganda that it hurt my head to watch it.<br/><br/>From beginning to end and everywhere in between, this movie was just a nasty mess.<br/><br/>Apart from all the flaws that you read on every other post, this made the USA look so bad in the eyes of other nations that instead of promoting the country to something of a hero, it made the US look like a total mess of self serving, egoistic, glory hungry retards.<br/><br/>Why had the President and the US Armed Forces not try to contact any other nation's leaders in trying to overcome the aliens? Because the US leaders, politicians and gatekeepers want to prove to the world that they have the answer and solution to even the most insane and unforeseen problem attacking the world.<br/><br/>There have been lots of horrible movies, but this one is definitely in the top 20.<br/><br/>I knew the US would save the world and I hated the movie for it. I was really hoping that the aliens would blast the zhit out of the USA, so that the rest of the world could possibly try to negotiate some sort of truce with the aliens.<br/><br/>As you can see, Germany or England, Russia or Australia did not attack. And the aliens didn't even think of hovering over Canada - even though it's right close to the USA! What happened there?<br/><br/>By this film, they stood idly by, watching everything fall to the floor in flames and it was only the US that was able to do anything.<br/><br/>What a load of s__t! Too retarded for somebody who doesn't fall for American machismo...too much Hollywood for Hollywood.<br/><br/>What happened to Hollywood? Can't they find any more Bruce Willis clones to make action movies anymore? They have to try to result to DRAMATIC action with a huge cast of characters who in their own right should not be paid 1/10th of the wage they earn.<br/><br/>I'm certain that had Brad Pitt been a star that year, his ugly mug would have been in there somewhere - as well as his bitch of a wife."

And this is what is annoying about this movie.<br/><br/>Here in Europe many reviewers wrote that this was a terrible movie that everybody should see just to be able to believe how BAD it is !<br/><br/>This is the perfect movie to go see with a bunch of friends and joke about it all the time, because this is truly a bad movie where the most entertaining thing we get from it ,is the moments where we trash it down. And if you don´t live in the United States multiply this fun twice.<br/><br/>The story couldn´t have been cheesier and idiotic. This is the bottom of the pit in creativity. The worst "" War of the Worlds "" rip-off ever ! This couldn´t have been worst written or imagined ! H.G.Wells must be turning in his grave till this day. Instead of developing the great potential ideas that could have been done with a story like this, they choose to focus on the patriotic stuff ( !!!!??? ).  Man, what a puke !<br/><br/>The fun thing about it, was that this movie gave a bigger contribute to create a bad image of America abroad than the whole RAMBO series put together instead !<br/><br/>And talk about predictiblity !

","Like many all the other films directed by Roland Emmerich, this movie has incredible effects but a incredible lame plot, terrible performances and a pathetic script. Roland Emmerich is one of the very few directors (Like Michael Bay and Paul W.S. Anderson) that is not able to make a single good movie even with all the talent of the world. Will Smith makes here his second worst role. (The first worst role must be for the dreadful movie ""Hancock"") The only good things of this film are the special effects, but that's it. Many people seem to hate the most recent movies of Roland Emmerich, but to be honest he never made a single good film, not even a decent one."

"Chris-268","1","19","37","5 July 2000"," A sad commentary on the insecurity of a nation.
","This piece of tripe was one of the worst and most offensive movies I have ever seen. 0 out of 10. Negative numbers, even. Was there one, single original idea in the whole film? Not that I could spot. The aliens were a bald faced copy of H.R. Giger's ""Alien."" Their fighter craft were knockoffs of those used in ""War Of The Worlds"", released more than 40 years prior. The idea that a computer virus could be used to defeat an alien technology millions of times more advanced than our own is insulting to anyone with half a brain. It's been done, and the idea comes off as badly here as before. (Read ""3001: Final Odyssey"" by Arthur C. Clarke.)<br/><br/>These points alone aren't enough to ruin a movie completely; they merely add to the ridiculousness of it in this case. When ID was released, I read an article in Time magazine that talked about the psychology behind the movie. At the time, the United States had run out of Enemies. The Soviet Union wasn't a threat anymore, and the Middle East had already been pounded into submission during the Gulf War. There was no one for us to pick on, to show our overwhelming superiority to. Sensing the void, Hollywood created a new enemy in the race of planet conquering aliens seen in this film. And they made that enemy seem so invincible that it's all the more remarkable in the end when the macho Americans are able to defeat them single-handedly. Yes, it is the good old USA that saves the day, all by itself. Wil Smith's machismo is nauseating. In a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously (Men In Black) this kind of acting is entertaining. But not here.<br/><br/>I am an American, and I take pride in America. But this movie exemplifies everything that is wrong with our outlook. We shouldn't have to build up our self esteem by pretending we are so superior, even to alien races who have conquered space. From a credibility standpoint, this is absurd. Like so many bad sci-fi movies, the producers never stopped to consider the unlikeliness of the scenario. Without going on a tirade about ""alien paranoia""- that is, the belief that extra terrestrial life forms are always hostile and want to steal our planet- I'll just say this: to say that the ""Melissa"" or the ""I Love You"" virus would be effective against their technology would be like saying that a couple of guys armed with pea shooters could take out an entire Panzer tank division.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this. Watch an intelligent sci-fi movie, like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", or ""Contact."" Films like that make you think; ID4 makes you want to sink back in the lazyboy, crack open another beer, and say ""Hot dang, we kicked some alien a**!"""

Depressingly, there was a huge audience for it at the time. I guess that controlling the minds of the masses isn't too difficult when you assault their senses relentlessly through the media.

","This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  It had lots of great effects and the action sequences are great.  Will Smith was his usual self funny and entertaining.  While the realism may be a little hard to take, (spoilers) laptops compatible with alien technology a virus drummed up in a couple days that can disable the ships etc.  It wasn't really meant to be taken as an extremely scientifically accurate movie.  Just a fun alien invasion movie where humanity has to come together and fight off the aggressors, a little over-used subject maybe but what isn't these days?  At any rate this rehash was pulled off very well.  One thing I would like to say though is to all those posting complaints about the Americans always find the answer.  This is a movie about Americans made for Americans so why would they go all that way and then have say, to pull a country out of the hat, the British win it for them? (no slight to the British intended at all in that) That would be stupid!  I'm not an expert on foreign films but I doubt there are a lot of British films that show German's winning it or French films that have Spaniards winning so I think these ""America always seems to do it"" arguments are rather unfair, especially for a film such as this one which is a work of total fiction.<br/><br/>

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When global telecommunications are disrupted by strange atmospheric occurrences, investigation reveals that they are spaceships positioning themselves around the globe and taking positions above the major cities. As President Whitmore attempts negotiations, cable maintenance man David Levinson spots a signal that appears to be counting down to an attack. When the attack comes, major cities are lost and military response significantly weakened and unable to defend.  When the survivors come together and plan a fight back to defeat the attackers.<br/><br/>When this first came out I rushed to see it when it came out and was blown away by the spectacle.  The second viewing (without the hype) revealed a pretty average film with big effects and, seeing it last night, the film doesn't really stand up to much seen years later - even the effects look dated.  The plot is a simple remake of about 100 different sci-fi movies, all the clichés are there and in full effect.  The film is basically in three parts: 1) aliens show up and kick ass, 2) humans wonder what went wrong, mourn and regroup and 3) the humans strike back on the 4th July.<br/><br/>Parts one and three both rely heavily on spectacle and, in fairness, it delivers this well - killing millions in grand ways and showing landmarks being destroyed with ease.  The aerial battles are impressive but really just a montage of fast moving dots.  It is unfair to compare apples with oranges - but the attack on Zion in Matrix Revolutions just p*sses on the effects here.  Even without the comparison there is some pretty shoddy blue screen work that must have been hoped would be missed in the middle of all the action.  Aside from that it does mostly look good enough to pass an evening.<br/><br/>The plot is, of course, utter nonsense and I won't even waste my time mocking the many, many failures in logic that abound here - it would be like kicking a child.  However suffice to say that the finale is just plain daft and the whole idea of everyone in the world missing the attack signal except a cable guy who was married to one of the President's top people just smacks of very bad and lazy writing.  The writing really is exposed whenever nothing is blowing up.  The script tries to set up basic characters but only in the same way a disaster movie does - basic enough to care vaguely about when they go out in a blaze of supposed emotional glory.  The section without explosions is awful and hard to watch - I couldn't care about characters that the script could barely be bothered to develop past lazy stereotypes and that is just the easy stuff.  Worse than that is the horrible flag waving - lets not kid ourselves, this film is not about us, it's about US.  In other words this is not earth v's the flying saucers but rather America versus the flying saucers.  It is hard not to feel the need to suppress a gag when the President gives his final address to the nation and leads the world to defeat the aliens by following the US's example.<br/><br/>Of the cast, none are any good.  Smith does his usual style stuff where he thinks attitude involves saying `yo ass' and `sh*t' as punctuation on his lines.  Goldblum does his usual stuff of being smart and pausing a lot, but he is slumming here.  Pullman plays the President that the US must wish it have - he is such an idealised character that I felt sorry for Pullman having to deliver a role that must have just baffled him in it's simplicity. Hirsch is such a cliché that it's almost offensive, while McDonnell is merely an emotional event rather than a character and Fox, well, she's black right? So lets have her play it with sista attitude - I love her work and it's sad to see her giving such a lazy role.  Quaid is awful, Loggia is OK, Fierstein is horrible, Baldwin is OK and Spiner takes a small step from Data.  Lets be honest - this film is not about the actors, it merely needed some big names to add to the box office draw (and the audience profiling could not be crasser than the casting of Pullman, Smith and Goldblum - so obvious it hurts).<br/><br/>Overall this is a big dumb blockbuster that will amuse the audience. However it is way too long and requires you to view without your brain. If you can do this then this is a big dumb sci-fi with more spectacle than anything else.  It's just a major problem that the plot, characters and script are all lazy, crass, basic and unashamedly flag waving to the point that syrup was coming out of my ears.  Vivica Fox looks great in stripper gear though!"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>The thing that made `Bladerunner' special was that every element from the story to the movements of actor and camera to the sets to the colors were of one mind. It was successful science fiction and successful film because it was coherent. One man had the vision in all these areas and the skills to blend them in complementary ways. There are many such films, but they get fewer, the more special effects are involved.<br/><br/>That's because so many of the key elements of the vision and narrative are delegated to others, all over the planet, with different design sensibilities and philosophies. Here, that problem is immense, and we have enough experience with this filmmaker on prior projects to know he cannot control a smaller hive.<br/><br/>Add to this minor incompetences of minor lives (Smith, Goldblum and so on) and a script literally borrowed from the prior catalog. And what you are left with is a film whose entire marketing campaign (hundreds of millions) and central appeal is built on blowing up the White House.

","It is movies like this that fuel the rest of the world's resentment towards America. Here you have $100 Million plus and the best that can be produced is a braindead, stupidly simplistic, bigoted story of how wonderful the USA is and ""What would the world do without us?"", complete with visually impressive yet emotionally devoid special effects.<br/><br/>Contrary to this film's premise, the rest of the world would not be sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting for America to save the day. Do we really expect that if a bunch of alien creatures that are smart enough to travel the universe and build incredible transports and weaponry technology decided they liked the look of our wee planet, that we would even have a hope of fighting back? Maybe you Yankees have an over-inflated perception of your abilities, but let's be reasonable here. Of course the film is about the triumph of the human spirit against all adversity, but really - how much more advanced is the super-evolved aliens' sense of ""species pride"" going to be? Do we really think twice when destroying an insect nest about the possibility of them getting us back?<br/><br/>This film is riddled with incredibly dumb things. Even if there were some memorable characters (there aren't) and some moving moments (cheesy unsuccessful attempts) we would be prevented from enjoying them because the story is so foolish. I list a couple of examples:<br/><br/>-An explosion that 'nukes' a city in seconds is not capable of being outrun and survived, in a tunnel, by a lone woman and the dog she loves very much.<br/><br/>-Giant ships hovering over the world's major cities, when destroyed, manage to conveniently end up crashed out at sea, or in the mountains next to the city. Um, how?<br/><br/>-A computer virus. How clever. Tell me, how did they link up with the mothership computer. Were the aliens conveniently using compatible computer systems and interfacing link-ups? Perhaps interested people could read Arthur C. Clarke's ""3001: Final Odyssey"" for an example of how this principle can be executed plausibly.<br/><br/>Need I go on? I think not. I will simply conclude by saying that perhaps the makers of ID4 should think about what it was about ""Star Wars"" that moved them and millions of others a long time ago, and go back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>Note: In New Zealand the promotional banners for ID4 contained a whopping great spelling mistake (""weren't"" spelled ""were'nt"") Was this the case worldwide?

","The 4th of July is almost upon and what movie is fitting for Independence Day? Of course, the movie ""Independence Day"" by Roland Emmerich. The premise is simple, aliens have come and attacked Earth on the 4th of July and the planet but mostly America has got to stop them. I've watched this movie years ago so rewatching it will be a very interesting experience.<br/><br/>One thing I've remembered while starting this movie is how amazing and tension-filled that intro is. The scene with mankind's footprint on the moon getting blown away by the alien ship and the people on earth panicking about the ship in the sky is good stuff.<br/><br/>My biggest praise for this movie has got to be the visual effects though which still look great even today. I think everyone remembers it since it was all in the marketing but the iconic white house getting blown up by the alien ship is just phenomenal honestly. Looking at how the movie was made and finding out that they built a miniature white house and blown it up which is cool. All the action scenes in this movie are just very thrilling and exciting to watch with its fast-paced air battles and spectacular explosions. The first act with the alien destruction and the final third act with the war is just so good! The movie contains a lot of comedic moments especially from Will Smith and they all gave me a slight chuckle and work in the movie's favour.<br/><br/>Speaking of Will Smith, this and Bad Boys are the movies that practically launched his career to action fame and watching this movie again I can see why. Will Smith is extremely charming, funny and awesome as ""Captain Steven Hiller"". He punched an alien in the face while giving a cheesy one-liner, what more could you ask for? Jeff Goldblum is also likeable as the tech expert ""David Levinson"" and Bill Pullman is charismatic as the American President ""Thomas J. Whitmore"" and gives one of the most memorable speeches in movie history. The supporting cast is also great in their variety of different performances from the weird to the serious and they all do a great job.<br/><br/>The negatives of this movie are very clear and it is that the plot is just very thin and bland. However, this is kind of expected since the movie is just an alien invasion but the movie runs for 145 minutes which is LONG. So the director does a lot of padding which ruins the pacing of this movie. This is especially noticeable in the second act where it feels like everything is slowing down and coming to a halt just so they can find a way to bring all the characters together and it just drags. Additionally, the movie has to find a way for humans to fight back and win but it is not very convincing. You are required to ignore questioning the logic of the plot and characters and dialling down the sense of believability for this movies plot to work.<br/><br/>While I did praise the actors for their performance, the characters themselves are very lacking in depth. I don't feel like I understand any of the characters motives or backstory and none of the main characters changes by the end of the movie either. I never really cared for any of the characters dying and there are moments I've feel where they want you the audience to feel something but it doesn't work because none of the characters is that interesting for us to care. Well except for the dog who is a character we all care for and has a great moment in the movie. Rewatching the movie I've noticed how stereotypical the characters were which is probably why this movie was a product of the 90s and wouldn't be allowed today necessarily.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is still a fun movie to watch and even to rewatch. The true main star of this movie is the visual effects with its stunning action pyrotechnics giving us some of the best destruction in movie history. The production and set design are great and the amount of practical stuff is astounding as well. However, the movie is pretty cheesy and dumb with a very stupid conclusion which I've still find dumb even during my rewatch. One line still sticks to mind is ""they'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper"" and honestly I still think about that because it shouldn't affect ones flying ability but apparently that is important. Nevertheless, this movie is just pure spectacle filled fun and no doubt watching this movie was an enjoyable time which is all that matters in over the top, cliche movies like these."

","Once upon a time, Americans liked to elect morons as their presidents. This rather unfortunate phenomenon had the effect of prompting other morons to make films that justified the reign and actions of their moronic mentors. Independence Day, together with it's token tweeisms, heavily polished action - hero presidential figure, thinly disguised propagandist speeches and even the final 'We Wuz WRONG!' speech, the pretentiousness of which even an eight year old could see through, is a strong example of this. Humungous amounts of money were poured into this white elephant of a film - making project. $100 million I understand. No doubt financed by the kind of people whose interests it serves to nurture moronic qualities in the American public, these people had very clear ideas about how to use their bloated bank balances for the greater good. Hey guys, lets build some new, affordable social housing for the decent, hard - working (overworked) people of our nation. No. Okay. Lets build some new hospitals to provide the best possible care for the least privileged. Definitely not. Right. What about some more schools? How about channelling some funding into the most deprived, over - worked inner city schools? Don't be an ass. Err... okay. How about making an over - hyped, no - brainer scripted, shameless piece of hegemonic republican propagandist trash and wrap a bit of science fiction around it so all the geeks go?

","""Independence day"" (ID4) is one of the most overrated films in movie history. Technically is very well done, the rest is a disaster.<br/><br/>I wonder if the film -which is one the biggest hits of all time- would enjoy the same gigantic success NOW... <br/><br/>The film was released in 1996: these were the Clinton years, without terrorism threat.<br/><br/>In 2005 we've already experienced 9/11 and two wars decided and led by US administration (Afgahnistan and Iraq). Audiences (at least outside US) probably wouldn't like ID4 so much. So, I ask again even if the answer doesn't exist: would the film enjoy the same gigantic success?<br/><br/>The picture is an hymn to patriotism and contains strong political messages:<br/><br/>1. US president is an example for everyone and he's ready to take part in a fight for freedom (...""Enduring Freedom""?)<br/><br/>2. All the countries should live a day like the 4th of July, the Independence day<br/><br/>3. US democracy is the best one and every country should follow it<br/><br/>To me these messages were clear also in 1996, but at that time I just made a laugh -after all it was only a popcorn movie. NOW I think people outside US could hardly enjoy this film. I'm sorry to say that because I'm not anti-American and I know that not all the Americans think in the same way.<br/><br/>The film is also full of stereotypes regarding Americans themselves. Look at the characters: the main ones are a white Christian president, a black pilot and a Jewish scientist. That's a way of making several kinds of audience happy, because many races are represented in the movie.<br/><br/>There are clichés regarding foreign people as well. Common people of the world are represented in their stereotypical physical and cultural characteristics (see for example the pilots of the different armies!).<br/><br/>The movie is very conservative. I don't know if Mr.Emmerich wanted to do a film like this, but the result certainly speaks a lot.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed when I think that Roland Emmerich, a German director, made it. It wasn't necessary to do a so servile movie to please American audiences..."

","I can accept that this film film is not supposed to be especially serious, but, to me, it commits every sin in the cinematic book of crimes. For a start, there isn't one character with any charm or charisma, to the point where I started supporting the aliens. But of course, the aliens couldn't possibly win because firstly, they aren't human and therefore must be evil, and secondly, the Americans must always be seen as brave, dynamic and intelligent; the saviours of mankind. It is this kind of overly patriotic, flag waving, 'America is the greatest country on earth' attitude that winds people up. A bit of humility wouldn't go amiss sometimes.<br/><br/>Aside from the usual 'isn't America brilliant?' theme, the film has a dreadfully predictable story-line, a corny script and woeful acting. I suppose the best thing you could say about it is that the special effects are slick. But even then, this doesn't add to my enjoyment of the film. The alien ship may be an impressive computer-made creation, but that's still what it looks like; computer-made. It doesn't look real.<br/><br/>The mark of a good film is if you are still talking about it in the pub a few hours after you've left the cinema, or even at work the following day.

","Ah...1996. It seems as if it were only yesterday. But it's a world away from the cynical, fearful, paranoid, and oppressive times we live in now. ID4 would be rightfully laughed out of cinemas in the present day.<br/><br/>America, pulsating infectious positive vibes with its booming economy, popular President running for re-election, a summer crammed with iconic, action-packed adventures such as The Rock, Mission: Impossible, and Eraser, all while riding high the wave of the Atlanta Olympics, naturally turned ID4 into the biggest hit of the decade. I must admit, I too was suckered into it.<br/><br/>Why do I say suckered? I recall being amazed by the teaser trailer before a screening of Broken Arrow on April 13th, a full 4 months before the release (we had to wait until August 9th in the UK). It promised a dark, scary, and serious film about interstellar war. Then, as we got closer, a new trailer synced to the theme of Crimson Tide came out, mesmerizing audiences with then revolutionary visual effects.<br/><br/>When the film was finally released the dark, scary, and serious film that we were promised across the entire ad campaign quickly descended into camp, corny, stupid nonsense. It's easy to make a terrible film and entertain the masses with flickering images and bright, pretty colors even if it doesn't make a shred of sense. How else would you account for the success of Michael Bay? ID4 is bad across the board. The dialogue is just awful, I cringe at every other line. Despite the fact that an end-of-the-world scenario is potentially very dramatic there is no real acting in the film at all. Each and every one of the actors speak like they're reading from cue cards being held beside the static camera. Will Smith's irregular ad-libbing is irritating and dates the film even further. Bill Pullman, as much as I like him, stumbles through the film like he's drunk and/or unable to understand English.<br/><br/>Principal photography for ID4 wrapped in well under 3 months. I blame the swift shoot for the obvious lack of rehearsals and decent performances. It's like Roland Emmerich got the film in the can as quickly as possible at the expense of everything that might actually make it worthwhile. His non-effort results in almost the entire film being made of static shots with no hand-held camera movements whatsoever, which castrates ID4 of any sense of urgency or realism. Even the extras are bad, which is pretty sad considering all they have to do is run away from very fake explosions. If they didn't work for free then the production was ripped off.<br/><br/>There's not one likable character. The second round of promos sold it as a Will Smith movie. It's not. He's really a secondary character in a cast filled with secondary characters. The worst subplot features Randy Quaid as a drunk pilot. Whenever the film cuts to his family (and his very annoying, moody, Keanu Reeves lookalike son) it threatens to keel over and die. Emmerich really ought to have been a bit more liberal with the scissors. It's astonishing to think that his director's cut is even longer. As if it were not already too bloated and clumsy.<br/><br/>Of all the would-be greatness, only David Arnold's rousing score truly entertains. Though if your very geeky like me you'll realize that it's merely a plagiarism of Richard Joseph's theme to James Pond 3 on the Mega Drive.<br/><br/>Worth watching only as a curious, outdated relic of an innocent time long since gone. ID4's enjoyment has long since expired."

I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.<br/><br/>The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you can suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a crop duster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. Never would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident back in 2003...oops...my bad.<br/><br/>The reason I am even giving this film 4/10 is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the ""buddy"" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, ""Men in Black""."

How can a major studio get away with such gross, offensive nonsense? However, the greatest irony comes in the scenes set in Iraq, where friendly Iraqis are fighting shoulder to shoulder with both Israel and Uncle Sam! Truly mind blowing and a telling insight into a mentality that no doubt lead to a rather different American involvement in the deserts of Iraq a few years later.

It's very funny to discover that American Presidents have the same feelings as ordinary people have, the same problems and the same rights (but why they can't have lovers then?). It's very funny, folks.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most pathetic pictures I've ever seen. And it looks terrible. It consists nothing but visual effects. But is this enough to spend money to watch it?"
"RichardKleiner","2","11","21","13 May 2008"," This film doesn't deserve anything higher than a five
","Independence Day may be the best example of what I know as ""Bad Hollywood"". Although I not consider myself such an expert in movies as to spot an excellent screenplay, this movie may be an easy choice for noticing a bad screenplay.<br/><br/>Why, do you ask? Well, let's sum up this to five scenes or situations with a memorable quote from each.<br/><br/>#5 TV NEWS ANCHORMAN-""Once again, the L.A.P.D. is asking Los Angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft. You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war"".<br/><br/>Apparently, people in the US are stupid enough to think that with a six bullet revolver they can inflict damage to a spaceship that covers the entire sky and could easily squash one half of a city if it landed on it. Or at least, that's what the Network executives think.<br/><br/>#4 CONSTANCE (Before leaving David and his father alone in the Oval Office) ""Don't touch anything.<br/><br/>Even if it was allowed that a White House employee let civilians inside the place where the President works, there still should be some security, don't you think? Whatever person that may be allowed to enter the Oval Office may have his own personal political agenda and vandalize the place, or at least take a little souvenir, from a fountain pen to the desk itself. But that seems to stop both characters after the instruction of ""Don't touch anything"".<br/><br/>#3 UNSPECIFIED FARMER (After pesticide has landed on the wrong field) ""If your father doesn't come in 20 minutes, I'm hiring someone else"".<br/><br/>What a threat! If I was the farmer, I would be personally furious, and would have said something like ""When he comes, I'll junk his stupid biplane and beat the living hell out of him with the fuselage parts"". But this one gives him twenty minutes to come, considering hiring someone else. Again, if I was that farmer, I wouldn't consider it. I would hire someone else right away! <br/><br/>#2 JULIUS ""It's Air Force One, for crying out loud, and still he gets sick!"" This time, the previous two civilians manage to inconspicuously enter Air Force One without previous authorization, just because they told the President to run away. No matter the heroics, I'm pretty sure the President never lets anyone with no business on board the plane to just ""shoe in"".<br/><br/>#1 PRESIDENT WHITMORE ""Today we (the world) celebrate our Independence Day"" The final line of the most hated speech in Hollywood cinema by every single anti-American in the world. I personally don't have anything against the US, but still this rather globally view of an American holiday may result a little bit insulting.<br/><br/>I've left out some quotes as I don't remember them literally. Still some scenes are probably some of the worst in a script and in a movie.<br/><br/>For instance, Steven (Will Smith) and Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) are discussing about him leaving her, while an alien spacecraft is over their skies, just as if nothing is happening aside from a dog barking in the yard. The United States have three of those huge ships above three of their most important cities. Still every other country has only one ship above it's capital, including Russia, a much bigger country with other cities besides Moscow (like St. Petersburg or Stalingrad).<br/><br/>If you could make a game of drinking a shot of alcohol for every stupid line you find in the movie, you would need two bottles.<br/><br/>There were stuff I liked. The effects of course, are state the art, but that doesn't redeems the lousy script (whose weight was the action sequences and nothing else). The fighter planes sequences were actually very good, as I love battle scenes, and also the mother ship sequences. The kneeling down sequence in the locker room stole a chuckle.<br/><br/>The movie overall it's not as bad as others, but it's still very bad.<br/><br/>The script is for idiots who have never seen a movie (not just about US politics or Earth disaster movies, but overall any good movie). The performances, coming from otherwise good actors, are forced and completely embarrassing. The famous score by David Arnold, while spectacular and good, is too much for the movie. It's too dramatic and over the top for rather meaningless scenes. It may be that the music works better without the movie.<br/><br/>It's over patriotic tones are almost obscene. This is rather pathetic, knowing the fact that co-writer/director, Roland Emmerich, is German and by the time this movie was being made, he still had his German accent ""Zis mofie vill be great"".<br/><br/>It's not even fun to watch, except for the action sequences.<br/><br/>While some may disagree with me and consider it much better, I would object to giving the movie ten stars, as there are far better alien invasion movies around and this one has major flaws (again, the whole script). Even as I was entirely crazy, drunk, high or all of the above, I couldn't rate it higher than 5, but I'm pretty sure it deserves a 2/10 (one for the effects, another for the action sequences and that's pretty much it)."

It starts off OK and to my disappointment never really gets going and then insults to an unbelievable extent.

Not one feature of it is praiseworthy. I have peace of mind that i will never see this film again. Big budget = cobblers? It is now too often the case. Check out the original or first remake of 'Invasion of the Bodysnatchers' instead"
"Calaboss","6","21","46","16 April 2005"," What's with all the anti-American comments?
","I started reading the comments for this movie and was taken by how many people from outside the U.S. were deriding it as being too patriotic. A recurring derogatory comment was ""The Americans save the day, again."" And the movie is ""only for stupid American children and rednecks."" <br/><br/>I don't understand what those people are thinking about. This is an American movie, made for, oddly enough, Americans! Would those people also be surprised that Americans are biased for America? I personally agree that the RAH-RAH factor was too high in ID4, but not all my countrymen must have felt that way. The movie made over $300,000,000 domestically, so more than kids and hicks must have liked it. And despite the fact that, overseas, the IMDb commenter's seem to dismiss the film as propagandistic pabulum, it made almost $500,000,000 in foreign sales, so there must be a lot of American rednecks in other countries too.<br/><br/>Now, if foreigners want to watch American films, that's fine with me (and I'm sure it's more than fine with U.S. movie producers), but they shouldn't be surprised if our movies are ""Pro-American."" I would expect that Russian films are ""Pro-Russian"" too. <br/><br/>If anyone is offended by our films, the solution is really simple - DON'T WATCH THEM. I found French films to be pretentious, low rent, chick flicks, so I stopped watching them. Not watching foreign films is easy to do, so feel free to show your disgust by never watching an American film again. In fact, if all foreigners stopped, maybe Hollywood studios would start making films just for them, although you shouldn't hold your breath.<br/><br/>If Germany, Japan, or any other country could make such big, booming, over-the-top films, I'd probably watch them, but no other countries have production companies that can afford to throw a hundred million dollars (or more) into making a film. If you want wiz-bang, high-tech, blockbuster films like Harry Potter, Terminator 2, Spiderman, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, ID4, etc., you're going to have to view an American film. And if they have to put some patriotic RAH-RAH in there to make sure they at least make their money back domestically (in case the film doesn't work overseas), well, that's what they'll do. Movie making is just a business like any other. If movies don't make money, they'll stop making them.<br/><br/>Remember- Movies like ID4 and X-Men are just mindless FANTASIES. They aren't meant to be taken seriously. They're meant to be harmless fun on a Saturday afternoon. I don't know if I'm a typical American male, but I do like to just kick back and watch things go ""BOOM"" once in a while.<br/><br/>However, if you wish to view a nice, high concept, artsy-fartsy, thought provoking, low budget, snooze-inducing talk-fest of a movie, feel free to watch some of that hokum coming out of France."

","Independence Day has little to no redeemable qualities about it. The acting, directing, editing, and writing are all absolute crap. Moreover, this movie is one hundred and forty five minutes long. I have nothing against long movies; most of my favorites run over two hours long, but when a piece of crap like this, a film that relies completely on special effects, thinks it has enough of a story to last that long? PLEASE! The only reason I'm giving this more than one star is the special effects. They probably pleased some simpleton minds who went to see yet another 'AMERICA SAVES THE WORLD' movie. Don't even get me started on Emmerich, a man responsible for crap like the American remake of ""Godzilla"", the even worse ""Universal Soldier"", and the ridiculously bad ""Moon 44"". Sure, the guy made a decent film in ""Stargate"", but nothing else I've seen from him is worth anything at all. Moreover, I can't even laugh at his crap, unlike stuff by directors like Uwe Boll. Well, he makes money for the studios, I guess.<br/><br/>The script remains the worst part however. It's like ""Armageddon"" only even more overly sentimental and even worse acted, and even more cliché-packed if that's possible. So many people go after Michael Bay, but Emmerich should be the target. At least Bay made one good movie (The Rock), Emmerich is just rubbish all the damn time.<br/><br/>Ugh, do yourself a favor, and do not watch this movie. 2/10"
"darren-elding","1","7","12","7 October 2004"," Worst film ever?
","Contains Spoilers (if it is actually possible to spoil this film further)<br/><br/>This probably has to be the worst film ever made (per dollar spent). OK, perhaps not the very worst, Godzilla was even worse, but it's still a terrible film. It should have been so good too. What better scenario could there be for a big budget sci-fi film than the invasion of the Earth by an alien race? It started off quite promisingly too, the first half hour was quite enjoyable. But then it deteriorates into typical Hollywood 'movie-making-by-numbers' drivel. There's the ridiculous comedy moments such as our hero Smith punching an alien after a spaceship crash, the washed-up, drunk ex-serviceman who will come good in the end to save the day, the implausible ending, etc, etc. The excruciatingly over sentimental scenes that all US films seem to insist on torturing the rest of us with (such as the scene with the president and his kid, or the nauseating speech to his troops) are almost unwatchable unless you have a particularly strong stomach or a handy bucket. My advice would be to watch another film, any other film... except Godzilla."

The plot was so stupid, that I'm sure it would insult the intelligence of an adult with a 3rd grade education.  The film tried to include some satire, which was not the least bit funny.  I thought that the film was legitimate at the beginning. Unfortunately, it became bogus during the scene where Will Smith is dragging the alien and talking in ""rap-language.""  From then on, the films plot and acting got progressively worse.  I give the special effects a ten, but give the remainder of the movie a negative ten.  Ten plus negative ten equals zero.

Now... how come they couldn't put those people, or people like them, to work on the plot?<br/><br/>The basic idea is simple:  A race of aliens come to earth to conquer it, and the human race fights back.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is HOW the humans fight back.  Using 50 year old alien technology, Jeff Goldblum, a satellite TV repairman, creates a computer virus to shut down the mothership's shields.  Apparently, this ""Advanced"" race of alien beings use Macintosh Computers, never upgrade their software, or change their passwords, or try to communicate with ships that are trying to dock, before allowing them to dock.<br/><br/>Then there's the Hillbilly crop duster, played by Randy Quaid, who jumps himself into an F-18 Hornet, and is able to fly it, quite well, right away. I don't care if he was in the Korean War, or whatever... you don't just sit yourself into an advanced tactical fighter, without previous training and an understanding of all the controls, and start flying right away."

The speed with which they find the solution to accessing the alien's ships, flying them and locate their weak spot is rather unbelievable.<br/><br/>From a non-US point of view, I also think it is very arrogant to write a story in which, by some 'strange' coincidence, the date at which the world is saved from the alien threat is July 4, which just 'happens' to be the US independance day."

","Here is what I learned from this film: 1) there is sound in the vacuum of space, as shown in the opening scene as the alien ships approach Earth, 2) if a city is about to be destroyed by a hovering alien ship and there is a massive gridlock traffic jam in the outbound lane of the highway, it will not occur to any of the drivers to switch over to the empty inbound lane and get the hell out, 3) if a massive fireball is approaching you are in a tunnel, just duck into an alcove and the flames will rush by without filling in all empty spaces and roasting you alive, 4) if you crack the computer code from an alien fighter ship held by the government since the late 1940's, you can be sure the aliens will still use the same program for both their fighters and the Mother Ship after 50 years, enabling you to hack into the Mother Ship's system from a laptop even though their technology must be hundreds of years more advanced than ours, and 5) if you are a smart ass fighter pilot like Will Smith with no prior flight experience with alien fighters, you can easily fly an alien fighter right up into the Mother Ship, which in fact would have to be in orbit around the Earth, requiring complex maneuvers on the part of Will Smith to leave orbit at 25,000 mph and then match the orbital speed of the Mother Ship to link up with it. Not to worry though, since the film, like in a cartoon, shows the Mother Ship as stationary in the sky, so Will Smith just flies up to it with no need to fret about oxygen in the vacuum of space and no need to worry that the aliens will notice that their computer system has been hacked or that one of their fighters is making an unauthorized approach."

Will you order a massive nuclear attack to repel the aliens?<br/><br/>Nope, the president in Independence Day thinks that it's premature to use nuclear weapons at this point. He wants to try and take down the 15-mile floating saucers with air-to-air missiles. You try it and it didn't work. Every fighter jet is wiped out in a matter of minutes. Meanwhile the flying saucers are moving on to destroy more large cities. What do you do? You're going to order the massive nuclear attack nowright?<br/><br/>WRONG, but the president thinks that one nuclear weapon may be used on one alien ship as long as not too many people get hurt by it. You fire and detonate a nuclear missile against one of the 15-mile saucers, but the saucer doesn't go down. One nuke didn't work. What do you do? Do you try more? How about 10, 30, or 100 nukes? What do you have to lose? <br/><br/>No, the president thinks that it is now hopeless to use any weapons. He wants other options. At this point, one of the president's aides decides that now is a good time to inform the president that the United States is secretly in possession of alien technology in Area 51. You go to Area 51 and use the alien tech to hatch a one-time plan to disable the shields of the flying saucers. But their shields will only be down for a few minutes if this works. Now, will you please order the massive nuclear assault when the shields go down? It's our last chance. You'll do it, right?<br/><br/>WRONG again, the president would rather try conventional weapons in this one-time effort to save the Earth. You send your last fighter jets to fire air-to-air missiles at the 15-mile flying saucer. The missiles manage to scorch the outside of the saucer, nothing more. All is lost. Hold on, one guy crashed his plane into the middle on the saucer, which caused a chain reaction that destroyed the entire ship. <br/><br/>Waitare you kidding me? The aliens built their 15-mile wide impenetrable flying saucers with a weak point in the middle that, if touched, destroys the entire ship. That can't be right. Why would they do that?

The local McDonald's obviously had been photoshopped out, lest the viewer might think the Americans brought anything other than peace and democracy to the world.<br/><br/>...But really. I dislike neither America nor its inhabitants, but you *have* to realise how your overblown patriotism must look in the eyes of those with a more, erm, objective view on things. In fact, if the movie makers had been a bit more sensitive to actual history, they'd have had the alien ships exploding while our heroes were still desperately trying to come up with a plan, leaving everyone dumbstruck until someone finally realised, 'Damn! The Russians beat us to it'.<br/><br/>Now *that* would have been a funny joke.<br/><br/>Everyone already commented on the general ridiculousness of the main plot line, so I'll refrain from doing that. But let me just share one pet peeve that no one seems to have mentioned so far: the portrayal of science. In the actual world, scientists are intelligent people who know stuff you don't. In ID4 world, scientists are stupid, giggly weirdos who fail to make actual progress until the President and his cable guy decide to come barging in (in a sterile area, no less, supposedly spoiling decades of research, but who cares what those geeks are doing). THEY FAILED TO REALISE THAT THE PATTERNS ON THE SCREEN WERE A COMMUNICATION SIGNAL. I rest my case.<br/><br/>Then there's the romance. The Will Smith/Vivica Fox romance was decent, though completely compiled from stock dialogue and clichéd scenes, but at least you get to feel like they deserve each other and vaguely hope for a happy ending for them. But Jeff Goldblum's character getting his wife back? She dumped him because he didn't do anything extraordinary, wants him back now that he's saved the day, and he happily encloses her in his arms as the credits roll - why doesn't he tell her that 'sorry, but she never accepted him for who he was, and it's too late now'? Do the writers really intend to convey the message that you truly only deserve to be loved for what you do, rather than for who you are? I'm sorry, but that doesn't seem very romantic to me.<br/><br/>So, maybe I am overanalysing, because ID4 is really just a no-brainer, blah blah. But somehow, I can't see the fun of watching a movie while desperately trying to keep my neurons from firing - one might as well watch a movie with one's eyes closed. ('OMG you haters, you were just expecting WAY too much, if you had closed your eyes throughout the entire movie you'd have given it a 10/10!') <br/><br/>By the way, you know what else killed me ded? This exquisite piece of irrefutable argumentation I stumbled upon in the comments: ""Ok first of all the only people complaining about how bad this movie was are from other countries. here is a news flash for you. the US saved England's butts in world war 2.""<br/><br/>______ * Yes, I know he's not that great an actor, but girls can be superficial too.

In general i got little impression of a sense of urgency or astonishment from the Hollywood pretenders, that ALIENS ARE INVADING!.<br/><br/>It was impossible to overlook the countless obvious logical problems this movie had,... how did Smith know where to find his wife,... why did they have to get idiot volunteers to fight the aliens (the entire air force was gone, including retirees?),.. why didn't the missiles have the same explosive power each time as the final one,... how do you 'upload' a computer virus to an alien system without knowing their technology or protocol.<br/><br/>There were just too many dumb script decisions,... Goldblum gets drunk and acts out because he's upset that fighting the aliens with Nuclear Weapons will hurt the environment(!), ...astoundingly idiotic,... The ""president"" decides to be a hero too, wow, there are no words to express how asinine that idea was,... The aliens have the technology to fly millions of light years in city sized ships yet they have to rely on our relatively archaic satellite systems in order to communicate with each other. I could go on and on and on.<br/><br/>The fact that the entire premise or core idea of the movie was ridiculous, is no justification in glossing over obvious gaps in sense. Sci-fi movies are suppose to take us into fantasy, but not into stupidity. This movie was bad because not enough mental effort was put into it, quite typical of Hollywood. The sad truth is, that if this movie had been computer animated, say by Pixar, it would have been far more realistic and believable."

I was unfortunately suckered into seeing this over-commercialized over- hyped pile of mindless junk. Forgetting that this is the 90's and during the summer special effects and action are all that's required to draw people to the theaters. A plausible well written story with good drama, tension and excitement are not necessary for the brain dead of our society who continue to throw away money on this junk every year which means we will continue to see more garbage like it every year. This film is not that bad and I wouldn't detest it so much if it didn't earn so much money. I keep hoping people will tire of these films and spend their money on something better or will never see the end of junk like this. The first half is not too bad and the image of the huge spaceships that cover entire cities is quite scary and does have dramatic impact. Once we get to the underground secret lab and the hidden space ship the film goes down hill faster than you can say ID !? The clichés pile up starting with the millionth time since Watergate on film that our Gov. is keeping secrets from the people even the Pres., then of course we have to have at least 1 gooey slimy gory alien surgery scene and as far as the special effects I saw nothing in this film new or impressive that we haven't seen since Star Wars which is now over 20 years old. Then we're expected to believe that as advanced as this allien invader is their technology has not improved in the last 40+ years that they wouldn't detect one of their old spaceships is manned by man and infiltrating their brain center and that we could learn to fly it in a very short time or that it would still even fly !? It's too bad the producers couldn't find some creative writers to find a more scientific or imaginative way to destroy the invaders. I'll take War Of The Worlds, When Worlds Collide and  Colossus The Forbin Project 3 far more entertaining end of the world dramas and watch them over and over again rather than every sitting through ID which should stand for Idiots Donate !"

","I saw Independence Day twice in the cinema during the summer of 1996. The first time, i thought it was action packed, with stunning special effects with fantastic set pieces like New York and Washington D.C. being blown to pieces by the invading aliens. Then i had to see it again. This time i went with some friends.<br/><br/>When i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature. The proof is in the daft stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes (during the arrival of the massive ships over the New York skyline) after that as far as Goldblum's concerned its Laurel and Hardy time with Will Smith's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship. Then there is Will Smith. The director must have just said to smith 'Just be yourself' meaning Fresh Prince of Bel air in a military uniform. Smith is much better in Men In Black (a real comedy) and the excellent i, robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the Hero.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Randy Quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history. Rand's character is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the later Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>The potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters.

","Before he became an over-inflated egotist, Will Smith was actually a likable guy.

It wasn't until he started starring in trash like ""Independence Day"" that his welcome began wearing thin. ""Independence Day"" does nothing to redeem Will Smith. In fact, 1998's bomb did more to reinforce the notion that Will Smith should have remained in television rather than going into motion pictures.<br/><br/>But I can't pick on Will Smith for this mess alone: remember, it takes a village. In the case of ""Independence Day"", it took many months of pre-publicity and advertising to pitch this bloated, idiotic, absurd story to audiences. It worked, given the fact that its opening weekend grossed an astounding $36.1 million at the box office. But just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good. (""Independence Day flopped with critics.)<br/><br/>Essentially a poor remake of H.G. Welles' ""War of the Worlds"", ""Independence Day"" offers the same story line with a few modern twists and variations on the original storyline. Yes, Roland Emmerich's version contains ground-breaking special effects--visuals that defied existing technologies at the time, rightfully winning awards for their breakthrough brilliance. But you get a much stronger remake of ""War of the Worlds"" with M. Night Shyamalan's far superior ""Signs""--also loosely based on the original tale--sans the spectacular effects. Why? Because ""Signs"" gave us characters to actually care about and a claustrophobically atmospheric screenplay soaked in mystery and suspense. ""Independence Day"" merely assumes we are even the least bit interested in its characters and could care less about plausible plot development.<br/><br/>By the time Will Smith and company take the helm near the end of this wreck, we are asked to believe they can figure out the same alien technology attacking the earth to stop the invasion. I didn't buy it. Neither should you.<br/><br/>Leave ""Independence Day"" on the shelf where it belongs."

I firmly believe that sci-fi movies, as unlikely as they can be, should have decency and SHOULD NOT show downright ignorance -- but then again, how many times are we supposed to be presented with space ships that make noises in empty space? Here we are supposed to learn that aliens whose technology is thousands of years ahead of ours still use floppies, program their computers in our programming languages (despite the fact that they have a completely different alphabet and speech) or in a compatible format anyways, and that we can upload a VIRUS to their HUGE computer when Windows viruses can't affect machines that run a different operating system like Unix here on Earth!

Good job his estranged wife is the President's personal assistant and not a checkout girl at Safeway, eh? They have had an alien ship in Area 52 for 50 years and no-one can figure out how to get it operational - Goldblum figures it out in 10 minutes, in between writing a virus for the alien operating system.

Naaah, let's send him up to the alien mother ship and near certain death! Now, let's see, in a world crisis, when the world is (apparently) looking to the USA for a lead as to what to do, how best should we use the President? I know, let's send him up in a fighter plane against one of those ships which keeps destroying the planes we send up against it!

None of these criticisms was anything which couldn't have been corrected by a little bit of rewriting, but taken together they indicated contempt for an audience which, clearly, was assumed to be so devoid of intelligence that none of these things would matter to them.<br/><br/>I guess the box office proved them right on that one!

"Glimmer_Twin","3","5","8","21 February 2005"," ""Indepence Day
","The plot in ""Independence Day"" isn't exactly hard to describe; some kind of alien race has decided to try to take over Earth, and after destroying most major cities in the world and crushing all counter-attacks, the U.S. finally prevails and kills them off. Any movie that can be explained well in one sentence - and I imagine that last sentence was pretty much the whole script - has a problem to start with. But, there are many simple action movies that still manage to be entertaining, given that they have a certain level of self-awareness (a movie like ""Die Hard"" is a good example). This movie, however, has the self-awareness of a two-year old. Not only that, it also over-uses every last one of the pathetic clichés that so many people connect Hollywood disaster-films with these days - flag-waving, macho guys trying to be funny (and failing miserably in the process), a score that is basically centered around different versions of the U.S. national anthem, the underdog who gets beaten down but prevails in the end, thus achieving the American Dream, the leader who is really not a man of politics, but a man of action, and of the people - everything. Watching a movie like this is interesting, because it is actually so dumb and totally unaware of its own absurdness that you can't parody it; it's already a parody of itself.<br/><br/>The acting is bad, based on the fact that every character in this movie is insanely predictable. We all know within the first two seconds of seeing them exactly how they will behave until the very end. Of course Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), the alcoholic Vietnam veteran (who is the underdog I mentioned before) will get his revenge at the aliens who abducted him ten years before the attacks, of course he will prove the one's who have taunted him for so long wrong, and of course he will sacrifice his life for the sake of the United States of America - not the world - to become an incarnation of the archetype of the American Hero. Being a European, I have absolutely nothing against America myself, but it's no wonder how large parts of the world has a bad image of it when stuff like this is what they are basing their opinions on. (It's true that the director of the movie is actually German, but movies like this are controlled by studios, not directors.) All the other major characters' actions are just as predictable his Russell's, so I'm not going to go into them.<br/><br/>You are not supposed to take movies like this too seriously, and I don't. But large parts of it is so mind-numbingly stupid that it ends up being provoking. There are tons of logical plot holes; one of the biggest ones being how Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith) and David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) manage to first travel into the alien mother ship, using one of the alien vehicles, obtained in Roswell, New Mexico in the '50s (the vehicle is located in Area 51 - where else?), and then downloading a virus into the main computer, causing the shields of the ships attacking Earth to go down, which allows the human forces to strike against them. This is absurd in many ways; first of all, don't the aliens have some kind of scan for spaceships entering their mother ship? Their technology is so ridiculously advanced there's no reason they shouldn't have one. But most of all, how the hell can Levinson just hook up his portable computer to their main computer and download the virus in a matter of seconds? These creatures have shields powerful enough to withstand any human weapon, but they are totally defenseless against a guy with his home computer? Normally, I don't find plot holes like that all that disturbing, but there's so many of them in this movie, you just can't help but. And in addition to that some special effects are really poor.<br/><br/>Movies like ""Independence Day"" is the reason so many people detest Hollywood these days. It's dull and predictable, and has absolutely nothing new to offer. In addition to that, what it actually does offer, it offers in such a way that it feels like the heads of the studio responsible for it is actually sitting and laughing at for buying something as absurd as this. Sadly, the joke isn't on them, seeing as how this movie grossed more than $800 million worldwide. Maybe the human race does deserve to be annihilated after all."

","""Independence Day"" was one of the most disappointing movies from 1996.  The trailer looked promising, especially with the clip of the alien ship disintegrating the White House, and I thought that this was going to be a serious movie.  However, Will Smith and Harvey Fierstein are in it; so I should have known better.  Also, if the human race is about to face extinction, I think people are much, much more likely to fight out of self-defense rather than out of patriotism.  That little pep rally speech from Bill Pullman really undermined the movie.  The virus angle was kind of interesting, if not terribly plausible.  Though it would be very likely that a spacefaring race would have some kind of protection against computer viruses, it's still possible that the aliens never used computer viruses on each other so they never developed anti-virus software (or they did have such technology, but it wasn't able to detect human-made computer viruses for one reason or another).  It really doesn't matter anyway.  Too many stupid things happened before they even tried out the virus, including where Jeff Goldblum got the idea of using it against the aliens.  To summarize this movie in six words, can I get my money back?"
"Antithesys","8","5","8","11 September 2000"," The greatest bad movie of all time
","Much has been made of the flaws of this film: the cardboard cutout characters, the cheesy Hollywood storyline, the plot holes so big the alien mothership could fly through them. Normally these things turn me off to a movie. But ID4 is too much fun, I don't care how bad it is.<br/><br/>
Paying homage to 50's invasion movies, 70's disaster movies, Star Wars, War of the Worlds, etc., ID4 digs right in as huge alien saucers drop into our atmosphere and hover ominously over the 30 most explodable landmarks in the world. They soon reveal that they're - gasp! - unfriendly and start wiping out humanity city by city. The rest of the movie follows several groups of characters trying desperately to come up with a way to fend off the slimy visitors.<br/><br/>The fx, of course, are top-notch. There are a few battle scenes that are amazing. The acting isn't all that hot, but Will Smith is his usual perky self (I enjoy describing Will Smith as ""perky""), and Bill Pullman brings what he can to the presidency, including a scene late in the movie in which he rallies his attack pilots before the final battle; this over-the-top monologue is by far my favorite movie speech ever. Still brings a tear to my eye. Independence Day would probably qualify for MST3K in a few years, but its cheesiness is forgiven - this movie is too much fun."
"Kyle Westphal","3","5","8","16 December 1999"," Maybe the Aliens Came to Earth to Destroy The Makers of This ""Movie""
","The Plot: Predatory aliens are coming to destroy Earth and it's up to Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, Lord help us, to save the planet. That's basically it for a ""plot"".<br/><br/>My Critique: It's unfortunate that one of the largest grossing films of all time also happens to be one of the stupidest. ""ID4"" is perhaps the granddaddy of all bad science fiction/special effects movies in the blockbuster-driven 1990's. It has it all, as far as blockbuster go. ""ID4"" has no real story. Aliens come to Earth and blow up things. Earth (or rather America) fights back. More things blow up. Between things blowing up, we have pitiful attempts at filler, such as a stripper saving the First Lady.<br/><br/>The screenwriters opted for minimal character development. The Characters don't actually have much to do with the ""story"", they're just there to yell stupid one-liners and ""No!!!!"" whenever something blows up.<br/><br/>
In place of story, special effects are used. To me, the special effects in ""ID4"" aren't even good. In the entire movie, we only see one alien. The Oscar winning special effects are mainly of explosions and ugly, gray, alien destroyers, which all look the same to me.<br/><br/>But perhaps the main thing ""ID4"" lacks is a message. When I say message, I don't mean a moral lesson. Instead, I mean that the movie doesn't have a point it's trying to make. All great science fiction, and most movies in general, have a point to them. In ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"", the point was that man cannot rely on computers. In ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", aliens were coming to destroy Earth, like the ones in ""ID4"". However in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", the aliens were trying to teach humans a lesson about nuclear war, as was the point in many sci-fi movies from the 1950's. In ""ID4"", though, aliens simply want to destroy humans. They have no motivation for carnage.<br/><br/>It's a true shame that a movie as stupid, thoughtless, and flashy as ""Independence Day"" is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.<br/><br/>My Rating : 3"

","Independence Day, otherwise known by the abbreviation, ID4, was the blockbuster film of the summer of 1996, powered by Will Smith, and of course, a nonstop promotional blitz by 20th Century Fox.<br/><br/>Directed by Roland Emmerich, director of 1994's equally cheesy Stargate, and the completely awful 1998 Godzilla, insults the intelligence of every moviegoer with this travesty. The man simply cannot direct, period.<br/><br/>Advertisement was through the roof during the summer of '96 promising non stop special effects and an unbelievable science fiction story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, special effects were the only thing that was available in this film, since the story is completely cheesy, stupid, and just plain unremarkable.<br/><br/>The three leads, (Will Smith, the cocky and smart mouthed fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum, the cable employee who cannot drive a car and relies on his father for transportation yet, comes up with the virus that save humanity and Bill Pullman, the clueless president of the United States who doesn't even know about Area 51) are simple caricatures of cheesy 70's disaster movies from which they are based. None of them are remotely believable in any way whatsoever. Everyone thinks that Will Smith was terrific in this film, however, I feel he was a lot better, in the superior 1997 science fiction film Men In Black.<br/><br/>Another point how could Steven Hiller, (Will Smith) find his stripper girlfriend in the middle of a supposedly destroyed Los Angeles after ""borrowing"" or actually stealing a helicopter from the most idiotic guard in the history of mankind?! Or better yet, the United States itself would not be able to survive after it dropped a nuclear weapon on it's own backyard as they did in Houston in the film, just another laughable oversight by the filmmakers!<br/><br/>The ""story"" if there is one, involves a nonstop invasion from outer space, and the destruction of our planet.<br/><br/>It's just another humans vs. them science fiction film that has been done hundreds of times in the past, with far better results.<br/><br/>Want a better film with a similar premise, try watching 2005's War of the Worlds, directed by the great Steven Spielberg with a far better storyline involved. None of the characters are remotely interesting in ID4, and one of the characters played by Miss Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein was so annoying, that it was the only time, I smiled to see the end of that irritating character.<br/><br/>But, the real thing that makes ID4/Independence Day such a terrible film is the completely ridiculous notion that one measly cable repair man with a laptop computer can disable the aliens shields to allow the United States and other countries to take down their spaceships. (And people thought the ending of War of the Worlds was unrealistic!)This is definitely one of the most unbelievable endings to any film ever made, and completely insults the intelligence of every moviegoer who had to endure this film.<br/><br/>ID4 rates one star out of ten.

I can't believe any of them agreed to do this script. They must have somehow got strong-armed into doing this. <br/><br/>Clearly the director shares a lot of the blame here. In a movie like this, the only good parts are the violent parts and the parts in which things get blown up, but some of the explosion scenes were very poorly done. For example, in one scene, from the trajectories of the cars that are ostensibly being blown down the street, it is clear that they are just being dropped into the screen from above. <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that anyone would agree to direct or act in a film based on this script.<br/><br/>Characters are killed without first being developed at all, resulting in the viewer not caring so much when they die. The story is stupid in about three different ways. There's no way to suspend disbelief because it's so stupid. At no point during my viewing of this was I unaware that I was watching a movie--and a very bad one. The script is cliché-ridden and childish, designed for an audience of children and mental invalids. <br/><br/>I had always thought of Vivica Fox as kind of pretty, but she is looking pretty ugly in this one. <br/><br/>Trust me, you can skip this one.

How anyone can like or recommend this is beyond me. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith do get a few points for their improvisational throwaways, though those stand out as they are the only lines in the film that sound like they were spoken by human beings.

","4 out of 10<br/><br/>Collaborators Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have time and again proven themselves the most unoriginal filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Independence Day is the epitome of their lack of ideas, as they simply steal concepts from previous movies (better or worse movies is still questionable) and graft it here, typical so that it can lead to stuff getting blown up real good.  That is the extent of Independence Day's appeal, to see things blow up, and believe me, that can get old real fast.<br/><br/>A lot of things about the movie have always bothered me, whether it's the unnecessarily lengthy countdown the aliens have toward destruction, as it gives ample time for city-dwellers to escape.  Or perhaps it's how pathetically easy the aliens are to defeat once their shields drop.  Are we to assume that raggedy groups of inexperienced combat pilots could suddenly defeat the ferocious (and far numerous) swarms of alien fighters?  Perhaps taking the cake is the very fact that the alien motherships, when destroyed, actually crash by slanting sideways so as they won't fall on the targets below them.  <br/><br/>The action sequences deliver sporadic thrills, but they get repetitive very quickly, as it's mostly watching fighter jets and alien spacecrafts blow up. Some variation, perhaps infantry combat, would have been nice.  I think it says a lot about Independence Day when I state that it happens to be the 3rd best alien invasion flick of 1996 (the superior ones being Star Trek: First Contact and The Arrival).  When you realize how rare alien invasion movies are, then it's obvious that being 3rd best is a dubious remark.

Although this fantasy drama mentioned at one point in the film Independence Day would be a world celebration if they stand together and eliminate the enemy, I couldn't help but feel this film was viewed entirely from an American perspective. <br/><br/>I did not agree with the choice of actors for some of the characters, especially Bill Pullman as the President. I'm not sure whether the President himself was not a very strong, believable character, or whether Bill Pullman was not serious enough to portray the President. Having said that, the dialogue is riddled with unnecessary humor, which was more annoying than funny and uncalled for. The film had a serious premise, but it was handled in a very lighthearted manner, killing the potential suspense more often than not. The scenes that were done more seriously, were preceded or followed by comical scenes, deeming even the serious scenes lighthearted. The film had all the material to be an awesome action thriller, but the characters and dialogue were too stereotypical American. <br/><br/>The film also had way too many plot holes and convenience, silly remarks and a lot of credibility issues that made me raise an eyebrow. For now, I'll only mention the scene where Will Smith volunteers to fly the alien aircraft, saying he's seen how they manoeuvre. SEEN is completely different to actually FLYING an alien aircraft, and he not only succeeds, but manages to escape through almost impossible obstacles. Another example is Randy Quaid's character, Russell Casse, volunteering to fight the aliens. He flies a plane, yes, but its one thing to be able to fly a plane, but to engage in combat is entirely different. He simply does not have the experience, so it wasn't believable in the least. The music was also too dramatic and overbearing at times.<br/><br/>Regardless, this was indeed a very entertaining action sci-fi with some amazing action sequences and visual effects that are good to this day.

The reason: They have planned a timed attack which is not only affixed to our system of measuring time but is only discovered by one lone guy (Jeff Goldblum) in with a laptop.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't deliver anything that couldn't be found in a 50s alien invasion movie or a 70s disaster movie. As for the characters, somebody must have left the floodgates at Central Casting. We get a computer nerd (Goldblum), his Jewish father (Judd Hircsh), a hotshot pilot (Will Smith), The President (Bill Pullman), A wacko scientist (Brent Spiner), a stripper housewife (Vivica A. Fox) and a drunken pilot (Randy Quaid). All that is missing are George Kennedy, Robert Stack, O.J. Simpson, Linda Blair, Shelley Winters and Red Buttons.<br/><br/>The invasion scenes don't leave anything new either. Just hundreds of people running and screaming as monuments get blown up one by one and oddly all of them are American. What about the Eiffel Tower, The Taj Mahal, The coliseum, The Great Wall or Barney.<br/><br/>What do they want? To kill us of course. The aliens come off in 'Independence Day' like interstellar cockroaches which (if I understood it correctly), find a planet inhabit it and destroy it. I liked the idea that the aliens in David Twohy's 'The Arrival' had much better. They used our environment against us so that they could terraform the earth and take over. Heck even Marvin the Martian had the excuse that our planet was blocking his view of Venus.<br/><br/>Even the scene in which we find out their intentions is flat and boring. The scene builds with a question we have been wondering about all along but can't answer it intelligently. See what you think: The President (to the alien): 'What do you want us to do?' The alien: 'Die!' Gripping huh? The director Roland Emmerich keeps the aliens under wraps for most of the movie. Then when we finally get to seem them they are boring, tired old octopus creatures with tentacles and slimy skin. Ho-hum. Consider the fun aliens in 'Mars Attacks', small creatures with large-brains and bug-eyes who cackle with glee when they fry congress.<br/><br/>'Independence Day' is an event movie designed for the moment to be packaged advertised and sold on 2,000 screens. The main interest is giving the audience what they want. All of the budget has gone into the special effects and the oversized ad campaign (Why did the call it ID4, wouldn't that stand for Independence Day 4?)

","Released in 1996, when I was just under ten years old, this sci-fi action blockbuster directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich turned out to be a massive hit. I remember seeing at least a bit of it probably shortly after it was released on video, but don't remember much about that. Within the past couple years, I've seen three films which Emmerich has made since this one, which are ""The Patriot"", ""10,000 BC"", and ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Of those three, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was the only one I was impressed with at all, though even that one certainly has its flaws and is hated by many. By the time I finally got around to watching ""Independence Day"", fourteen years after its release, I knew it was a popular blockbuster, but also knew that it was widely criticized and that Emmerich doesn't have the greatest reputation as a filmmaker. I thought that as popular as the movie was, there was a good chance I wouldn't like it, but obviously had no way of knowing for sure. However, after watching it, it's not too surprising that I find myself joining the naysaying crowd.<br/><br/>In the United States of America, it is very close to Independence Day when it is discovered that mysterious giant objects are headed towards Earth! It is believed that these are meteors, but not for long, as it is soon clear that they are actually spaceships! A New York City cable worker named David Levinson discovers satellite transmissions which seem to indicate a countdown to an alien attack! He goes with his father, Julius to warn U.S. President Thomas J. Whitmore about this planned attack, and the president orders an evacuation of the cities the intruders are targeting, but it's too late. It isn't long at all before the countdown ends and major cities around the world, including three American ones (New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C), are destroyed by hovering spaceships which blast them with destructive beams! It is now up to the survivors to defeat these evil aliens and save their planet. Whitmore, who escaped with family and staff members from the capital of the United States just in time before the city was obliterated, heads to Area 51, where it is said that a seized alien spacecraft is being kept (something he had never been told before), and must work with others to prevent the end of humanity! <br/><br/>This 1996 blockbuster suffers from the quality of the characters, plus the performances from the cast members who play them. None of them stand out as really good here, with a very unimpressive performance from Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, and a number of other bland performances. Randy Quaid is worse than most of the others, playing alcoholic Russell Casse, and so are the ones who play his kids. Scenes with these characters can sure be annoying, with lines such as, ""You don't want to die a virgin, do you?"" I've only seen the special edition, featuring nine minutes of footage not included in the original theatrical version of the movie. Apparently, the Casses are not featured as much in the original version, and that certainly doesn't sound like a bad thing to me, but unfortunately, these characters are not the film's only problem. In addition to the problems with the characters and those who play them, I also didn't find much excitement while watching this film, as much as I know so many others have. I found SOME excitement, but very little. I also didn't care much for the story, in which we barely ever see these evil aliens, nor do we ever get to know much about them. With all the problems I found with ""Independence Day"", I found it to be tedious and usually boring, and I doubt seeing nine minutes less would have made much of a difference. There are parts that I could tell are supposed to be funny, but none of them made me laugh, so I can't say anything for the film's humour, either. Since this is a high budget modern blockbuster, it's no surprise that the visuals are great, but that's not enough to make a good movie.<br/><br/>Shortly after watching the special edition, I thought about watching the original theatrical version before reviewing the film. (One might find it hard to believe I've never seen that version!) However, I decided not to do that. It is nine minutes shorter than the special edition, but if that's the only difference, I really don't think it's worth sacrificing another two hours or so of my life watching it. Maybe the extended version I saw features some restored scenes which the film is better off without, and that might mean that the version people saw in theatres is a BIT better, but I was unimpressed with a lot more than just nine minutes of what I saw! MAYBE it would rise to a 5/10 for me if I saw the original, but that wouldn't be enough. Many viewers consider ""Independence Day"" an entertaining blockbuster, and I certainly don't look down on them for that, but personally, I can't imagine myself ever actually liking it. Since there were several months in between my viewing of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and my viewing of this 1996 film from Roland Emmerich, I'm not sure how to compare them (though they do have similar flaws), but for some reason, I found more suspense in the 2004 release. If you like ""Independence Day"" for any reason, that's great, just don't expect me have the same opinion."

","Here's another page in my chapter of movies I used to love but don't any more. Actually this one had a huge effect on my life- not only did it give me an interest in aliens, but believe it or not, the president in this movie inspired me to look up real life politicians, and got me intensely interested in history and social sciences. All of my upper year schooling was centred on those subjects. Now, I recognize this isn't a particularly deep film, but for an action movie and special effects spectacle this is still a pretty good effort.<br/><br/>The plot- an alien mothership arrives at Earth and sends city-sized spaceships over the great cities of the world, including Washington, DC, New York and Los Angeles. The dramatic music associated with these spaceships give them godlike importance (I've heard it said before that religious music and science fiction music are often alike). The movie tackles the interesting question of how people, including politicians and ordinary people, would react, showing panic, awe, and celebration. But I'd have to say Contact, the Jodie Foster movie that came out a year later, does a better job at thinking how people would react to aliens- that movie replaced this one as being my favourite alien movie (post-Star Wars). But the aliens attack the cities, which would be devastating since they're so important. The explosions look pretty convincing; the destruction of the American cities is seen but the movie lacks an international view (the scenes showing the attacks on non-American cities were cut). And we get the satisfaction of seeing the humans winning. Along the way we get some comic relief from, among other things, Jeff Goldblum's character arguing with his father, and Brent Spiner.<br/><br/>We get some good material but there are some flaws- including an overly sentimental and cheesy subplot following the Russell character. I don't see why we should care about this idiot's issues with his children's respect, his wanting to prove himself. He's out for revenge, having been abducted by aliens years ago, so writers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich predictably make sure to provide him the opportunity. Upon hearing he was abducted, people react to him like he's crazy even after the aliens arrive, and one has to wonder why when the world has seen conclusive proof that aliens do exist. Incidentally, Russell says the aliens have been carrying out abductions for years to learn our weaknesses. It seriously took these super-intelligent aliens *years* to learn fire hurts us? Another disappointment is with the aliens themselves- octopus men. They should have gone with the greys- they're the ones associated with Roswell, after all.<br/><br/>The president (Bill Pullman) isn't always helpful- upon being told he's short on pilots, his order is ""Then find them."" He does give an inspiring speech, though. Jeff Goldblum is also good- he was also attached to two other huge money makers, Jurassic Park (1993) and its 1997 sequel The Lost World. Will Smith is the other star, and he's not bad."
"mfisher452","2","3","4","24 September 2003"," Some great special effects but not much else
","Readers of Arthur C. Clarke's classic ""Childhood's End"" will recognize the opening of this film, because that novel started in a similar way: Gigantic alien ships enter Earth's atmosphere and hover over our major cities. But oh, what a difference. Clarke's Overlords look like Satan but are a wise, kind and noble race. Under their stewardship, the human race enters a Golden Age of peace and prosperity, later to undergo a great cataclysmic transcendental transformation that foreshadows ""2001."" Too bad they couldn't be bothered to make that story but instead made this one: A lame, uninspired eco-fable with a few spectacular special effects and one or two good ideas, but basically a violent mess. (Possible spoilers) An alien race shows up in our skies. In the process, they use our communications satellites against us (apparently they can cross interstellar space but can't deploy their own satellites). Their great ships hover over our major cities (how do they know which ones are the most important? How do they know what the White House, etc., is?). After a day or two (why did they wait?), the ships activate beam weapons that destroy entire cities. In a ridiculously contrived scene, the aliens communicate telepathically with the U.S. president; this is so the audience can learn why they have come. They plan to occupy our planet, strip it of its resources (I guess we humans aren't raping our natural world aggressively enough), and then pick up and move on to the next planet of lamebrained autochthons. But a few American fighter pilots and a computer whiz team up to OUTWIT AND DEFEAT AN ENTIRE ADVANCED ALIEN RACE THAT HAS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CROSS INTERSTELLAR SPACE. Go figure.<br/><br/>Not only the basic plot is laughable; the film is also blighted by the totally illogical behavior of most of the human characters, not one of whom manages to rise above caricature. Bill Pullman plays a totally underwhelming U.S. president and the wonderful Mary McDonnell has very little to do as the First Lady except die. Judd Hirsch tries to be funny but is actually rather offensive as a Jewish alte kakker. Jeff Goldblum plays his nice Jewish son, who was once married to the ultimate Catholic shiksa (Margaret Colin) and still pines for her; she is now a presidential adviser. Will Smith's role comes closest to that of a real person; he is a fighter pilot. Viveca A. Fox is his luscious girlfriend, but you have to figure she has more mammaries than brains when she goes to her regular job as an exotic dancer with a monstrous spaceship hovering over L.A. Later on, they get married; I guess this is meant to reflect the fact that people actually have done impulsive things like get married in the middle of a war to try to prove that life goes on, or to declare their love when the husband is a soldier and is going off into mortal danger; but here it does nothing but interrupt the flow of the film. Harry Connick plays the U.S. Air Force's stupidest fighter pilot. He makes me wonder how we prevailed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Brent Spiner plays a caricature of a mad scientist who is the project leader investigating one of the aliens' fighter craft, which was THE alien spaceship that crashed in Roswell in the 1940s. Robert Loggia plays a caricature of an Air Force general. Randy Quaid plays a caricature of a burned-out alcoholic pilot who was actually abducted by the aliens during one of their scouting visits to Earth years before. He gives his life to destroy an alien spaceship in one of the film's most ludicrous scenes. And so it goes.<br/><br/>It is true that any computer can emulate any other computer, but in these days of computer literacy, most viewers of ID4 will have personally experienced compatibility problems with their PCs: Programs that won't run correctly, or at all, under their particular version of Windows, etc. Modern corporations have platoons of engineers who do nothing all day but struggle to keep their networks on line. So it stretches credibility way past the breaking point when Jeff Goldblum's character USES AN ORDINARY LAPTOP TO INFECT THE ENTIRE ALIEN COMPUTER NETWORK WITH A VIRUS THAT DEACTIVATES THEIR ENTIRE DEFENSIVE APPARATUS. I would love to have been at the story conference where they came up with that gobbler. It must have been real desperation time. Either that, or the writers have nothing but contempt for the viewers. And they must have run out of money on the pyrotechnics and had nothing left over for the alien special effects, because the aliens are astonishingly lame and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Modern CGI technology is now advanced enough that 'Childhood's End' could be successfully put on the screen. I hope that someone does so; unlike this turkey, it may actually be worth watching."

","This is a poorly written and lazy screenplay. It seems like the writer doesn't even know what to do with most of the character in the film, since he has them wandering around in every scene. If you were to turn this movie on in the middle of it, you wouldn't even be able to easily tell who is playing the President of the United States, because there is nothing presidential about them. Events in the story don't seem to make a lot of sense either, which are too numerous to list.

No one smokes in military operations anymore."
"sxfield","Null","4","6","11 February 2002"," A couple of points most reviewers seem to have overlooked.
","I wonder why Arthur C. Clarke wasn't given a nod for the idea of the scene seems to have come directly from 'Childhood's End'. I haven't read all the reviews, but it seems some points have not been addressed; for example, world unity. The world is so divided by ideologies, language, beliefs, economic conditions, currency, etc. that it would take a world-wide threat (like an alien attack or another black plague) to unify all the people. This film, shallow as it is in other respects, illustrates that. Also, this film was 'centered' in America, so the film makers naturally concentrated on America, with 'cameos' of members of other countries. I resent being told that 'the worst part of the movie was America' (see above comment about divisiveness, negativism and just plain rudeness). Obviously, I am American, but I have Swedish and English (and other) roots. I consider myself a citizen of Earth. The Earth, this little blue planet is my home. So, let's try to take that phrase 'think globally' seriously. I rather liked the movie with it's humor and special effects (I guess I'm easily entertained), and my wife always cries at the sad parts. Movies are like beauty - in the eye and ear of the beholder. It's easy to find fault with things, but much harder to find the good, the higher ground, the motivation. That's why it's easy to be a critic! Makes you wonder what kind of movies the reviewers rave over..."

Of course the Americans will save the day.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot of fun, with good special effects and a script that requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief.

The aliens are defeated by a computer virus written on an apple laptop which can overcome their own computer system. Many people say this is impossible. However think about it, the aliens have a single cohesive society (like bees or ants) so they have no computer hackers. Their computer system lacks and security.

"herbstnebel2ss","9","14","31","4 July 2004"," War of the Worlds updated.
","Upon viewing Independence Day I immediately noticed that it was basically a remake of The War of the Worlds (finally). Initially the Earth is the victim of a devastating attack by alien beings. Faced with extermination mankind forgets it's petty quarrels and unites to battle the other world invaders. As in the War of the Worlds, conventional weapons are useless and even nuclear bombs have no effect. Finally a ""virus"" helps ensure a successful outcome (as opposed to bacteria). The acting in this movie is nothing great. Character development is just so-so and stone faced Bill Pullman is a bad choice for an inspiring leader. What really makes things happen are the dazzling special effects and David Arnold's sweeping score. Roland Emmerich's fast paced directorial skill keeps the story moving in spite of the B grade acting. However Randy Quade's portrayal of a chronic alcoholic is outstanding. This seems to be a favorite role of his, to the point that he's being type cast. All in all this movie is entertaining, enjoyable, and even patriotic. I highly recommend it."

(OK, here's one: if the aliens have multiple tentacles, why did they design spaceships that can be flown with two hands?)  Great sf has *never* been about turning off your brain and not questioning the patently ridiculous.  And everything that's stupid about this movie actually serves to make the story *less* interesting (e.g., instead of having to figure out how to fly the alien  spaceships, just turn the key and go!). This movie was a big success for three reasons: it rips off some classic images from written sf (such as the immense spaceships appearing over world cities, from Arthur C. Clarke's _Childhood's End_), it has great SFX, and the good guys win.  For  many, that was enough to  overcome the putrid screenwriting.

The 50's movie had a few things going for it, such as paranoia about Soviet attack and air power, and a recent surge of interest in UFO's and the paranormal.<br/><br/>ID4, in the 90's, couldn't capitalize on those, since the Soviets were gone and UFO's were just mainstream pop-culture by now, so the filmmakers decided that they would make the film overly patriotic, practically gushing sentiment and pride, as a cheap way to attract viewers. Here's a good rule of thumb, when a movie has to appeal to ones sense of patriotism just to get you to even think about going to see it, don't go see it.<br/><br/>There are other irksome things about this movie, Will Smith's one liners, the absurd alien attack plan, the inaccuracy about Area 51(for starters Area 51 is not the airbase's official name), endless unsympathetic characters, and let's not forget the absolutely moronic way that the hero's disable the alien shields. If memory serves me, In Earth v The Flying Saucers we discover that a specific radio wave that causes the Saucer's guidance system to malfunction, while it's a leap of faith to believe that a simple radio wave can have such an amazing effect on a device designed to guide a complex spaceship across countless light-years, the thing they came up with in ID4 is absolutely unbelievable.<br/><br/>On the plus side the special effects look great, even after all these years, which alone is a good reason to at least catch the movie when it's on TV.

","This is one of my favourite movies. It is a mixture of every good (and bad) sci-fi movie of the last 50 years. I am not American, but I wanted to get up and cheer when Bill Pullman made his ""this is our Independence Day"" speech! He was great, Goldblum & Smith were brilliant, and Judd Hirsch stole the show with his ""you think they paid 100 dollars for a hammer?"" and ""Roswell - you knew then but you did nothing"".<br/><br/>Love it, love it, love it!! I have it on tape and watch it every time I'm feeling down. I agree with the comment that it should be seen on the big screen - the 1st time - after that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich is a master of suspense and I applaud him for a movie I have watched countless times in the last 10 years, and will watch again and again and again......"
"charlessmith702210","9","5","9","29 May 2006"," One lone hero saves the world from evil alien ships
","I believe that this is the best science fiction film since Close Encounters of the Third Kind and even 2001: A Space Odessey. <br/><br/>Of course, ""Independence Day"" reminds Americans about July 4---a celebratory day with plenty of fireworks---but the main fireworks were there in the flick---lots of special-effect explosions in the combat scenes between the U.S. fighter jets and the ailen ships. Big explosions, small explosions...enough to make you wonder, when the next explosion will take place, as if you are seeing a real fireworks display.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is a lot more violent than ""E.T."", but there is still a lot of extraterrestrial elements there---from the voices of the ailens---to the sounds of the small alien fighter ships and their laser shots. It seems like the big combat scenes in the flick were taken out of the famous space fights in the Star Wars movies--particularly the ""Return of the Jedi"".<br/><br/>There was one scene where authorities were trying to establish communication with the alien ships...It may not be the famous 5 notes-- B-flat, C, A-flat, A-flat an octave lower, and E-flat, like in ""Close Encounters"".....but it was through the help of a helicopter code-named ""Welcome Wagon"", which showed a visual type of communication through its light panels.<br/><br/>You may have heard about the Japanese kamikaze pilots who crash their planes into Allied battleships in World War II, but this is what character Russell Casse does to completely destroy the monster ailen spaceship. Finding out that his fighter jet's missile failed......he decides to give up his life to save mankind....by going right into the path of the deadly laser beam in the center of the spaceship....with the failed yet armed bomb in it. The way the bomb blew up the whole ship seems like that bomb was a nuclear one. Sort of an unusual suicide mission for that character, isn't it?"

","Roland Emmerich is undoubtedly a very skilled director who knows how to please the crowd. This movie has several good points and a few bad points which can be easily overlooked.

This piece of cinematic garbage is filled with inconsistencies and scientific snafus (and one teeny tiny computer bug: how can an Apple Mac communicate with an alien server, even though the aliens use a TOTALLY different language and protocol? Jeff Goldblum should have gotten a busy signal!) Another really bad science bug is when the alien screamed, even though Brent Spiner (notwithstanding his lousy Data image) declared it free of vocal chords. Perhaps the saddest parts of the movie come out when Will Smith tries to be funny. All in all, it stinks!"
"FloatingOpera7","10","8","17","15 May 2006"," Films Of The 90's: Independence Day
","Independence Day (1996): Starring Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, Vivica A. Fox, Harry Connick Jr, Harvey Fierstein, Margaret Colin, Mary McDonnell, Robert Loggia, James Duval, Brent Spiner....Director Roland Emmerich, Screenplay Dean Devlin Released in the summer of 1996 to correspond with July 4th, Independence Day, this was a box-office blockbuster and a document in films of the 1990's. Initially, I was repulsed by the commercials and previews for it and despite all the hype surrounding it (everyone who was ages 13-30's and fans of sci-fi thrillers at this time kept raving about it)I didn't see it. Not until it was released on video (yes video not DVD) did I finally see it and appreciate it for the exciting if unlikely story and the special effects, attractive characters, music, stunning cinematography and the overall ""feel-goodness"" of it all. Predatory, heartless aliens invade the earth and destroy pre-9/11 New York City and other parts of the US and the world, and humans fight back on Independence Day and beat the aliens. This was a time, we must remember, when the X-Files was on TV, as well as Millennium and when interest in aliens and end of the world prophecies were rampant, especially because the year 2000 was approaching. Remember the looney Heaven's Gate cult consisting of seemingly normal middle-class Americans who left families, trust funds, identities and renounced their current life in order to be picked up by a spaceship and instead committed group suicide ? If this film had been released after 9/11 the aliens would be a stand-in for terrorists. Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller is delivering the kind of action-hero role he has for the most part performed and is enjoyable nonetheless. Vivica A. Fox as a stripper/mother is another fine role, though she, like all the women in this film, take backseats and it's the men who save the day. Especially good are Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum, as a Jewish father and son Julius and David who constantly bicker but prove resourceful and valiant in mankind's darkest hour. Margaret Colin as Constance ""Connie"" Spano, a beautiful, strong-willed President's Secretary and David's love interest is also doing a fine job. Not to mention Bill Pullman as the President, portraying the President as tough and ready to put his own life on the line. Yes, his wife the First Lady (Mary McDonnel) dies, and his Presidency seems to be under mostly Republican attack (like Bill Clinton who adored this movie) but he proves heroic and fights the aliens with his fighter jet, something President Bush would never think twice about. Overall, there is a sense of patriotism and humanity in this film, expanding beyond American love of country but in a sort of Many People, One Planet sort of way, and truth be told, should aliens threaten the earth, humans would set aside their religious, political rivalries and unite in a common cause. Randy Quaid as ex-World War II pilot Russell Casse, another hero, is superb. Harry Connick Jr and Harvey Feinstein make appearances - Harry Connick as Steve's army buddy Captain Jimmy Wilder and Harvey Feinstein as Marty, David's other Jewish (and gay though we don't get too much gay from him) friend who panics, worries about his mother and dies in a firestorm in his car as the Empire State Building collapses. Far from being a movie which only relies on everything being blown up and military planes battle alien ships, this is a movie with a lot of poignant and genuinely moving human moments, even leaving room for good humor. Roland Emmerich established himself as a master of this kind of epic adventure film. He would later film ""Godzilla"" in 1998 to lesser success as that film pales by comparison, but he made up for it in 2004's well-made ""Day After Tomorrow""."

"moviesleuth2","10","6","12","22 April 2010"," The Ultimate Summer Action Movie...Period.
","This is it. The penultimate summer action movie. Car's don't explode, they fly 50 feet away. Buildings don't fall down, they get incinerated. And if that's not enough, New York doesn't just get busted up, it gets leveled...along with every other major city in the world.<br/><br/>There's only one guy ballsy enough to make this movie, and that's Roland Emmerich. ""Big"" just doesn't cut it. Nor does ""epic,"" for that matter. You have to at least admire a guy that completely skips on the kitchen sink and instead throws in New York, Los Angeles, The Presidency, and a space ship that's a quarter the size of our moon. Now THAT'S what I'm talking' about!<br/><br/>Of course, it helps tremendously that ""Independence Day"" is immensely entertaining. The action, of which there is plenty, is exciting, and there are more one-liners than there are fingers and toes of you and the person sitting next to you. And, oh yeah, don't forget the creepy aliens.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story stars on July 3, when radar picks up a signal coming from the moon. Then, after introducing us to the surprisingly vast array of characters, the alien ships show up. And they're not looking to become your next door neighbor. So after causing massive destruction, a few stragglers gather together to bring them down.<br/><br/>Yes, that's vastly oversimplifying things. But for a movie that has so much going on, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do: provide eye-popping action, and a good few laughs along the way. Nothing seems to be left out, and there aren't any glaring mistakes.<br/><br/>The cast is made up of a few well known faces and a surprising amount of character actors. All of them do their job extremely well. Of them, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman can be considered the ""main"" characters. Will Smith is one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, and it's not hard to see why. He has more range than is often recognized, and his screen appeal is undeniable. He also has considerable comic skill (after all, he was the star of one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV). His performance as fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller is among his best performances. Jeff Goldblum is once again playing a geek, but unlike ""Jurassic Park,"" Goldblum's David Levinson is not an egotistical jerk. He has solid chemistry with his co-stars, specifically Smith, and his father, Julius (well-played by Judd Hirsch). Bill Pullman is the weakest of the three, although that's hardly a damning statement. He acquits himself well enough amidst the surrounding talent, and never fades into the background (which he has done in other roles). The smaller roles are made up of recognizable faces, including Randy Quaid as an alcoholic pilot (played with the off-the-wall panache that only Randy Quaid can give), Mary McDonnell as the First Lady, Robert Loggia as a general, Vivica A. Fox as Hiller's stripper girlfriend, Margaret Colin as a Presidential aide (and David's ex). Cameos by Harvey Fierstein as David's co-worker and Brent Spiner as an off-the-wall scientist are also good. But special mention has to go to Harry Connick, Jr. as Jimmy Wilder, Hiller's best friend. Connick is electrifying, and often steals scenes from Smith (something that is quite difficult).<br/><br/>This is summer fun, and Emmerich knows this. There's never a moment where it takes itself very seriously (even though there are a few times where the opportunity arises). Critics weren't very approving of this movie, and you know what? It doesn't matter. This is not an artistic movie of any sort. It's plain and simply entertaining."

"thesar-2","8","4","7","4 September 2010"," ID4ever will watch this movie
","First impressions rarely let me down. Rarely.<br/><br/>Picture it, way back in 1996, Cine Capri in Phoenix, AZ, I first watched Independence Day andhated it. I went with two buddies, one of which said afterwards that it was realistic portrayal of the aliens. I said, ""In movies? Or (pointing) up there?"" He confirmed he meant from above. Sheesh. Eh, to each his/her own, but I didn't (at the time) find anything realistic about it.<br/><br/>It was the second time I saw this, however, that grabbed me and opened my eyes to the best big-budget-B-movie ever made up to that point. And that's exactly what it is: a B-Movie with a Budget. It took elements from practically every MST3k-mocked mid-20th Century alien invasion story, but added the element of excessive funds.<br/><br/>Further review of this movie, it also added hilarious lines, decent acting and state-of-the-art (EVEN by today's standards, 14 years later) special effects. So, you must know, this is the ultimate leave-your-brain at the door movie. Sit back and have a roaring time.<br/><br/>Impatient people do not have to wait long for the movie to kick-start what it's here for; the alien mother ship makes it's ""Star Wars"" entrance seconds into the feature and all hell breaks loose first in the US government, but then the world as smoky-fire clouds reveal the ""baby"" 15-mile-wide ships over the world.<br/><br/>Bam! Start the soap opera list of stars from various parts of the US. We've already met Constance (Colin) and President Whitmore (Pullman) in D.C. but then there's his First Lady Marilyn (McDonnell) in L.A. who shares the city with couple Steven (Smith) and Jasmine. NYC holds David (Goldlum) and Dad (Hirsch) – not to mention the hilarious Marty (Fierstein) who, instinctively cares for his mother and lawyer. For good measure, throw in crazy Russell (Quaid) who, not to really spoil anything, acts like Cartman from South Park episode one. There'll be more, but, I believe the movie revolves around this already extended cast.<br/><br/>Unlike most disaster/end-of-the-world films, this is the best cast ever assembled in this particular genre. Unfortunately, even though I really did like the actors and their characters and felt the chemistry was perfect, that statement isn't saying much. Take Director/Producer/Writer Emmerich, since he happened to direct this one. Three of his follow-ups had so many big names and so many disappointments that I hardly cared enough about them to mind if they perished prior to the big and clichéd finales. 2012, 1998's Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow were all sub-par to painful and each and every character was so one-dimensional and thoughtless, we lost a lot of what those movies were all about: hope.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the other Emmerich comrade, Michael Bay, and his terrible list of both movies and assemble of way below average characters: Pearl Harbor, Transformers 1-2, The Island and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010.) (Personally, I didn't like Armageddon, but at least he had one-two worth rooting for in that disaster film.)<br/><br/>At any rate, I loved the characters in Independence Day, but the true stars of the film was the special effects and tongue-in-cheek dialogue. After you get to know the different personality and employments of the actors, the rest of the movie is a just plain roller-coaster of aliens trying to eliminate us, humans failing at eliminating them, an actually plausible and believable love story and, of course, the kick-ass, though obvious FIGHT-BACK finale that does NOT disappoint for a single second.<br/><br/>I'm a score-man. I love a beautiful and relevant instrumental background music track, and this movie's got a great one by David Arnold. It's not only action-packed and has elements of perfect Sci-Fi moments, but the number one quality it had was: HOPE. The movie centers around humans (FINALLY) banding together, putting way ""petty differences"" (LOVE THAT LINE) as spoken by the President in a great motivational and human speech, and the hope we have to survive. Truly, I love a score that through no spoken words, speaks tons for the movie, and mood, at hand.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned how I liked the cast, but I'd like to focus in on some of my favorites. Back in the mid-1990s, it was unquestionable that the summers belonged to WILL SMITH. Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black, heck, even some unfortunate fools went to see Wild, Wild, West. Personally, I like when he actually acts and not just play ""Will Smith"" but here he's at the top of his ""Hey, I'm Will Smith"" game.<br/><br/>Further, I'm a fan of Jeff Goldblum, and you kinda have to be, to like him here. He's also playing his signature ""Hey, I'm JeffuhuhGoldblum"" role. He was hilarious, smart and I liked his true desire to use his talents to solve the little alien invasion problem.<br/><br/>Mixed these two together, meaning Goldbulm's David and Smith's Steven, finally, and towards the end of the movie, it was heaven. They played off each other; two complete strangers who could both bounce off each other with 100% separate personalities, but had extreme chemistry. You almost wonder what took the movie so long to get them together.<br/><br/>Finally, just plain see this movie, if you haven't already. It's extremely fun and even better on a big screen. In fact, this movie has been used in one of my long-standing arguments whenever I hear someone say ""Oh, I'll just wait for video."" Like Twister, Independence Day looks just, well, so small when you watch it on the television. Picture how threatening a 15-MILE-WIDE (TV Series) ""V""-shaped ship hovers over the cities as seen in the movie theater and then do the same for a 7 inch spacecraft on your TV and tell me this one was ""worth"" the wait for video."
"KillerLord","10","4","7","29 September 2008"," A Beautiful Action Flick!
","Many people seem to have a problem with this picture. Some people do not like it because it is an action movie. Some people do not like it because it takes a well established, tried and tested plot of hostile aliens, rather than the friendly alien like ET. Some people have a problem because of the eventual method that is used by one of the lead characters of the movie in order to bring down the defense system of the aliens. But I do not find any of this too objectionable to down rate this movie as much as I have seen it has been. <br/><br/>The story starts with alien space ships taking strategic positions across the various major cities of the world. We see an amazing effect of the city being engulfed by the shadow of the mammoth space ship hovering over it. And then, people are divided in opinions about the intention of these spaceships. Of course, it is clear from the kind of positions the ships take that the intentions are more hostile than friendly. But yet people literally throw a welcoming party for the aliens and of course pay a price for it. Some of these things have led to severe criticism from many viewers and critics. But let us put these aside for a while and see what happens next. The alien ship fires an incredibly powerful weapon that leaves the city in wreck. The sound and sight of this destruction is the strength of the movie. The movie is about war and it is war that this movie shows beautifully. <br/><br/>And the next thing you have is an attempt by the best fighter planes trying to take the ship out. But they realize that there is a computerized shield that protects the ship. The movie follows through and finally shows the computer wizard realizing that a computer virus can disable the ship's shields for enough time so as to allow an obliteration of the ships. Again, many people have criticized this. Well, the argument goes that a civilization so advanced could not be weak enough for a virus. But there are many things we do not know about this civilization. Let us not forget that it our tendency to think in a certain way that eventually led to the creation of viruses. Did the aliens think in the same way? Mostly not! Thoughts, ideas and civilization, in general, would have advanced completely differently for them and they surely would not have even heard of a computer virus. So, I personally feel that this idea is not as bad as people are calling it. <br/><br/>For smooth fight sequences and computer graphics, this movie is in a different league altogether. I cannot think of a better way of doing all the action sequences. Critics may argue that there are loop holes in the plot and yes, some of these loop holes are strong enough to ensure the movie does not go down in cinematic history, but I still would like to give it a ten on ten for I have found the merits overwhelmingly more striking than the demerits. A beautiful action movie indeed!"

","Well, I can't honestly give this film a good review despite being a fan of Will Smith (well, he can be very annoying at times though and is better suited to other films) and Goldblum. The actors in it are not my favourites and this combined with what appeared to very bad acting really ruined the film for me. Bill Pullman, Robert Loggia and Adam Baldwin were absolutely awful. Was it just bad directing or just simply bad acting? Bill Pullman acted like he was in a comedy. His face expressions hilarious at times. I mean does he ever know when to put a serious face even at the thought the earth is about to end? I mean what was going on in his head? What was going on in the Director's head more importantly as this has some of the worse acting I have ever seen in a film. As for the story line, the thought of a virus being uploaded to a revolutionary alien ship like this was so unrealistic it made me laugh. What did they use again, a floppy disk? Is their security firewall that lame? Seriously? Who writes this crap? I could have walked out of the cinema at that point alone had it not been for some really good special effects which was the only factor to grab my attention. As for a single missile destroying a giant UFO that would kill an entire city if was to collapse on the earth, I don't think much thought went into the ending. I also like how Will Smith can just to fly an alien spaceship. I mean, is he from the matrix? Watchable for the special effects only. Everything else was a let down and I mean a serious let down. Now I like blockbuster films with special effects as much as anyone but it still needs to be believable and also well acted. This lacks this."
"rebeljenn","3","4","7","30 December 2005"," Silly, annoying, unrealistic
","'Independence Day' is a science-fiction thriller starring Will Smith in the role that made him famous. Regarded highly after its cinema release, the film's reputation now seems to have taken a turn for the worse. The film is patriotic in the annoying sense, and Will Smith's character is annoying as he battles the aliens and becomes an outspoken hero. It's also got those cheesy scenes - people and pets avoiding ultimate doom and somehow, miraculously surviving the destruction. In fact, 'Independence Day' is just another take on Wells' 'War of the Worlds', but it's America at the forefront of this disaster, which happens on its day of independence. I never enjoyed the film and thought it was a little long to sit through, but everyone else seemed to like it. I've noticed, however, that it seems to have lost its audience. If you like thrillers and liked the most recent version of 'War of the Worlds', then I think you may like this film."

There is a stereotype to basically insult everyone. From Jeff Goldblum's nerd with the great right hand. ( He punched out the president) To Harry Connick, Jr as the dumb cajun ( shoulda had little x's on his eyelids).Randy Quaid as the hopelessly drunk Vietnam Vet. Viveca Fox is a stripper. Harvey Firestein as the gay Jewish guy with a mother fixation. Will Smith as a fighter jock who talks like a car jacker wants to be an astronaut but lives with a stripper? Where's Al Sharpton when you need him? And what were they thinking when they brought the First Lady back from the grave so she could die in front of her daughter. There isn't a level that the movie isn't a collection of ethnic insults; if you think about it. The movie wasn't made to be thought about it was made to enjoy.

","Independence Day is one of the few Sci-Fi movies that I really like. The main reason for that is because there is a certain amount of humor in it thanks to Will Smith. Not everything the man has ever done works perfectly (I really didn't like ""Wild Wild West"" for instance), but in this movie he is more than OK.<br/><br/>A few days before Independence Day, a signal is received from outer space and large objects are spotted on a collision course with planet earth. At first everybody thinks they are dealing with meteorites, but soon they find out that these are actually alien aircrafts. Of course they try to make contact with the aliens, believing that they aren't hostile, but as their attempts don't get any response, a scientist finds out that the aliens are positioning themselves on strategic places, ready to destroy the human race. They almost succeed, but the few survivors that are left, will fight back and do everything possible to destroy the alien war crafts...<br/><br/>If there is anything bad I can say about this movie than it must be the obvious and overdone American patriotism that can be found in this movie. Nothing else really bothered me. I liked the special effects, the humor was nice, the story more than OK and the acting was very good. Overall I enjoyed this movie and I don't really understand why it gets such a low rating on IMDb. Personally I give this movie a 7.5/10."
"helix-2","Null","7","15","21 March 1999"," ID4-It really happened...In Mexico, 1519.
","I'm actually pleased at the two sided conflict this visually enjoyable but otherwise uneven presentation of a very interesting subject matter (alien invasion) has inspired. Though I don't agree with them, I'm not suprised at the resentment many non-American nationals felt about the films patriotic theme. I also don't feel that ID4 was meant to be mindless drivel. It's excellent first half was followed by a weak second half simply because there wasn't enough time left to set up an equally perfect ending.<br/><br/>We must remember that H.G. Wells wrote ""War of the Worlds"" as a commentary on British Imperialism. In other words, he wanted to give his society a vicarious taste of its own medicine. Many ID4 critics dismissed the film as mindless, flag waving claptrap. But did anyone notice the disturbing parallels between this movie and the Spanish Conquest of Mexico? In ID4 giant ships carrying an alien race armed with horrifying weaponry approach the great cities of the world. The leadership of these countries is indecisive on what to do. Some advise attack. Otherwise insist on waiting. Meanwhile, the lesser countries appear unaffected by the invasion. (i.e., Southern Hemisphere Unaffected was seen on a t.v. broadcast early in the film) Before we know it. The Alien Visitors are upon us. And waste our cities. In Mexico, 1519, large unusual ships appear in the eastern horizon. Panic and awe engulf the populace. The alien visitors are tall, white skinned, have hairy faces and terrifying weapons. They ride monstrous looking dragons (horses) and are accompanied by giant, viscious dogs (staghounds. In Mexico at that time, the chihuahua was the biggest dog. And most ferocious, too) They appear invincible. As they approach the great city of Tenochtitlan they align themselves with subjected nations (Tlaxcala, Totonacs, etc). The native leader Montezuma doesn't know what to do. Attack? Surrender? Negotiate?<br/><br/>One scene in ID4 moved me. The fear and awe inspired by the arrival of the awesome alien ships.<br/><br/>Bernal Diaz, a journalist accompanying Cortez, wrote of the silent awe, fear and fascination displayed by the thousands of  Aztecs lining the road and every rooftop as the Spaniards, clad in metal armor which rattled like an enormous inhuman machine, marched into their doomed city."

I can not believe it was even nominated for a golden raspberry award. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I do not think it should have been nominated for that award.

","When I first heard of this movie, I was fairly interested. It does have a great cast and it looked good. But I was disappointed. Granted, I do not think it is Roland Emmerich's worst film, but it is far from his best either(that's The Day after Tomorrow and even that was pretty uneven). The film does look great though, the special effects are very good and the scenery and cinematography are also excellent. David Arnold's score is also serviceable, with some interesting song choices, and the ending is quite explosive. However, the dialogue on the most part is very cheesy and forced, the story is shallow and incomprehensible and the direction is murky. Also the film is much too long, and it doesn't help that the pace is uneven. The acting, despite this great cast, is not good, they all try hard but they can't do anything with the dialogue and with Emmerich fighting them every step of the way it is no wonder. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith but he has done some stuff I like, however he overdoes it here and his character for some reason annoys me. Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum are great actors, but their characters are shallow and Goldblum especially should have had more to do. Overall, not terrible, but it is a case of the special effects overshadowing pretty much everything else. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"TheUnknown837-1","9","5","10","28 August 2010"," My definition of an energetic, old-fashioned summer popcorn flick
","Even though it is packed full of conventions, stereotypes, and clichés of the science-fiction genre and its detractors are right in calling it old-fashioned and dopey, ""Independence Day"" is actually a terrific feel-good popcorn flick from Roland Emmerich and Dead Devlin, the Hollywood cognoscenti for the genre. These two filmmakers love the popcorn movie genre, as they have stated numerous times and proved even more times with their pictures. None of their movies, from ""Independence Day"" to ""Godzilla"" to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" to the more recent ""2012"" were created with the intention of being taken seriously. They are continuing the tradition of the silly disaster films from the 70s and occasionally the silly science-fiction flicks of the 50s. Their superlative film is ""Independence Day,"" the box office champ of 1996 that started a broad interest in aliens as bloodthirsty war-mongers again.<br/><br/>The cast is populated by a wide variety of Hollywood talents perfectly matched to the stereotypes written in the screenplay. Bill Pullman is the weary-eyed, weary-voiced president of the United States; Will Smith is the smart-mouthed fighter pilot ready to kick some alien tail while shelling out punch lines, Jeff Goldblum is the nerdy but smart TV cable man who figures out before everybody else that the aliens are going to attack, his ostensibly Jewish father is played by Judd Hirsch, and Randy Quaid is the drunken, delusional crop duster pilot who claims he once had a close encounter before.<br/><br/>The aliens in the movie are even less original, having been pulled off the shelf of the creatures from the 1950s. The only real update is that they've now been generated using modern-day special effects and not puppets, men in suits, and stop-motion animation. Their ships are also a very good visual achievement, and the sight of a 15-mile wide flying saucer hovering over L.A. looks really darn cool.<br/><br/>You would think by the way I've been pointing out stereotypes in my review that I didn't think too terribly much of ""Independence Day"" and that it was too clichéd for me to praise or recommend. You would think wrong. This is just my style of reviews; I point out the good and the bad in every movie I see.<br/><br/>So you want to hear what I liked about ""Independence Day."" Three words: it was fun. Three more words: it's a popcorn movie. Four words now: I *love* popcorn movies! This is the type of movie that if done wrong can be dreadfully boring, but if done right, as here, then is sheer entertainment. Sure, we've seen the like of a movie like this before in terms of substance. And it most certainly is a movie with style over substance. Of course ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are better movies because their substance is more prominent than their style. But admit it, every now and then you are in the hankering for a good, old-fashioned flick. Sometimes those kitschy black-and-white films really fill in the void for you. So therefore, I see nothing wrong with continuing this tradition using a bigger budget and modern technology.<br/><br/>Another reason why ""Independence Day"" works is that it enthusiastically embraces its kitschy charm. Every single moment of it is played for visual spectacle or an old-fashioned charm or gag. And this stereotyping in the cast is repetitive, but it's used in a way where it is amusing, not offensive. Take Will Smith's character, for example. Even though he is just playing the same mentality of his beloved character from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" (they seldom let him do anything else, after all) he brings a lot of charm and screen charisma to his performance. In the hands of a lesser actor, this role might have come across as annoying. But Smith is such a great performer that he makes it work. Randy Quaid is also in prime for as a deliberately comical drunk with a heart. And his final scene in the movie has deservedly gone on to become famous.<br/><br/>And Roland Emmerich is very good at handling special effects sequences. There are numerous highly implausible moments, such as a fighter pilot maneuvering through a canyon while fighting off miniature UFOs, but the directing and the pacing is so tight that you don't stop to really nitpick over it, but embrace it. If there had been more dead air, you would have no choice but to stop and gripe.<br/><br/>And unfortunately a lot of people do stop and gripe throughout the film. But even though I do enjoy this movie enormously, I can acknowledge and understand their points. This is the kind of movie you will either welcome and love for what it is or detest and scorn for what it is. As a summer popcorn movie flooded with enthusiasm and testosterone, I think it does its job most commendably. Roland Emmerich has made some really good popcorn flicks, but this is his best one."

","On Independence Day, alien spacecrafts have appeared all over the world. No one knows why they're here, or what their purpose is...they're just hanging out in the air. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers the truth...the aliens are planning one major attack on the entire Earth at once. Unfortunately, no one believes him except for his father (Judd Hirsch). David makes his way to Washington, where his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) works for the President (Bill Pullman). Meanwhile, Captain Steven Miller (Will Smith) is having problems with his commonlaw girlfriend, Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her choice of work. She has a son from a previous relationship, and Steven acts like the boy's own father. He gets called to service to see what is going on with these alien ships. David is able to reach the President literally minutes before the attack commences. Soon all the major world cities are attacked at once, and it seems like the Earth is doomed.<br/><br/>By far this is one of the best alien movies to come around in recent memory. The acting is excellent, the effects are amazing (especially for coming out in 1996), and the action is palpable. ""Independence Day"" is everything a true moviegoer seeks to find, and delivers."
"cosmic_quest","8","5","10","21 October 2007"," Clichéd but in a fun way
","I have to admit that, as far as Hollywood blockbusters go, 'Independence Day' has always been a favourite. The film starts on July 2nd, when the planet is thrown into chaos when number of alien starships enter the atmosphere and settle into orbit over various key cities worldwide before launching a devastating attack. Survivors-- including the American President and his staff, an Air Force pilot and his girlfriend, a drunk and his three kids and the cable repair man/genius who first discovered the aliens' intent-- congregated at a secret facility at Area 51 then on July 4th, they launch their counterattack.<br/><br/>The characters were stereotypical but the actors, including Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch and Robert Loggia, all gave decent performances despite the cheesy dialogue they were sometimes lumbered with. Even then, the 'good' characters were all likable enough and you wanted to see the good guys strive through and win (unlike Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' where I wished someone would just dish the main characters up to the aliens) while the token difficult, arrogant politician played for 'boos' with good effect.<br/><br/>In terms of the storyline, it was predictable and, at times, sugary but it was fun! It has everything from action to romance to humour to drama and even handled death with some degree of poignancy, and all this before the standard geeky character saves the world using the 1996 version of HG Wells' virus idea. The special effects used for destruction of the cities were impressive, even eleven years on, as was those used to depict the combat between the American planes and the aliens. It was quite breathtaking when I saw it in the cinema back in '96.<br/><br/>The main complaint about 'Independence Day' seems to be over the depiction of Americans saving the world. As a Briton myself, I do find the idea that every other country would sit back and expect America to save us a tad idiotic, not to mention I like to think the majority of mature Americans don't need to be spoon-fed patriotism, but you can't expect deep thought from a blockbuster. And the President's nauseating Independence Day speech was good for a laugh.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun film that was the first to update the whole 'disaster' flick genre. Don't nitpick but just kick back and enjoy."

The only thing I didn't like about Independence Day was that there wasn't enough of the aliens; in fact, I don't think there was much at all which is bizarre. All I could see was alien spaceships, and I think there is a difference. Also, there was barely much information on who those aliens were, where they were from, and how they knew about us. If only the movie gotten those things right, Independence Day would've been far greater than it already is. But I have to admit, those spaceships were so cool, big and scary-looking. It's these spaceships that make this movie enjoyable to watch. I really liked the scene where one of the spaceship just disintegrates an entire building in mere seconds with all these people on top. The cast was great too especially Will Smith. He was what made this movie a success. He's one of the main reasons I watched this movie, and why I particularly enjoyed it. The movie was fine all the way throughout, but I wouldn't say the part towards the end was as good as the beginning or middle.

","Roland Emmerich certainly loaded this movie with astonishing special effects, and set something of a demolition standard. The infernos released by the alien vessels upon various landmark buildings are really quite stupendous. <br/><br/>But - oh-dear - what a wretched, predictable (and arrogant) piece of ham it is in just about every other department. I lost count of the number of gaping stares the camera lingered upon. I likewise lost count of the number of clichÃ©d comments in a script that was surely written by a committee composed of those adolescents who wear their baseball caps back-to-front, call each other 'dude', and conveniently possess IQ's that can be measured on a clinical thermometer. <br/><br/>It was clearly intended as a 'God Bless America' movie, as implied by the title, and though I've no problem with yanks slapping themselves on the back from time to time, this was just a little too blatant for good taste. <br/><br/>I'm going to risk accusations of anti-semitism here and suggest that the subtext for this work was 'American Jews save the world for an ungrateful humanity'. We have a Jewish scientist (played by Jewish Goldblum). He and he alone solves the riddle of alien invasion methodology. He and his arrogant Jewish father manage to secure seats on Airforce One, where this father goes about reminding everyone how his son has saved them all. Later, Goldblum is sent to the alien mothership where he manages to foul-up their computers with a virus. After that it's gung-ho all the way. Brains can be safely left behind.<br/><br/>There is one particularly offensive scene in which the father is attempting to induct a group of people into a Jewish ceremony. One person declines, remarking 'actually I'm not Jewish' to which this Zionist bigot responds 'Well, nobody's perfect.' It's supposed to be funny. And to those building illegal settlements in Palestine; it probably is. Yet I cannot imagine any other religion in which such a comment would have been allowed to pass unchecked. Certainly if the refusenik had been Jewish and had received a similar discourtesy, the movie would never have gained release. It's Jewish backers in Hollwood would have made damn sure of that (not that its Jewish Producers and Directors would have included it in the first place). Whereas if this slighted individual he'd been Muslim, There would likely have been demonstrations and death threats. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants however can have their feelings abused with impunity. <br/><br/>The other people to feature favourably are both of Afro-Caribbean race. Will Smith plays a preposterously gung-ho fighter pilot, stuffing it to the aliens, whilst his wife engages in civilian heroics on the ground. Together, they form a kind of ethnic apologia. They may be black, but they're still useful.<br/><br/>The US president is unfortunately still Christian (well; no nation's perfect), and interestingly he experiences a telepathic event with a captured alien, in which he describes them as a plague of locusts that go about the universe, using up resources wherever they can be found. That selfishness alone apparently justifies their extermination, though his insight might just as easily be a description of humankind. As HG Wells once asked in his War Of The Worlds with reference to our treatment of other terrestrial species: 'Are we such paragons of mercy...?'<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, these aliens are depicted as ugly, violent, smelly, and ruthless - almost as bad as Christians. No emphasis is given to their considerable scientific and technological superiority, or the fact that they appear to function as a harmonious people. They're messing with God's children on God's own Earth, and that makes them pariahs. No prizes for guessing who sees themselves as the new master race.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for people with brains, let alone morals or conscience. It's a shoot-'em-up of the most banal and tasteless nature. It appeals to the worst instincts and bigotries of the narrow-minded whilst masquerading as a nationalist set-piece. <br/><br/>Frankly; in every other faculty than that of special-effects - it stinks."

","I don't care what anyone says about this movie and how fake it was. So what, it's a movie about aliens destroying earth...the whole plot is fake to begin with...well so far. heh But seriously. This movie rocks! The characters were wonderful and the comedy was unforgettable. I wish to god they would make an ID4-2. But I doubt it will happen just like I doubt Mad Max 4 will ever happen. But this movie was just a great fun filled ride. Yeah a lot was bull like the virus and the crop duster gone F-18 but that is what makes a movie a ""MOVIE"". If it was meant to be real at every turn then there would not be a movie at all. In fact you would cancel out more than 75% of movies in the world. Will, Jeff and everyone in this movie made it the best movie I have seen in a long time and that I still love to this day of 2007. And now I have a wonderful movie to show my daughter. :) Thanks Will and Jeff!"

","Yes, this is a bad movie.  Yes, it was the start of several similar movies like it where there is no story and just a lot of special effects.  Yes, the ""plot"" makes no sense and seems like something a 5 year old would come up with.  There is also cheesy dialog that only Titanic can match- another flashy dud.  I still can't bring myself to label this as ""the worst movie I have ever seen"".  Why not?  Because it is, in some ways, refreshingly different.  It also has, despite what everyone else says, some originality if you put the clothes-pin on your nose look closely enough at this stinker. <br/><br/>If you see this after the World Trade Center attack, you'll see people coming together in the face of adversity...just like they do when they are faced with overwhelming odds against them.  I had seen this back in 1996 and thought that it was unrealistic that people of all different backgrounds and races/classes pull together and help each other in spite of their differences.  It turns out I was wrong because that is exactly what happened on 9/11/01.  The U.S. military are not the bad guys, for a change.  The main characters are not believable, but they are awesome role models for our young people.  I think that's great!  There is a minimum of profanity or sex either, which is a welcome change.<br/><br/>I'm going to go out on a limb here and probably offend a lot of people, but I thought this movie came at just the right time for the USA.  We didn't have a good role model, IMHO, as a leader, so it was refreshing to see a too-good-to-be-true leader as a president in a movie.<br/><br/>Despite these good points, it is still a mess of a movie with an awful plot and terrible dialog.  Still, there is a silver lining to every cloud...4/10"

Sincerely, I can't believe it. And nowadays there are lots of films in this same style, I mean, with lots of money spent in the technical aspects of the film and horrible screenplay and/or actors.<br/><br/>Is it perhaps that they knew that people would like the result? Is it perhaps that I'm wrong and most people really like that trash...?<br/><br/>Or is it perhaps that they thought that the film was too horrifying that they had to include comic elements to make it a lighter horror film...?<br/><br/>Maybe there is no explanation at all, but in any case I think they failed in their intentions whatever they were.<br/><br/>5-6 out of 10 (just for the effects)."

","This movie might possibly hold the record for IMDb reviewers calling it the worst movie of all time. Wow! Obviously those folks have never seen ""The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot"" or ""Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell"", a couple of sci-fi flicks that would immediately vault this film into the ranks of early 'Star Wars' territory. Personally I didn't think the film was that bad, in fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I was thinking along the lines of the same year's ""Mars Attacks"" which truly was deplorable. <br/><br/>That's not to say that the film didn't have it's share of problems. Someone thought it would be a pretty good idea to put a delusional drunk (Randy Quaid) and a sitting U.S. President (Bill Pullman - what!?!?) into the cockpit of a fighter jet to wage war against a massive alien strike force! Really?!?! And the computer virus idea while sounding good on paper doesn't quite square against the advanced alien technology that would have brought the invasion into Earth's atmosphere. Uh-oh, it sounds like I might be joining the naysayers on this one if I keep on thinking this through.<br/><br/>But I did like the early reference to 1951's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". However in that one, the aliens offered us Earthlings a chance to redeem ourselves from the self destructive path humanity was on, while here, the foreigners weren't going to give us even half a fighting chance. The picture's special effects and cinematography were pretty sensational for 1996, and the concept of bringing the planet's inhabitants together seeking common ground against the alien invaders was a brief feel good moment even if a fleeting one. And if you're feeling nostalgic, Randy Quaid's kamikaze attack on the mother ship echoed that famous scene in 'Dr. Strangelove' where Slim Pickens rode that bucking bronco joyride to Armageddon in all of it's patriotic glory. Oh yeah, take that you nasty aliens!"

So it went under your skin and stayed there without prejudice. Also, all the nations of the world agree to help Earth against a common enemy. It stays that on Earth we are one race, the Human Race.

I can't believe so many people went to see this film, and I absolutely can't believe that some people actually thought it was a great story. Sure, the special FX are good, but not THAT good. Summer action movies should be exciting AND interesting to watch. This one is almost painful to endure. Finally, What is this fascination that Americans have for tough-guy, real macho, butt-kicking, U.S. Presidents? In this movie (and in Air Force One) we witness the President flying fighter planes (or punching terrorists) and giving the bad guys what they deserve. Oh, Please!

","This is an awesome movie. It is brilliantly executed, well thought out. It has action, quite a sense of humour, entertaining, and suspense and tension. It is a real fun watch. And has great special effects.
It also has great character development - Russell Case (Randy Quaid) when he first appears in the film, is a drunkard and irresponsible, even though he has three children, one of whom is ill. He is also a widower and was kidnapped by aliens and experimented on ten years prior to the story's start. During the coarse of the film, he starts taking care of his children more and begins being a father to them. During the climax, he sacrifices his life to destroy the flying saucer.
There is also the personal story between David Levinson and Constance, his ex-wife. They had divorced three years before the start of the film as Constance believed that David was not 'ambitious enough' and wanted her 'life to mean something' by going to work at the White House. During the course of the film, they slowly reconcile and by the end of it, they get back together.
The cast is excellent and their acting is solid. I personally think that Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch are the best of the cast, though all the cast were excellent.
It is a marvelous film, and I generally do not get into or like alien movies. What really appeals to me is that the aliens are portrayed as evil, not as some 'friendly we are here to help humanity' creatures, which is annoying and painful. One of Emmerich's best movies! I recommend watching it!"
"bowmanblue","7","1","1","4 December 2017"," It is what it is
","I watched 'Independence Day' back in 1995 during the 'height' of the X-files-induced 'alien fever' that was so prominent in popular culture that even the President of America at the time had to address the world and point out that the Government wasn't really stashing away bodies of little grey men. Therefore me, like many, were absolutely blown away when marketing material showed a giant alien spaceship hovering over the White House and promptly blowing it to pieces. That one iconic image sold the film alone. However, I distinctly remember the sense of disappointment I felt upon leaving the cinema. I'd seen the (fleeting!) clips of aerial dogfights between fighter jets and UFOs and expected them to make up more of the film. However, what I got was effectively a two and a half hour story about one stupid decision after the next.<br/><br/>Despite being one of the most profitable movies of all time, it hardly won any prizes for logical storytelling. If you search Google for articles about the film's numerous plot holes and daft developments (Apple laptop being the highpoint!) you'll see what I mean. I didn't hate the film at the time. I appreciated the amazing special effects (for the day) and a great deal of work had gone into showing the carnage caused by an alien attack of populated areas. No faults there. <br/><br/>So, if the effects were really the only stand-out aspects of the film, why did I end up buying the film and still watch it to this day? Well, I guess I appreciate it for what it is. It's the very definition of loud, dumb and stupid. It's a 'popcorn' movie, designed to entertain and keep your mind vaguely occupied while you check Instagram on your phone. Granted today's generations will probably not appreciate the effects, based on the numerous superhero movies where entire cities get reduced to ruins over a period of a half hour battle sequence, but what still holds up is the general sense of eagerness. This is arguably the film that launched Will Smith's career and you just can't help but warm to him. Yes, no matter how dumb and unlikely every situation he's placed in is, he's still brilliant to watch and, along with Jeff Goldblum (who's basically playing Jeff Goldblum – again), the pair of them make the movie still relevant to this day.<br/><br/>So, if you want to enjoy 'Independence Day' you'll definitely have to put your brain on hold and know that you're getting what became the template for disaster movies (certainly nineties ones anyway, but then 'San Andreas' was pretty much the same story). You'll also have to be okay with healthy doses of 'pro-America' scripting. If you've watched (the brilliant) 'Team America: World Police' you'll probably be singing along that song of theirs 'America *£$% yeah!' all the way through, as it really is applicable. And then, when you're done enjoying the stupidity, treat yourself to a YouTube video on how these are the dumbest aliens ever to invade our planet (with the possible exception of that lot from 'Signs')."
"jac-44480","8","1","1","16 January 2017"," So Cheesy its Good
","Aliens invade Earth's atmosphere using giant space ships with impenetrable defense shields. Modern human military technology is no match against the advanced space ships. As the aliens make final preparations, humans scramble for alternative solutions to prevent annihilation.<br/><br/>This movie is an action-comedy featuring an ensemble cast, and a script that is filled with clichés, parodies, and some of the cheesiest dialogue in movie history. This movie is ultra-jingoistic with blind patriotism being a main theme throughout. Although extremely silly, the cheesy dialogue is highly quotable with numerous one-liners that keep the viewers constantly entertained. The special effects are outstanding, and there are plenty of intense action scenes with lots of explosions. Despite the ridiculous plot holes, Independence Day does not take itself seriously and makes fun of itself at every chance.<br/><br/>The two lead characters are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Smith portrays a macho-military tough guy while Goldblum is a stereo-typical computer nerd who uses intellect to solve complex problems, but can barely tie his own shoes. Both leads give strong performances with plenty of memorable one-liners.<br/><br/>Perhaps even better, the main supporting cast played by Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, and Harvey Fierstein. These three deliver some of the movie's funniest moments and quotes. Quaid plays a doofus crop-duster who suffers from PTSD and claims he was abducted by aliens. Now he wants payback against the aliens for his past experiences. Judd Hirsch plays the stereo-typical Jewish father of Goldblum's character, and the dialogue between the two features endless dry humor. Hirsch plays Goldblum's selfish, helpless, panicked co-worker who's natural response to the news of impending doom is to contact his lawyer.<br/><br/>Then we have the government characters to include Bill Pullman as President, Robert Loggia as head military general, Adam Baldwin as second officer, James Rebhorn as CIA adviser to the President, and Brent Spiner as a crazy government scientist who works in Area 51. Spiner's character is particularly funny as he frequently goes off on long tangents about scientific stuff that nobody else understands. Other supporting roles, particularly the ones played by women, are not very funny or memorable, although I liked Margaret Colin as Goldblum's ex-wife and their constant bickering.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, all of these characters are forced to work together to come up with solutions on how to defeat the aliens. The final cigar-scene shared between Smith and Goldblum is a classic moment, where both characters display excellent chemistry for two guys with polar opposite personalities. Another highlight of the movie is Bill Pullman's impassioned speech to the troops and pilots, which is a remarkable moment for a character who is otherwise boring."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","1","15 January 2017"," No longer the movie I once despised
","What I remember about Roland Emmerich's Independence Day as I child is the cheesy one-liners, that Presidential speech that has everymen and war heroes alike puffing out their chest with patriotism, and a portrayal of a world where America acts as the sole voice of reason to a bunch of lesser powers who fully embrace their own stereotype. I always hated it, and could not fathom why the movie had gathered such a loyal army of fans throughout the years, even amongst critics. The film was, and still is, very much a modern-day blockbuster, but watching it again 15 or so years later, it now seems wonderfully old-fashioned.<br/><br/>Dismissing the more studious, and admittedly more intelligent, first contact movies of the 1970s as liberal wishful thinking, Independence Day harks back to the alien invasion pictures of the 50s, where a more us-against-them approach catered to the Cold War- influenced paranoia of the time, and squared-jawed heroes, loony scientists and military personnel alike put their heads together to defeat a force from outer space. Here, we get Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a hotshot pilot who manages to capture one of the tentacled martians after a disastrous dogfight; Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, a genius satellite technician who uncovers the aliens' plans; and Bill Pullman as President Thomas Whitmore, a young ex-pilot going through an image crisis.<br/><br/>The posters and trailers focused on the image of the giant alien ship looming over major American cities, and indeed the moments of catastrophic destruction (usually of famous landmarks) and giant energy beams still manage to amaze, with the special effects still holding up 20 years later. Yet the movie spends most of its time at ground level, and crams it with enough characters and side-stories to fill another 3 films. The three central, intertwining stories aside, we also have a sub-plots involving Hiller's wife Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) encountering the wounded First Lady (Mary McDonnell), and a boozed-up crop duster played by Randy Quaid, whose claims of alien abduction have made him a laughing stock. Throw in Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein and Brent Spiner, and there's enough going on to make your head spin.<br/><br/>Yet Independence Day manages to burst through the convolution by sheer force, delivering a story that is simplistic, ham-fisted and very stupid, but never unspectacular. The three leads help make their characters memorable and incredibly likable with charisma alone, as the script never allows them to be anything more than an archetype. It's the very definition of big, dumb and fun, and was a bit of a game-changer in its day. Disaster movie audiences were no longer satisfied unless they witnessed carnage on a global level, and blockbusters today are still trying to replicate the success of 'ID4', including the director himself, who tried and failed on an astronomic level with the utterly atrocious 2012 (2009). I didn't see it coming, but my opinion of Independence Day has completely changed. Perhaps the movie's age gives it a nostalgic charm it never had before, so I'm hardly anticipating the sequel."

","If you had asked me what I thought of INDEPENDENCE DAY when it was first released, I would've given it a solid 10 out of 10. I was twelve years old when it first came to theaters and I remember seeing it that opening weekend. It blew my mind. I immediately went out and started buying the action figures and the alien fighter, and I even bought the movie novelization. I still have one of the big alien figures with motion sensors that make it roar and open its head cavity to reveal the little alien dude inside. I found it at a Salvation Army for something like $10 a few years ago. Of course I bought it because I seriously loved this movie as a kid. Now? Well, I still have a soft spot for it but it doesn't hold my attention as well anymore. I've grown and seen countless movies since INDEPENDENCE DAY hit theaters. My tastes have expanded and there's very little room for Roland Emmerich's alien invasion, other than nostalgia. Pretty much everyone has seen this movie at one point or another and are at least vaguely familiar with it. Aliens arrive at Earth on July 2nd and their enormous saucers settle in over major population centers while humans around the world lose their minds. Eventually the aliens begin a devastating series of attacks and send the survivors scrambling for some means of defeating them. Their ultimate solution: Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and an Apple computer.<br/><br/>There's no denying the sense of fun that comes with any of the big action sequences in the film. Watching the movie again after all these years, I love the dog-fighting scenes just as much now as I did then. And you know what? They still look great. I was recently made aware that most of these big action sequences were done with miniatures and motion-tracking, and that's really incredible. These dogfighting battles are chaotic with jets and alien fighters swarming and blasting each other out of the sky, and I never would've guessed it hadn't all been done with visual effects. There were some in there to give it that extra flair but a lot of those are miniatures. No wonder I can watch it now, 20 years after its initial release, and be just as engaged as I was the first time. And of course there's the massive destruction sequences for which the movie is famous. Everyone knows the shot of the alien beam weapon blasting down on the White House and exploding and, again, it was done with miniatures and it still looks amazing. From a technical and visual standpoint, INDEPENDENCE DAY is still marvelous. Watching it again now, it's no surprise that twelve-year-old me loved this movie so much. It's got great action, great FX, and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen in a movie. The aliens in INDEPENDENCE DAY are still one of the best designed science fiction creatures I've seen in film.<br/><br/>My problem with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that any scene that doesn't directly involve the aliens or the big dogfights is sort of dull. There is a lot of boring extra material in the movie and, at over two hours long, it could've used a trim. If they had edited this movie down to a solid 110 minutes, I'd probably still love it. Did we really need the whole Randy Quaid subplot? For those who don't remember, Randy Quaid plays Randy Quaid as a drunken crop-duster who we follow as he packs up his stepchildren in an RV and evacuates as part of a huge caravan where he eventually crosses paths with Will Smith and gets a chance for redemption in the big final battle. Who cares? Cut it. It added nothing to the film. We can also cut down a bit on the Vivica A. Fox subplot where she rescues the injured First Lady from a crashed helicopter and collects survivors in a tow truck. Don't cut it (her reconnection with Will Smith in the third act is nice) but trim it down. We don't need to spend as much time with them. Keep the focus on the alien invasion and how the government is dealing with it. Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman as the U.S. President are the film's heroes and we shouldn't be cutting away from them so often; all the real interesting stuff is happening with them. No one thinks back on INDEPENDENCE DAY and fondly remembers Randy Quaid arguing with his son or Vivica Fox having a fireside chat with the President's wife. We remember Will Smith being chased by an alien fighter through the Grand Canyon or the captured alien awakening mid-dissection to tentacle-choke Brent Spiner in a crazy horror scene.<br/><br/>That about sums up my thoughts on INDEPENDENCE DAY. All the cool stuff you remember is still cool, and it's even more impressive that it still works twenty years later. Will Smith knocking an alien unconscious with a single punch and muttering ""Welcome to Earth"" is still awesome. But there's a lot of filler tossed in there to give this movie a more epic scope that just doesn't interest me and it can make the film's bloated runtime difficult to get through. Even moreso if you're watching the extended cut with an additional fifteen minutes of footage. It tries to take itself a little too seriously for a movie with Judd Hirsch cracking wise in Area 51 but, even with its flaws, it's still a classic in its own right."

","""Independence Day"" is essentially one big cliché after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.<br/><br/>That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie. The story is generic and predictable, yes, but it still has a lot of entertainment value. And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie cliché and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie. The spaceships were a nice design. But the aliens, both in and out of their exo-suits were really impressive, and they alone make it fun to watch the movie.<br/><br/>""Independence Day"" is a star-filled movie, boasting talents such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Viviva A. Fox, James Rebhorn, Brent Spinner and many more. People did good jobs with their given roles and characters.<br/><br/>This is a fun and fast-paced movie that is well-worth watching if you enjoy action Sci-Fi movies, just look past the American propaganda and endless clichés.

Great action, some truly funny moments, great space flights, does not bore you at all. HOWEVER, this movie has some HUGE shortcomings. Dialogue - uggh. Bill Pullman as President - yech. Too many stereotypes and caricatures - do the blacks and Jews really need to be the Hollywood cookie-cutter? Sickening. And of course, the biggest 'eye-roller' of them all - giving an alien spaceship a computer virus. Was this plot piece thought of the same folks fell for the Ugandi Prince email scam?? Anyone with half a brain knows you can't just ""give"" something a computer virus - they aren't air-born germs... Overall, check your brain at the door and this is a fun romp that moves at a good pace. Sci-fi purists will HATE this movie, but the average Joe and Josephine will enjoy it for its appeal."
"AaronCapenBanner","4","1","1","30 September 2013"," Alien Invasion.
","Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks.<br/><br/>Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's ""V"" TV films instead.<br/><br/>Nice that ""The X-Files"" gets a mention though!"
"ScottAmundsen","8","1","1","21 May 2013"," Yes, it's Kind of Dumb and Cliché Ridden, But it Has Something Very Special
","Some people might be surprised that I give this movie a star rating of 8. After all, everything the critics said about it is true: the story is a stupid one (honestly, if a race of creatures out there really were so advanced as to be able to make such long journeys through space, would they REALLY do so just to make war on us?), there is virtually NOTHING in it that has not been done already and usually by far superior films (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, for example), and to describe the script as cliché-ridden is an understatement: it positively REVELS in clichés and trite old memes from low-rent Fifties invaders-from-outer-space trash. The plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese and the movie at times seems to be daring the viewer to keep watching.<br/><br/>Why, then, with all these faults, is this one of those films that whenever it comes on, I simply HAVE to sit down and enjoy? BECAUSE IT'S FUN.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I love serious drama; I studied the works of Tennessee Williams for two years at University. But the director/writer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin did not set out to make serious drama. They set out to ENTERTAIN, a goal that is equally as valid as the goal of most serious drama which is to elicit a certain emotional response. There is a place in the pantheon for movies made just for fun.<br/><br/>And entertain this film does, and it does it well. Thanks largely in part to a script that was positively audacious in its deliberate loading the film of every outdated sci-fi idea in the book, aided and abetted by an incredible cast. The people in this film are all utterly believable and ground the film in a way that lesser attention to the acting would not have done. There are even a couple of moments I choke up every time: President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman) rallying speech to the pilots on the airfield; the reunion of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and Constance Spano (Margaret Colin); and most especially a quiet moment between David Levinson and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch, a particular favorite of mine) when the father looks at the son and says, ""I'm very proud of you"" that gets me every time: the father and son look at each other for just a moment, and so much is said in that moment.<br/><br/>Some folks reading this might think I just have a taste for really bad movies (and I won't deny that some movies I hold very dear are indeed VERY bad), but this is a film that knows what it's doing from the first frame to the last; a roller-coaster ride that is even more fun after you've seen it a few times.<br/><br/>Pass the popcorn and enjoy."

I actually thought that part was well thought out and plausible!! The idea goes like this: the aliens have a hive-mind (obvious to sci-fi fans who've seen it all before), and so have absolutely no concept of delinquency. They're aggressive, all right, but not the least bit sneaky.<br/><br/>Consequently, their command messages are sent in a code so weak it is broken by inspection; an 'interrogated' alien spills the whole plan just for the asking; their fighters and even space ship defences are foxed by simple tricks; they haven't changed IFF codes in 40 years; and their computer operating systems have absolutely no security.<br/><br/>This of course begs for a sequel where the delinquent, dirty-dealing two-fisted back-stabbing humans use the crashed ships to launch a counter-attack ."

","The movie has everything that has ""U.S.A."" written all over it. The graphics in the movie are put to good use, because the UFO's in the movie look awesome. As for the comedic touches of the movie, there are few parts of the movie you will actually laugh openly to. Except perhaps for the onetime laugh scene, where Will Smith welcomes an alien to earth.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the movie really does the job, and prepares you for a good movie experience.<br/><br/>I won't reveal my favorite part of the movie, which actually doesn't last very long, but it's incredibly romantic. So I guess this is a movie that holds a special place in everyone, or it doesn't hold much interest at all. But after ID4, everything that has computer graphics in it has taken a bit off. Take the new Star Wars movie for instance. So, in comparison, ID4 will always be the movie that killed off computer graphic movies, and will always be a classic in my heart."

If I were president when this happened, I would have been right their with Bill Pullman flying a plane into that alien space ship.

The special effects wee excellent, and the detail placed in the alien's attire, spaceships etc. was exceptional, considering the art department could have tanked in this category.

","Unlike his 2016 ID:Resurgence, which can pretty much be dismissed without a second thought, Roland Emmerich's original is a triumphalist triumph of epic film-making, with gung-ho David Arnold music to match. Although 150 minutes long, it is in many ways an economically-made yet attractively-filmed movie, passing smoothly and logically (but also at times with pleasant eccentricity) from scene to scene; and all the time looking plausible (at the military and government levels), while playing successfully with emotions of fear, shock, sadness, patriotism, stoicism, wit and indeed enigma.<br/><br/>Not much is wasted here, very few scenes indeed fall down, and a great many have become iconic, not just for this movie, but in the whole history of cinema. One knows those images or vignettes are coming, yet they continue to give pleasure, and have not lost their edge. There are no dud characters here, and many are a joy to see in action, all the more so as unlikely combinations of characters come together.<br/><br/>To look at ""Independence Day"" as it should be looked at is to see an antidote - or better a mirror image - of ""Close Encounters"". While the latter is clearly the more cerebral movie, ID also does its bit of emulation by following logical if strange paths of the stories of individuals, many of whom resemble Richard Dreyfuss's Roy Neary in being able to penetrate the top-secret military and scientific stuff, opening the movie up, though of course exposing those featuring to fear and misery, as opposed to the mix of awe and wonder that Spielberg had to offer back in 1977. But the universe is a big place, and if aliens exist at all, perhaps they will indeed be the locust-like lifeforms Bill Pullman's President Whitmore tells us about.<br/><br/>While Pullman is not a great actor, he does quite well enough in this role, while the Smith-Goldblum pairing is again iconic, robust and witty, as is the father-and-son provided by Goldblum and Judd Hirsch. James Rebhorn and Robert Loggia are perfect in their top-politician and top-military roles respectively, while Randy Quaid gets his character just right, as of course does Brent Spiner as the slightly whacko Doctor Okun. Adam Baldwin showed early promise in uniform as Major Mitchell, and Harvey Fierstein also offers his part with a nice mix of humour and poignancy. The female leads are perhaps weaker, though with Vivica Fox convincing most.<br/><br/>Many at the time dismissed ID as an effects movie of little import, but ironically the chance to compare with ID:Resurgence all those years later makes it abundantly clear what a surfeit of CGI can do to render a film meaningless. In contrast, the original ""Independence Day"" plays a military battle story straight and really seems to offer a tangible hint of what the dread event of alien invasion might look like; and it's authentically scary and awesome, and far from just throwaway death and destruction (unlike the tragically weak 2016 effort). To my mind, this kind of invasion is (thankfully) something that's never going to happen, but recall how mainstream physicists do actually see life as a relatively likely outcome out there in the universe (even as biologists, ecologists and geologists feel that planets with any life are going to be excruciatingly few and far between). Which means that a species gearing its whole way of life to moving from one to another exploiting resources look all the more plausible..."

"thenachoman","10","3","6","27 July 2012"," Still as optimistic and inspiring as it was in 1996
","I was 14 when Independence Day came out in 1996. Being a boy, into war games and sci-fi, it is perhaps no surprise that I loved it and went to see it about five times at the movies (no small achievement when you're a kid with hardly any money). At the time it was to me, the perfect movie. It had a great storyline, non-stop action, humor and incredible special effects. The love interest stuff went over my head of course.<br/><br/>Fast forward to today - July 2012. I am much older, and hopefully (?) much wiser. I've seen loads and loads of films since Independence Day. My tastes have become more sophisticated and I know much more about how films are made and why they made in the way they are. I've also become much more cynical about movies - unfortunately - and I guess that is somewhat inevitable with age.<br/><br/>Independence Day was on TV the other night and I thought 'what the hell - I'll watch it again.' I was a bit wary of doing this because I was fairly sure that I would hate it. I would be embarrassed that I liked it as a 14 year old. This has already happened to me with other movies I've watched as an adult that I loved as a child. But I loved this movie so much that I wanted to give it a chance. Maybe at 29 I would still enjoy it as I did 15 years ago.<br/><br/>By the time I had finished watching it I felt like I was 14 again. I was optimistic and hopeful about the human race - again. Screw the Global Financial Crisis - we can beat it! Yeah climate change is a big worry - but we can beat that too! Yeah! And I'm not joking either. I felt so good after watching this movie that it felt like I'd been injected with a shot with Anthony Robbin's personality.<br/><br/>How does a popcorn flick like Independence Day do this? <br/><br/>Yes, I liked the humor, especially Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsh. Yes the special effects stand up pretty well. The pacing is pretty much perfect. The script isn't amazing but there is some good dialogue in there. Even the president's speech wasn't as corny as I remember.<br/><br/>The reason I think Independence Day is such a great movie is that it is imbued with a sense of optimism about mankind. I don't think it's forced either. Movies are a reflection on the politics and history they are produced in. Independence Day was made in 1996, a time where the world was generally at peace and hopeful and optimistic about the future. <br/><br/>It is hard not to get carried along with the confidence and optimism in Independence Day. My cynic turned off after about 30 minutes and by the end I was cheering along with everyone else. Maybe harder. It feels like it's been so long since there has been any news in the world to be positive about.<br/><br/>In 2012 the world has changed a lot from 1996. America is no longer the superpower it was then. 9/11 and terrorism still cast a shadow. Most of the world is in recession. Climate change is becoming a reality. Some think it could get worse. There isn't a great sense of optimism at the moment. <br/><br/>Watching Independence Day again renewed my hope in mankind, like many great movies do. The cynic in me wanted to laugh at the idea of the world uniting together, mock the idea of Israelis and Syrians fighting side by side, and ridicule out of a crop duster pilot giving up his life to take out a city sized alien space ship. But the 14 year old inside me won out - that idealism and optimism was still there - thankfully. <br/><br/>I can't wait until movies like this are made again. That will mean that we are again moving forward with a sense of optimism and confidence about the future. And Hollywood movies will begin to reflect that. Maybe we will work out how to beat climate change. Or maybe the world economy will start booming again. There is a lot to look forward to. Great films help us rediscover our sense of optimism about the future. And Independence Day, for all its flaws, is one of them."
"DavidSim240183","4","3","6","7 October 2008"," Hollywood entertainment of the driest kind
","Independence Day was the runaway hit of its year. It propelled Roland Emmerich to the A-list, made a star out of Will Smith, and provided audiences with some of the most extravagant special effects and action sequences not seen since Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>But for all that, Independence Day typifies everything wrong with Hollywood blockbusters. Spectacle comes first. At the expense of everything else. When it comes to this type of gratuitous bludgeoning, Roland Emmerich is a particularly guilty offender. He has a list of empty-headed, special effects action bonanzas on his CV, with patriotic flag-waving to back it up. And Independence Day is the one film on Emmerich's resume where these faults are at they're most extreme.<br/><br/>Its the worst kind of Hollywood entertainment. Everything about it is designed to be a crowd-pleaser. It pushes the right buttons at all the right moments. Plenty of eye-popping effects. Mind-blowing stunts. An all star cast. And its meant to appeal to the American heartland. The last time I saw a film that embodied such patriotic rabble-rousing was the equally perverse Top Gun.<br/><br/>Naturally for a film so commercially calculated, ID4 was an inevitable success. But I was left underwhelmed by the whole thing. Alien invasion films have been done much better before and since. Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds was much more respectful because I cared for the people in it. But as with everything else Roland Emmerich gets his hands on, he can't resist filling out the film with stock characters and easy clichés.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman is the gung-ho All-American President. Jeff Goldblum the eccentric scientist who stumbles onto the truth that nobody listens to. Will Smith is the wisecracking fighter pilot. As well as the straight arrow US military types who believe the best defence is a good offence. And small-minded bureaucrats and techno-nerds this type of film can't seem to live without.<br/><br/>Independence Day seems a conscious ripoff of every SF film ever made. From The War of the Worlds to The Day The Earth Stood Still (shown on TV at one point). Even the climax seems modelled on the assault on the Death Star at the end of Star Wars. There's also a dash of X-Files style paranoia added to the mix with the whole inclusion of Area 51. The aliens recovered in Roswell are the same aliens invading the Earth. The one amusing spark of originality in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The film uses the days leading up to the 4th of July as a device to frame the invasion in. Starting with they're arrival. The attacks. And a last ditch counterstrike. The gigantic spaceships and they're massive attacks turned out to be the selling-point of the entire film. (Add to that a rigorous marketing campaign). And while there is a certain amount of fun to be had watching national monuments and The White House get blown to pieces, there does seem something a little flat about the special effects sequences.<br/><br/>When we got our first glimpse of an alien spaceship in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the result was awe-inspiring. Like something transcendent and immense had touched down on Earth. But the ships in Independence Day are curiously unremarkable. They only impress by the sheer vastness of they're scale. They may have Grand Canyon-sized interiors, but they lack any of the elegance and mysterious beauty Spielberg conjured up in Close Encounters. They never really connect with their audience.<br/><br/>And then there are the aliens themselves. I wish Roland Emmerich had come up with something a little more original than octopus people. Its disappointing when you take into account the alien creatures 20th Century Fox have produced in the past. The Alien and the Predator were genuinely otherworldly. They truly felt like creatures one had never imagined before, much less seen.<br/><br/>Another problem I have with ID4 is its patriotic flag-waving. Roland Emmerich, although German, shows a peculiar reverence for his adopted country in his films. This one displays it more than any other. We get majestic closeups of the Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, the American flag. And despite the fact its a worldwide invasion, not once do we see how the rest of the world is affected. Just the American side. Bill Pullman's stirring speech has become the stuff of legend. It practically drowns in its own sentimentality. And he personally leads the troops into battle. George Bush Jr didn't follow his example when he waged war on Iraq.<br/><br/>The cast are quite a mixed bag of ethnic diversities. Will Smith rises above it all, and although not as funny as he would be in his next alien invader film Men in Black, his effortless charm is a winner all the way. Jeff Goldblum basically plays the same flaky scientist sort he's been typecast in ever since The Fly. And beyond Bill Pullman's all-American president, there isn't much more to learn about him.<br/><br/>There are some interesting faces found in the supporting cast. Brent Spiner (Data!) amuses as the (mad) scientist in charge of Area 51. All the more when you realise who's behind those thick glasses and grey hair. So does Randy Quaid as the whacked out crop-duster kidnapped by aliens some years back. Judd Hirsch is warm and engaging as Goldblum's father. They're scenes together are quite believable. Also look out for Adam Baldwin, six years before he played wild-card Jayne in the muchly missed Firefly. His lantern-jawed US Major is a rather witty reversal.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I believed the way the aliens are dispatched. Its just too convenient. And ID4 has an improbably happy ending. It does have the occasional nice idea, like Area 51 used as the base to strike back against the aliens, but I find Independence Day much too unpalatable. Too caught up in its own patriotism and spectacularity, the dramatics of the story end up swamped by it."

","Since it's release in theaters 11 years ago, Independence Day has taken a lot heat. While I personally disagree that this movie is so horrible, it is easy to beat up the film seeing that its directed by one of the most boring directors of our time, Roland Emmerich.<br/><br/>However, I believe this is his finest work. The first act is all about the build-up of the alien invasion and the attacks. This takes about fifty minutes, which also develops many (too many) characters and their places in the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The attacks are good, but it is not unexpected. The special effects give it its credibility, and the second act begins the day after.<br/><br/>In the wake of the devastation, mankind is limping on to survive, all main characters personally affected in someway by the attacks. While everybody does a good job bringing out the emotional side of the attacks, Will Smith is the only one that degrades this. After battling the aliens and failing, he has a close encounter with an alien and reacts unrealistically, punching it and sarcastically greeting it. Then he's dragging it through the desert, screaming at it because he is missing a barbecue. HELLO?!? This is an alien race far superior to our own and it has single handedly brought mankind to its knees, and all he can do is yell at it for ruining his day? His performance is plausible but not his role. Thank God this is the only thing that I did not like in the second act.<br/><br/>After Will Smith brings the alien to a secret alien research facility in Area 51, the doctors decide to perform an autopsy. The autopsy scene is a classic. It is probably the best sci-fi scene I have EVER seen. It could fit into a 50's classic, and makes the movie so great.<br/><br/>At the end of the second act, they finally figure out how to take down the alien's shields and destroy their monster-sized spacecraft. This is where the lousy third act begins.<br/><br/>July 4 is the opening of the third act, in which they round up as many pilots as possible. One is my least favorite character, a guy named Russell who claims he had been kidnapped by aliens 10 years earlier. The guy is lackadaisical cornball. He has one good line (Hello, boys. I'm back!!!!). All pilots around the world, including Russell will be in the ultimate battle. They will fight the alien ships while Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum plant a virus inside the mother ship. This is sadly the only interesting part of the third act, the rest of it from before being a cornball of clichés.<br/><br/>The interior of the mother ship is so breathtaking, I actually found myself wishing somehow their ship would malfunction and they'd be stuck inside, forcing them to venture through the space frigate for about an hour in a style reminiscent to ""Alien"". But seeing that the movie is already 2 1/2 hours, I guess they decided to not to.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum's and Will Smith's chemistry work wonders while they're in the mother ship, and every moment inside it is really good.<br/><br/>The movie shortly ends after their departure from the mother ship, so it pretty much comes to a screeching halt. The world is still in ruins, and Emmerich leaves us to ponder how humanity will get back up.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie manages perfectly for 81% of the movie. I would've given it a 9.0 if it weren't for Will Smith's comic relief in the second act, Russell, and mainly clichéd third act. 8.1/10."

The only let down of the movie was the terribly poor and substandard special effects. I mean you could actually see the wires holding the aliens spacecraft. In fact this movie even makes the original series of Star Trek look good. But hey we all know that effects don't make a movie, its the acting and the actors. The Rock - Dwane Johnson (WWF wrestling champ) stars as plucky young airforce captain, Steven Hitler. While Burt Reynolds reprises his role as hunky computer geek, ""good morning"" David Levinson. Reynolds steals the show once again, proving that he truly deserved the Oscar won for his role in Cannonball run II. While the Rocks portrayal of Hiller provides the comedy relief, who can forget the fight scene on the alien mothership when he gives a ""rock-bottom"" to Seven of Nine? Classic.

","Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are two guys who give new meaning to the words ""turn-off"". As in ""turn-off the T.V."".<br/><br/>I ""watched"" Independence Day and Godzilla on an illegal black box and sadly, I couldn't fast forward or anything with the former, I had to turn off the T.V. and wait 30 minutes, or watch it the next day, with a different scene. It didn't matter; I hated this film immensely and that once again, people were paying money to see this garbage.<br/><br/>Critically-lambasted, Independence Day pays homage to Aliens vs. Earth films of the past. Same plot here. 140+ minutes of boring, unwatchable celluloid.<br/><br/>Problems with the film are horrible acting; some of the worst ever. I especially was amused by scenes in which the aliens start attacking and some of the actors are in cars spouting off one-line sentences before going to the next scenes. Yay, Viveca A. Fox works as a stripper despite the fact that her boyfriend, played by Will Smith, has a high-paying job with the government. The film is one-sided, with the aliens destroying everything in their path and the humans are simply helpless until they discover the solution. The same lame dialogue prevalent in these films remain. The biggest sin of Independence Day is that it has no heart and that it gave ideas to Tim Burton for ""Mars Attacks"", another film that I'll have some fun ""reviewing"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you want to see the otherwise good SFX and stuff and can tolerate sub-standardness everywhere else, jump right in. Otherwise, this movie makes the prior Devlin-Emmerich helmed ""Stargate"" look like Casablanca."

","One of the biggest hits of the year 1996 (especially in the USA) but certainly not one of the finest science-fiction movies ever made.<br/><br/> The sole advantage of the movie rests in the special effects that are really impressive (the gigantic spacecraft). But the assets of Roland Emmerich's movie stop here.<br/><br/> Then, ""Independence day"" accumulates the faults that damages the interest of the movie. First of all, ""Independence day"" wavers constantly between the science-fiction but also the disaster film. But the main problem of the movie is definitely the script. It's a weak and ridiculous script that alternates borrowings: ""Alien"" (the physical appearance of the extraterrestrials), ""Star Wars"" (the pursuit between the flying saucer and Will Smith's plane), ""the day the Earth stood still"" (1951) and homages: ""War of the worlds"", 2001: a space odyssey"" (when Jeff Goldblum turns on his portable computer, this is ""HAL 9000"" that appears on the screen!). In the long run, the movie's got nearly nothing new and it easily falls into the stereotypes of science-fiction. It's hackneyed and not inventive at all.<br/><br/>This is also a movie spoiled by an atrocious performance of nearly all the actors, especially the minor roles. Moreover Roland Emmerich's crew wanted to introduce humor so as to avoid to tell too seriously the story. A good idea but the humor doesn't fly high and it's sometimes very crude.<br/><br/>An average and pretentious movie."

","I saw this movie when I was twelve and I remember I couldn't wait to see it. As a twelve year old it was the greatest film ever made. The mixture of aliens, explosions and Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum blowing up the mother ship all made up for my favorite film at a young age. While it may no longer hog the top spot (I have grown up a bit since then) the film is still a favorite of mine, owning it on video and DVD and I still find it great fun to watch. Okay, okay, so the American patriotism is a little overdone at the end, but Jeff Goldblum is great value for money, especially when playing the cocky scientist who is destined to be right and mixing it up with a cockier Will Smith this has the basis to be a fun film which it is.<br/><br/>While the special effects are what the film relies on the most, it is the affectionate tribute to the many genres that inspired Emmerich and Devlin that makes this a joy to watch. Clearly in love with alien invasion films and disaster films from the 50's and 70's, they have ever cliche in the book thrown into the film, from the frightening, although fantastically done, alien attack that sees some of the most famous landmarks in America being blown up, through to the self sacrifice of a character through to the death of many a loved one who are merely one dimensional characters who serve no purpose other than to be killed and cause a gamut of emotions, Emmerich and Devlin have done their job well. The film is affectionate to the genre's it is paying tribute to and in doing so they have created one of the most entertaining Hollywood blockbusters in many a year. While the film would seem to have a lot in common more with a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration (explosions, explosions and some more explosions), they do in a less excessive mode and in doing so do create some funny and moving character moments. Goldblum and Judd Hirsch have some fantastic scenes together, while Bill Pullman's president having to watch his wife die is genuinely sad, never have the word sleeping seem so weepy.<br/><br/>It is the action scenes where this film comes to life and boy does Emmerich know how to put on a good show. From the aforementioned attack scene to the the retaliation of human kind, the film is a fast paced fun ride that never lets up and never has a dull moment. It may be corny and it may be a film made for twelve year old boys, but seven years have passed since the film was released and I'm going to admit it. I still love it."

Then we're involved with the heroes. Harry Connick Jr. for lack of better words was retarded in this film and had no place in it. Hence the ego statement earlier. At times the people in the movie were frightened from the alien experience, then zany, then happy, then sad again. Do they even know that nearly a third of the world is in ruins? Does Will Smith even remember that his ""so we are led to assume"" buddy Harry Jr. died just seconds ago when he pulled out a tacky one liner ""Welcome to Earth."" at the aliens?<br/><br/>ID-4 is a brainless movie attempting to bring out good feeling of patriotism just like Armageddon.

","One of the most criticized movies that I remember, and for a large sector that far from seeing its true pretensions, which are none other than those of a pure and carefree entertainment judge for their patriotic messages. They can not argue otherwise than the worn and boring speech ""Americanized"", the same ones who do not mind that concept when they come out of films like ""Save Private Ryan"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and many others that according to the director the same message seems to be forgotten, when dealing with more serious issues should be more objective.
In any case Roland Emmerich, he goes through the lining (fortunately) the opinion of critics and is limited to perform the kind of show that he would like to see in a movie theater. For ""Independence Day"", he does not hesitate to take references such as ""The War of the Worlds"" or ""Star Wars"" as well as the cinema of catastrophes of the 70's, recycling what was the day of its premiere a spectacular production with extraordinary visual effects, which combine exemplary models and digitalisations with a result of reference. The story is not new, but if it is, the dialogues are not Shakespeare's, but who cares? when it comes to spending two hours of pure action in which there is hardly room for absurd ramblings. It is therefore an easy target for those who believe themselves to be scholars and try to make those who enjoy this type of products complacent, who at least have a clear objective, to collect and entertain. I certainly had a great time and fully enjoyed this excellent science fiction film, to ""Hamlet"" we will leave for another day."

Great entertainment though.<br/><br/>For the most part the story follows Will Smith as an army of alien spaceships attack earth and threaten to destroy the human race. There's a huge cast attached, banding together to stop the invasion with multiple story arcs converging. The initial take down by the aliens is well done, devastating on a global level with fire balls etc. <br/><br/>It's one of those movies that I catch myself watching and enjoying every time I stumble across it on TV.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Bill Pullman as the president, Jeff Goldblum's banter with his crotchety dad Judd Hirsch.

","To rate Independence Day a 6.9 is an absolute travesty. The film set new benchmarks in the sci-fi genre and redefined the 4th of July celebration in the USA. To say that Will Smith's performance as a family man who dreams of becoming an astronaut is weak and one-dimensional, is an insult to any Oscar award ever won, both in the past and in the future. This film defined Will Smith's career and cemented him in history as the greatest actor there has ever been. Bill Pullman as the US President is a casting choice of pure genius and it would be fair to say that this is the greatest depiction of a Presidential role ever portrayed in a cinematic production. The President donning a jumpsuit and flying with his comrades to join the front line against the aliens epitomizes the sentiment of the founding fathers of the United States of America. Furthermore, it was this film, and this film alone, that inspired Barack Obama himself to run for office. Jeff Goldblum also gives an extraordinary performance that would indeed cause aliens to flock to Earth to witness his acting, had it not been for the outrageous 6.9 rating.<br/><br/>To conclude, Independence Day is an artistic masterpiece and sheds light on the harrowing security flaws of our world. We now realise who can be counted on; Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum, and all thanks to the directing perfection of Mr Roland Emmerich. 10/10 and the rest."

"Al_The_Strange","9","2","4","4 July 2013"," ""We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!""
","In 1996, this film was released with a simple premise: an alien invasion occurs on July 4th, with massive ships obliterating entire cities and systematically exterminating mankind. In some of the most chilling and awe-inspiring footage, the 15-mile-wide flying saucers destroy the White House, Los Angeles, and New York City (just a few of many), with massive waves of fire washing over the streets. This is quickly followed by retaliation, with squadrons of jet fighters taking on the extraterrestrial vessels.<br/><br/>This film crams in a lot within its two-and-a-half hour timeframe: the first act takes its time to establish all the key characters as the UFOs gradually take position. When the attack begins, the action remains pretty constant, leading up to a grand final battle. Special effects were really inspiring at its time, and remain iconic to this day. Even when firestorms, alien ships, and jet fighters aren't filling up the screen, the movie runs pretty fast, with frequent comedy to keep things light and fun. Overall, it's the perfect blockbuster picture, finding a fine balance between action, spectacle, humor, and drama.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much more of the same as any other alien invasion story you see. In fact, it bears much in common with the classic War of the Worlds. What makes ID4 more compelling, however, is that it juggles multiple characters and multiple points of views, and eventually brings them together for the central fight. All these characters are pretty fun to watch and root for, and show just enough development to make them work. The plot is pretty well-structured, using three distinct acts to portray this larger-than-life situation. It's also most noteworthy for portraying relatively realistic politics and military protocols, thanks largely to the consultation the filmmakers received from the Air Force during filming. The film also ties in a few ufology aspects to capitalize off of the popular concepts of alien life. It makes for a grand and entertaining story, even if it isn't all that deep or original.<br/><br/>This film has very solid photography and editing. Acting is generally fun from the whole cast: Bill Pullman is probably the only one who takes his role seriously, and actually comes off as a little cheesy with the way he tries so hard to sound cool and tough. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum steal the show the whole way with their lighthearted performances. Writing is pretty decent, although many lines are silly and goofy. This production spares no expense on sets, props, costumes, and special effects, although they are showing their age. David Arnold's music score is appropriately boisterous.<br/><br/>At the time of its release, Independence Day was one of the most exciting and awe-inspiring features I had seen. Despite its age and cheesiness, I still call it one of the most essential blockbusters of all time.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"
"Progressive-Element","9","2","4","24 May 2013"," Corny fun
","Roland Emmerich's alien invasion epic provides exhilarating set-pieces, from the first sight of the ships arriving, the destruction of major cities, to intense dogfights between fighter jets and the aliens' equivalents.<br/><br/>Will Smith makes for a charismatic hero, overshadowing most of the other cast members. Bill Pullman is a little stilted as the President, and gives a speech that was vote corniest piece of dialogue in a film. Jeff Goldblum is on autopilot, essentially doing his Jurassic Park persona all over again. Judd Hirsch provides much comic relief as Jeff's crotchety but wise old man.<br/><br/>No-one watches a film like this for Oscar-winning performances or soap opera dramatics though. While there are indeed some daft moments - the aliens with all this technology, and even with knowledge of OUR technology, have clearly never heard of firewalls or AVG - it more than delivers in the thrills department, evoking the spirit of 50s alien invasion movies, particularly the 1953 film The War of the Worlds."

"amwcsu","4","2","4","18 March 2010"," A Sci-Fi Classic? Hell no!!!
","Independence Day is a very interesting title for an alien invasion movie. In fact the 15-mile wide ships are also an interesting concept which is the only intriguing aspect of ID4! Will Smith's Capt. Hiller adds a humorous twist, but he's unconvincing as an Air Force Captain. He's like the Fresh Prince with a rank in the service. Overall ID4(why they call it that? I don't know), it's not worthy of my calling it a ""film"". It's a movie and a rather clichéd one at that. Like the Michael""Ka-Boom""Bay version of Transformers 11 years after the fact, it's a bombastic disaster movie that's the mid-1990's rendition of the Posideon Adventure, Airport, and Earthquake right down to the token multi-vocational, multi-ethnic cast. Some critics and viewers see as a cinematic display of American jingoism and arrogance. I think they're right on the money with that sentiment. Why should only the USA be the only nation of people to stand up to these creatures? Why should the USA have all the answers. Why couldn't Japan, the UK, Canada, or even Australia have the answers! <br/><br/>Instead of original characters we're exposed to token ones that are a rehash of characters from their other movies. For example, Jeff Goldblum is clearly re-enacting his Dr. Malcolm/Jurassic Park phase. But, that's not the reason why I don't necessarily like ID4. I don't like it because all the alien ships seem to do is destroy famous landmarks such as White House and the Empire State Building. They just kill for no reason other than the thrill of killing humanity(very vague if you ask me!)It's most clichéd because its tired message of ""humanity must work together in peace"" Oh brother! Independence Day is nothing but ""boom"" bang"" ""BA-DOOM!"" There is no thoughtfulness and intelligence just...absurdity. This example is bringing down the alien empire with a simple garden-variety computer virus! A friggin' computer virus are you shitting me?!"" How the hell do these people know that the alien ships aren't immune to such electronic contamination?! These are extra-terrestrials we're talking about, here! The next example is the psychically destroying the ships with thermonuclear weapons. What? Hasn't Emmerich ever heard of EMP, nuclear fallout, and atomic shock waves?! Unbelievable.<br/><br/>If you are going to make a movie about aliens invading Earth, do it with thought, pizazz, and a better f&*king reason to raze the cities of the Earth other than just for the hell of it!!! Seeing million of people cram the highways at the last minute is a stupid sight in itself. Haven't we seen this before in the movie the Day After and Earthquake? Let's do something different other than a resurrection of 70's melodrama. In conclusion, Rolan Emmerich is just as bad as Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay only he brings the absurd doomsday element into his movies. People like him and his contemporaries must be stopped!"

To worry about anything deeper than that is sort of like saying, ""Are we having fun yet? -- i.e., you're just not getting it.<br/><br/>Actually, looked at another way, it IS deep. It is a great movie for showing directly what it feels like to put aside petty differences for the time being. It reminds me of taking LSD: it takes for most people an extraordinarily strong entheogen like LSD to enter different ""spaces"" of expanded awareness; similarly, it takes an extraordinarily strong world event to bring people together.

I will not go into detail on my comments to the above, as they have already been well-described in many other reviews and I will not waste the readers time. However, I will conclude with one other point about this movie which really irks me. It is the blatantly loud, pro-American jingoism that permeates this film. It is so over the top that it is embarrassing, and I say this as a proud American. How I yearn for a return to the old American virtues of humbleness, quiet pride and the ""can-do"" attitude of the past. The in-your-face flag-waving, posing, posturing, rudeness and general ignorance of other peoples and nations shown in this and many other simplistic films of this nature is quite pathetic.

The inane subplots from the first half are widened to become the bulk of the film in the second half, and logic and reason are more and more done away with. By the end, it's become hopelessly jingoistic and patriotic, and far too cheesy. The cast is pretty good, with some great chemistry between Smith and Goldblum, and the special effects are still stunning today, which make up for the failings of the plot.

","Though some many harsh critics and bad attitude toward this movie, I know that. The story is cheesy, the plot is stupid, and no depth in the whole movie...alright, that can be true. However, undoubtedly, this is still a very good summer popcorn movie and indeed it hit the box office with no surprise. The Visual effects and Special effects during 96~97 were still stunning. Basically, it is quite similar to the classic Star Wars trilogy...aircraft chasing and mother ship attacked. In my personally opinion, the story itself is still interesting. The script writers actually did a good job. They created not single-dimension crisis at the same time, and when people resolved one crisis and then another one just appeared. It made the story intensive and easily grabs audiences' tension. Besides, the reason why there were still so much people feel like it was so realistic during watching in the theater was because the whole story was set in modern world. The Big Apple (where I live) and other important capitals around the world. People are familiar with these places so that people may feel very realistic at that time. Besides, I do love the first person shot and the score. The first person POV shots are really good in the battle scenes. The director Roland Emmerich is really doing a good job - to provide a good and exciting entertained movie during the summer. The score composed by David Arnold is excellent. After seeing this movie in the theater, I just ran to CD store to buy its soundtrack. The music in this movie is definitely can be placed among John Williams' classics.

There is a point when I movie is sooo way out that you can't ignore it.<br/><br/>It has one good point and that is the special effects. Even then you HAVE to see it on a big screen to get a sense of scale.<br/><br/>I shall attempt to list the bad points *spoiler*: 1. No suspense. You know right from the start how it is going to turn out.<br/><br/>2. No internal consistency. These ship can cross interstellar distances a fantastic speeds and yet they take ages to get into position. The small fighter ship can reach the moon in less than a day and yet they have trouble keeping up with fighter jet. The alien fighter's were pretty just weirdly shaped jet fighters in the way they moved. Thus the dogfights scenes were just like any old war movie, when they could have made it exciting and different. So no tension there, they just looked evenly matched apart from the shields.<br/><br/>3. Corny as hell and just soooo American and patriotic. Puke.<br/><br/>4. The dumbest plan in history. Apart from the virus thing, what the hell are they going to do about millions of tons of spaceship hit the ground? 5. Boring subplots, namely the crop duster pilot.<br/><br/>6. Almost entirely 2D characters with perhaps a couple of exceptions.<br/><br/>Eh, what am I wasting my time on?

We are obviously powerless to fend for ourselves, we need the president himself to save our asses. I know it's only a film, but maybe this is taking it a bit far."

","Some latest American films remind me of big `burger'-like sandwiches: too many things amassed in them, no traces of taste and a question `how can anyone eat and even swallow such a big piece of?' Well, to be honest, ID is definitely not the worst film of the decade, and even of the year and it's a good evolution for Mr.Emmerich after Moon 44 and Universal Soldier-like second rate flicks (some say his  debut was the best film of his career, unfortunately, I have not seen it). But this cannot justify the immense success of the film. The thing is that the director has calculated the formula of success with American audience (patriotism + freedom + democracy + lots of special effects + couple of stars + little work for viewers brain + simple and predictable story so that the audience feels happy that it can foresee the next move of the plot=lots of money=good film; if you add to this science fiction elements it may become a super blockbuster, if you add a couple of serious problems and exclude aliens you may even get an Oscar nomination ) and if the film is blockbuster in USA it almost always earns a good money in the rest of the world, but than, this is not art, not even entertainment, its just an arithmetic.<br/><br/>Now about the film itself. This is not a science fiction. Some other term should be invented for the film like this, because it sounds almost ridiculous, OK, I see fiction, but where the hell is science? Real science fiction books or films use some invented or fantastic world to show some all human problems, this doesn't mean that all SFi films should be as serious as films of Tarkovsky or Kubrick, but Independence Day goes beyond all imaginable limits of cliché melodrama, cheap action film and hurrah-patriotic propaganda (when watching ID sometimes I even suspected that German Emmerich mocks at excessive patriotic feelings of some Americans  his last film `Patriot' goes even farther in this nationalistic fields of glory-but if this is a satire it is a very subtle one and most people take the `God bless America, land that I love' part of the film rather seriously). Of course, some may say `the film is what it is - pure entertainment, want serious themes? go, watch Fellini', partly it's right, and entertaining side of the film is not that bad (effects are good, the first part  `the chess game' till the `checkmate' is rather engrossing and I may say that on the level of the entertainment I liked it, than, especially after air plane attack scene, goes blah-blah-blah). When I watch a film like this I often ask myself wouldn't it still be a blockbuster if the storylines were better developed, dialogs were wiser, characters were not that schematic? Ok maybe you earn a couple millions more in USA if you make the American president to save the universe, but what we, non-Americans done to deserve such a torture? I think its mainly fault of critics and ordinary viewers. The first should have burned such film for its bad taste and low level, the audience should demonstrate that of course it likes entertainment but it doesn't mean that entertaining film should be stupid and flat. But the main problem is that Americans themselves are obsessed in finding `messages' in the films. So, what is the message of this one?<br/><br/>AMERICA IS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, it saved the world from feudalism (`The Patriot'), and communism (there are more films on this subject than I can remember) , now it saves us from all possible enemies from Islamic terrorists to Godzila (by the way, it may shock some, but I LIKED GODZILLA, at least there was not that much flag waving and it seemed to be  more pure entertainment than pro-American and pro-militaristic propaganda). If the ID stayed within the limits of `Martians attack' and disaster films, it would be pretty acceptable but here all these is mixed with enormous dosage of `America, America, God shed his grace on thee' and `Rembo-Rocky-A Few Good Man-stand up and fight' turns. The resulting salad is almost unbearable."

","I don't care what anybody says, this is the best, big-screen sci-fi epic to hit us since we saw the last of the Star Wars episodes. Yeah, it's schlock and predictable, but it's also unabashed fun and great eye candy. Subtextual lines can be set to the future in anticipation of the holocaust disaster films heralding in the new decade, and backwards to America's hypocritical prejudice towards its takeover by aliens of another breed (read illegal, here). Wrap it all up in the flag-waving mythos of ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" and Hans Solo rebel forces of ""Star Wars"", and you've plucked about every heartstring out there. The cast of characters is equally diametric and dysfunctional, ranging from an alien-abducted drunk to a woody-making stripper, and passing through a scientist that's the incarnation of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Leary. There's no love lost on the young here like ""Titanic"" or ""Deep Impact"", but the film has plenty of mature sap between its token black couple, its divorced-estranged, career-vs-heart pair, and even a tear-jerk cameo from the President and his dying wife, appropriately played out in the hugging encounters from their young daughter. Typical set pieces like the nagging, Jewish father, the steady, steel-jawed General, the endearing but doomed wingman, and the conniving, weasely ex-CIA director act as anchors for the other, more fleshed-out stereotypes to breathe. Admittedly, Goldblum resurrects is too-many-brain-cells-make-you-depressed doctor from ""Jussasic Park"", but he's soooo smoooooth at it. Pullman's dedicated-but-troubled President is steady if boring, but he's effectively played off Smith's vivacious, life-loving pilot who gets to split all the good lines with Quaid's more besotted flyboy interpretation. After all the pyrotechnics and special effects have fizzled down, the film's still standing from the weight of its characterizations. And that, as the President patriotizes in his Fourth of July speech, is all that ultimately matters."

","*Warning: Potential spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>What about ID4, you say? Well, I think it doesn't deserve the 6 it has averaged at imdb.com. More like an 8. True, it has plot holes the size of New York's own potholes, and no one in his 5 senses would believe Bill Pullman could be President of the United States... or that a virus could be implanted on an alien mothership... and using a Macintosh?!?!?<br/><br/>Then again, this movie should be looked at face value: no one said it was factual, possible or even close to reality. It is science fiction, pure and simple. And it excels at that.<br/><br/>The movie is amazingly good at making people have a good time. It's simply a movie about good and bad guys, about America and their (or yours, given the case) patriotic feelings. Nothing more than that was implied in the trailer, in the posters or in the advertisment. And it works! The stunning images of the Empire State Building exploding were simply awesome. The CGI planes and alien ships had some terrific battles, similar in concept (although not in the final product) to the trench battle scenes in Star Wars (the real one, not the Fandom Menace). There were enough explosions to satisfy any action flick fan (although my neighbors might think they would have liked the movie more had I turned down a notch -or two- my subwoofer's amp). It's entertainment, and it's very good one. Just don't look for common sense or reality around here. That was not the initial premise. I loved this picture, and I drool over the DVD special edition. You really have to see the original theatrical ending. It would have been a good one.<br/><br/>I cannot rate this movie less than an 8, just because I have seen it so many times and it has never failed to entertain."

Even the respectable special effects are tainted by the context they try hard to enhance.

","After watching Independence Day, and the surge of adoration from American youth that followed, I wondered if the previous generation looked on with as much horror when the same happened for Star Wars.  I hope not.<br/><br/>Where to begin on how awful this movie is?  The drama is propped up by dozens of unlikely situations.  We're supposed to cheer as the dog jumps through the door, narrowly missing an early death by fireball.  Would the fireball really stop at the door and preserve everyone inside?  Would their oxygen not be consumed?  Later, not only a stranded fighter pilot, but a horde of RVs stumble on Area 51, just in time for the president's arrival (whose wife has just been rescued by the fighter pilot's girlfriend).  This is the worst kind of stop-gap scriptwriting.<br/><br/>The plot tries to make up for the gaping holes with extraneous material.  We are told with loving detail what the aliens look like, how their biologically-active protective suits work, of their telepathic abilities. How many aliens to we actually encounter face-to-face in the film?  You got it -- one.<br/><br/>The attempt at generating tension in the first half hour is utterly ludicrous; every person on earth has seen the previews of the White House and various other buildings being blown to smithereens by the aliens. Before the opening credits role, we know a war's on.  Why pretend we don't?<br/><br/>Independence Day was one of the first in a disturbing trend in cinema in the 1990s, culminating, I think, with The Phantom Menace: filmmaking driven by special effects.  The attitude of the film is, ""We do this because we can, not because we should.""  This inevitably leads the plot astray and dictates what course the aliens will take.  Wouldn't it be much more efficient for the technologically-advanced aliens to engineer a human-killing super virus? Sure, but then there wouldn't be great shots of L.A. getting vaporized.<br/><br/>Equally offensive is the needless off-target moralizing of the film.  It suggests that the war is about ""independence"" -- come on, guys, isn't really about survival?  The theme at the end is one of unity among the different nations, but it's a unity that consists of the U.S. telling the other guys when and where to shoot.  And if that's what unity is all about, then we've been getting along great for the last 50 years."

","Independence Day (1996) is a classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996, it was actually released the year that I was 12 years old and this film become a hit in Slovenia and it was released in movie theater's. This movie is directed by German director Roland Emmerich who also directed Universal Soldier (1992) with Jean-Claude Van Damme my favorite movie that I love to death and it is my first favorite movie of Roland Emmerich! Independence Day is the second favorite film of mine that I love to death from this director! I love this film to death, it is my favorite alien invasion sci-fi action film. The film is rated PG-13 and even with less violence this film still brings been entertaining and very interesting action movie. Of all the 90's action movies that focus more on airplanes are only two movies from the 90's I consider been best: Die Hard 2 and Independence Day I love them to death! This film stars: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia and Randy Quaid.<br/><br/>War of the Worlds (2005) remake with Tom Cruise is the only movie that I know about alien invasions and I can say is not as a good as Independence Day. I thought War of the Worlds was kinda boring film and too over long. I do have that movie on Blu-ray disc because of Tom Cruise collection but I still I am bored to death with that movie. This film is the opposite of War of the Worlds and the remake can't beat this classic epic sci-fi action film. <br/><br/>Plot: Independence Day is a 1996 science fiction action film that follows the citizens of Earth who band together to repel alien invaders determined to take the world by force.<br/><br/>The film was be followed twenty years later in 2016 with the sequel Independence Day: Resurgence. I still have to watch the sequel which I am very excited to see that film. This flick has a great talented cast such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Robert Loggia. The movie has a great practical special effects, heroism and characters that are written easily likable and sure the movie it's over the top sometimes and it doesn't hold up as maybe it did 20 years ago but it still does it's job pretty well and it's without a doubt the best film of Roland Emmerich next to Universal Soldier. <br/><br/>The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin. Along with the rest of the human population, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4 – the same date as Independence Day in the United States. <br/><br/>It has good action, good story, good characters, good mix of computer, models and practical effects which still hold up to this very day. A little trivia, when Bill Pullman gave his speech about how they are going to fight back against the aliens, I think when people saw this in South America that they actually believed Bill Pullman was the President which shows how great his acting was in this film. The scene where it is the aftermath after the attack, and we see the Statue of Liberty destroyed that was a homage to the original Planet of the Apes movie where Charlten Heston finds the Statue of Liberty destroyed. <br/><br/>I enjoy a lot of great and funny scenes with Will Smith character when he punches the alien and says ""Welcome to Earth!"" and then grabs the cigar and said, ""Now, that's what I call a close encounter!"" I totally disagree with some people who didn't care for it especially critics, it was way better than that awful ""Skyline"" and the ""War of the Worlds"" remake. In my honest I'm definitely not looking forward to the new sequel that come out, but I am going to gave a shot even tough I hear mainly negative stuff about it. <br/><br/>Overall: Independence Day is a good movie to watch on 4th of July the same date that holiday Independence Day is in the United States. 10/10 still is Roland Emmerich best film! <br/><br/>Independence Day is a 1996 American science fiction action film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. <br/><br/>10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox Starring: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Margaret Colin, Vivica A.

Plus he mad a certain 1998 film so bad I will not mention it by name ( hint-it rhymes with Modzilla). There's nothing wrong with doing spectacle driven action films so long as there is heart and entertainment value. This is where Independence Day comes in, a film that has a lot of charisma and charm. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are enthusiastic leads who manage to keep you interested even when something isn't blowing up and the film is fully aware of how dumb it is and therefore embraces it and has fun. As a result the audience has fun too. Obviously you see a movie like this for the spectacle and this film delivers as the effects still hold up even today and the action scenes are exciting and energetic. The first act build up manages to keep the viewer hooked as it climaxes with some of the most outstanding explosions ever caught on film. Followed by a fun dogfight sequence. However the film does stall during the second and first half o the third act with only the alien autopsy being interesting. However once Bill Pulmman gives his patriotic speech the film kicks into high gear once again."

","And most people rating it today were maybe not even born when it came out. Different Generations see films differently. But I saw it weeks after it came out, and the Theatre was still filled to maximum on a weekday Matinée. I stayed in the Theatre and watched it a second time. I've watched this film many times since then and the magic is still there, especially in the extended cut. As with the new ID4 film, my favorite character was Dr Brackish Okun (Named after Special Effects man Jeffery Okun) played by Star Trek: Next Generation's Brent Spiner.<br/><br/>Emmerich and Devlin should have used this film as a template when making their sequel, it seems they had forgotten how to tell this story. The fast pace, multiple character stories, and wry humor kept you glued to it. Randy Quaid's ""Russel Casse"" basically stole the film just like Brent Spiner did with the second one. What works is the flawed characters, both of these people, Casse and Okun, have serious social character flaws but they both rise above their perceived Geekness to become heroes.<br/><br/>But what made this film great was the way they Composited practical special effects with the primitive Apple CGI of the time. When they showed the Alien Mothership and the 13-mile wide invasion ships, they looked not only big, but real. The Pyrotechnics were all filmed with real models of the cities that were being destroyed, upside down, so the Alien Weapons aftermath do not follow the laws of physics.<br/><br/>Another thing that was not done in the new version, but was exploited here, was the use of an Apple Laptop as mankind's best weapon against an alien invasion. In the new time-line generated by this story, we have to assume the Apple Cupertino plant was destroyed, and there never were any IMacs, IPhones, or even modern day tablets and smartphones. Instead, advances in computing and Aerodynamics were affected by the infusion of Alien Tech. So the world depicted in ID4: Insurgence was not the familiar landscape we see here, which was totally destroyed.<br/><br/>That probably made it difficult to insert modern day products into that story, as none existed. The Only thing we see there, was QQ taking over global communications due to by the void of ATT being gone.<br/><br/>Emmerich and Devlin created an invasion story of special magnificence, something so large we could not have imagined it until we saw it here. 1953's ""War of the Worlds"" came close, but we never saw the level of destruction that is shown here as three major US cites are totally eradicated, blown to smithereens, vaporized, gutted and otherwise obliterated.<br/><br/>It seems they tried to make the Alien Invasion force in ""Resurgence"" even bigger than what we see here, and it does not work at all. But the nature of the invaders was explored more in the sequel. This installment gives us a first look.<br/><br/>But mostly the interaction between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is clever, even the relationship between Goldblum and his ""father"" Judd Hirsh (From ""Taxi"") which is just like so many of us in our relationships with our fathers. Especially with Russel Casse and the love of his kids, despite his alcoholism. And President Whitmore and his daughter, Captain Steven Hiller and his Fiancé Vivica A Fox and her son. So this film explores how family dynamics would be affected in such a scenario. That aspect is severely lacking in the new sequel.<br/><br/>Mainly it's a story about heroism, not Jingoism. Nobody waves any one flag, it's the whole world united, Israel and Palestine working and fighting together for a common cause. Which is the world we all would like to see eventually. Here it takes an Alien Invasion to bring people together. Hopefully that won't be the case. Ironically, the world was closer to that goal when this film came out than it is today."

All I know is that it wasn't until the sequel, ""Resurgence"" hit theaters that I decided to sit down and actually watch this movie.<br/><br/>Now that I have, what did I think?

But in all seriousness, the movie is just downright cheesy, from the plot to the characters to the lines, cheese galore.<br/><br/>That having been said, the movie is nevertheless watchable and fun in its own right. There's an element of it that feels almost like it was made for little kids or teenagers--it certainly has the feel of a 90's era video game. But whatever the audience it might have been intended for, it does make for a fun film overall--which is why I've given it 6/10 stars.

","In the 1990s and the early to late 2000s, Roland Emmerich, a German director, directed a few movies. Some of them were science-fiction, action-oriented, thriller, and disaster related. This film in particular.<br/><br/>Aliens have come to our planet and destroyed most of our countries. Only a few people survived and with the help of the president of the White House, a military solider, and a nerdy scientist, they plan to fight against the aliens on Independence Day and destroy them once and for all.<br/><br/>I'm reviewing this on Independence Day because considering that's how the battle between the humans and aliens started and the sequel just came out two weeks and three days ago. Anyway, this is a really good film. Nothing awesome or anything, but still good. I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else hated this film and Roland Emmerich in general, but as a big fan of action films that have heart, this one actually worked for me. There are some problems that I want to address before I can get to the good parts.<br/><br/>First, the story. The concept is very fresh. The idea of humans fighting against the aliens as the part of patriotism is really original, but when it comes to the overall narrative, it's very formulaic and it does contain lots of clichés that plagued the later Roland Emmerich films. Second, some of the dialog does come across as clichéd and unbelievably cheesy and the character development seemed to be lacking at times. That's it for the flaws. Now for the good parts.<br/><br/>Despite what I said about the dialog, the overall acting is great. I mean, talk about a big cast of talented actors. Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Harvey Fierstein, Randy Quaid, and yours truly, Will Smith. All of these actors did really well and gives the characters some likability. Also, the one liners, aside from the cheesy and clichéd moments, are really funny, the best coming from Will Smith.<br/><br/>Also, the patriotism theme of the movie is presented really well and shows that if we work together as a united nation, we can defeat our enemies and bring peace to the world. The special effects, despite being a little dated, are still nice especially the spaceships designs which were also pretty cool. The action sequences are great and the explosions of all the countries are well-shot.<br/><br/>The best part, however, would have to go to the music score from David Arnold. The guy composed some of the later James Bond films and even did some great music for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. His score here is beyond fantastic. It has heart, it has an epic tone, it has some strong action cues, and it fits the patriotism theme of the film perfectly. Particularly with the President's speech scene which made me shed some tears. That's all I have to say.<br/><br/>Like I said before, I understand why the Nostalgia Critic and everyone else didn't like this film, but in spite of it's problems, I actually think this is a really good film for the fourth of July. Yes, it's a little cheesy, but to be fair, the 80s did had it's share of cheesy stuff and we were OK with it. So, overall, Independence Day is a really good patriotic science fiction action film and I think that it's one of Roland Emmerich's three best films, the other two being Stargate and the Patriot. To those who haven't seen it yet, go check it out and you'll enjoy the ride. Thumbs up. :)"

","This is definitely one of the best summer movies ever. It has a lot of action and plenty of aliens to fight. This is also the movie to be watching every 4th of July. Sure aliens may not exist, but this movie is worth watching. Also the operation room scene where they were operating on the alien until the alien came awake used to scare me as a kid. Also I laugh at that one guys raspy voice every time I hear it. Also the aliens in this movie are really cool. I used to have a toy of one those aliens. This movie will always be a part of my childhood and I still like it today. We'll also never forget the famous speech scene with Bill Pullman in this movie."

","Off quality, this probably deserves a 7 or 6, but if there is one movie that has so much fun and great parts to overcome flaws and logic errors, it's this. Sure, the president flies a plane, but come on! Unrealistic, sure, but patriotic as heck! Will Smith punches an alien with a one liner-corny, yes, but still entertaining. Alien space ships target tourist attractions before military but again, beautiful spectacle. This movie has great performances by every actor with so much charisma. Not one character is unlikable. Plus, it has one of the best movie speeches followed by an awesome aerial battle. Seeing humans put aside their differences to work together is magnificent."
"timdalton007","9","0","0","1 July 2016"," ID4 At Twenty
","It seems difficult to believe that Independence Day turns twenty years old this year. One of the biggest films of the 1990s, ID4 (as it was known in publicity material) became one of the biggest crossing films of the decade and a template for the current era of disaster films. Yet despite its age, it's a film that continues to stand up remarkably well.<br/><br/>For one thing, it's well cast. While Will Smith has become a well known name as a result of this film and others like it, the ID4 cast is perhaps wisely made up largely of character actors who all give performances that help sell the incredible events of the film. These range from Jeff Goldblum as an MIT educated computer expert, Smith's fighter pilot Steve Hiller, Bill Pullman's President of the United States who comes into his own during the film's events to a supporting cast that includes Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Mary McDonnell, Randy Quaid and Brent Spiner among others. Each has standout moments that helps to make the film work though with the potential exception of Smith no one really steals the show. It's as good an example as any of what an ensemble cast is capable of and especially so in a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>What the film is perhaps best remembered for is its effects. Two decades later and shown either on large screen televisions or projected on screens, those effects hold up pretty well. From the opening scene on the Moon to the ship's entry over major cities to dogfights above cities and deserts, the film's is a powerful showing of what was being done on the end of the physical effects era and the beginning of heavy CGI effects. Yet the film's iconic moments as the White House, Empire State Building and other landmarks are wiped out (done with impressive physical models) makes a compelling case for a way of doing effects that has largely vanished in recent years. Perhaps the makers of this film, who helped to spur those efforts, might need to take a look at their work from two decades ago?<br/><br/>Beyond that, the film might well be the best thing that director Rolland Emmerich (and his producer/co-writer Dean Devlin) have ever produced. Independence Day is a surprisingly well constructed film, using the classic three act structure in a big budget sci- fi/disaster movie complex as we get set-up, defeat and then one last battle all in the space of around two and a half hours. Despite showing the worldwide nature of the film's events, it only rarely seems to hint at it briefly which makes the film feel at times oddly American centric (something overseas reviewers have noted for years) yet perhaps it notable that the filmmakers at least made the effort to expand the story at all. Combined with dialogue and knowing homages to some of the genre's classics, the result is a film that is tense and utterly enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the the film's extended version as well. That version, which has seen the light of day on home video, contains some nine extra minutes of footage which is immensely helpful to the film. Not only does it help to flesh out not only characters but also some of the plot points that have been somewhat criticized over the years including setting up the film's ending. In a way it's a shame that version wasn't the original theatrical version or the one that came to be so well known on home video initially as it is a superior cut of the film to say the least.<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention is David Arnold's score. Though Arnold has already scored Stargate and was a year away from scoring the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, it's this score that likely brought Arnold to greater attention than anything else. Though British, Arnold created one of the definitive American film scores of all time that includes rousing action scores and a memorable main theme. Yet Arnold's score also proves adept at both tension in the film's first hour and most especially in the lead-up to iconic moments as well as mournful sounds in its aftermath. It's a fine piece of work and a calling card for Arnold even today.<br/><br/>Keeping all that in mind, it isn't to see why Independence Day was a success both then and now. It's a well-cast, visual spectacle that uses classical story structuring, witty dialogue and a rousing score to produce a story that is as much a joy to watch now as it was twenty years ago. However one feels about its belated sequel, there is no doubting the power and success of this film. <br/><br/>And long may it continue to entertain generations to come."

","1996 was a vastly different time for big time blockbusters. Independence Day is easily one of the most famous end-of-the-world blockbusters, but sadly, 20 years later, it doesn't necessarily hold up. With painfully cheesy one-liners and one-too many characters to follow, it's a less than stellar take on the alien invasion genre.<br/><br/>One thing that does stand out is the ensemble cast. Perhaps besides Harvey Fierstein, I really enjoyed the entire cast. With a powerhouse like Will Smith bringing the charisma and most of the film's comedy, all you need is some solid supporting cast members to carry the rest of the weight, although let's face it, Jeff Goldblum plays the exact same character he does in Jurassic Park. Having said that, there are far too many characters that feel entirely unnecessary and end up bloating the film to an hour and a half. Cut half of the supporting roles and 30min of screen time and you have a much more re-watchable film.<br/><br/>I can't entirely blame the film for having dated special effects, especially since it won an Oscar for them. However, I can blame the film for having a script and direction that doesn't seem to care enough to develop the characters and story into a respectable blockbuster territory. Perhaps it's because we are so inundated with mega-films that do all of these things so well that I got a little upset watching Independence Day. How many times can Roland Emmerich zoom the camera in on someone giving a shocked face at the alien's ship? It happens at least 20 times within the first hour.<br/><br/>This film definitely has its copycats, as Emmerich recently pointed out in an interview. But he took a lot from the previous sci-fi epics that came before him. Everything from the music, end credits (visually), to the space battles felt like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek film. With that said, none of those films have as good of a speech as Bill Pullman does as he rallied the pilots before the final takedown. That's right about when I began to accept the film for what it is and forgive some of the horrifically cheesy moments.<br/><br/>Although the film is over 140 minutes long, we never really get a sense as to the alien's motivations or backstory as to their appearance on earth, which was disappointing for sure. Why did we need to follow the kids of one of the pilots, who barely had a role, and not get a little bit more insight from the aliens point of view? These are just a few of the issues I had with the film, but really, it's mindless fun that doesn't really need to be dissected to such an extent. Overall, it's half way decent and likely better than it has any right to be.<br/><br/>+Will Smith's ridiculous one-liners<br/><br/>+Pullman's speech<br/><br/>+Mindless fun<br/><br/>-Enough with the close-ups<br/><br/>-Too many side characters<br/><br/>-And they are focused on way too much<br/><br/>6.0/10"

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","24 June 2016"," Explosive science-action thriller is a whole lot of fun
","For over thousands years, mankind has been hit with a powerfully intriguing question: Are we alone, or is there life on other planets. Scientists to do this day still continue to investigate whether extraterrestrial life is existent on other planets or has visited our planet when we didn't know it. This sci-fi action thriller formulates an obvious fictional account of mankind's fight for survival against the large army of aliens who are set to invade Earth. The concept isn't terribly new as we experienced it before in H.G. Wells' War of The World's, but it's not say the film doesn't succeed on its own merits. Showering us with a wide plethora of eye-popping special effects and CGI, director Roland Emmerich blasts the screen with an high-octane action flick swarming with pulse-pounding action sequences and pure charisma, resulting in what was called in 1996 ""the biggest movie of the summer"". The film opens up in July 2nd when communication systems are mysteriously failing from strange signals picking up outside the atmosphere. When the U.S military discover what appears to be meteors set to collide into Earth, they discover these strange objects are nothing other than gigantic spaceships run by aliens who appear to be here for a warm welcome. Soon, ex-scientist David Levinson (played by Jefd Goldblum) learn of their plot to invade our home planet when the aliens launch an attack on major cities including Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles; resulting in the death of millions. With the future of the human race dangling, United States President Thomas Whitmore (played by Bill Pullman) on July 3rd, orders a large scale attack against the alien army with cocky Air Force pilot Captain Steven Hiller (played by Will Smith) leading the operation in attempt to save mankind. <br/><br/>This big-budget action flick isn't highly original, nor does it leave a landmark on science- fiction genre. But it's hard to deny what a hell of a thrill ride it is, even if it's not a highly intelligent concept. From the opening minutes of the alien invasion, we are introduced to the startling, yet chord-striking shots of landmarks such as the White House, the Empire State Building, and other major downtown areas as they're obliterated into fiery explosions in front of a massive crowd of spectators. From that point, we know are in an intense ride. When it comes special effects, director Roland Emmerich doesn't play around. He embraces his beauty in jaw-dropping effects, and the air battle scenes involving Air Force pilots against the small alien spaceships make fine evidence of this. Though these scenes appear to borrow elements from other sci-fi classics like 'Star Wars' or 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind', there is plenty of excitement to be endured, including some funny (and occasionally no-brainer) one-liners uttered by the characters and the sheer likability of Will Smith playing a cocky pilot who embraces his commitment in active combat while maintaining an appropriately comedic attitude. If there is any flaw sustained in during the near 2 1/2 hour runtime, it probably comes from the shortage of properly developed characters as the mass array of action clouds over the character development, though the plot stands surprisingly stable throughout. In the end, we can't help but hope of these characters survival and success on their mission to save mankind from extermination. <br/><br/>Independence Day is an exciting science-fiction popcorn thriller with dazzling special effects and decent, if slightly cheesy performances. This film isn't exactly what I consider a classic nor influential. Overall, it is a solidly entertaining and leaves a good note on Roland Emmerich's resume. Due to the amazing quality of the film, it makes me excited for the sequel 'Indepedence Day: Resurgence' which is set to hit theaters this weekend."

The premise of the film sees an alien invasion that forces the whole world to unite to stop them. Jeff goldblum is a brilliant actor and he is really good in this film. I found hid character pretty interesting and I found him really entertaining throughout the film. Will Smith was an unknown at this point but he just oozes charisma in this film. I also liked his character and how he and goldblum interacted. Bill Pullman plays the president of the United states and he is possibly the coolest president in film history. He has a pretty emotional journey throughout this film and I really cared about him. I thought the two love interests were good as well as they worked and I bought there romance with smith and goldblum. The story has some decent character moments and depth to its characters. Unfortunately, the film is a little simple and it comes across with a few plot holes and clichés that don't help the decent run time. The script has some decent drama and humour in it but it just has quite a bit of ridiculous cheese in it.

","Watching ""Independence Day"" takes me back to that fateful day in early 1996. I saw the trailer right before ""Broken Arrow"" and that image of a wall of fire and debris coming toward the screen blew my 15 year-old mind . Some serious seeds were sown that day. So I guess I've got a soft spot for this movie even to this day. Even now, those fireballs are still pretty awesome, and even after seeing this as much as I have, I still get caught up in it.<br/><br/>To me, ""Independence Day"" is synonymous with huge effects spectacle, at least in terms of Summer escapism. In a way, the movie really embodies it. Sure, we've had billion-dollar grossers since then, but can any of those movies really compare? None of them scream the July 4th holiday like this one, even while famous D.C. landmarks are decimated. I dare say that this has become synonymous with the idea of tentpole Summer titles, and even ingrained as a patriotic movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's the assured direction and across-the-board likability of the cast that makes this so watchable. I love the dogfights, and to this day, Bill Pullman's speech is rousing, to say the least. As cliché-ridden as this is, it's very well packaged.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Much as I like the film from an action standpoint, I give it 7 stars for being full of just plain stupid science fiction clichés. An object one fifth the mass of the moon would show up from its gravitational effects long before getting anywhere close to Earth. Then it sheds a fleet of ships 15 miles in diameter that station themselves over major world cities. Ships that huge would be almost impossible for anything short of a nuclear weapon to damage, plus big enough to house fleets bigger than any nation's air force. But no, they have to have shields, too. Then it turns out the aliens have - you'll never see this coming - telepathy, too. In desperation, the President orders a nuclear strike. A ship 15 miles in diameter and a mile thick would suffer a hole maybe a couple of miles across. Something that, on the scale of that ship, would just buff out. But, no, the shield protects the ship. It's not like they'd be likely to have a defense system capable of shooting down any incoming weapon. <br/><br/>And of course, there's something big and secret at Area 51, where we have an alien ship under study. I'm surprised they didn't work in the Bermuda Triangle and the Maya calendar. Meanwhile, the First Lady has been fatally injured and turns up at Area 51 to say good-bye. Ridiculous. There's this huge underground lab with all sorts of equipment, and not a single person with any medical training? Not even someone with combat medic training? She's dying. Operate, already. She can't end up any more dead than if you just sit there and do nothing.<br/><br/>When the mother ship popped into town, the captive ship at Area 51 turned on, to the joy of everyone because ""we couldn't replicate their power source."" So then Jeff Goldblum decides to fly it by hooking up a terrestrial laptop. So if the alien ship used unknown power, how did the terrestrial PC communicate? Because terrestrial computers use ordinary electricity to send signals. The much ridiculed assumption that the aliens lack firewalls and computer protection pales into insignificance against our not being able to start up the alien systems when they can obviously use electricity.<br/><br/>Oh, spoiler alert, we don't all die."

It's not supposed to be a deep philosophical discussion about Man Against The Universe, nor an attempt to seriously visualize the possible consequences of alien invasion. It's meant to be good fun, watching Our Heroes struggle valiantly against The Evil Alien Hordes. And remember, this film is brain's candy, not brain's food.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly one of the most fun sci-fi movies in history. The tale starts with a ship roughly 1/4 size of the moon entering orbit of earth, only to send down multiple city sized ships to our cities to wipe out humanity. This is one of those movies where you won't realize you've spent nearly 3 hours in front of your set. In fact, you'll probably want more.. I think there's really nothing particularly special about this film, other than it manages to fit all it's 'block-buster' fair into such a tight package, and casts it so well, that it works. Again, I go on about pacing, but for me it's crucial in a 'block-buster' film. The characters are a distinctly stock: cool, macho pilot, geek who saves the day, drunk who comes good in a crisis, US President who is also action man (cf Airforce One). The special effects are very good, but alone this doesn't explain success (anyone remember Dune?). I think this movie succeeds, because it is fun.

","Independence Day is directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum. These three characters represent an Air Force pilot (Smith), the President of the U.S. (Pullman), and a low life tech whiz (Goldblum). When aliens from outer space attack Earth, these three, along with the remaining survivors, must come together to defeat the aliens and restore freedom to the human race. This all takes place on the 4th of July, as well, because of America.<br/><br/>To start, this movie isn't supposed to be serious, and it's not supposed to make too much sense. This film was purely made to be fun, and to entertain the audience. And that's exactly what it does. Although the movie isn't amazing critically, it's a blast in every way possible. I could watch this movie in the summer (heck, on Independence Day), when it's too hot to go outside, or on a cold winter day when I'm snowed inside the house and can't leave. This movie isn't The Shawshank Redemption (1994), but I'll watch this movie way more than I will Shawshank.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Bill Pullman do great in their roles. Will Smith plays the awesome action hero, that eventually learns to care about people other than himself, including his girlfriend and her son. Jeff Goldblum, while playing Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1994), plays a good science geek, that eventually becomes another action hero. Bill Pullman is actually believable as the President, and learns that being such a high up position means more than just having the title and giving commands; you have to personally help your people.<br/><br/>The special effects are also great; in fact, they were ground- breaking for 1996. All of the shots of alien spaceships look really believable, and the use of practical effects on the aliens themselves was very smart. The shot of an alien ship blowing up the white house was amazing; I don't know how they did that.<br/><br/>The only real bad thing about this movie is the human's plan to take down the aliens. I don't want to spoil it, but it doesn't make sense barely at all. It's plausible, but it's about a .00001% chance that it would actually work. However, the same could be said about Bill Pullman being the President.<br/><br/>Overall, Independence Day is a very fun movie that's hard to look at critically. It has very few cons, and revolutionary special effects. I'm going to give Independence Day a B+, or an 8 out of 10."

The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.<br/><br/>The tension was akin to any good crime drama but the plot kept it teasingly interesting. Why didn't I hear of this book? Anyways, Eddie(Bradley Cooper) is trying to meet a deadline after breaking it off with the love of his life(Abbie Cornish),and is on a downward spiral. He runs into an ex-brother-in-law who appears to be a druggie, but is actually involved in designer drug production, and is ensnared in a plot that leads him from the Russian Mafia to Wall Street. The science behind this movie is very believable and I applaud the producers for being brave enough to bringing it to the screen"

","An excellent 'Bridget Jones' style chick flick starring the always irritating William Smith. Set in the mid nineties we see earth visited by a large number of obnoxious aliens. Arriving in America unannounced and lacking visas, passports and other travel documents, the aliens are turned away. Angered by the decision the aliens start to get a tad rowdy, blowing things up and generally becoming a nuisance. This kind of bad behaviour isn't to be tolerated, not in America and certainly not in China who as we know are a very respectful race. Someone needs to tell the aliens enough is enough it's time to pack up and go home or apply for a travel visa through the correct channels. The stage is set for a hero and we are treated to four of them. A pilot (Will Smith), a scientist (Geoffrey Goldbloom), a paranoid schizophrenic (Randy Quaid) and hilariously the president of America (Bill Pulman). Smith gets the ball rolling by catching an alien an dishing out a viscous beating, knocking the terrified alien unconscious and fracturing it's cheek bone. Smith high on a mixture of adrenaline and painkillers teams up with Goldbloom and steals an alien ship in a bid to destroy the aliens mothership. With Smith and Goldbloom gone, it's left up to our schizophrenic and the president to lead the world in a battle to end the anti social loutish behaviour of the aliens. Quaid clearly very confused and possessing no flight training what so ever, attempts to leave with the aliens, driving a plane up to the aliens ship he screams 'hello boys I'm back' indicating he is on friendly terms with several of the aliens or has simply been drinking heavily. Tragically however his lack of training forces him to lose control of his plane at a critical moment crashing into the alien ship causing an obscene amount of damage and countless alien casualties. Eventually the aliens tire of the hard line approach adopted by the American government and simply toddle off home, tails between their legs but pride very much intact. A must watch film for the whole family and an Oscar winning performance from Quaid!"

The American president has to struggle with that weasel, I don't remember what his job was, to prevent Earth from being destroyed by radioactive waste. It's good to see the president's optimism.

","In this film, directed by Roland Emmerich (the man who likes to destroy the earth again and again and again), the Earth is threatened by giant alien ships that come out of nowhere in the sky, covering the major cities on the planet. The first attacks confirm the worst expectations: they are hostile. It's the opportunity of ""Uncle Sam"" to save the world from bad guys in full holiday of July 4th. From cast we can detach Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell, respectively in the role of an Air Force airman, the U.S. President and his wife.<br/><br/>This film addresses a theme that recurs in the film: aliens, and the possibility of they want to invade us. The question is what we would have so interesting to arouse that desire. The film also raises another question: although the film is American, why are Americans always the heroes of such films? The answer is simple: because only then these films can be used as propaganda to United States and all they represent. And if doubts exist of that see the title itself: the ""independence day"" has nothing to do with aliens but with the holiday of U.S. independence declaration. The way it's portrayed the US president himself also helps to see the ""hidden"" nature of this film.<br/><br/>Although the actors fail to surprise and the script aren't innovative (even recalls, partially, the H.G. Wells novel ""War of the Worlds""), the film becomes interesting for the visual and special effects, which earned the Oscar for this category. Also the sound effects deserve a very positive note. Therefore, sci-fi and special effects lovers: this film was made entirely for you, especially if you are American."

","Roland Emmerich. The name is synonymous with epic-level disaster movies. From Godzilla 2000 to 2012, Mr Emmerich has made the majority of a career of making movies on the edge of largest as possible. He has created a model that has allowed the return of disaster movies and it started with Independence Day.<br/><br/>The movie depicts a struggle between humanity-reeling from devastating attacks and highly advanced alien invaders. The story follows a select group of these survivors enduring attacks on a genocide scale. Mr. Emmerich was able to put together an all star cast to complement the Oscar-winning visual effects.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman leads the cast as the President of the United States, a steady youthful figure who falls into the standard profile of a cinematic President. Jeff Goldblum continued his trend of playing the scientist figure who suffers in life due to his lack of emotional expression. Will Smith in a role that cemented his meteoric rise to acting stardom plays an air force pilot. Costars include Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and musician, Harry Connick Jr.<br/><br/>While the movie's theme coincides with it's release weekend, July 3rd; the movie itself tends to pay homage to films such as Star Wars, The Day the Earth Stood Still and other classic science fiction movies. This is done primarily through familiar camera angles and setups that were pioneered during the classic era.<br/><br/>While Mr. Emmerich's cast does a good job of moving the plot forward and showing appropriate emotion as needed; Independence Day shows it's weaknesses during predictable plot twists and the lack of a singular identifiable antagonist. The movie now nineteen years old has stood the test of time and compared with today's blockbusters still is able to show it's quality."

","This and Terminator 2. There is a lot to like about film. Of course, there are plenty of clichés and if you take the time to do an in- depth analysis, you will find a few plot holes (however minor). But the film overall is really good. The cast is really good at exhibiting emotion (with the exception of Will Smith who always acts like a comedian). SPOILER ALERT: I really felt it when the President's wife died or when David and Constance were discussing their divorce. The movie also really deserves it's Oscar for best special effects. That shot of the White House blowing up is SO good, you wince (not because the effect was bad, but because it's the freakin' White House being blown to smithereens.) The film borrows elements used previously by other alien/sci-fi action films but it also has many unique elements. I mean, how many action movies nowadays take almost an hour to develop characters before getting to the main action? (That was a good choice, on behalf of the film, BTW. I was pleasantly surprised when watching it for the first time.) Bottom line, the film has it's cheesy moments, but it is very entertaining, fun and even heartfelt at times. I loved it. Must-watch for any sci-fi or action movie fan."

","This movie in my opinion shouldn't be rated 6.5 out of 10, it was a pretty good movie, it's a tale about how aliens come down to earth to invade us, and all humans have to set aside their differences and work together to defeat them. Will smith was a great actor in these type of movies (men in black) and rocked his roll as the captain. And for the time when they made it is amazing! Almost as good as the effects that we have today. This my first time watching it, and I can't even wait to see the sequel. I can't believe the budget for the sequel is 200,000,000. It better be really good to spend that type of money on it."
"byson5186","7","0","0","7 July 2015"," Action Entertaining, Characters Forgettable
","It seems like about every holiday has a movie based on the holiday. Frequently, the movies are also named after the holiday as they did it with this movie. Most of the movies named after a holiday are not action movies with exception to this one. This movie is a movie you can definitely expect to see on TV during the 4th of July, as that holiday just happened. A little like how you can definitely expect to see Home Alone and Home Alone 2 on TV during the holiday season, and if you're like me, you'll like watching them around the holidays to get into the holiday spirit. This movie would definitely be an entertaining movie to watch on Independence Day with friends. Seeing action in movies naturally excites us and keeps our eyes on the screen. The action in this movie is definitely one to excite you.<br/><br/>So, while this movie has some entertaining action it definitely has flaws which I notice and you probably notice too. Like the biggest example I think has to be getting to know the characters. This movie has multiple main characters, and scenes keep switching from one character to the next. We might remember a couple of the actors that starred in this movie, but we will probably forget the name of the character they played. As the scenes keep switching from characters, it is hard for us to keep up with all of them and a lot of the scenes we see them in where there isn't action are slow scenes. They don't seem like characters you'd write a wiki article after or really care to know about their background outside of the movie. The characters mostly seem like just a group of people from different backgrounds handling an alien invasion. Will Smith also starred in the movie Men In Black which also dealt with aliens and came out less than a year after this one does. We seem to get to know his character better in that movie than this one, and we'd probably think of Men In Black a little more as entertaining, and his character is a little more funny in that movie.<br/><br/>Again, the action scenes are cool. The first action sequence has to be the most memorable as it is seen in the covers of this movie. It is sometimes even shown in pop culture, like they show a scene from the first action sequence in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. The action sequences after that look like scenes from a Star Wars movie, or a video game. They remind me of a video game I used to play, Star Fox 64. Those scenes are cool and can be cheesy at times, but also have humor to them. They also have really good special effects that seem to work really well, almost 20 years later.<br/><br/>The plot from this movie does not seem too out of the ordinary. It seems like a common plot of having aliens come to earth. Some aliens coming in peace, and others wrecking havoc like this one, and humanity having to find ways to defend themselves. About movies of aliens coming in peace, one movie which I feel like is way underrated and it seems like half the people who saw this movie loves it, is a movie that came out last year called Earth To Echo. I'd go far enough to consider that the greatest movie ever made, and I'd strongly recommend it. Also, another movie I'd recommend in movies named after holidays which I feel like is slow but entertaining, and the slow scenes in that movie are more entertaining than the slow scenes in this movie is called Labor Day. I enjoyed it when I saw it.<br/><br/>One thing I always remember from watching this movie on TV and how it's on during Independence Day and I remember this from many years ago. If you watch movies on TV, they frequently shorten some scenes and go to commercials at the exact same time every year you watch it on TV. I notice that with Home Alone, how some scenes are shortened and one scene in particular from Home Alone that I remember them going to commercials to is after Kevin looks out the window after fooling the crooks of people in the house using mannequins, if you watch it on like TBS. In this movie, from what I remember watching it from like 18-years ago as a kid also on Independence Day. While I don't know this movie well enough to talk about shortened scenes, I always remember how one time this movie switches to commercials is after the first action sequence right after the light bulb in the tunnel pops. A way to keep us watching to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>So, the movie is entertaining and in one sentence it's flaws are not getting to know the characters, sometimes cheesy, not a lot of plot, something that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary, and some slow scenes for a 2+ hour movie. This movie has seemed to change how we see movies and action in cinemas since it came out and I look forward to it's sequel. Though this movie doesn't seem like the type of movie that needs a sequel or can go in the direction for a sequel. So, despite it's flaws because of the action and entertainment I give it a 7/10."

","If you're looking to poke ""Independence Day"", it gives you plenty of ammunition, including an abundance of clunky dialogue, some cornball characterizations (and a few actors who crank up the corn to 11 -- namely Harry Connick Jr. and Randy Quaid), occasional poor CG, boring creature design, and a miraculous magical plot contrivance that is supposed to save the day for us humans. I think all of that is compensated for by the giddy, go-for-broke exuberance with which the movie amps up the scale of destruction, even while keeping the story tightly focused on a handful of nicely played characters who the story brings together smoothly and effectively. Amidst the dialogue groaners and the fake-looking fireballs, it's easy to miss all the big and small things the movie does right -- especially, of course, laying waste to New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. in a thrilling cross-cut sequence. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum play off each other better than I would have expected and they are supported by an able cast who create a credible ensemble, one member of which actually dies (something disaster movies seem to have forgotten how to do of late). Though the creature design was pedestrian even at the time, the set design of the alien ships remains imaginative and visually compelling. All in all, this film is a blast."

","""Welcome to Earth!"" Sci-fi disaster flicks don't get any bigger than this 1996 blockbuster, oozing destruction and explosions left and right on practically every frame. The forty-seventh highest grossing film of all time, it was at the forefront of the large- scale disaster film and science resurgences of the mid-to-late 1990s. But do the effects outweigh character? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>Director Roland Emmerich takes us on a roller coaster ride in saving the world from non-peaceful extraterrestrials of whom, rather than the friendly aliens from 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T.', are bent on planning to decimate the very existence of mankind with their monstrously menacing mothership, where in one sequence the White House is blasted to smithereens. The film also features an all-star cast: Bill Pullman (as United States president Thomas J. Whitmore playing a Bill Clinton-esque persona, alongside the Hillary-esque First Lady portrayed by Mary McDonnell), Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated computer expert, chess enthusiast and environmentalist, the cool, charming and cocky Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller,an assured U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 pilot and Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, a widowed alcoholic redneck and Vietnam veteran who claims to have been abducted by the aliens a decade before the present Martian invasion and of whom eventually sacrifices himself to save mankind. <br/><br/>As far as it's concerned, it's just a spectacle-filled summer popcorn flick that presents a visually slick and fast-paced adventure, boasting expensive special effects and large-scale action sequences that appears more of an actual character than anyone actually in front of the camera, borrowing liberally from H. G. Welles' 'War of the Worlds', 'Aliens' and every sci-fi invasion film in between. Poor on character development but dripping with all-too realistic visual effects, 'Independence Day' nonetheless thus resulted as an international smash-hit, and remains a big and loud sci-fi extravaganza, exploding with gigantic visual grandeur of stunning visual proportions that were, and still are, out of this world."

For Example, the effects in this movie are great! The aliens are original and the explosions are quite believable, even if they are CGI. The plot is just another alien takeover. Just think of War of the Worlds meets Top Gun. The characters are OK. That's the nicest things to say about them. Jeff Goldblum plays JEFF GOLDBLUM! That's it. The only actor who's trying is Will Smith, but he makes everything he's in awesome! The movie is just OK. The movie is silly, but harmless. It has plot holes, but the action distracts you from them.

","I will admit, I have loved Independence Day ever since the movie came out. The movie has a good story with a great set of special effects.<br/><br/>In the beginning; when the when the SETI guy hears a radio signal while he's listening to REM's song ""It's the end of the world as we know it"", I call that a classic moment. Then including Jeff Goldblum's entry to the movie and the aliens sudden invasions to blow-up the cities. The fight back is rather entertaining, but the movie starts going down once they go into the whole Area 51 alien myth (a place that in real life isn't even called Area 51 officially).<br/><br/>I love the movie up to the the stuff with Will Smith, his character has some of the most ridiculous macho-man scenes, in rather unbelievable action scenes along with his tribute to the tobacco companies. Along side Jeff Goldblum's saving of the world with an overnight written computer virus for the aliens is rather unbelievable, especially since he starts this immediately after he was tripping around drunk.<br/><br/>If anything, a movie like Independence Day is 100 times better than movies like E.T. and Contact. Although, Independence Day always makes me think of a quote from the movie's producer (Bill Pay) who made a quote in a classic Discovery Channel documentary ""Inside Area 51"": ""I, in my heart, would like to think that there are aliens at Area 51, but don't really believe it until I see more."""

","This film is on the whole not very good film. It has its moments, but is mostly mediocre action, but it is entertaining. It's just far too melodramatic IMO. I like the top secret program that even the president is ignorant of, a concept in a story I wrote, but the sci fi is just far too Hollywood to be good. Enough time is not devoted to that. The acting has its good qualities with some of the actors, and some of the characters have a likable quality, while others have this sort of, again, overly dramatic caricature. The father who sacrifices himself to save the world is not overly dramatic in itself, but even a nice touch. One of the better ones even. But the way he does it, with all the ""come to mama"" and ""I'm back, boys!' is just hokey. It really makes you cringe like you do at a person who tries to hard to be funny. But when I cringed at this, the moving moment made up for it. I hate to be using the same words, but it was a bit too feel good an dramatic. All of a sudden the world was just all friendly and kumba-ya? Pfft. But it's a fun movie. I'll watch it many times, just because it has that classic 90s thing to it. Will Smith is his usual self, an actor I do not tend to like, though he has his talent. But he's likable, though I am not sure he is the great actor he is made out to be. Some people are like that. You can hate their acting, but like them. On the acting the acting is not great actually, but it may be the horrible script. Watch it over and over, but far better stuff out there."

","Most seem to say this is a terrible film, but I just find it so damn exciting! It doesn't exactly lack content, but I admit some of its content is over-the-top at times.<br/><br/>We are flooded with iconography of American culture at the opening of the film, such as a plaque we left behind on the moon saying that we ""came in peace"" with the original mission. Then, after a shadow passing over the moon, foreshadowing danger, we see many icons such as the statue of liberty, the Iwo Jima Flag monument and the Washington monument. We are shown America as a striving world power throughout the film.<br/><br/>While the film touches on unity from people of different status/ethnicity/gender, it mainly does this with American characters. Other nationalities are conveyed as the U.S. sends them information on how to defeat the aliens through Morse code. This is a little disappointing from a film that is about unity between nations to fight a danger from another world.<br/><br/>What bothers me is that we are given the aliens' motivation rather abruptly through the fictional President portrayed by Bill Pullman who just happens to ""see"" their intent, and the intent is somewhat stupid coming from an ""intelligent"" species.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks in intellect (which isn't as much as harsh critics say it lacks) is entertainment and excitement, and while films are meant to make us think and portray a good story, they are also about entertaining audiences; after all, movies are money- makers. When watching this film we were bursting out laughing at certain points in the film, and rightfully so. ""Welcome to Earth"" is such a great line no matter how campy it seems.<br/><br/>This is a better movie than people may say, and although it is more about the spectacle it is much better than most Michael Bay films."

","There was much hype about this movie when it was first released and I haven't watched it until many, many years later. It's a sci-fi movie with the classic alien-invasion theme, where a massive alien ship is wiping out much of the world's major cities. Therefore, a large group of survivors sets out towards Area 51, a secret government testing ground to devise a plan to counterattack the aliens.<br/><br/>The alien invasion scenes begin almost immediately after the film starts, kicking the plot off to a fast pace. The special and visual effects of the alien spaceship, city destruction scenes and midair spacecraft battles were pretty spectacular. While the humans vs. aliens plot device generates some sort of excitement, much of the film is consumed in, what I think, in awkward attempts at humor and slapstick comedy, and also lacks much suspense and attention-grabber moments. This film is probably more of a sci-fi comedy, but the cast didn't appear to display much sensitivity, tension or urgency for an alien invasion incident, and the acting was pretty corny at times.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a cheesy sci-fi movie.

Let's talk about how in an explosion destroying an entire city, not letting brick over brick, the woman get locked in a maintenance closet one second before the explosion kills them, an instead of saving other people waits for his dog to jump, putting her children's life at risk. Really ? The only reason of why this movie got a 6,9, it's because show how Americans save the world, in the shittiest way possible, without brain, only with pure raw nuclear power, and with the stupidest plan that was possible to conceive, and because this is an American website.

","Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite directors, mostly because he has been making the same type of movie now for about 20 years (not unlike Michael Bay in some respects). Still, he does have a great eye for visuals and can create spectacle like few others out there. INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of his first forays into the ""disaster"" genre, and as a large-scale blockbuster, it largely succeeds. Sure, there isn't a lot of attention paid to character or plot, but it delivers on the action and visuals. The ensemble cast is also great, and each person gets their own moment to shine. At first glance, one might be tempted to compare this to Armageddon, but I think that this film edges it out by a small margin. Both movies have essentially the same story beats, but the emotional arcs in this movie feel more genuine and there isn't a sappy Aerosmith ballad, either. The special effects in this movie are incredible, considering it came out in 1996 and I thought that the alien and spaceship designs were creative and nice to look at. Overall, I think that this movie has had, and will continue to have more staying power than Armageddon, if only because it did it first. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it, and if you're looking for a fun, turn-your-brain-off type of movie, you can't go wrong with this one."

","From the director who once stated that he is ""a filmmaker, not a scientist"" as his defense to the plethora of historical & scientific inaccuracies present in his movies, Independence Day remains Roland Emmerich's most enjoyable & unabashedly entertaining work to date and is the picture that introduced me to this weirdo. And although it offers the same ridiculousness as his other features, it still succeeds as a solid popcorn flick that was once at the forefront of large-scale disaster films.<br/><br/>The story concerns an alien invasion against which the entire mankind unite to fight for its freedom. It begins on July 2 when the alien mothership enters the Earth's orbit & deploys several spaceships which take over the major cities of the world & annihilate them completely. On July 3, a counterattack is launched but turns out to be ineffective until a computer expert finds out a flaw in alien's advanced system. And so, July 4 becomes the day when humanity puts up its final fights for its freedom.<br/><br/>Direction by Roland Emmerich here is actually top-notch when compared to his other works, writing employs all the flimsy narrative, clichéd dialogues & illogical plot developments, production design is stunning for its magnitude, visual effects were jaw-dropping at its time of release but now looks pretty dated, the camera-work is nicely carried out, editing isn't bad as the story is finely paced & the score by David Arnold has a very patriotic feel to it & keeps the drama flowing with excitement.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, its ensemble cast chips in with adequate contribution in the film & although there was no standout performance by anyone, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum & Bill Pullman still manage to make their characters work despite the lack of depth & characterization in the script itself. The entire alien advanced technology is beautifully portrayed as well plus I really admire the cool design of the spaceships, the meticulous detail in which it's all presented & the look of the aliens as well.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Roland Emmerich has made some of the worst films in his career but Independence Day isn't one of them. Sure it's flawed & relies on visual effects plus patriotic themes to hide most of it but then, it's also hard to not be amazed by its ambition & how it influenced the disaster genre. If you're looking for a fun, relaxing & exciting movie extravaganza to just chill out, then Independence Day is pretty much capable of delivering that experience."

","Independence Day is one of those cult classics, in my opinion. There are some many things wrong with this movie, but because of that it is memorable and, in an odd sense, enjoyable. The plot is basic, the dialogue is painful and the characters are all over the place, a common attribute of Roland Emmerich. Even the action is somewhat dull (except for the destruction of the big cities by the alien ships, that stuff was pure awesomeness). Besides all the hate, it is very lovable after you peel away the awful outer layer. It's really painful, but it is perfect in the eyes of those who can see it's horrific nature and relish in that fact."

","I know people say that there are a lot of technical faults in this movie. That's true. But what's also true is that movie was made in 1996, where the computer graphics had just started to develop. A lot of stuff which could be done today could not be done at that time. So directors had to go with whatever they had. The motive of making a film is to make money, which the film did. The film has an awesome story line, apart from some technical glitches. I watched this film when I was in my teens. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. This movie is awesome. The way the story is told is very good. Some of the scenes are breath-taking. The scene where the aliens destroy the city with one attack was horrifying while at the same time that scene was just brilliant. And I almost cried in the last scene when that crazy guy sacrifices his life to save the lives of others. The actors had done a solid job in this film. If you like sci-fi and alien stuff, then I think you should go for it. This is one movie which you do not want to miss out on."

","It certainly doesn't possess the witty repartee of a Woody Allen, or does raise big philosophical questions like a Stanley Kubrick and doesn't even possess the technique or score genies of a Sergio Leone, but what Independence Day lacks in those areas, it more than makes up for it in; special effects wizardry, slick, epic fast paced action sequences and fun, humours performances, that once assembled, combine to make Independence Day a film that is a eye catching, heart pounding, awe inspiring Saturday night extravaganza that will never fail to entertain. <br/><br/>Almost from the start it's clear to see that Roland Emmerich burrows extensively from all godfathers of Alien encounter films that came before; from the way the Alien space craft arrives in the sky surrounded in a plume of stormy clouds like scenes from the remake of War of the Worlds, the very look of the Aliens themselves clearly draw comparisons with Ridley Scots 'Alien', then you have the possible extinction of the human race to deal with, similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some may say this is a signal of lack of imagination and originality on writer Dean Devlin part, but the way I look at it, imitation is the sincerity form of flattery, and I see Independence Day as more of a allusion or a homage of the highest respects to those past greats, rather than a mere cheap carbon copy (Well costing at 75million and grossing over 800 million, more like a very expensive and successful carbon copy). <br/><br/>Being a typical big budget Hollywood film the premise is as simple as ever, a massive fleet of alien space ships arrive on earth after travelling billions of light years, but there isn't a ET amongst them, these guys mean business! And they didn't come to earth for friendly game of stuck in the mud or a casual stroll in the park whilst sightseeing; instead they are came here to destroy it and everyone on it. But once again, with this being an American Hollywood feature, the only guys equipped to save the world is the president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a highly skilled jet pilot (Will Smith). Queue the waving of the flag, handing out of American pie and an Elvis Presley greatest hits album. But there nothing wrong with a little bit of patriotism, but Bill Pullman gives the customary great American speech about unity and courage, and the rebranding of an American holiday into a global holiday, Independence Day does take patriotism to a palpable extreme, often venturing into the irritating and ridiculous as it makes every other country seem incapable of coping without out their help. But I digress, after the US army seems incapable of penetrating through the Aliens shield, with all their bullets and bombs, Jeff Goldblum being the computer genies that he is has the genius idea of simply disarming the shields – wow give the Einstein an Nobel Prize right? Well one problem, to administer the computer virus that will infect the mother ship that will in turn disarm all the other ship's shields for around two minutes, they have to get up close and personal to do so – queue loud mouth, charismatic Will smith. <br/><br/>To say that Independence Day was high concept film would be a massive understatement; it would be the same as saying Beetles were just a rock band. But I feel films that get labelled as high concept always get such a bad rep. What's wrong with appealing to all four quadrants of the film market, isn't watching films supposed to be an inclusive, communal experience. A film can bring together different; races, religions, genders and ages, surely that something that should be celebrated and encompasses everything that makes cinema so magical. And watching Independence Day was truly a magical experience; you just have to look at the performances, well the performance of Will Smith, who stands heads and shoulder above everyone else, in a film that made him an eventual global superstar. Like I said, he was loud and charismatic, making his character so enticing and exciting to watch. I simply love the scene when the Alien crash lands and tries to get out of its ship, only to be punched in the face by Will Smith, ""Well come to earth"" which would probably go down as one of my all time favourite move scenes and quotes ever. His performance was almost as big and spectacular as the special effects even though they are from 1996, I feel they easily outdo some modern day big budget films such as the embarrassingly bad Olympus has Fallen. Independence Day is a truly enjoyable fantastic film that rightly deserved all its finical success; defiantly looking forward to seeing it again."

","This I remember thinking was a fun movie. It wasn't like it was trying to be Citizen Kane or anything like that it's just sort of a movie about gun happy aliens who blow crap up. It's like a more contemporary Plan 9 From Outer Space. I guess I can't really expect much logic in a movie where a TV repair man can find things that the government's top men can't find. Also in a movie where the president get's into a fighter plane to stop the aliens. Also in a movie where the ship can be destroyed by a drunk redneck pilot flying his jet into the gun.

"vincentlynch-moonoi","8","0","0","30 November 2013"," Heckuva good movie!
","I'll tell you how I know that this is a REALLY good movie. First, I very rarely enjoy science fiction films; less than a handful in my entire life...and I'm 64 years old. Second, I very rarely enjoy military movies. Third, I rarely enjoy disaster films. And those genres are what this movie is. And I love it! The cast does a terrific job here. I was never much of a fan of Jeff Goldblum, but here as an MIT-educated computer expert, he's really good. In fact, there's only a handful of films I've really enjoyed him in, this being the principal one. This film, and ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" were the two movies that led me to realize that Will Smith was a lot more than just a sitcom actor and a rapper. I've enjoyed him ever since. He is wonderful here as a Marine pilot. Bill Pullman is no favorite of mine, but he does well here as the President and former war fighter pilot. I always enjoy seeing Robert Loggia, and no less so here as a general and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Randy Quaid is good as comic relief, but his role here is just a little deeper, and he handles it well...though the role as an alcoholic crop duster and veteran Vietnam War pilot who claims to have been an alien abductee is illogical. James Duval, as Quaid's son, does well here. To bad he's just a little too weird to be more Hollywood mainstream; he showed potential. Judd Hirsch...well, too stereotypical as an old Jew in this film for me to enjoy his performance. Mary McDonnell is low key as the First Lady. Vivica A. Fox...this was probably the first time I ever noticed her, though it took quite a few years before I became fully aware of her.<br/><br/>The special effects here are quite stunning.<br/><br/>The story? Well, as with all science fiction, there's a lot to swallow here. The biggest of which being that during a war for survival the American president would actually get involved in the battle by flying a jet...even if he had been a former military pilot. But, don't over-think the film. Just enjoy it. It's fun and exciting."

","I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie.

"crazymanmichael","6","0","0","14 July 2013"," Silly, inept, but actually quite a lot of fun
","Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines ""willing suspension of disbelief"". The amount of ""will"" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clichés to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) <br/><br/>These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up ""Welcome to Earth"" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the ""mothership"" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack.<br/><br/>Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred ""goofs"" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: <br/><br/>By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a ""virus."" A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The ""virus"" in the movie is certainly an example of ""malware"". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) <br/><br/>The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? <br/><br/>END OF SPOILER <br/><br/>So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans.<br/><br/>Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of ""levitation beam"" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their ""primary weapon""... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. <br/><br/>I know: nitpicky."
"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","4 July 2013"," Watching Independence Day is like watching fireworks. Beautiful to watch and ready to explode.
","Nothing says, American 4th of July holiday than a H.G Wells, ""War of the Worlds"" remake from Disaster King German Director Roland Emmerich call Independence Day. Honestly, this movie has nothing to do with American Revolution or the founding of the country. This movie has much to do with Independence Day, as killer giant Ewoks have to do with Grito de Dolores, (Mexico's Independence Day) which is little to none. I can see the rationale for why some people think Independence Day is the coolest Alien Invasion movie ever, and why some people think it's massively stupid. It's both, it's kinda dumb, but also lots of fun to watch. This movie isn't worth taking too serious, over. The movie is meant to be enjoy. And yeah, it's a War of the Worlds adaptation and probably one of the better modern update of that book because it's fun and works in the book's way of defeating the aliens in a modern way that's not too absurd. For a movie that channeling 'War of the Worlds', it does show other countries and other places trying to fight against the aliens, than the original movies. I do like that. It really does seem like a War of the Worlds. There isn't much to the plot besides the fact that Aliens attacking bit cities and people trying to fight them off. The narrative mostly focuses on a desperate group of people who are some of most stereotypical clichés characters ever, but also the most interesting and awesome, people I would like to be with, if Aliens ever do attack. In my opinion, I think the actors are mostly playing themselves in this film. There is Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) who flies in jet fighter planes and on his free time, punches aliens in the face while giving out some of the best bad ass lines. Not only is he the ultimate cool hero type, but Will Smith gives one charming performance. This movie, pretty much made Will Smith's movie career. He just move from one big explosion addict blockbuster Director (Michael Bay) to another big explosion addict blockbuster Director Roland Emmerich. The second best character in the film is David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is pretty damn cool how smart he is in solving problems. Then you got President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), the Harrison Ford's Air Force One type of a president who gives one of the best speeches in the history of film. Last character worth noting is Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) who is pretty much just Cousin Eddie from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation with a different name who helps pilot the last comeback attack. As less, the producers gave him, a jet plane, rather than his normal biplane. It wouldn't work if he had to fly that to keep pace with F-18s. The special effects are awesome, even by today's standards of CGIs. I really believe the cities were getting destroy. The music compose by David Arnold is brilliant. Very uplifting and adventurous. There are a lot of cool scenes in the film, and a lot of dumb moments. One is the dog saving scene. I know dogs in film are typically seen as innocent, loyal, and uncorrupted, but to value animal life more important than human lives in film is just silly and wrong. If I had to choose between protecting my child and saving my dog, I would protect my child. That's not cold-hearted; that's called being a good parent. There are other questionable scenes worth asking. Like how do the aliens know the most ironic buildings for each city for point of attack, why did they wait six hours until attacking, and how can people give an alien computer a virus when they didn't even exist on OSX or basic Linux at that time? Specifically that the software would be incompatible. The biggest complain that I got for the movie is that nobody notice the aliens coming, even knowing they exist since 1947. For goodness sakes, you would have thought somebody would notice to tell somebody what was happening. Overall: personally I like Independence Day, even though I know it's corny. Really, though, the first half isn't all that bad. It's a cool set up to what turns out to be a bunch of reality pushing clichés. The scene where the big flying saucers are slowly appearing over the cities while the score lays on the horns is pretty awesome. Similar scenes have been tried in other movies since, and they just seem lame or excessive by comparison. In my opinion, Independence Day is how you film a good popcorn flick."

","Welcome to WillyT Reviews. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and aliens. Now that's a recipe for success. Independence day takes place over a three day period and between those three days the world's population is reduced to basically nothing after a wave of aliens attack. Bill Pullman plays the President and he is probably my favorite portrayal of a US president on film. Jeff Goldblum knocks it out of the park again as the smartest man on Earth. Then there is Will Smith who matures from The Fresh Prince to a pilot in the army and even though he is playing a role with more seriousness but still has his wit and comedic charm. There is a lot to talk about with this movie but my limit is 1000 words, here we go.<br/><br/>The opening scene, if you have followed my reviews recently I talk a lot about the opening scenes and other than the cliché REM song ""It's The End of the World as We Know It"" the movie zoned me in right away. It starts on the moon and the spaceships just hover over and descend towards Earth. I feel like the movie kind of jumped into it and had very little character development in the beginning but they made up for it in the middle and end. The ships fly over major cities all over the world and the first act concludes with the destruction of cities and the death of millions. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier I love the characters and how they develop in the film, especially the president. Bill Pullman starts out as an unpopular President who has made poor decisions in the past. As disaster strikes he grows a backbone and becomes a strong leader. His little speech about Independence Day was really inspirational. It was a little cheesy but it did its job and I liked it. Jeff Goldblum learns how to love again and he becomes a stronger person and a better man. Will Smith grows up in a way and his dream comes true. It's a little weird but the destruction of Earth and the almost extinction of humanity was kind of a good thing for these people. In a way it makes the world stronger and one can assume what happens after the credits roll and my imagination went wild, which is never a bad thing.<br/><br/>My favorite character is David's Jewish uncle. I forget his name but he is hilarious and steals every scene he is a part of. Was his acting memorable or amazing, no, but I feel like the actor was just being himself and he did such a fluent job that reflected on screen. His lines fit well and are smart at the same time witty. Towards the end he is praying in a circle. He invites a man to join him, ""I'm not Jewish"" he says ""Nobody's perfect."" He responds. In the time of disaster and fear he still cracks a joke and made me smile. He was a perfect blend to the movie. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the aliens. Now I have a few problems with them. They look OK, a little unrealistic and silly but it could have been worse. I like how they use technology and communicate with each other but they have shields around their ships. That's cheating and makes it almost impossible to stop them. I thought it was lame and the movie could have worked without them, maybe even better. Finally, they have no reason for the attack. They literally go from planet to planet and kill everything. ""They're like locusts."" The President says after he actually communicates with them in my favorite scene. I wanted a better reason. After the buildup in the first act and half of the second act it made me think, wow that's it. That makes no sense. The aliens are so smart and are basically invulnerable but they make so many stupid mistakes. Watching the movie conclude I didn't really buy it. I was OK with the ending and I enjoyed it but it was not as good as I expected. I won't spoil the ending but it's not like War of The Worlds where they just die from the parasites and particles in the air. My feelings on that is for another time. When it comes to alien movies I have been let down so many times by the ending. Signs, War of the Worlds, and now Independence Day, out of those three movies this one had the best ending but I don't think it was enough because it wasn't realistic. Overall, Independence Day was a good movie with really good special effects. I could watch historic buildings all over the country being blown up and the wall of fire tearing cities apart all day long. The lead characters were strong, the acting wasn't terrific but it worked and they developed well. Side characters were fun and fit nicely, specifically the General and David's Uncle. The aliens were OK, foolish but still scary. The story was really good and presented well but had a disappointing ending. I see this movie on TV all the time and whenever it's on I can hop right in and watch it while still being entertained. It is a good movie to watch alone or with a group, it can be a background movie so I give Independence Day the Willyt Honorable Mention for its characters and their development, the awesome special effects and its entertainment value. WillyT out!"

","Independent isn't really the word for this fabulous blockbuster.<br/><br/>The story line is a mish mash from a large collection of well established works... ""War of the worlds"", ""V"", ""Earth vs. Flying Saucers"" and even a stab at ""Battle of Britain"" with its arcade game attempts at portraying a collosal aerial battle. Capt Jimmy Raven is depicted as juvenile, which may be a slap in the direction of US ""friendly fire"" pilots, whilst the rest of the world's forces are shown as comparatively professional and ill equipped.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman sticks to his role of US President in a perceived public image, and doesn't attempt to use a more likely and realistic manner. The alien visitors are treated as friendly until proved hostile, but the glaring warning signs are ignored.<br/><br/>Wll Smith plays Will Smith with his usual flair.<br/><br/>However the ""Area 51"" theory is handled quite well, even if Brent Spiner is kept in without a leash as Dr Okun, as if to say ""forget Mr. Data let's be wacky"".<br/><br/>If you have a large screen, or better still an LCD project, you will thoroughly enjoy the effects."

","Do you like your sci-fi served red, white and blue with a funny old Jew? Well, look no further than the obscure cult hit Independence Day to satisfy your patriotic yet culturally sensitive desire for alien ass- kicking. What can you say about Independence Day? It's like a birthday cake that explodes in your face. You sit there smiling and licking the frosting off your cheeks saying, ""Mmm... cake!"" Then you realize that you're covered in frosting and you want to eat something more substantial and nutritious. But that doesn't mean that exploding cakes aren't awesome! Independence Day is the best exploding cake that will ever give you a frosting facial of fun!<br/><br/>Bill Pullman plays the president of the world ...ahem... the USA and when he learns that giant round discs are entering Earth's atmosphere, his eyes narrow a bit out of concern but his presidential poise is not shaken. You see, President Personality is just biding his time until he gets to fly a fighter plane and face off against the telepathic cockroaches himself. But the rest of the world goes batspit crazy and the alien invaders waste no time in letting the human race know that their paranoia is quite valid as they proceed to show that they love to blow s*** up. <br/><br/>Jeff Bloomingold is here and his job is to wear glasses and say smart stuff. Will Smith is here too and his job is to offer the viewers the kind of wholesome blackness that's just edgy enough for you to go, ""That's what I'm sayin'!"" without getting a look of shock from your grandmother. Robert Loggia even has a job here. It's up to him to give a gravelly voiced delivery of all the dire implications of what's going on. Or is that what's going down? If you're a semi-elderly viewer or just a complete square, this is where you are grateful to Will Smith for providing you with some clue as to what's cool. Or is that what's hot? Anyway, for those who thought show-boating couldn't be charming, you might want to witness Will as he evades and ultimately doops an alien aircraft using nothing but puns, a parachute and an eject button. Will Smith's trash-talking will have you basking in redemptive glory after having lost his best friend mere seconds earlier. It's for this reason that you can forgive the rehashing of all too familiar Star Wars ace pilot jargon that occurs in the same action sequence. A pilot yells, ""There's too many of 'em"" while another yells ""I can't shake him! I can't shake him."" Equally forgivable is Smith giving references to two other alien movies within ten minutes of screen time. The only thing that could make this movie more awesome is if Brenden Fraser rode in on a horse and said, ""Let's roll!"" Enjoy the cake and savor that frosting!"

","This film is really what brought Sci Fi back in the mid-1990s, bringing together some of the best Special Effects with an all star cast, a soundtrack that was written in gold and a way about it that is not beyond the realms of reality. Independence Day is a real collection of brilliance, combining the typical B Movie story of the 1960s with the technology of the 1990s, and Roland Emmerich's magic wand of directing blends it to perfection!<br/><br/>The story is your typical sort of B Movie thing, Aliens arrive, cause trouble, so we kill them, the end. But the way its executed is what makes it unique to other films of similar genre, and all of these points are entirely plausible. The Aliens seem plausible, the plot seems plausible, the way we destroy the aliens seems plausible, the characters and their backgrounds seem plausible, so generally, this film doesn't stray too far from reality, which makes it better than other films which would have us believe that we destroyed the aliens using pop-tarts catapulted from the side of Mount Rushmore.<br/><br/>Overall, a really good film to watch, although it can be quite scary for some younger audiences as well as the use of bad language and battle violence, its just a great little film to watch, just sit back and enjoy the ride! :D"

For the life of me I can't understand why they destroy LA time and again. Don't the movie makers like where they live? They ""intrinsically"" destroyed Houston in this one with an atomic weapon aimed against the invaders. So they should try destroying Houston by itself like they did with the killer bee picture in 1978, and leave poor LA alone.

"compi24","6","0","0","19 February 2012"," Review Of ""Independence Day""
","""Independence Day"" is a 1996 Roland Emmerich film starring Will Smith and Bill Pullman. Now, let me preface this review by saying that I'm not really a fan of Roland Emmerich movies. I usually find them to be heavy on special effects, rather flimsy on worthwhile narrative substance, and shoddy in terms of character development. Now before I go on, I know what you're thinking - ""Well what the heck do I care about those last two things, all I need is explosions."" That's fine I guess. It's just that I'd rather have a well crafted story featuring explosions that endanger characters I actually give a crap about than the aforementioned. Now with that said, is ""Independence Day"" the former or the latter? It's a little bit of both. This movie is not total bad but it does have it's moments. Thankfully the good moments outweigh the bad ones. Yes, the character development is rather nonexistent. This is mainly because of the fact that there are way too many characters in this film altogether, so even the slightest hint of any sort of character arc is almost impossible/undetectable. The plot is rather stale, and there are a handful of plot holes and inconsistencies throughout, but there isn't really any dynamic of this plot that is so flagrantly bad one can't sit through it without feeling entertained. I had mixed feelings about some of the lines in this film. Some of them were pumped with so much 90's action cheese It made me want to gauge my eyes out with a pinecone, but there were others that made me laugh/smile some. As most Roland Emmerich films go, the special effects end up looking unbelievable and it's no different for ""Independence Day"". The fact that this film came out in 1996 is still a shocker to me. The acting is great in some places, while lacking in others. Bill Pullman had one of the best performances in the film, as did Jeff Goldblum. Overall, It's apparent that ""Independence Day"" is one of Roland Emmerich's best films, if not his best, and it is indeed very entertaining."

","It seems to be a another lifetime when I saw the promos of ""Independence Day"" for the first time and the experience was nothing short of a big WOW! Watching the movie on big screen was awesome. Computers were just gaining popularity and hence the way aliens were defeated in the end didn't feel corny back then. <br/><br/>Will Smith was the scene-stealer - first time the world took notice of this actor and he redefined the meaning of ""being cool"". Bill Pullman seems to have been modelled after Kennedy and Clinton. Notably he delivers the speech with great aplomb. Jeff Goldblum was strictly okayish. Rest of the supporting star-cast lend adequate support. <br/><br/>Without going overboard on the usage of CGI's Roland Emmerich narrated a story which connected with almost everybody, a wholesome entertainer. And then he made a few more but none could garner the status of ""Independence Day"".<br/><br/>PS: Back then """"Independence Day"" hinted who will don the cap of big brother when it comes to sorting out the matters in the house. And guess what, with so many international crisis looming and spawning, the authority still remains unchallenged."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","0","5 October 2011"," ""Independence Day"" or America as the World in Microcosm ...
","Let's get this straight, if only for the visual effects and the thrilling attacks sequences, for the iconic shot of the Empire State Building and White House blown to pieces, without any use of CGI but old good 'miniature' material, ""Independence Day"" is a groundbreaking achievement that redefines the purposes of visual and special effects in the Sci-Fi genre. And if only for that, the movie deserves a certain bit of respect.<br/><br/>But when you make such a big-budgeted action-packed blockbuster, and expect to impress the eyes of movie goers and make their hearts pound so hard that they forget to put their salty fingers in the popcorn box, why not make a supplementary effect to improve a script that would justify the use of these special effects, and not let the success of a movie rely only on a technological achievement? In ""Independence Day"", it's like Roland Emmerich was so confident over the success of his film that he didn't care much for the complaints that would be expressed toward the script and its blatant lack of originality.<br/><br/>And if it doesn't take a genius to know that some formulas simply cannot fail, it doesn't take an elitist mindset either to find obvious flaws in the way the story is written, and maybe worse, in the way the characters are written, not portrayed because I think the actors did a satisfying job with what was at their hands. Overall, the humans were fine but how about the Aliens? Couldn't have they come up with something fresher? I found hard to believe that these ugly octopus-like creatures could own a technology powerful enough to wipe out the entire human race. Well, never mind, the point is that I don't buy the argument that just because a movie features spectacular effects, one must suspend his disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is, especially when the most difficult stuff is perfectly handled. I don't buy the counter-argument either that just because you criticize some elements of the plot, you're some kind of movie buff with a precious taste and a particular dislike for mainstream movies.<br/><br/>I genuinely liked ""Independence Day"", I enjoyed it and not just as a guilty pleasure. I will never forget the experience in the movie theater when even as a 14 year old kid, I couldn't help but cheer during the President's speech. Oh some parts probably made me cringe, but it's nothing compared to what was thrown to my eyes that night, it was a great year for action films, ""Eraser"", ""The Rock"" but on that level, ""Independence Day"" was a class on its own, that till now, stood the test of time. But the more I thought of it, the more I realize that I loved the experience much more than the story ... well, the result is pretty much the same, and the film was the highest grossing of the year but this indicates the main flaw on special-effects-driven film like ""ID4"", they leave as great an impression as a ride on a roller-coaster, but as ephemeral too. Their inner ambition is more to garner the most viewers than to leave an indelible mark on cinematic papers. Again, the team did a good job, but it just could have been so much better on the story department.<br/><br/>I don't want to fall in the wisecracking trap by numbering all the clichés that structure the plot; it would be a pointless exercise, because whatever plot was, it was relying on an overused concept anyway. And the film features every single stereotypical elements so cherished by the disaster genre, a lot of social and racial backgrounds presented through the classic external focus with the maximum of diversity as to sustain the beautiful vision of America's melting-pot. In a way, it's more economical to show all the racial minorities that constitute America than the whole world, America as the microcosm of the World. Hell, the liberation from the Alien invasion even coincided with the 4th of July. I hesitate between two words starting with P: pretension or patriotism, but when things are so obviously over the top, I guess it's a more of a clever reminder than we're only watching a film  as if we hadn't noticed before.<br/><br/>""Today we celebrate our Independence!"" Did that make me cringe as a non-American? Not quite and I doubt the people in the theater pushed their thinking as far as I'm doing right here in a totally different context. In cinemas' darkness, movies affect us more, creating a deeper connection with the protagonists, in that case, a charismatic country. America entertains the world, and never is the empathy as strong as in theaters. I remember how the crowd cheered during that speech, and while I'm not sure people would look at the film the same way now, it makes me realize how these times were still innocent. These lost years between the Gulf War and the September 11th Attacks, when nothing was as religiously and politically lauded as today, from every side. I still look at the attack sequence with cinematically fascinated eyes, but I'm still lucid about the way some people would consider, now, the sight of the Empire State Building's explosion.<br/><br/>And I wonder if that works as a critic or an alibi for ""Independence Day"" ... world has become a very dangerous place by itself and maybe this is what makes the film an innocent and immature entertainment. Let just think that the real enemy for men is the Alien, when it has come to men vs. men. There's even a sort of sentimental fatalism in the way it shows that it's only in the case of Alien attacks that Humanity will join its forces and be united.<br/><br/>Finally, if the movie ever sinned, it's from a childish naivety  or was it deliberate? Or have we become just so mature that we changed our whole mindset regarding movies?"

","Nowadays, the genre of sci-fi blockbusters is an element of cinema which is best avoided. It is a far cry from Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In 1996, the big hit was Independence Day.<br/><br/>Earth is invaded by aliens, who destroy major city after major city. The special effects are terrific at times, particularly the attacks on iconic landmarks such as the White House and the Empire State Building. The actors have fun in their roles, especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith as the satellite genius and amazingly talented pilot respectively.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich's film, although great fun, contains several unbearably cheesy moments. One which springs to mind is the President's call for the world to declare July 4 as their independence day. Many of the battle sequences, although visually great, seem unrealistic. The dialogue is also poor for the most part.<br/><br/>Watching it now, many of the film's elements seem stereotypical, although it is difficult to tell if this is because of the several similar films since, trying to replicate the success of Independence Day. It is a prime example of the thrilling action films we have become accustomed to. Despite this, Independence Day offers more substance than its counterparts, and is at the forefront of the sci-fi blockbluster."

Well, Independence Day is a alien invasion movie about aliens from outer space coming to invade Earth. Soon then, the world become suspicious when these very giant alien ships float above us turning day into an dark place. The President of the United States, played by Bill Pullman, alerted the people that they are in a state of emergency. The alien ships soon destroyed major cities in the U.S. including Washington D.C, L.A. and New York. This was something very extraordinary. The screen is then set ablaze as the ship fired on the buildings and destroys everything in it's path. So, an Fighter plane pilot, played by Will Smith takes action to eliminate these unearthly beings. The movie has a lot of great visual effects, good camera shots of the big alien ship hovering over New York. The action scenes are very exciting.

After discovering the presence of the invaders, the U.S. fights back, bringing in the military. After trying to destroy the ships with everything from guns to nuclear weapons, they realize they are running out of options. After many failed attempts and a lot of deaths, the aliens are killed by a computer virus being planted in the mother ship with help from the entire world.<br/><br/>Emmerich does a thorough job of getting his point across in this movie. Apocalypse is a frequently used topic and Emmerich seems to realize this as he tries to add humor to such a serious subject.  The world is coming to an end, and the only way to prevent it is to have the entire world work together.  Mankind must forget their petty differences and work together for the good of every person. The movie is a disappointment when it comes to special effects; the spaceships are big blobs and the aliens are nothing but the typical ugly little creature.

There's lots of panic, rioting, and such. (I'm so glad I don't live in New York!)Amogst all this confusion is David (Jeff Goldblum), a cable repair person who thinks he's cracked the Alien Code! He figures out that in so many hours the Aliens will attack. Well, him and his dad rush to Washington and tell the Prresident! With not a second to lose they all fly outta there on Air Force 1 with the most spectacular Firestorm in History hot on their tails. The Cities are destroyed.<br/><br/>We counter attack, but our planes are shot down and in the ""Darkest Hour"" David comes up with a computer virus that will take down the shields of the invaders and allow our flyboys to go in and kick Butt! Well, Him and Will Smith do just that and the President (I mentioned he was a fighter pilot right?) lead all the planes we have left against the aliens. Would you believe that with the shields gone, our F-18's are on par with the best in the Universe!!!!!!!!! The aliens respond by killing all humans they can find, in the air and on the ground. Lots of civilians are killed and inside the bunker, Smith's son asks the President's daughter if shes' scared. He says, ""Me too!"" Then Russel Case flies his plane into the middle of it all and the Aliens go Down In FLAMES!!!! Yee Haw! In the next shot, Will and Jeff blow up the mother ship, (which is a third the size of our moon). That must be some NUKE! They fly home, everyone gets to watch the FIREWORKS.<br/><br/>

"peterjamesyates","Null","0","0","27 February 2002"," Entertaining film - probably not for Derek Malcolm.
","Regret only read about 22 user comments. Just from those, most of my observations have already been written. One or two more things, for the sake of good order: much of the plot occurs through 'happenstance' not least the arrival of, and general area of the U.S. covered by, the alien craft. As I recall, Asia - the world's largest land mass - barely featured. I know the survivors were short of time, but it was a jolly good thing that the ergonomics of the alien craft suited the human pilots so well, and the seats looked virtually tailor made. (We viewers know, though, that the boffins in the underground centre had been modifying the craft over time for this very eventuality.) A high tech airplane - no need for such extraneities as pilots' headgear. Sadly, the human race is a bit more weathered today than it was in 1996 and, trivial though it may be, it would be something if our special effects aces worked on a bit more realism. With respect to their work, the fireballs replete with debris, the motor vehicles spinning in mid air and the seemingly total lack of dust when an entire city is being destroyed fail to convince people post 11 Sep 01 - if, indeed, they convinced before. Why are we given all these fireballs, anyway - are building materials so highly flammable? As mentioned elsewhere, the stereotypical characters were in place - in keeping with the quality of the script. Comforting, though, that Hollywood is STILL employing pseudo English actors to speak with caricature English accents. Many of these 1990s films seem to have a pre-packed video flavour to them, so formulaic are they. I genuinely like the national pride: 'UNITED STATES OF AMERICA' adorns the fuselage of Air Force One, and am minded to request Buck House to paint 'ENGLAND' on the side of the Queen's Flight aircraft. Well, they're doing a Jubilee rock concert at the Palace this year.<br/><br/>In final analysis, an entertaining picture but I wouldn't want to see it again just yet.

This movie will entertain you but it will not move you.  This isn't an art film or a great film.  It is simply a very big dumb movie with lots of stuff blowing up and bodies flying around.  An entertaining big dumb movie, as these things go, but a big dumb movie nonetheless. Overall, ID4 moves along at a fair pace, the action sequences are generally fun to watch, and the characters play well together.  The movie is best watched on a big screen supplemented by a good sound system for maximum effect.  So grab a bucket of popcorn, a giant-size Mountain Dew, kick back, turn off your brain, and enjoy the ride."

So, when I first heard of ID4 Independence Day I couldn't believe I would ever get the chance to see such an unimaginable story. It was something totally even though it was based on the old disaster motion pictures of the seventies.<br/><br/>This movie already impresses the entire audience only through its visual effects. The earliest visual shots are already breathtaking. I couldn't believe I would ever see images of mass destruction so perfectly rendered.<br/><br/>Although back in 1996 these particular scenes impressed me beyond anything I've ever seen before, not even those scenes can possibly be compared to the terribly unfortunate and horrendous tragedy that has recently struck the World Trade Center.<br/><br/>Writers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have created characters I've become very fond of and wrote an incredible story. Director Roland Emmerich really captured the spirit of those old disaster movies and did it with an amazing talent, backed up by a majestic score composed by David Arnold.<br/><br/>Emmerich selected very talented names for the roles like Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park), Bill Pullman (Casper), Judd Hirsch (Taxi) and also well known names like Harry Connick Jr. and Randy Quaid.<br/><br/>I've recently bought this masterpiece on DVD.

Many people are justified in stating that the success of ""Independence Day"" comes from the fact that its nothing more than what its intended to be: FUN, period.<br/><br/>However, in this day and age of constant threats to modern society from epidemics such as war and disease, ""Independence Day"" can suddenly mean more than just a cinematic escape from reality.  Perhaps it symbolizes the power and determination of the human spirit to prevail against all odds.  Well, I most certainly think so!  Just observe the plot and you'll find out what I mean:<br/><br/>Several gigantic UFOs, dwarfing anything which mankind can possibly conceive, suddenly hover above major cities all over the world.  Without warning, these alien ships simultaneously strike the heart of the cities with awesome laser beams, causing vast proportions of horrific destruction. Just when it seems that all is lost for the citizens of the Planet Earth, a courageous band of human rebels join forces to combat this seemingly impregnable terror.  These rebels come from all walks of life, from the dead serious to the outrageously funny.  You've got Will Smith, a fighter pilot with a mouth of a wise guy but having a heart of gold; Jeff Goldblum, the computer nerd who knows how to decode the alien bad guys; and Bill Pullman, the dedicated U.S. president who will stop at nothing to preserve the survival of the human race.  Put them together and you have a trinity (respectively the heart, mind and soul) of the ultimate good guys to rally ""mankind,"" a word as Pullman in the film eloquently states, ""should have a new meaning to us all.""<br/><br/>The spirit of this movie owes much to past multi-character disaster classics such as ""Earthquake.""  If you are an avid fan of sci-fi flicks, the content and material of ""Independence Day"" might be familiar territory for you, but it's a treat to watch nonetheless.<br/><br/>So, do you feel the need to ignite that ""fighting human spirit"" in you?

Every alien in the whole species comes towards Earth to attack, and eliminate every being on the planet, so that they can consume every natural resource and then move on to another planet.  Main defenders are the President (Bill Pullman), who is in charge, David Levinson, a cable guy (Jeff Goldblum) who finds out how to get through the alien technology, and Captain Steve Hillard of the Air Force (Will Smith) who hates those aliens shooting green s**t at him.  Everyone fighting back against the aliens is probably the best part in the film, and the characters were fairly well known by the end of the film, which isn't really normal for a big, expensive, special-effects blockbuster."

","Commentators who like this film seem divided: some applaud ID4's special effects and dismiss those who slate its lack of character development, implausible science, and US-centred chauvinism. Others hail it as a great spoof, and insist that the references to War of the Worlds, Alien, Star Wars and so on are satirical.<br/><br/>Anyone who makes a successful movie has to be intelligent, and that lends credibility to the spoof theory. It's easy to believe that there is more going on than meets the eye. But the intelligence of this fim is largely visual: it's in the special effects rather than the script. If this were truly a spoof of the sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s, and the disaster movies of the 70s, I'd expect to discern more wit in the dialogue. But the dialogue was entertaining without being razor-sharp.<br/><br/>So I reluctantly conclude that this is a film to be enjoyed for its action rather than than fun it might be poking at earlier Hollywood genres. And enjoyable it is: the special effects are special indeed.<br/><br/>Who cares that the security in the White House is so lousy, that the aliens clearly bought their computer software from Microsoft, and that the rest of the world is supposed, yet again, to believe that only Americans have the heart and know-how to save us?<br/><br/>One thing that does irk me, though, is the stereotypical portrayal of non-Americans. I can just about stomach the plummy accent of the British officer in the Iraqi desert - after all, Sandhurst graduates do often speak like that. But Africans running through the bush with spears? Now you really are pulling my leg. Or was it a satirical reference to Zulu?"

The two background love stories (between Goldblum and Colin / Smith and Fox)appeal both to the emotions and support the overall story. How could you not be touched when Pullman tells the first-daughter that her dead mother is 'only sleeping'? Or Judd Hirsch's gruff but clearly loving interactions with son Jeff Goldblum.

","My comments are full of spoilers:<br/><br/>But by now, everyone has probably seen this.<br/><br/>ID4 begins with a mistake and ends with a mistake. First of all, there's no air on the moon. Thus when the ship is flying over the Moon, it shouldn't lift dust or even make a noise. Yet it did. Watch the opening of this film.<br/><br/>Why did S.E.T.I (Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence) detect a signal? What kind of signal were the aliens sending? Did they notify the Earth that they were coming?<br/><br/>Why were they using the Earth's satellites to communicate? Weren't they positioned around the globe already? They didn't need the Earth's satellites.<br/><br/>If the satellites were unreliable, how come the USA communicated with squadrons around the world? <br/><br/>What did Jeff Goldblum mean when he said ""Checkmate"" to his work partner? Did he mean that the aliens were planning to take away the Earth's King? Hmm.<br/><br/>Wil Smith knocks out an alien with a punch. Then that same alien kills five people in a lab. How come nobody thought about punching it again?<br/><br/>
The aliens had no vocal cords, but they made sounds when they were shot at.<br/><br/>
What was the degree of the doctor in Area 51? He performed autopsies, fixed alien ships... I guess he's one of those multiple degrees people that are so rare to find. <br/><br/>Etc, etc, etc. My favorite mistake here is the virus thing. How did David (Jeff Golblum) bring down the shields with a virus? Did the aliens use Mac computers too? Or did David know the computer language of the aliens? And computer viruses won't work unless the aliens run them. Did any alien run the virus David sent? And even if the ship got infected with a virus, how come even the small ships on the Earth got infected? Ridiculous. The writers of this movie had created an enemy (The Aliens) that couldn't be defeated. Plain and simple. Thus what they did was wrapping the movie up with something that is technically impossible. <br/><br/>And when Wil Smith and Jeff Goldblum are inside the small ship, the blinders opened. Wil Smith says, ""What the hell are you doing?"" Jeff replies, ""It is not me; they are overriding the system."" If the aliens were able to override the system of a small ship, how come they weren't able to get rid of the virus or override the virus and raise all the shields again?<br/><br/>And the movie ends with the huge ship falling out of the sky. Remember when the aliens arrived the Secretary of Defense suggested targeting the ship and blowing it out of the sky? What did the general say? Here it is:<br/><br/>You risk turning one big falling object into many.<br/><br/>Well, that's what they did at the end of the movie: they turned one big falling object into many. That's more than enough to destroy humanity right there. That explosion and the aftermath were enough to create nuclear winter. <br/><br/>Those are the science mistakes. Now let's see the movie genre mistakes: it was supposed to be a science fiction film. After the alien attacks, it turns into a drama film. For a few minutes, I fell I was watching ""The Day After"".<br/><br/>The characters were stupid. The President spent the whole movie with a smile on his face. They seemed to be detached from the fact that they were being exterminated. Most of the characters here were completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>This film didn't need the whole patriotism thing. The main message of this movie seems to be this: don't mess with the USA. Plain and simple."

Whitmore), the aliens should have said that they were there to retaliate for the Earth's shooting down of their exploration vessel, the one in containment at Area 51.<br/><br/>The dialog could have been ... Pullman: ""Why attack?""  Alien:  ""You fired the first shot"" ...and the rest could come out in conjecture.

","Independence Day is basically a movie in which the special effects are ultimately the main thing that's really worth looking out for.  It used miniatures quite effectively (they probably work at best when it incorporates green lighting) as buildings practically shoot out towards the camera with a loud presence and the fighter jet sequences are perhaps highest point overall in this film but ultimately, that's about it, just a collection of hugh special effects.  The story itself is shallow with an explaination surrounding the motives behind the alien invasion.  The only character trait that's really interesting surrounding the aliens is their telepathy. But the movie only touches on that subject briefly in one scene. At the same time, the movie adds pointless and downright silly traits to the aliens i.e. their smell.  You can also to a deep look into the dialog in Independence Day.  The script is for the most part basically an assortment of one-liners throughout.  It perhaps gives a small notion that it doesn't for the most part want to be taking very seriously or it isn't ment to be taken seriously because of this. Perhaps you can argue that this really provides relief in a story concerning the destruction of earth but at the same time, the writing just feels too lame.  While the special effects are the highest point in Independence Day, they also in certain areas set an example of downright silly storytelling.  Like for example, a action sequence involving a dog surviving an in-coming blaze.  Or a scene in which a hugh alien is knocked unconscious with a single punch.  This scene gives a notion that in spite of the fact that the aliens possess the ability to lay out a massive invasion, but they're unable to fight on their own (meaning without the use of any type of vehicle)."

","There is an undercurrent today, rumbling about that men aren't particularly needed in that 'old-fashioned' way. That primal level defenses simply are a thing of the past. Well, to my mind, that kind of mind-set presumes an awful lot. I am watching, with some trepidation, feminist thinking degrading our forces simply on the 'why-not' premise of women requiring that all situations be made level for their abilities, whether those abilities in fact exist. The result is droves of men, good men, leaving the services, because the premise is flawed and the execution is destructive.<br/><br/>Independence Day is a text entirely to the contrary and thus, entirely to my liking. It is vital that women /not/ need to put themselves utterly into harm's way, for they are a priceless resource. ID4 takes this completely seriously. The result is a rousing war movie, one that stirs the blood. There is some simplification of the situation, a potential impediment that seems necessary when a film maintains a wide viewpoint through its entire length. However, even given this, focus is also kept on a limited number of key individuals, whose interaction and ability to come together are key to whether they will succeed, or fail.<br/><br/>This is in many ways an old-fashioned movie, in that there are no permanently disturbed characters, no one's sexual hangups are explored, selfishness and self-absorption are put aside. Thus it is not 'edgy'. I say, good. Ordinary folk have too much living to do to bother with films that endlessly navel-gaze and woolgather. There is no moss growing on these people and I'd like to see people in real life being just as courageous.<br/><br/>So, if you want deep thought, go see something else.

It's not the most intelligent production out there, but its entertainment value alone makes it well worth the time it takes to view it.<br/><br/>Goldblum and Smith both ponied up professional (if at times hammy) performances in this production, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I watch it often, in fact. <br/><br/>Also, I am highly patriotic. I'm proud to be an American. My family has fought (and died) for America's rights and causes, and in America's wars, throughout history since they immigrated here from Scotland and Germany in the (very) early 1800's, and I am proud of my heritage as an American. This movie inspired me, uplifted me, and made me feel a stronger sense of pride for feeling the way that I do.<br/><br/>Bash this movie if you will. Bash Americans and American ideals. For those of us who love our country and are proud of the rights and freedoms for which our families have lived and died, your words mean absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>This movie rates a 9.0/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"arp2500","Null","3","8","24 December 2001"," an ax to grind
","I've waited a long time to lamb baste this movie in a public forum. I hated this picture. Hated, hated, hated this picture. And everyone I have ever met loves this picture. Loves, loves, loves this picture. There is a very precise and scientific reason for that... Everything everyone knows is wrong! Let's look at this differently. Let's look at the facts here (and I'm going to point out some things that may spoil the movie for you if you have not seen it, but that's ok... You don't want to!):<br/><br/>1. The plot is absolutely paper thin. Aliens invade earth (the aliens have no intuition on human culture, but they know what tourist landmarks to hit), and Americans fight them. That's it! Roll credits, and it's over. 2. This movie follows a time worn cliche of event location. If something big happens in an American film, it has to happen in the United states exclusively. not in the Virgin islands, not in Switzerland, not even in Canada... America. And, of course, if there is a problem, the Americans will be the only ones able to solve it. 3. Then, if Americans are going to solve it, it's going to be a band of stereotypes. This includes a rural every guy, the know it all scientist, the president (who flies a jet, no less!), and Will Smith. 4. In a really bad mix of product placement and worn plot device, an Apple computer is used to destroy an entire alien supercomputer... That destroys an entire alien superstructure... That destroys a multi million dollar movie super budget. 5. The aliens are never explained! why do they attack Earth? Who knows, but if it looks groovy, who cares? Absolutely no thought is put into the aliens. The only interesting thing about the aliens, perhaps the whole movie, is that the aliens work in space suits that are aliens in themselves. But once again, it is never explained. And the aliens are the atypical asexual non-clothed bi-pedal beings we have come to expect in sci-fi flicks. 6. The design of the alien hardware follows another worn cliche, of design following that of the decade that a movie is made. In other words, being a 1990's movie, expect lots of chrome (ala Terminator2)and compound curves. The 'mother' ships suffer from 'CG-Itis', a curious aftereffect of over indulgent CGI use. The result is a ship that looks like a pizza pie made out of glitter stucco. 7. Same guy who made this movie made Godzilla (American version...which takes place in America, not japan... see a link here?), and scads of other filmed explosions disguised as movies.<br/><br/>And there's much much more. But given all that, people still just eat up this movie. And of course, as the response, Hollywood makes more just like it. In other words, people have turned into sheep with no identity or taste, with Hollywood eager to cater since most of the folks there are interested in film as profit and not art. Rent this movie at own peril."

","""Independence Day"" earned more money than any other film in 1996.  In the film, aliens from an unknown planet hover over major parts of the world and finally attack.  Almost everything is destroyed and the few survivors who remain band together to fight the un-welcomed visitors.  Needless to say the special effects and technical aspects of the film are pretty solid, but that does not save the film from being a major disappointment.  The direction and screenplay are near non-existent and the characters are woefully flat and uninteresting.  All in all a poor film that is nothing more than a lot of noise.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","""The most likely circumstance is that extraterrestrial beings will look nothing like any organisms or machines familiar to us."" --Carl Sagan, The Cosmic Connection.<br/><br/>And what is the moral of INDEPENDENCE DAY, my child? That humans will always win. Always always always. Aliens got no game like humans; even with faster-than-light travel and impenetrable shields and death rays and superior technology and ruthless efficiency far greater than humans... humans will always win.<br/><br/>How could they not? Humans made the movie. Arrogant sluts. All alien invasion films are nothing more than human arrogance, from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL to CONEHEADS.<br/><br/>This movie just has better special effects.<br/><br/>Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have some gall listing themselves as the sole writers of this confused sci-fi debacle, when the alien arrival scenes in INDEPENDENCE DAY are plagiarized from Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End. City-sized spaceships eerily filter into Earth's skies, causing panic, yet simply hovering over major cities. These are the primo scenes in the movie, as massive shadows crawl over familiar landscapes, including the cowering White House.<br/><br/>The inevitable human story lines are introduced - to make us care: Marine pilot, Captain Hiller (Will Smith), and his stripper fiancÃ© (Vivica A. Fox); the President (Bill Pullman) and his stranded wife (Mary McDonnell); the tech geek (Jeff Goldblum), his Jewish dad (Judd Hirsch) and his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) who works for the Pres; the crop-dusting pilot (Randy Quaid) and his half-breed brood.<br/><br/>And then - beautiful destruction; wholesale death ray decimation of cities, unquestioning, unmerciful, unhuman. And a cheer goes up as the White House is obliterated in a savage blast of energy; no two useless, duplicitous, bureaucratic bricks left standing together.<br/><br/>End Act I.<br/><br/>Let the stupidity begin.<br/><br/>""The singular failure of UFO believers is their lack of imagination."" --James O'Ehley, The Sci-Fi Movie Page.<br/><br/>The Aliens have razed whole cities in seconds. How do the Marines retaliate against power so formidable? Send in Captain Hiller and his fighter plane squadron, which will do as much damage as bacteria on an elephant's backside.<br/><br/>The gargantuan Alien ships have impenetrable shields, which not even nukes can penetrate. Though nothing can harm them, why do they feel the need to counterattack Will Smith's bad boys with fighters of their own? Because the humans who wrote the movie have no imagination, forcing the aliens into stunted human methods of warfare.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast all put in their 2c worth to defeat the aliens: Will Smith getting his black on, Goldblum getting his Goldblum on, Judd Hirsch getting his Jew on, Pullman getting his Clinton on; with Robert Loggia, Harvey Fierstein and Pullman trying to out-rasp each other for maximum cred.<br/><br/>But can anyone's cred be saved if we examine their hypocritical agenda? Pres Pullman communicates with an alien through some kind of Spock mind-meld, and ""sees"" the aliens' Grand Plan and rasps, ""My God!"" with a Bon Jovi accent, ""They're like locusts, moving from planet to planet. After they've consumed every natural resource, they move on - and we're next!"" Oh, the Aquanetted outrage! Er... excuse me - isn't that exactly what MAN does? <br/><br/>Carl Sagan filibusters in all his books for space exploration and terraforming. After Earth's resources dry up, MAN himself must find a way to move on and rape some other planet.<br/><br/>When faced with extinction from extra-terrestrials, of course we would fight back, but not because we are sanctimoniously 'right' - but because we are as SELFISH as the next race of intelligent beings. INDEPENDENCE DAY could have been saved with the inclusion of this one little concept.<br/><br/>End Act II.<br/><br/>Let the terror forming begin.<br/><br/>""To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder."" --Lao-Tsze, Chinese philosopher.<br/><br/>Before the humans launch a definitive attack on the alien ships, President Pullman makes us feel dirty with his raspy pep speech: ""We will not go gently into the night; we will not vanish without a fight..."" Somewhere an orchestra is playing; somewhere a cheese factory is dying.<br/><br/>If Devlin and Emmerich stole the first act from Clarke, they stole the last act from H.G. Wells - in War Of The Worlds, Wells's Martian invaders die of Earth viruses. Conveniently forgetting that plagiarism is unethical, Devlin and Emmerich update Wells's organic virus to a computer virus, which Goldblum and Smith must plant personally in the mothership, which would scramble the force-shields of all the alien ships hovering over cities and leave them open to attack. Cue illogical plot, soporific aliens, enough special effects to feed all the children in Africa, and Einsteinian physics thrown out with the bathwater...<br/><br/>How does Goldblum plant the computer virus in the alien computers - when we can't even get Macs to talk to PCs? Inspirational music, cheering across the globe, pretty orange explosions, sacrifice, tears, everyone on Earth happy (like an Obama election), movie stars uniting on the blasted white glaring salt flats... Is there anything more desirable to a woman than that last long shot of Goldblum and Smith striding towards the camera, their burning craft in the background, across the white blaze of the salt lake? (Probably the only recorded instance of a white man ever looking cooler than a black man.) Then the forgotten physics laws kick back in, as that same atmosphere that should have burned Smith and Goldblum to a cinder upon their re-entry now fries the remnants of the alien mothership as metal chunks of it streak across the stratosphere to put an epic cap on the overwrought finale...<br/><br/>Carl Sagan wrote, ""The virtue of thinking about life elsewhere is that it forces us to stretch our imaginations."" Probably the only time Carl Sagan has ever been wrong...<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","With a great story lined up and an A list cast all included, Independence Day broke records when released in 96, and now 12 years on it still hasn't lost any of its magic.<br/><br/>Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Bel Air) coming almost straight from being a rapper and starring on a network TV show got the role of a U.S pilot which put him firmly on the market as one of the hottest and youngest actors around.<br/><br/>Smith stars alongside Bill Pullman (While you were sleeping) and Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park) as the world comes under attack by alien spacecrafts and the stakes are raised by each of their love lives.<br/><br/>With its Oscar winning effects, Independence Day established itself in the Sci-Fi genre with the huge and very impressive spacecraft designs and justified it brilliantly, especially with Smith's first encounter with one of the aliens, a personal favourite moment.<br/><br/>And along with the great effects, comes an even better plot which is gripping, tense and extraordinary. The suspense is built as viewers are given glimpses of what is coming, and the world's response is also intriguing, none more so than the political view of the president.<br/><br/>There was an interesting political side to the story, what to do and what not to do to save lives, keeping secrets and to use the right course of action, giving the plot more depth.<br/><br/>Though at first we are thrust into so many people's lives that it can be easy to forget, we gradually get to know the characters and their situations and though a bit cheesy, are still fun to watch, and at points dramatic and thankfully realistic in context.<br/><br/>There are some great one liners, especially from Smith. The acting is far from brilliant but the effects and the suspense in the plot is enough for it to be included in the top Sci-Fi thrillers of all time. And though it does wear thin after a few watchers, it never loses its power to entertain and shock."

This is not to say that the movie does not have its sad moments, but this incredible cast brightens up the day.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman plays the lovable fighter pilot who has become President. Jeff Goldblum plays a computer genius who is still in love with his wife (Margaret Colin), but are separated by professional differences. Jeff Goldblum's character, David Levinson joins up with his dad Julius (Judd Hirsh) in which the two add comic relief. Will Smith plays Captain Hiller who's dream is to fly a spaceship and lives with his striper girlfriend Jasmine (Viviva Fox). The list of great characters goes on and on. <br/><br/>Each of this incredible cast's story will be affected by the alien invasion. They must put aside their differences in order to save the planet and in the process learn to respect each other. This theme is metaphor for life that in time of crisis, human beings can come together for the good of mankind. <br/><br/>Overall just a great movie that constantly adds a new twist to the story. This movie is not trying to win an academy award but, if you take it for its worth, you will have a great time."

The special effects were top notch and the dogfight sequences were great fun even if a bit unrealistic in the actual manuevering capabilties of the aircraft involved.

","This is perhaps Roland Emmerich's best film to date. It's not a great film, but it was fun to watch and had me feeling a little patriotic after seeing it on Independence Day of 1996.<br/><br/>Like The Day After Tomorrow, another Emmerich film, Independence Day draws a good line between popcorn fun and quirky enough characters that kept me smiling. If I had to compare the two though, Independence Day would fall on top. It is also Roland Emmerich's best film so far.<br/><br/>Aliens from another planet are bent on taking over our world with huge ships that block out the sunlight. Using smaller one manned ships, they decide to do battle with our air force. We use atomic bombs as well, and neither one has any real effect on the monstrous ships that loom over major cities to lay waist to everything. All hope seems lost until a simple Cable technician (Jeff Goldblum) finds a way to make the fight more fair for mankind. With help from a cocky air force pilot (Will Smith in one of his better and more famous roles) the two set out to attack the alien mother ship with a computer virus. Will it work? Well if you haven't seen the movie you'll have to.<br/><br/>Independence Day was a phenomenal success. It helped make Will Smith a superstar and paved the way to become the biggest blockbuster of 1996. It was one of those movies you couldn't help but enjoy no matter how flawed it may have been. Like many other summer films, Independence Day was pure popcorn entertainment. I enjoyed it a lot."

","I've just seen Independence Day for the first time. We found the video at the thrift shop yesterday and brought it home, because I'd always wanted to see it, in a tepid sort of way. It's very, very good, despite being just a touch too heavy on Star Wars references. It's about as funny as a movie can be that's about big ugly vicious things trying to kill us all. I like it because Will Smith got turned down by NASA but ended up flying a spacecraft after all, and married the girl, and gave the poor little boy a father. I like it because the crazy drunk whom everybody laughed at recovered his self-respect, and his loving but exasperated son got his father back even as he lost him. I like that Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch played the parts of my husband and his dad. I like that the president, a former fighter pilot evidently uneasy with the dirty compromises of politics, gets one more chance to fly away from earthbound ambiguities into a clear sky and a straightforward mission. I like that Jeff Goldblum's ex-wife starts to wonder if ambition has perhaps led her away from something really worth doing, into something that only looked worthwhile. I like the silly moment when Harry Connick, Jr. appears to be proposing to Will Smith, and the thought plainly crosses his mind that if these aliens really do manage to take over the earth and kill everybody, at least he'll be spared having to talk his way out of that one. I like that the First Lady is assisted by an exotic dancer who admits that she ""voted for the other one."" I like the old Marine general, who never looked really at ease in that tie, back in fatigues and looking twenty years younger. Altogether, I really liked Independence Day."

To give it a 0 rating would mean it is devoid of anything but mindless drivil which, given the writing team and directors would be insulting. However, it does have amble advertisments for SKY news (even though the satalites are apparently been knocked out) and this in itself would merit the 0 rating. But let's be serious.

To put things into perspective, since I write this comment almost seven years after the movie came out, I find it pretty amusing that this movie coins some of the most outrageous and ass-inine (hyphen on purpose) ideas ever developped for a motion picture such as using a mac to spread a computer virus onto an alien spacecraft, or showing aliens sustaining bullet wounds without so much as a blink and be knocked out for several hours with a single punch in the face or also - last one, I promise - the president of the US hopping into an f18 and flying like his last flight was yesterday...while no one questions why, yes WHY he knows how to fly one of these birds...<br/><br/>In summary, I think ID4 deserves to be #1 of the bottom 100 chart. Yup, even worse than from Justin to Kelly because the latter is shameless and open about its mediocrity, riding on just enough hype to last through the summer and appeal to acne-ridden teens, but at least it's honest and it's not trying to treat the audience as a mindless pack of idiots incapable of realizing the 2 hour long shortcoming that ID4 represents. <rage fading>"

But, as time has passed, and I've become more discerning in my moviegoing, this film becomes less and less spectacular to me.<br/><br/>It has its moments. Will Smith brings the charisma; he almost seems born to play the role (the scene in the desert where he carries the alien proves this.) Jeff Goldblum's is not unlike ""Jurassic Park's"" Ian Malcolm; he's likable, if not wholly interesting. Bill Pullman plays another president of cinematic invention; we could only be fortunate to have such a ballsy commander-in-chief like Whitmore. Judd Hirsch, as the senior Levinson, has the more energetic role in the film. His comic relief is well-timed.<br/><br/>The effects, essentially the most remembered part of the film, serve their purpose, but disappoint in some spots (the best they could come up with for an alien is an oozing, octopus- like creature?) Little was done that hasn't been done before (aerial dogfights, large-scale annihilation of major cities, et al.) For me, Vivica Fox was the true eye-candy in the whole film. ;-)<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest gripe lies with the story itself. The film plunders elements from other sources (""Star Wars"", ""War of the Worlds"", and Toho B-movies, to name a few.) Had the writing been tighter, and Emmerich and Devlin hadn't relied on stereotypes and cliched jingoistic devices like the President's speech, this merely okay movie could have been great.<br/><br/>I'm all for escapist entertainment, but when done like ""ID4"", it can grow tiresome."

","Sure, the special effects are impressive, but as with Godzilla, special FX alone to not a movie make! Boring, predictable plot, unfriendly aliens (hasn't it ever occurred to filmmakers that beings intelligent enough to have mastered interstellar travel are likely to have also mastered their violent natures?), and xenophobic, nationalistic Americans combine to make one of the stupidest, most predictable movies I have ever seen. It's sad to think how low we have stooped to be entertained. If you want to see an *intelligent* movie about extraterrestrials, watch Contact or 2001 : A Space Odyssey instead. Unfortunately, *intelligent* sci-fi movies are a rare phenomenon in today's atmosphere of overblown SFX, gratuitous violence, and general paranoia of things we do not understand."

For example the idea about how alien research is funded by overcharging on Toilet seats or some such thing. Then of course will smith enters alien space craft and starts manoeuvring it as if he had built the whole damned thing.

","This was one of the highest grossing films of 1996, it made breakthroughs with special effects, and is still remembered as one of the greatest disaster movies of all time, directed by Roland Emmerich (Stargate, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, White House Down. Basically on July 2nd, communication systems worldwide are sent into chaos by atmospheric interference, caused by an enormous alien mother ship, it deploys large objects that approach Earth, they are alien spacecrafts, spreading to major cities across the world. MIT-trained satellite technician David 'Dave' Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) has discovered a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions, he determines it is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) orders the evacuation of New York City, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., but the countdown ends and the ships activate, blasting energy weapons and destroying large cities, and killing millions of people. On July 3rd, Whitmore, Levinson, his father Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch), General William Grey (Robert Loggia) and other White House staff has escaped the devastation, an aviation force is sent to counter-attack an alien ship, Captain 'Steve' Hiller (Will Smith) is among the pilots fighting, but the attack is unsuccessful, as the alien spaceships, and smaller pilot ships, are protected by a force field. Whitmore and everyone on Air Force One are taken to Area 51, Nevada, where evidence of the aliens attacking Earth has been kept secret, eccentric scientist Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner) leads the project, and shows them a recovered alien pilot ship, and deceased alien lifeforms. Hiller crash landed following the counter-attack, and subdues an injured alien pilot, the unconscious alien is taken to Area 51 where Dr. Okun and his team operate, but it regains consciousness and attacks, it uses Okun's body to communicate telepathically and speak, before attempting a psychic attack on Whitmore, it is shot dead, Okun is left in a coma. Whitmore orders a nuclear attack on the ship positioned over Houston, but the ship remains intact, Hiller meanwhile takes a helicopter to search El Toro for his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox) and her son Dylan (Ross Bagley), he finds a group of other survivors, including First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell), who later dies of her fatal injuries. On July 4, Levinson demonstrates that the alien force fields can be deactivated by uploading a computer virus, he suggests entering the mother ship to upload a virus into all alien ships, disabling all force fields, and plant a nuclear bomb on board, Hiller volunteers to pilot the attacker, with Levinson joining him. While Whitmore joins the aerial battle of military pilots and volunteers with flight experience, including alcoholic crop duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), to destroy the ship above Area 51, Hiller and Levinson infiltrate the alien mother ship, the virus is uploaded, all shields are disabled, but missiles are exhausted attacking fighters and causing minimal damage to the outside of the ship. In the end, Casse unable to fire his one remaining missile sacrifices himself, flying into the energy weapon as it fires, causing the ship to explode, and Hiller and Levinson activate the nuclear weapon, the mother ship is destroyed as they narrowly escape, humankind rejoices their survival and watch the mother ship burn up in the atmosphere, it resembles a firework display. Also starring Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, Mrs. Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, Donnie Darko's James Duval as Miguel Casse, Mrs. Doubtfire's Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore and Harry Connick Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder. Then Fresh Prince Smith is fantastic as the wise-cracking fighter pilot and became a massive movie star, Goldblum gives a great variation on his Jurassic Park boffin role, Pullman is a good straight-faced President, and the supporting cast all get their moments as well. I agree with critics that it is a very Americanised movie, the rest of the world is targeted but hardly seen, the Yanks are ultimately representing everyone, but it doesn't matter, the big draw of the film is the brilliant special effects, seeing city-size alien spaceships covering the world in shadow, and blowing up the Empire State Building, the White House and the big cities with huge explosions, it doesn't matter how many times you watch, it is a highly entertaining science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 47 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!"

Bottom line, anything and I mean anything starring Will Smith is automatically a candidate for the worst film of all time. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich got their comeuppance however.

"ncruz-77996","3","2","6","1 July 2019"," Seriously Overrated
","Introduction:<br/><br/>I hate Independence Day. There's no originality, it's filled with cliches, the characters are stereotypes of stereotypes. It's just a very stupid action movie, that makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Let's start with the good, the very little there is. The film's action is fun to watch, and Will Smith is descent in his role, even if his character has no character, and I think the alien designs are the most creative thing in the film.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the film has an incredible lack of originality. The story is your generic aliens try and take the world story, just dumber. As the characters make stupid decisions, like letting the president go into battle. The Roswell UFO Crash being real. The film is just really dumb, and many might say, it's meant to be stupid. Well, if it wanted my brain to hurt, it succeeded. The film is almost intelligence insulting. And here's something, people hate on Battle Los Angeles, a terrible movie, for the same reason they like Independence Day.<br/><br/>The characters are also uninteresting, just saying catchphrases, and being stereotypes. Like Jeff Goldblum is a Jewish stereotype, Will Smith is a black stereotype. The actors are clearly not trying, and the film just feels like no effort is put into it. The aliens are also just generic, they have no character, and they're just evil. And I wouldn't mind so much, if the creators weren't trying to make an original alien invasion film.<br/><br/>I just don't get it! What's the love for this film? There are so many better action and science fiction films. This one barely stands out. It's just another stupid movie. And I can kind of understand somebody liking it. It's dumb. Everyone has a guilty-pleasure. But there are so many people that enjoy this film. And that's what I don't get.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Well, I've probably put more effort into this review, than the writers put into the movie. It's not very good. I can't stand this film, it's lazy, it's stupid, and it's cliche. There is nothing original about it, and I don't get it."

Yes it stretches the suspension of disbelieve way, way too far. And yes it isn't the most well written movie in the world.<br/><br/>But the special effects are fantastic, with a nice mix of practical and CGI so that everyone is happy. The acting is actually pretty good for the most part. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum bring likablity to their characters. Speaking of characters, all of them are likable and get a good amount of screen time so we care about them. This is a big film, with a huge ensemble cast and many plot lines that all come together, and I love stuff like that.<br/><br/>The film never takes itself too seriously, having a patriotic theme that's so cheesy but awesome at the same time.

Career performances by Smith as Air Force pilot, Pullman as President, Loggia as gritty general, even Goldblum as quirky scientist (in a real stretch). Only drawback is some (I think unnecessarily) unpleasant moments with the bad guys mid-way through. This is really the 90's answer to the great sci-fi classics of the 50's. I am at a total loss as to the negative comments and the lousy IMDb ratings, it must be from that crowd that thinks Wet Hot American Summer is Oscar material.

"Movie Nuttball","10","2","6","10 July 2004"," Independence Day - In-depth Comment!
","I have always loved this movie Independence Day. I love alien movies and this is the ultimate one to watch! It has the most unusual all star cast which all perform well, great music by David Arnold, and some of the greatest special effects ever seen in a movie. I don't know about other people but I believe in aliens and other life in the universe. There is just so much out there and who are we to say that we are alone? To think that there could be hundreds of thousands of intelligent species on other worlds is such an extraordinary thought. In My opinion most of the things in this movie are accurate. In My opinion ID-4 is one of the greatest movies ever made! Below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in the film!<br/><br/>Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore - He is the President of the United States of America. He fought in the Gulf War. He is an excellent pilot and an intelligent man. Invading forces are entering the Earth's atmosphere and this means that the United States and the rest of the world is going to have company like it never has had and the President must make decisions like never before!<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson - This tall man is a cable worker and he is a computer genius not to mention is a very smart man to begin with. He will play a big part in trying to save the world.<br/><br/>Margaret Colin as Constance Spano - She is the secretary to the president. She also has had long relationship David Levinson and as time goes on it looks like they will be back together again!<br/><br/>Will Smith as Capt. Steven Hiller - This smart fighter pilot is really a daredevil. He lives with his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow and her young son Dylan. Will Capt. Steven Hiller marry this attractive woman if he goes out fights an enemy like the world has never seen? <br/><br/>Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson - He is the father of David Levinson. He gives David a great idea and if it wasn't for him the world wouldn't have an advantage against the aliens.<br/><br/>Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore - The wife of the President of the USA. Her and Thomas J. Whitmore are a very close couple.<br/><br/>Randy Quaid as Russell Casse - This man served in Viet Nam and was abducted by aliens many years. He may have become a alcoholic but when the time comes he'll quit and try to save the world!<br/><br/>Robert Loggia as General William M. Grey - This top official is the first to know about the invaders from another world!<br/><br/>James Rebhorn as Albert Nimziki - This Secretary of Defense has not told the President everything!<br/><br/>Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert - This man cares about his brother, his mother, his housekeeper and ever his lawyer. <br/><br/>Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell - This large man is one of the high commanding officers in Area 51! <br/><br/>Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun - He is the head doctor in Area 51 and has had the experience at studying alien life and the arsenal they possess!<br/><br/>Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow - This beauty has been waiting for Capt. Steven Hiller to marry her. Since things in the world have gotten a little bit out of hand their marriage has to halt.<br/><br/>Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow - He is the young boy of Jasmine Dubrow. <br/><br/>Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore - She is the young daughter of the President and the First Lady.<br/><br/>James Duval as Miguel Casse, Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse - They are Russell Casse' kids.<br/><br/>Bill Smitrovich as Captain Watson - He gives orders to the fighters that will have a dog fight like they have never imagined! <br/><br/>Harry Connick Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder - This wild pilot has a charming personality and is Capt. Steven Hiller's best friend. <br/><br/>Leland Orser as Tech/Medical Assistant #1 - When there's an emergency procedure he along with Dr. Brackish Okun must perform an unbelievable surgery on a being from another planet!<br/><br/>Erick Avari as SETI Chief - After being woken up and banging his head he hears the extraordinary sound of other life on the phone!<br/><br/>Dean Devlin as Eagle 2 Pilot - This fighter pilot will have a flying time of his life!<br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE:<br/><br/>If love Roland Emmerich then I recommend that you see the following films: Making Contact (a very different movie), Universal Soldier (an awesome movie, one of the best!), Stargate (another excellent film!), Godzilla 1998 (Don't get Me wrong, its a great movie but I still feel that it is nothing like the classic Godzilla movies so I only recommend you see it if you like American monster films and/or Roland Emmerich), The Patriot,(2000, this is fine film!), and The Day After Tomorrow (Great movie!) <br/><br/>If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The UFO Incident, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

It's meant to be FUN people. And it's a hell of a lot more fun than those crappy Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>As usual, Jeff Goldblum is the scene stealer as a quirky genius, and Will Smith does his usual tough, smart, funny persona bit. Bill Pullman is alright as the President; his wife is played by the lady from ""Dances With Wolves"". Judd Hirsch is fun as Jeff's dad.<br/><br/>Sure there are problems with the plot - the fact that this all happens in the pan of 3 days is ridiculous. Maybe there are too many characters and maybe the film is long, but this isn't a terrible crime. The film isn't BAD. The destruction of the cities are well done and the climax is rousing in the tradition of the classic Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>If you want a really bad science fiction film, go watch the above mentioned Star Wars prequels, ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones""."

Jeff Goldblum as a geeky scientist, Will Smith as a cocky pilot, and Randy Quaid as a nut case.<br/><br/>Even minor scenes such as the one with Harvey Fierstein were excellent as the individual scenes were well scripted. The special effects were top notch for 1996 and still beat today's low grade CG nonsense.

I noticed the last time I watched it on a premium movie station, they had cut it to make time for ""Mar Attacks."" I am the guy who prefers it that way. Sorry. Also for purists, the film holds 100's of factual errors, continuity errors, and goofs. It seems they took so many takes shooting this film to ""get it right"" they ended up with things out of place from scene to scene. Most people won't notice."

","""Independence Day"" (1996), this movie is the best disaster movie and best alien invasion movie. This is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. I usually am not a fan of the disaster film genre, but this is one of those rare movies that gets it right! ""Independence Day"" is one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies. This movie is a blast, literally, all the way from beginning to end. Great story, great acting, great special effects, exciting sets/locations, and a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it all together. You get the complete package for all the elements of a great film. It's one of the fastest 145 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie. Of course when a movie goes by fast, you know it's a great movie! I don't want to say anything else, because I don't want to spoil the movie for some who may not have had the chance to see it yet. ""Independence Day"" is a phenomenal achievement. I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie, you are definitely missing out. See it if you haven't already, I guarantee that you'll love it. Prepare for the alien invasion!"

","While most people just roll their eyes at the mention of Roland Emmerich as a director, many forget that he essentially started the revival of the ""destructive action"" film. What used to be common in the seventies, with movies like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Towering Inferno (1974), films showing catastrophes had taken a bit of a back seat until Independence Day. This revival on a globally-catastrophic scale brought about such films as Armageddon (1998) and Deep Impact (1998).<br/><br/>Granted, Emmerich continued to make world destruction a part of his directing career, which is why films like this almost seem hokey today. Godzilla (1998), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), 2012 (2009), and White House Down (2013) haven't been the most critically-acclaimed films of all time, but they certainly carry Emmerich's penchant for demolishing cultural landmarks. One does wonder why Independence Day stands out amongst his other films, almost as an anomaly. While later films by Roland Emmerich were a bit too over the top in their carnage, this film has a good balance of destruction and plot. Some of the comedy in later films felt forced, but in this film the actors did a great job of lightening tension. Perhaps the biggest difference between Independence Day and his later films is the fact that humanity can actually fight back against the annihilation it currently faces.<br/><br/>I mean, let's face it, the legendary speech by Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore is merely the icing on the cake of great characters like Will Smith's cocky pilot Captain Steven Hiller, Jeff Goldblum's awkward genius David Levinson, and Randy Quaid's conspiracy theorist Russell Casse. These are characters we care about. These are characters who have their strengths, as well as their weaknesses. These are characters who are greater combined together, and are able to halt the alien assault on earth.<br/><br/>A great sci-fi film that almost guarantees it'll be shown on TV at least once a year due to it's loose holiday theme, I give Independence Day 4.5 stars out of 5."

"jmmustchin","10","1","2","18 November 2018"," Awesome disaster-action movie
","Independence Day is (in my opinion) one of the two greatest disaster movies ever made, alongside Deep Impact. The movie begins on July 2nd, when an enormous alien space craft is seen passing by the moon. The US military soon detect the anomaly. A series of city-sized craft are released from the mothership, and take up position over many of the world's major cities. Electronics expert David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) decodes an alien signal indicating they are going to attack. He manages to warn President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and flee Washington - just barely escaping the city's destruction. The heat rays in the alien craft obliterate all of the major cities that had craft parked over them - and almost all of their inhabitants. They then begin moving from city to city, intending to exterminate humanity. The survivors must regroup, band together and fight back against the alien invaders.<br/><br/>The movie is very exciting, with brilliant tension (especially in the half hour before the cities' destruction - man, is that a breath-holder!). The acting is splendid - especially from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. The movie is also brilliantly plotted. It has a considerable air of mystery about it, which adds to the delightful experience that watching it is.<br/><br/>But the special effects in this movie are INCREDIBLE. Quite honestly, this movie contains among the best - and certainly most real-looking - effects I've ever seen (the only movies I've seen with more real-looking effects being the first two Jurassic Parks). They're so real, they're almost scary.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I highly recommend viewing the Extended Version. It's better - and makes more sense."

To prevent their annihilation, while at Area 51, one American scientists proposes a plan to the President who arrived by Air Force One with him to give the alien computer system a virus. This virus will bring down all of the alien shields so that the united human counter-offensive can use some of their own weapons, i.e., a nuclear missile. The Americans discovered previously they were not able to penetrate past them; after the first strike the President ordered the military to launch a nuclear bomb from a grounded armored vehicle that had a visual of one of the destroyers in sight. The missile was not able to pass its shield. The scientist and a soldier commandeer a captured enemy jet stored there, at Area 51, and successfully upload the virus into the mother ship by flying the jet into the mother ship's docking bay and connecting to their computer system.

"stebird","10","1","2","17 August 2017"," We stand together, this is our Independence Day!
","One of the first modern blockbusters, Independence day is a landmark achievement in film-making and made mega-money at the box office. <br/><br/>A perfect story and a well told narrative to celebrate the Independence of America, as well as tackling the situation of an alien invasion head on; the formula of the story is a mixture of spectacular action and the human psyche, instead of mindless in-your-face grandeur, Independence Day opts for a more humane approach, adding tension and heightened emotion to the score. <br/><br/>Unlike a whole load of other sci-fi films, in this film the physical appearance of the actual aliens is purposely limited, what they look like isn't important..., they limit this to a couple of scenes most famously in Area 51 where the alien attacks the doctor in the lab. <br/><br/>In all honesty I believe this film to be Will Smith's finest, I see the man as a limited actor who hasn't got the greatest set of skills, but in Independence Day the guy was near perfect, embracing his role as Captain Steven Hiller with gusto and possesses an air of confidence unrivalled by any of his other film roles. <br/><br/>The supporting cast most notably Jeff Goldblum's David pulled their weight with enthusiasm, each of them had a required sense of urgency about them, choreographing their characters so they fit handsomely into the bigger story. <br/><br/>The premise seemed a little bit outrageous, this wouldn't happen in real life, if aliens did invade then the situation would be tackled very differently than how it is in the film, hence the story was tarted up for the big screen, overly elaborate in every department, this isn't a problem though because it's a fictional film and in every fictional film, there are deep exaggerations bordering onto the far-fetched. <br/><br/>The recent sequel of Independence Day doesn't hold a candle to the original, the sequel does everything it shouldn't, resists no temptation and appears to be glorified and therefore terrible, not so with the original, this film has clear boundaries and doesn't dare to cross them once, twenty years apart? The equivalent of a million years in Hollywood, and can't you just tell the difference in quality between the two films.<br/><br/>One of those films you can watch again and again and never get tired of, that's the mark of a top quality film..., one of the finest films of the 90's you'd be hard pressed to miss it."

I don't care for Oscars, but that's not why I go to movies in the first place. I go to a movie to be entertained, not to pick apart like a Rotisserie chicken. That's my two cents. And even if the dialogue isn't the best, it's still interesting. Many of the lines are memorable and fun to listen to as a fan. I'd even heard of some of them used in other TV shows and video games. This movie is one of those love-it-or-hate-it films, but I'm one of the people who love it. Alien ships, destruction, dogfights, and different people banding together to fight a common foe. Will they survive? Only time will tell."
"justin-fencsak","10","1","2","4 July 2017"," The movie that made Will Smith a star and began a resurgence in alien invasion movies...
","When it comes to sci-fi alien invasion stories, older generations think of HG Wells' War of the Worlds, which spawned a classic radio broadcast and two movie versions, both of which were successful. Then came Invasion of the Flying Saucers, and then Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Star Wars would soon put the genre to rest. In the mid 90s, the directors of the surprise hit Stargate came up with an idea to make a big budget alien invasion movie set on our favorite holiday in this country...Independence Day. The movie would soon break records and gross around $800 million worldwide and sell even more on VHS, laserdisc, and then DVD and bluray and digital HD and pay TV, and the rest is history. Watching it today vs 21 years ago is kinda outdated but this movie is much better than the box office failure that was Resurgence and the movie that Centropolis made two years after ID4, a rehash of Godzilla that wasn't as good as the original one or even the 2014 reboot. The visual effects in the movie as well as the sound mix are pretty good, the casting is great, and the acting is classy."

Paxton, in my opinion, played one of the most heroic, and best Presidents on screen. Goldblum was not bad, of course most of us associate him with his role in Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Don't forget Will, he was pretty great in this film too as Steve Hiller, probably one of his best roles. Which begs the question, why he didn't return for the sequel?! Oh well!!<br/><br/>The technology to make the film at the time, 1996, was really out of this world great.

","This review done in 2017 in the hopes of setting the record straight:<br/><br/>1. First, I recently was subjected to the second installment which overall was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad writing, direction, story development and under-budgeted. Most obvious was the dearth of ""hi emotion"" moments which are the high notes of a really good film, when the Adrenalin pumps and the endorphins flow.<br/><br/>2. Which made me dig up a copy of this movie which I rewatched and thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Acting, writing, direction, hi notes -- all here. This film is a 9 or a 10. Anyone who thinks otherwise should turn in their crayons.<br/><br/>3. Then as a bonus there at the 1:10 mark was the essence of the ""Secret Space Program"" (a hot topic today) with Judd Hirsch explaining how it was funded... brilliant!"
"zkonedog","9","1","2","9 March 2017"," THIS Is How Summer Blockbusters Should Be Made!
","When making a movie of the ""summer blockbuster"" type, there a number of elements that must be present, such as action, adventure, a bit of humor, some sort of seemingly unstoppable enemy, & (if the film studio really cares) some interesting characters to latch onto. The coup de grace comes if the film is able to anchor itself around a significant moment/date either past, present, or future. ""Independence Day"" scores high marks on all those elements.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the film sees planet Earth suddenly attacked by aliens bent on taking over the world. With the future of the nation on the line, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) recruits military man Steven Hiller (Will Smith) & scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) to hatch a plan to defeat the sinister invaders on the weekend of the Fourth of July.<br/><br/>To put it as plainly as possible, ""Independence Day"" is primarily a rousing success because of the gravitas the ""Fourth of July"" theme lends it. Without that holiday serving as the backdrop of the alien invasion, it just wouldn't be as epic and would likely fail to get viewers as invested. For example, a speech given by Pullman's character towards the end of the film will bring the hair on the back of your neck to attention due to it being given on our nation's birthday.<br/><br/>To be fair, however, this film is well-constructed enough to stand on its own merits. Primarily, this happens because of the all-star cast and their character development on screen. Besides the three primary leads (of which Smith almost steals the show at some points), other accomplished actors like Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin, & Vivica A. Fox round out the supporting roles. They all interact very well with each other and give the viewers some people to root for (a necessity in any quality invasion film).<br/><br/>Overall, ""Independence Day"" is easily a flick that can be enjoyed every July 4th (at the very least). It's one of those movies where you pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and just get swept away in the scope of the action playing out on the screen."

Today's movie-makers don't seem to bother with that kind of well played music when a film like this is made?<br/><br/>ID4 is a knockout from beginning to end...so don't pay too much attention to those critics who take it too seriously."
"Wuchakk","5","1","2","15 March 2016"," Blockbuster Sci-Fi with overdone comedy and inanities
","Released in 1996, ""Independence Day"" (or ""ID4"") chronicles events as the earth is threatened by malevolent aliens who wipe out entire cities. Bill Pullman plays the US President, Margaret Colin his aid and Mary McDonnell his wife. Will Smith plays a hotshot pilot and Vivica A. Fox his babe. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, James Duval and Brent Spiner are also on hand.<br/><br/>I saw this movie when it was released while on vacation during the height of its hype (incidentally, at the very theater in Aurora, CO, where The Dark Knight Rises Massacre would occur 16 years later). While fun and entertaining as most blockbusters are, it didn't match the hoopla, so I've had mixed feelings about it ever since. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the main characters are likable and there's a warmth to their relationships. I also like the feel-good quality of the movie in that it brings the whole world together to face a common enemy, despite our differences. In other words, it's not just Independence Day for America, but for Planet Earth. I also like the tie-in with Area 51, which shows that some thought was put into the script beyond just blowing up iconic buildings and whole cities. The scene where the captured alien utilizes Dr. Brakish Okun's vocal chords to speak is well done. Also, Margaret Colin looks great throughout.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the mixture of serious sci-fi with overdone comedy and the numerous ""Yeah, right"" moments. Comedy works with serious sci-fi/adventure/drama/thriller/horror as long as it's not overdone. The Terminator flicks are good examples, even Star Trek. In ""ID4"" too much of the comedy and inanities take you OUT of the story rather than take you IN. The comedic asides seem disjointed from the plot rather than enhancing it. <br/><br/>Despite the likable characters and warmth thereof, they too often come off empty and adolescent. The story focuses on the alien threat and human response so there's little character development of value. I enjoy a sci-fi flick even when its fantasy extends into the absurd and far-fetched, so long as there is some payoff -- some message of significance, some portrayal of what might or could possibly be, some character development that draws the viewer into the story and provides some basis for caring about what's happening. There's not enough of this in ""ID4."" <br/><br/>That said, there's a lot to enjoy as a shallow sci-fi blockbuster with a likable cast and some thrilling sequences. The key is not taking it too seriously since it doesn't take itself seriously. <br/><br/>The film is overlong at 145 minutes and was shot all over the USA with establishing shots from around the world. <br/><br/>GRADE: Borderline C+ or B- (5.5/10 Stars)"

A film that still has a great look, great special effects, and it can take you the place that only movies can."
"user-543-975655","9","1","2","5 August 2014"," One Of Emmerich's Best
","Roland Emmerich is a somewhat underrated director. Yes, I know he has had a few flops like 10,000 B.C and Godzilla, and even 2012 to some people, but I think Independence Day is one of his best movies. I'm saying that because it is so good all around. For example, the aliens. It's great how the alien ships are so incredibly huge (15+ miles in diameter). In some alien movies the aliens are in tiny ships and they go so fast that you aren't able to follow them. But Emmerich's version of the aliens is huge and slow, so that isn't a problem here. Anyway, the main aspects, as always. First off, the acting. Not the best. Sure, there were people like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, and they were pretty good, but some of the people like Miguel and quite a few other small characters it seemed like they had no acting experience whatsoever. None. Zip. But the main characters like Smith, Goldblum, and Pullman made up for it. Mostly. Now the special effects. For a 90's action flick, they were really good. To today's standards, they would not be good at all. But they are amazing for 90's standards. In the 15+ miles across ships, there are so many little lights and openings and such, and that most likely means rooms. So that would mean there are probably 10,000+ rooms, not even counting how many floors there would be. Detail like that is not always something you come by in movies these days. Speaking of the aliens, this movie had some really awesome practical effects for the aliens. That means someone put more than one day of effort into making this, which is always good. The special effects people did a wonderful job in this movie.<br/><br/>And now, the writing. I can't say it was the best ever, and it was kind of cheesy, but I am willing to let that slide. Some of the lines were just not needed at all, and if you got rid of all of them, the movie would be about 5 minutes shorter. Things like ""We need to pack up"" isn't needed. It's kind of obvious when there's an alien invasion that could wipe out the entire world, it's kind of obvious. And other times, there were supposed to be awesome punchlines, but they come out flat and bland because the actors couldn't execute them. But really, that's the only thing I really don't like about this movie. Fourth, the characters. I didn't think this was a good idea, but I didn't care that much because it all ends up making sense. There were four different families/groups of people. There were the people in Captain Hiller's (Will Smith) family and group of friends, and also Russell Casse's (Randy Quaid), along with President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman), and David Levinson's (Jeff Goldblum). If there were only 3-4 people in each group, I'd be OK with that. But there were at least 5-10 characters in each group, and that's a lot to bother keeping track of. It just takes away from the movie. And for the fifth, the plot. Some of it is original, and some of it isn't at all. The part that isn't original at all is the fact that a bunch of aliens have come to destroy Earth. You see that in about 85% or higher of alien movies. So nothing new there at all. But the part that is original was how Hiller and Levinson (Smith and Goldblum) took down the alien mother ship. I won't tell you exactly how because I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it involved a lot of awesomeness. And lastly, the cinematography. The way Emmerich decided to display the alien spacecraft coming out of the clouds and pretty much anything that involved the spaceships and the mother-ships was just awesome. There was a definite sense of danger and threat in all of those shots, which was nice as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I really liked Independence Day, because it is a great and enjoyable movie that I would watch again anytime. 9/10. And it sure is a lot better than 10,000 B.C and 2012. Anyway, thanks for reading and check out some of my other reviews. See ya!"

It's fabulous and I love it. It's got a great (simple) story, lots of laughs, it says something and is good to look at.<br/><br/>This film is BIG and LOUD. It was amazing on a big screen. It's action packed, suspenseful, emotive and it's even got a little re-finding of faith in there as well. It has cute children, good looking men in uniform, a scantily clad beautiful woman, a gorgeous dog, humour; Jewish humour AND Will Smith no less, a comedic hysterical gay guy, ridiculous stereotypes of different races & classic world landmarks together with subtitles just in case the viewer didn't quite get that the pyramids and people dressed for the desert with camels in the background is supposed to be Giza in Cairo, ridiculous English accents that make me giggle every time, tense aerial fight scenes, heroism, politics, patriotism, great sweeping vistas, an uplifting soundtrack and theme music, pretty slick SFX (still), a rousing and uplifting speech about the strength of the human spirit and the world coming together to fight a common foe, weepy bits... hell, it's got Data from Star Trek, it's got a Baldwin and, AND it's got long leggedy aliens. And long leggedy Jeff Goldblum, who's just plain awesome. And the lovely Bill Pullman. And Mary McDonnell.<br/><br/>See? Just what you want from a film! Someone called it a popcorn movie, and I think that is entirely correct. It's not trying to be anything other than great blockbuster entertainment and it delivers."

","Independence Day is a military science fiction disaster film about an alien invasion of Earth.It stars Will Smith,Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman together with Margaret Colin,Vivica A. Fox,Mary McDonnell,Judd Hirsch,Robert Loggia,Randy Quaid and James Rebhorn. The narrative focuses on a disparate group of people who converge in the Nevada desert and, along with the rest of the human population, participate in a last- chance counterattack on July 4,which is the same date as the Independence Day holiday in the United States.It was directed by German director Roland Emmerich, who co-wrote the script with producer Dean Devlin.<br/><br/>The film begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent, a hot-shot jet pilot, and the President of the United States.<br/><br/>It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what the viewer like in a monster hit.And they are willing to overlook any flaws that this movie has like thin plot and poor character development.But nevertheless,it has proved to be a a thrilling, spectacle- filled,entertaining and visually stunning movie."

","""Independence Day"" is one of those blockbusters where we know we're basically in it for the spectacle. Yeah, the writing ain't so hot, the dialogue is silly, and some of the performances are indeed broad, but does all of that really matter when the action is as slick and high tech and impressive visually as it is in this over the top movie? We know we're in for a good time right from the start when we get a sense of how enormous that alien mother ship is. The story, for those of us who may not have already seen this, is basically an update of films like ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"", ""The War of the Worlds"", and ""Star Wars"", with state of the art special effects. Thoroughly evil aliens hover giant city destroying spaceships over Earths' major cities, apparently ready to do some damage, and the human race seemingly can't do much. U.S. President Bill Pullman keeps trying to figure out the best options, even as the stakes keep changing. Among our other heroes are a swaggering Will Smith as an Air Force pilot and Jeff Goldblum as the nerdy computer expert who finds out how to sneak past the alien defenses. This reviewer will admit that this movie is a groaner at times (the whole story with Randy Quaids' character especially) but writer / producer Dean Devlin and writer / director Roland Emmerich serve up all of the major set pieces with flair. ""Independence Day"" may be a long movie (145 minutes in its theatrical incarnation, 154 minutes in its extended version) but at least it's never boring. It's got a supporting cast just full of familiar faces, and the invading E.T.'s are such a loathsome bunch - they're compared to locusts - that one simply can't help but want to see the humans rise up and kick some damn ass. And eventually they get their chance, and in a development we certainly hope would extend to real life, all the countries of the world are united in their one single purpose. One particularly effective sequence occurs approximately half way through when an alien specimen is prematurely set up for an autopsy, and the entire sequence aboard the mother ship is a corker as well. Overall, this is good fun for anybody who'd just like to turn their brains off and enjoy some straightforward escapism. And, in conclusion...what's so wrong with a little rah rah flag waving? Seven out of 10."
"Mackiatoe","7","1","2","21 February 2012"," Epic, Thrilling and Awesome Special Effects!
","Wow. This is one of my favourite films of all time. Not because it's a moving, meaningful, heart warming or terrifying film. It's a full on thriller with epic destruction scenes and a classic '50's storyline.<br/><br/>I'll start with the bad. 1)It's a tad cheesy. Things that people say and some of the sequences are a bit clichéd, but it's easy to out aside. 2)The storyline is VERY predictable. Alien ships come along, BOOM, rebuild of forces and a big final battle. But hey, thats the storyline that's made some other great films, right?<br/><br/>And now the good. Lots of it in fact... 1)It's utterly, incredibly, EPIC. The suspense of watching the ships arriving over the cities is really awesome. The destruction scenes are amazing. Watching everything get blown up is actually pretty cool. Sometimes, I just feel the need to watch those scenes again just for how epic they are. 2)The special effects are amazing. It just looks real. I'd dare say that some of it comes onto levels of which Avatar is on. It's scarily realistic. And it's quite a marvel to, with just how big the ships are. It's in your face and incredible to watch. 3)The storyline is a thriller. Suspense, action and a bit of romance. It's the usual Roland Emmerich. Each of the characters don't even know each other until these aliens come and destroy everything. While it's predictable, it's fun. Man throws everything it's got at the aliens, and then one simple phrase (catch a cold) changes everything. It's not entirely believable, but then again, the entire story is made up so little mistakes don't really matter. <br/><br/>So, if you want an epic Sci-Fi thriller with amazing special effects, suspense and the best destruction scenes I have ever seen, this is the one for you. Don't take it seriously, it's not realistic. Most films aren't. This though, is already a classic, and will always be one of those 'great films'. It makes my top 10 films of all time easily!"

","In 1996 the movie Independence Day was released. Also known as ID4 this movie starts out with a scene of the first man on the moon and that the American's came in peace for all mankind. On July 2nd aliens from another planet enter the earth's atmosphere with their mother spaceship and many other smaller spacecraft attached. They plan to invade and destroy the world starting with all major cities. At first the Americans try to come in peace and send a message to the alien mother ship. They respond by blowing up the helicopter and all other surrounding aircraft. At this time president Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) learns by help of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) that the aliens are using our own satellite system against us and will destroy the world in a short period of time. The president then orders everyone to leave the cities and prepare for destruction. Then the alien's strike they blow up and destroy major cities all around the world in their first attack. The United States set up a counter attack to destroy the mother ship when they learn that the alien space craft has a protective shield that none of our weapons can penetrate. U.S. air force captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is one of the only few survivors in this counter attack and he beings down a small alien space craft and captures an alien and brings him to a secret lab/ army base called area 51. The aliens continue destroying cities and president Whitmore is forced to engage in nuclear warfare with the aliens to destroy them. However the protective shield around the alien space craft cannot be penetrated by a nuclear bomb. Many of Americans have died at this point and the president and every other world leader is distressed. At this point David Levinson who figured out they were using the worlds satellite system against us realizes that the protective shield around the space craft's works off of an advanced computer system. By giving that system a computer virus the shield will be dropped and then the military can attack them. They plan an attack with the whole world on many different space craft because once the mother ship is infected with the virus then all the smaller ships will be also. Capitan Steven Hiller teams up with David and Steven will fly the recovered alien spacecraft from area 51 into the mother ship and David will implant the computer virus. The rest of able Americans and other pilots around the world are ready to attack. Once inside the mother ship Steven and David get locked in to the system and implant the virus. Their protective shields are now ineffective and the Americans begin to attack the smaller ships. They destroy them and then Capitan Hiller and David set off their nuclear bomb in the mother ship and they fly out in their spacecraft. The mother ship explodes into millions of pieces and David and Steven make a safe landing back on earth and return to their families. The aliens have been defeated. The central theme of this movie is heart and never giving up. The human race did not give up once on fighting for their freedom. Even after many counter attacks failed they proved that they were not going to go down without a fight and they all came together and worked together to save their world from destruction. Throughout this movie the sound effects of the explosions and the flying shrapnel and fire make this movie very realistic. After many counter attacks have failed you can see the distress on the president's face in a close up when he gives the order to nuke them. Overall this movie is very well written, action packed and very realistic. Watching this movie feels like you are really there and you become part of it because it is so intense. This was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone."

","Plot: Aliens enter the Earth's atmosphere and start wrecking havoc in our already chaotic planet. The movie follows 3 main characters, the heroic and young US President, the highly skilled Jet Fighter pilot and the tree-hugging and extremely smart Scientist. All of them will combine their forces in order to kick some major Alien booty.<br/><br/>You'll love Independence Day if: You like nicely done and very, very, very, VERY, big and loud explosions, dogfights between UFOs and Jet Fighters, over the top heroism, typical Hollywood characters and cheesy one-liners... did I mention the loud BOOMS? Get a big bucket of popcorn, turn off your brain and just pretend you are a 10-yeal old kid that just wants a bit of Hollywood Humor, great special effects, big aliens and big boobs... oh, forget the last one, wrong movie. I've got to admit that some scenes really touched my black, hellish and tasty heart despite them being way too typical... you know, over the top bravery, a bit of romance, etc. I also have to admit that I wanted the Aliens to win... sorry fellow humanoids!<br/><br/>You'll hate Independence Day if: You want realism and good characters. Logic literally takes a backseat in this movie... a movie where a race of EXTREMELY advanced aliens traveled millions of light years only to show us, the Homo Sapiens, how stupid they are despite their superior technology. They get killed in all kinds of stupid ways that are far from realistic or at least believable. Even their initial strategic placement over major cities has no meaning... I mean why exactly do the aliens want to destroy the White House and not a military base with nuclear missiles??? Do they hate big fancy buildings or something? Next the characters are the usual typical bunch. The extremely heroic US President, the Jew, (therefore smart), scientist and his old pops, (I loved that guy!), the honest lap-dancer, a black jet fighter pilot, (therefore Macho & too ""Hip-Hop""), the nerdy secret scientist, (I hate this stereotype), and so on and so forth. The biggest problem is that while most actors do a good job they once again play themselves, like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. I really wanted to avoid saying this but this movie is way, way, WAY too conservative, almost Disney-ish and maybe a bit too ""GOD BLESS America!!!""<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Popcorn Movie (4.7/10)<br/><br/>[+] Great SFX like massive spaceships and even more massive explosions. Somewhat funny. Perfect movie to test your Home Theater Speakers.<br/><br/>[-] Way too stereotypical characters and not all actors portraying them are exactly good. Not a movie you'll see twice, (especially out of the Cinema). Not enough aliens<br/><br/>Also Check: Armageddon (1998) - Jurassic Park (1993) - Mars Attacks! (1996) - War Of The Worlds (2005)<br/><br/>P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO..."

"annevejb","Null","1","2","24 August 2009"," A gripping yarn if meaning is ignored? v1.00
","Emmerich's earlier work, Moon 44 (1990). Low budget visuals but an intelligible story of a clash between two strong industrial groups, the clash happening well away from the legal frameworks on earth. Believable, if scary for a weak male to female. Independence Day (1996) maybe adds extra possible sets of meanings to this. <br/><br/>Further, I have a problem with how I interpret possible hidden meaning in this 1996 work. It is earthlings against alien invaders and as an underclass I have occasionally noticed that we are understood by many to be aliens, Klingons, we are often warred against. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Going to other sources to try to amplify my understandings of this can be sense, just I really need to look to biblical sources and I am prone to misunderstand those in a big way. Unfortunately that does not stop me feeling a need to try to interpret in that way. <br/><br/>Ancient Hebrew law, that some types of legal penalties should not be permanent for those in the tribes. The Jubilee year. A time of freeing those enslaved. But the biblical histories only note one occurrence of that, and in their later years at that, with a rush to back out and re-enslave those freed. <br/><br/>That is a fun thing for underclass to note and write experiences of occasionally as around 1992 to 93 I was noting that sort of thing. By 1996 I was in big trouble again, chained. I assume that other underclass will have had experiences too, freedom then loss of that freedom. For me, Independence Day by Emmerich feels like an expression of how the good among the ancient Hebrew might have felt when the slaves were freed. If that is the case I understand it to totally misunderstand the realities of big babies and other such. It is not an expression of a Klingon view but of an Enterprise view. <br/><br/>The weakness of the logic of an earth computer virus on alien machines is obvious to many. But I understand it to likely be intended to be a parallel to one of the main ways that Enterprise culture attacks and forms the underclasses. We are led astray and then mangled badly. This suggests that the underclasses are victims in a war that has always been going on, just the belief systems that have been openly dominant since the eighties have made the result clearer, they are a purer form of natural injustice? <br/><br/>The aliens having telepathic control fits what I understand of Enterprise understandings about Klingons, see Wet Hot American Summer. Meantime my Klingons' experiences of Enterprise attacks is of them often being akin to that. To quote Spike in Buffy, such actions by Enterprise or anyone are not without side effects. To me, this telepathic control is not about Klingon reality other than that. <br/><br/>Whatever, if I forget about meaning then this is a gripping yarn. Even if it is told by Captain Kirk's side."
"hnt_dnl","3","1","2","18 June 2009"," Forefather to TRANSFORMERS
","If you want to know the partial inspiration for the most recent TRANSFORMERS movie, look no further than this 1996 movie INDEPENDENCE DAY. On a lark, I watched ID4 recently again and it is just as bad as I remember it to be back in 1996. Both movies are very similar in that they have a host of annoying, poorly written characters and overly confusing action sequences. In ID4 the action is a tad more coherent, but strangely limited and kind of boring upon repeated viewing. When I originally saw it, I thought the action was the only good part of the movie. Still true, but not saying much.<br/><br/>The story of ID4 is that aliens float down to attack and destroy earth (yadda yadda yadda) and so a core group of humans must band together and brainstorm to defeat them (sound familiar?). Should, because this is the plot of TRANSFORMERS. Of course, as in TRANSFORMERS, a secret part of the gov't knew about the aliens for years already. In ID4, it is the infamous Area 51 (it was Section 7 or something in TRANSFORMERS). The band of heroes include the Pres. and some of his staff, the military (or what is left of it), a computer genius and his crew, and a bunch of nomadic volunteers who SOMEHOW found Area 51! The actors? ID4 stars Will Smith. I'll admit I don't like Smith, but I have opened my mind with several actors and liked them in certain films because I was impressed with their work, even if I didn't like them overall. THIS is not the film to make me like Will Smith! This movie is precisely the reason I don't like him. Playing Air Force Capt. Hiller, Smith is overly cocky, shouts at EVERYONE, and delivers really bad one-liners that make you cringe. I will say, I did like Smith in the original BAD BOYS (ironic b/c Michael Bay directed that movie and he also directed TRANSFORMERS, which I'm connecting to ID4).<br/><br/>Smith isn't the only actor who comes away unscathed. Bill Pullman is terrible as the President, just plain bad. He speaks at a slur/whispery tone throughout and I actually think he is supposed to be a tough guy! Conveniently, the Pres. is a former ""fighter pilot"" (haven't heard them called that since the 1940s!) and he lead the final July 4th attack against the space invaders. Other victims to the bad acting bug are Brent Spiner (STAR TREK:TNG's Data) looks bad as the Area 51 top scientist who experiments on the aliens to find out how to kill them, Robert Loggia (a usually reliable character actor) as the Pres. top military adviser, Judd Hirsch as an all-too Jewish father to a key person in the film; I'll mention later), Margaret Colin as the Pres. press secretary (who has an obvious crush on him!), Randy Quaid as a bumpkiny cropduster (convenient that he knows how to fly a plane!), and Jeff Golblum (really the film's third lead behind Smith and Pullman) as a brilliant computer nerd (and Colin's ex-husband and Hirsch's son).<br/><br/>I mentioned Goldblum last for a reason: he is actually the only character watchable in this! How Goldblum comes away from this smelling like a rose is amazing. He actually abandons all that jittery, hesitant acting style that he is famous for and pretty much plays it straight and looks good compared to everyone else. And he actually has funny lines that aren't unintentionally funny, but actually funny.<br/><br/>Interestingly also, ID4 is a fairly dated looking film that I've seen it recently. The special effects are surprisingly cheesy for a late 90s film. But the biggest clunker in this whole thing is HOW the humans defeated the aliens (a computer virus!). Sooo convenient that a simple earth virus could disrupt the central database of a highly advanced alien race. The ""band of heroes"" synchronizes the virus implant (headed by Smith and Goldblum, who use the Area 51 spaceship to fly into the mothercraft hovering above earth) with the figther attack (led by you know who!) so they can penetrate the alien armor and defeat them.<br/><br/>Pretty neat, huh? Well, ID4 is the 90s version of movies like TRANSFORMERS, which insults the viewers intelligence with an empty plot and poorly drawn characters. I hear people all the time say that ""it is supposed to be mindless fluff"" or ""it's just a movie"" or ""at least the action is great"" or ""enjoy it for what it is"". That's fine to a degree, but a movie ought to have a semblance that the filmmakers actually put real effort into what translated to the screen. The makers of ID4 did not."

There are a lot of funny scenes. My number one has to be when Will Smith drags an alien in a parachute behind him. Awesome dialog...<br/><br/>The effects are good enough. I think the design of the aliens is creative. Even though you don't see them much up-close, which is a shame. Spaceship design is maybe a little too... classic? I mean they're basically flying saucers. Not saying it's a bad thing, but I personally prefer more exotic, strange designs. Just one opinion of course.<br/><br/>For a disaster movie, it has a surprisingly long runtime. Over two hours. There's a good build-up in the story and it gives more depth to the movie when it comes to characters and background.<br/><br/>Independence Day is a good Sci-Fi movie with a nice mix of humor, action and drama.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars."

","The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition: entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art, I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film: where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched, these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat."

","I really loved ID4. I wasn't expecting too much of a plot - what can you expect when a film is called Independence Day and features aliens invading Earth in giant spaceships? -. This thing is one hell of a ride. It contains some of the best massive destruction scenes ever filmed, but the development of the plot is kinda stupid and sometimes offensive - like the Empire State goof -. I went to see this wanting to watch great special effects and i got it. I only hope Emmerich and Devlin would hire an actual screenwriter next time they make a movie, The Patriot sucked. ID4 is NOT science fiction. SCI-FI contains some explanation of why things work the way they do, like in 2001. This movie boasts great fx and action sequences. The problem does lie with stereotypical characters. However the scenario of fighting back the apocalypse is something we can all root for. Even those who didn't like it must have had a slight feeling of pride while beating back the aliens. The actors were at the very least charismatic and charming, even if they were underdeveloped. Bottom line, this movie is great fun and holds up after repeated viewings."

","As we all know, this film isn't very good... An undefeatable force of aliens is defeated, by Will Smith. It's ridiculous obviously! But what I want to look at is the proleptic nature of th film.<br/><br/>This is a pre 9/11 film and just as well because I don't think it would have been half as successful or entertaining had it been post 2001. This is because when the movie was first seen, blowing up buildings from the sky was not a reality....it was very very cool. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centres taste in action films, particularly American taste, has changed radically.<br/><br/>The remarkable element of this film is that it managed to satirise the war with Iraq before it even happened, let me explain:<br/><br/>In the film America has some big buildings destroyed by a force they do not understand and are threatened by, and of course they assume that the rest of the world is threatened also without really asking them! Then America saves the day with the President leading the troops from the front line, the only solution is to totally destroy this new life form. Surely this film represents the George Bush dream world in which he, and preferably Will Smith, save the human race.<br/><br/>The truth is, this film could be re-released today and modern critics would slate it for being unsubtle American propaganda.

","In reality, it's often comforting to know that all your expectations will be met and that no surprises are in store. At the movies however the unexpected is almost always a welcome visitor. But with the highly touted ""Independance Day"", the unexpected was never going to make an appearance.<br/><br/>On viewing this phenomenal blockbuster, I was greeted with exactly what I expected : complete schmaltz with an unimaginative storyline, one dimensional characters and a sight and sound show that sends you reeling.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich (""Universal Soldier"") and partner in crime/producer Dean Devlin have ground out a terribly manufactured, formulated script that is both derivative and dull, but who cares. The characters are all stereotyped and one can hardly begin to care whether or not they are blown up by spaceships, but who cares. What really matters is that ""ID4"" has delivered exactly what it promised, a visual display of mind blowing proportion, and an awesome sound effects show to back it up. The alien invasion is incredibly convincing thanks to the work of the f/x crew, with the definite highlight being the explosive destruction of several major cities. All this amazing cinematic genius adds up to pure escapism for the viewer.<br/><br/>Never mind that poor old Bill Pullman gets the worst role of his life as the young American president who is forced to deliver some of the most awful lines ever written for a lead player. Nobody else fairs any better, with Will Smith as the all American hero pilot who sees all of his dreams come true as he becomes a pseudo-astronaut and gets to save the world at the same time. And as the mathematical whiz who comes up with the ultimate plan to overthrow the enemy, Jeff Goldblum could be in danger of becoming stereotyped, though at least he had a little more to work with than most. Also starred Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Margaret Colin, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Harvey Fierstein, Harry Connick Jnr., and Brent Spiner.<br/><br/>Although more than two hours in length, ""Independance Day"" never seems to over stay its welcome, but I wouldn't recommend more than one viewing. If you do decide to catch this f/x extravaganza, do so at the cinema, preferably one equipped with a THX or Digital stereo sound system.

The clichés are all bad, the characters are stereotypical and unbelievable all the way across the board (except for Adam Baldwin, I really believe he's like that all the time now, having seen that character from him in so many roles) and history will only serve to make this movie more and more incomprehensible to future watchers. Its only hope is in becoming a cult-hit someday, and tragically it's not quite bad enough for that, as the special effects are as great as the script is horrible.<br/><br/>In terms of the larger culture of the Clinton Presidency, this movie also had the odd distinction of being one of a few big films that portrayed a young, vibrant male president with a non-existent or terminally injured first lady that was about to make him a free man. Where did THAT come from?!?!? And is there some underlying lesson we all should infer about Hollywood's attitude toward Hillary as Clinton's First Lady angles now to be the next President? <br/><br/>Ultimately I think this woeful film will really serves as a divining rod for our culture itself; you either believe this movie deserves three out of four stars, or you believe it deserves ZERO stars. There's hardly a middle ground."
"marshall_plan02","9","1","2","29 August 2007"," ""Top Gun"" meets ""War of the Worlds"" (only there's no Tom Cruise)
","This movie is TRULY one of the best and names itself the Science Fiction version of ""Top Gun"". The actors were great. Will Smith got ""jiggy with it"" as a hotshot F/A-18 pilot in the movie; Randy Quaid (the older brother of Dennis Quaid) proved to be the comic relief; Bill Pullman's character transformed from a President with the problem of a nation into a reborn veteran; and Jeff Goldblum became more brilliant than ever! The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots. Even this movie let out some political tension: aliens warning humans of obliteration (the ""No Peace"" scene in the Area 51 laboratory) and nations uniting in order to stop extinction of the human race. The only thing I craved out of this movie is a sequel or a prequel. Period."
"dtm666","7","1","2","4 July 2007"," Fun little popcorn flick
","I remember the hype that went behind this movie. A fairly Super Bowl commercial, a FOX special, a bunch of related shows or something... I don't remember the exact details, but I remember that there was a movement that was pushing this movie as a big deal.<br/><br/>So much hype back in the day...<br/><br/>Back when it was released in 1996-ish, I thought Independence Day was a fairly satisfying movie. It didn't have the most original plot in the world (aliens attempt to conquer Earth and it's up to the humans to repel them - where have we NOT seen that one before?), but it was still a thrill to see the special effects, thrilling aerial battles, and whatnot. Some ten odd years later, the movie has lost much of its luster, but not so much its fun element.<br/><br/>Those ""exciting"" special effects? They still serve a purpose and they're still okay, but nothing special. The plot is somewhat thin and the slow scenes are fairly slow enough to get you out of the mood. Even the tense moments seem predictable and it's not due to repeated viewings. Despite all this, it's still a fairly decent popcorn flick worth killing a night if you have nothing better to watch. It's not a sophisticated movie, it's not a masterpiece, it's just a fun little action flick with aliens and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>Independence Day is worth a look if you're looking for a quick fix of action movies, but anyone looking for high art should look elsewhere. Good messy fun."

The creatures - ""Alien."" Attacks on the giant ship, AND the mother ship - ""Stars Wars."" Using lights on a helicopter to signal ""friendly signs"" to the aliens - ""Close Encounters"" (and then it gets blown up - hilarious! and the pilot of the helicopter is the same actor in the same role in another movie about ""friendly aliens"" - 1984's ""Starman.""). ""Data"" from ""Star Trek - Next Generation"" as the crazy scientist leader of Area 51. Bill Pullman, AKA ""Lone Star"" from ""Space Balls"" as the President. Randy Quaid as the ""suicide pilot"" blowing up the big ship - same as Slim Pickens straight out of ""Dr. Strangelove."" ""War of the Worlds"" (giving their computer a ""cold"" like the aliens dying from earth ""viruses""). The early scene of Randy Quaid's kids in the trailer park watching an old B&W movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Jeff Goldblum from ""Earth Girls Are Easy."" ""Star Wars"" type dogfights.

"ozthegreatat42330","9","1","2","19 April 2007"," A blend of action, sci-fi and humor that wins in the end
","From the opening moments of the film as the camera shot pulls back from the footprints on the lunar surface, and the shadow of something passing overhead disturbs the dust on the ground, you know this is going to be a special film. And it is exactly that. Director Roland Emmerich creates a film that is good sci-fi and action, while not trying to take itself too seriously. The cast is excellent, with Will Smith and Jeff Goldbum standing out, and Randy Quaid playing an off the wall character as only he can. With the same attention to detail as he used in Stargate Emmerich gives us a film that will long be remembered for it's scope if nothing else. Underlying the film however is a disturbing trend that needs to be addressed. In the early days of the cold war, when McCarthyism was rife in our country, most sci-fi movies were about alien invasion. Then through the sixties to the eighties we had a period when aliens were benign as we looked for a better world. But as we entered the turbulent nineties and into the new century where conflict and violence is again pressing our sci-fi movies have once more started turning to alien invasions. Something to think about as you watch this film."
"eastbergholt2002","9","1","2","14 April 2007"," Entertaining Blockbuster
","Independence Day is fun and fast-paced. In many ways its the perfect Hollywood blockbuster. It involves a battle between good and evil and has a clever mix of action, romance and comedy. The characters are smart, brave and likable. It helps if you have a mental age of about 14 and don't take it too seriously. Overall, the film has a good story, superb production values and some impressive explosions. It has the obligatory, feel good ending and will probably be regarded as a Hollywood classic in twenty years time. <br/><br/>Bill Pullman plays a U.S. president who has to deal with a alien invasion. The president was a pilot in the First Gulf War and his war record propelled him to the presidency (sic). The president tries diplomacy but soon discovers that the aliens are hostile. Many cities are destroyed and people die in large numbers. The Earth's military forces initially take a beating, but America finds a way of fighting back. This is mainly down to the nerdy genius of Jeff Goldblum and the bravery of Will Smith, a cocky marine pilot. On the eve of the final battle, President Pullman rallies his troops by giving a speech that recalls the patriotic St. Crispin's Day speech from Shakespeare's Henry V. With no irony whatsoever, Pullman depicts the Brits and the aliens as interchangeable evildoers. <br/><br/>There are various romantic sub-plots. Smith is in love with a stripper with a heart of gold (Vivica Fox). Goldblum is still in love with his ex-wife, the president's press secretary (Margaret Colin) The film has excellent scene stealing performances from a large supporting cast, including: Quaid, Judd Hirsch, Mary McDonnell, Robert Loggia and Brent Spiner. This film is very entertaining and mindless fun."
"barnabyrudge","6","1","2","11 March 2007"," Corny, over-the-top space invasion film which is agreeably entertaining if you disengage the brain.
","The most curious thing about Independence Day is that it is structured very much like a disaster movie of the 1970s. For about an hour or so, disparate characters from varied walks of life are sketched in, then the big cataclysm takes place which draws them all together in a struggle for survival. This is exactly how films like Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake and The Towering Inferno were put together. The interesting slant with Independence Day is that it takes this 1970s disaster movie formula and fuses it with a genre that was at its most popular in the 1950s  the alien invasion story. With a mega budget, a cast of hundreds and state-of-the-art special effects, Independence Day is a box office juggernaut that brings out the best and worst of Hollywood movie-making. Corny, over-the-top and jingoistic one moment; exciting, entertaining and spectacular the next.<br/><br/>A number of massive spaceships appear above several major cities around the world. Worldwide hysteria follows, with some people welcoming the extra terrestrial visitors with open arms while others fear that the end of life as we know it is imminent. American President Thomas J Whitmore (Bill Pullman) tries to keep everyone calm, promising to take a sensible and communicative approach towards the newcomers. Meanwhile, scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) breaks a code emanating from the alien spacecrafts and realises that they are co-ordinating an attack against the Earth. In a cataclysmic offensive, the great cities of the world are decimated by the aliens  the Empire State Building, the White House, airports, air bases, and city blocks are reduced to rubble during the systematic destruction. Ace US Air Force pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith) somehow survives a mid-air duel against an alien craft, and soon afterwards seeks refuge in the top-secret desert base Area 51. Here Hiller joins forces with Levinson, President Whitmore, and various others, and together they plan one final desperate roll of the dice in their bid to save the planet from the seemingly unstoppable invaders.<br/><br/>It's simple to get carried away with Independence Day, especially when viewing it on the big screen. The epic scenes of destruction are done with such enthusiasm that it becomes very easy to sit back awestruck, enjoying the mindless spectacle of it all. (From a post-9/11 viewpoint, though, it's not quite such harmless fun to watch American landmarks crumbling to the ground). If you watch the film again afterwards, particularly on the small screen, some of its shortcomings are much more apparent. Things like the hopeless dialogue, the endless clichés, the non-stop jingoism surrounding American courage and ingenuity, and the largely wooden performances are a lot easier to spot second/third/fourth time around. But director Roland Emmerich is clearly having a great time with the cornball scenario - and during many sequences you can almost imagine him just to the left of the screen, rubbing his hands with glee and delighting in the sheer technical bravura of his simulated world destruction. It might be advisable to leave your brain in neutral.. but if you do just that, Independence Day hits the spot as exciting, escapist fun."
"boz75","9","1","2","20 February 2007"," Brilliant sci-fi movie - one of the best ever made!
","This film in my opinion is a classic sci-fi movie that will always have a place in my collection. It is based on aliens who move on from one world to the next who have conquer and conquest on their minds and our world, Earth, is targeted. It has very good action scenes, humour and fellowship, cool special effects(that even to this day are excellent), and I personally loved the different mix of characters. There is 1 main quibble for me - the virus that is uploaded to the mother-ship. I had to sweep that fact under the carpet because it is more unlikely than me winning the jackpot on the lottery, than someone who could successfully upload a virus to a supposedly state of the art alien space vessel..using.. windows 95 or even 3.11 maybe? lol. <br/><br/>However despite that, it gives the story of humans uniting together to accomplish a single goal despite our differences - simply to survive. A great tale and I cannot see why action,adventure or sci-fi fans would not enjoy this film - so if you fall into this category, watch it as you will not be disappointed. For people who have other film categoric interests, I would still recommend that you check this out to see what you think, as it is a very good film and still may have some entertainment value for you!"
"alicespiral","10","1","2","17 February 2007"," Keep telling yourself its only a movie

Now that we have computer games on DVD it looks just like that-a computer game. You could ask a million questions about the plot-like when one of the aliens speaks its in English! The explosions are great-but with major cities being zapped out all over the globe the reality is it would have caused massive Earthquakes and floods to say nothing of a communication breakdown.In other words no single computer would have worked.

"sherbetsaucers","7","1","2","6 February 2007"," At Least America Saved The World
","When I first decided to watch this movie I had a very clever idea. Why not, I thought, invite around some friends, and rather than watch this movie quietly, absorbing all of the pathos and dramatisation on screen, encourage them to talk through it, recording what they say and picking the highlights out to use as the bulk of this review. A fantastic idea with but one draw back. You couldn't understand a word on the Dictaphone. All I was left with was my friend Carole saying ""At last, Will Smith"" as 24.29 minutes into the movie we see the star, Jeff Goldblum being told that the thing they are sticking on the ship he is about to fly in is ""the strongest radio transmitter we had. It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus."" my friend Dean proclaiming 'that looks like a big metal d***o' and my good self booing loudly at the line, spoken by British officers, '""It's from the Americans. They want to organise a counter offensive."" ""It's about bloody time! What do they plan to do?""'. Come to think of it that may well have been the witty highlight of the night Let us move to the plot. *Takes a deep breath* Actuallyicantbebothered. *Gasps* I decided when describing the plot it was best not to waste time with spaces, besides it already has enough gaps in it, and I could plunge right into talking about the cool special effects and set pieces.<br/><br/>Actually, that's not totally fair. For a start the version I watched had 8 whole extra minutes of footage, which translates as Independence Day: Now With Added Trailer Trash. However, I enjoyed the added trailer trash. Suddenly I find myself actually caring about the family in their mobile home. There are also some added scenes with Jeff Goldblum, which is never a bad thing in my opinion. Thanks to adding in this extra footage, a few bits of the movie make more sense. Although no, they still don't explain that whole computer uploading thing. I can't get mine to notice my printer, and these are Aliens for crying out loud! So special effects. Wow. They still look amazing. The blowing up of the White House is now part of movie history but the amount of love and attention that Joseph Viskocil, head of mechanical effects puts into destroying things is a joy to behold. Not only the special effects but also the visual effects as well. My favourite being the canyon chase with the F-18 and the Alien space craft. Roland Emmerich had the guts to shoot the entire chase in daylight. There really is no margin for error here and yet it still rips along at a fantastic pace, not once giving the audience a chance to really question what they are watching. This movie set out to be a summer block buster, and it really, truly is.<br/><br/>Amazingly enough, the acting isn't too bad either. Will Smith gets to finally take on the part of action lead hero but having done his time as The Fresh Prince his timing for those oh-so-important one liners is spot on. Jeff Goldblum, who in my eyes can do no wrong, does no wrong. Unfortunately, their better halves in the film suffer from the fact that they are, well, women in an action movie. Margaret Colin, who initially seems independent and feisty gets to basically keep the home fires burning (though the Aliens also do a pretty good job of that one) and look all impressed when her man comes back having done the job and chomping on a stogie. Vivica A. Fox also has very little to do as her exotic dancer, despite driving around in a big truck at one point and picking up survivors. The fantastic Mary McDonnell gets to die and that's about it for female roles. Judd Hirsch in support as Goldblum's father is hilarious, while Randy Quaid, the washed up bum of previous note, is just a bit annoying. However, Bill Pullman as President Whitmore is perfect. I want to like him, I want to believe in him and, after he gives his speech (I don't think Thomas would mind being paraphrased) I want to follow him to the gates of hell. I would like to point out that I think it is Pullman who manages to make me like that speech. Read it on it's own. It could not be any more bombastic if it tried. I would like to point out that that statement comes from someone pretentious enough to use the word bombastic.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast fill their rolls admirably, and surprisingly enough you never feel that any of the cast are ever fighting for the screen. Unlike many 'modern' high effect movies (it was made way way back in 1996) the live action actors are never upstaged by what is happening around them, and here I think lies the true strength of this movie. If a viewer doesn't care about the people on the screen then they cannot connect with their plight enough to have any real suspension of disbelief. When you go to Alton Towers you know you're not going to fall out of The De-atomiser, or what ever attraction it is you chose to loosen your bowls: however, while you are riding it, there is still that fear, that adrenaline rush. You get that because you connect with the moment. In Independence Day you connect with the characters. You care about them and so you care about the fate of the world. It's because of this that all these years later the effects still bring a grin to your face."
"stargzr12","8","1","2","21 January 2007"," Fun, entertaining film!
","I loved this film! I love Will Smith, and he plays this character as the typical ""success against the odds"" story that most Americans love. (We do love our happy endings, don't we?) Jeff Goldblum's injured genius is a character he plays well, and the banter between he and Will is fun. It's fun, funny, has great special effects, and doesn't drag you down with pretense. The critics posting such horrible reviews should lighten up and remember to judge a film within its own genre. If you're looking for highbrow substance, dramatic seriousness, dark characters, or ponderous subjects, you should probably watch indie movies, or those depressing films in which everyone is unhappy, no one wins, and no one gets the girl. Pop some corn, settle in, and allow yourself to be entertained!"
"andrew-huggett","6","1","2","5 January 2007"," Enjoyable 'gung-ho' hokum
","Excellent special effects of alien spacecraft posed above LA, Washington and New York in broad daylight. Best sequences were of the cities destruction  but surely a more effective way (neutron radiation?) could have been devised to wipe out mankind with such advanced technology? Apart from the effects sequences the film was full of plot holes, completely unbelievable & predictable and had an unbearable 'gung-ho' American attitude. There were references to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Dr Strangelove' as well as more than a passing similarity to the 1953 film version of H.G. Wells 'The War of the Worlds' and 1977's 'Star Wars'. All of these films were far superior.<br/><br/>Absurd sequences include the following: knocking the alien unconscious  then later the same alien is virtually invincible and seems to be much larger; Air Force Ones's very narrow escape from Washington (and the fact that the President would be allowed to stay in The White House until the last moment); the fact that the spaceships were so indestructible & fast and that there were so many of them versus the air force jets; the absurdly easy way in which an Apple PowerBook was able to interface (remotely) with the alien's computers and shut down their force shield; the way in which the alien craft conveniently did not crash on top of Area 51 when it was brought down; the idea of the President piloting a jet like Luke Skywalker; and the ease with which all the alien craft were brought down around the world when it took the entire might of the USA air force to destroy the one above Area 51 (even without the force shield). Still despite all this it was great fun and I really enjoyed it!"

It's meant to be good fun, watching Our Heroes struggle valiantly against The Evil Alien Hordes. This is brain candy, not brain food. Accept it as such and enjoy it. If you're looking for Proust in film form, you're doomed to disappointment. If you're not, then you should be able to enjoy the White House being blown up, a jarhead fighter jock gloating as he gets to drive something really cool, and yes, even the cheesy reference to 2001: A Space Odyessey"" and the concept of a Powerbook being able to bring down an alien computer network should not dampen your enjoyment.

Independence day had a great story and the visuals were one of the best I have seen, but it wasn't original enough.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays his character well, but he just doesn't put enough effort into really owning the character.

An ensemble of plucky heroes,most notably a computer technician and chess enthusiast(Jeff Goldblum),a tough and streetwise Marine pilot(Will Smith),his stripper girlfriend(the luscious Viveca A. Fox)with her son and dog in tow,a crazed vet working as a crop-duster(Randy Quaid,stealing EVERY scene he's in)and,of course,the President(Bill Pullman,butched and brooding,as contrasted to his whacked-out turn in the previous ""Mr.Wrong"")who has the task of being both a father and inspirational leader at this time.<br/><br/>The plot points are firmly in place,the lines are spit out like professional writers made them(as if!),and there's expositions aplenty. Throw in a tie-in to Area 51 paranoia and some stock side characters(a fried scientist played by Brent Spiner,the put-upon kids of Quaid's character,a tightly-wound General played by Robert Loggia,the President's cute-as-a-button daughter and his doomed first lady, played by an underused MAry McDonnell,Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's character's kvetching dad,etc.)and you've got an instantly accessible hit. And yet,despite the sense of eye-rolling predictability about this film,it still is a fun ride! The action moves at such a fluid pace that it doesn't allow you the viewer to dwell too deeply on the light characters or the overly jingoistic sentiment.<br/><br/>People who saw this on the big screen probably got the added bonus of being able to experience the audio intensity of the film's sound editing that you probably won't get from seeing it on video or TV. DVD might give you SOME of that effect,but unless you have a home theater system with surround sound,I kinda doubt it."

I don't like films that clearly feel I, the audience member, have the mentality of a 3-year-old chimp.<br/><br/>
Over the last couple of years, we've had a slew of superior blockbuster FX films that are genuinely intelligent, well-written, well acted and imaginative. Lord of the Rings, for instance, or Spider-man. Heck, even the new Star Wars films are ambitious and try to give us something we haven't seen before. In that light, we can look back on ""ID4"" and laugh. And laugh, and laugh...<br/><br/>You can boil the movie's problems down to the fact that these are the DUMBEST ALIENS EVER. Suspension of disbelief I can do, but I can't accept aliens that are smart enough to build interstellar spaceships and yet allow the heroes to PARK A THERMONUCLEAR MISSLE FIVE FEET FROM THEIR COMMAND CENTER. Among many, many other things. Between these guys and the ones in ""Signs"" who can't open a pantry door, maybe we ought to get together some money for an alien anti-defamation league. But then, in typical jingoist, propagandic fashion, we're not supposed to think about the aliens' actions, we're just supposed to accept them as evil cannon fodder whose destruction we can cheer. (In a sense, ""Starship Troopers"" was parodizing this movie...the aliens are SLIMY and EVIL, so the heroes feel justified in mindlessly wiping them out, without pausing to consider that the ""human version"" of events doesn't really make any sense...)<br/><br/>Seriously, though, for all the people who defend this movie and other idiocies just like it, where would you draw the line? Where would you start to get offended at just how gullible the filmmakers are assuming you are? Doesn't it bug you that the screenwriters expect you to buy all kinds of unlikely, lazy plotting? Don't you get annoyed by how stupid and irrational they have to make the aliens for the human ""heroes"" to triumph over them? Isn't it depressing to think how unlikely it is that a REAL alien menace probably would loudly announce its presence, use our own easily-accessible communications systems to reveal vital information, and then wait politely while the cities were evacuated? That they'd probably smear us in no time flat?<br/><br/>Well, whatever. But I do think this movie is worth seeing in light of recent world events. Like the makers of ID4, our leaders want us to believe that the enemy is a faceless horde that acts without reason, and is so alien and evil that suspicious events can be rationalized away in the ""official"" version of events. Truly, this film is a model for how all governments would like their citizens to think of their enemies. Don't bother assigning thought to their actions! Just kill, kill, kill!"

"dust-7","Null","1","2","18 November 2002"," Good overproduced cliched-ridden film
","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>S.E.T.I gets word. Why? Who knows. The Pentagon has its own surveillance and that's the next scene. Bigger than a bread basket. Is it a meteor? Well, good golly Bob (Robert Loggia), it a quarter the size of the moon they just told you, and it looks like a giant razor stand on the infrared. And that sort of sets the tone.<br/><br/>It's a comedy, of committee planning, in the film, and of the film. But the overproduced special effects, which still look good, the camera work, and so on, make it a fun film to watch. Just turn off the sound and captions. Amazingly, you'll be able to follow the 'plot' step for step.<br/><br/>As for those who have the I-hate-America-first attitude, when I see similar complaints about James Bond or Jackie Chan or whoever else 'saving-the-world-again', then maybe such consistency would barely help their laments. It's a film about impossibly odd American resourcefulness, coupled with the bravery of fighter pilots in Russia, Israeli and Arab working together, Japanese and so on. But only Goldblum stumbled on the key.<br/><br/>And it's a ridiculous solution. First he discovers the countdown. But by the time the count is down, it's pretty obvious the aliens mean to do damage. So it becomes a device merely to get him on Air Force One. Then Dad breaks down with his Area 51 rant, only to have it confirmed by the bad guy insider and all around 'weasel'. So off to the only working command and control center in the whole wide world, taking AF1 and its capabilities as well, that the aliens can't track, even with the traffic, of all sorts, going in and out, and Goldblum has another epiphany. You can't shoot through the force fields of the aliens. So get them to drop shields by - what - flying up there with a 40 year old spaceship and uploading a computer virus to their operating system. Are they using Windows XXX? I mean. Is this rewriting the HD boot sector? What? It's actually the major plot point. And it makes no sense. Did Bill Gates really cut a deal with space aliens before anyone ever knew they existed - well . . that might seem superficially plausible. And I guess that version of Windows doesn't check for outdated software in order to automatically upgrade. A 40 year old space ship? It would be like trying to fool Saddam by sneaking in and trying to land with an F4 Phantom, or something. People would notice.<br/><br/>So, anyway. Forget everything you knew in the previous scene, basically. That's how it works. It's not just a bunch of comfortably cliched characters and plot 'twists' drawn almost from other films, as some have suggested here, but almost isolated cliched scenes without too much regard to what came before or after in the film, overall. So the monster goes beserk. Great. Fine. If this was a government lab in the arctic. But we just saw this is Area 51 and the last US military installation in operation. There's lot of guards, and they would be inside the operatory, watching through the window, and so on, especially if they thought the space man was alive. But then the Pres wouldn't get his telepathic vid-flick, though to what purpose I can't imagine. They already established that the space aliens intended to wipe out all of humanity in three days or less. What, that wasn't enough motivation? Oh, yeah, now we find out they're like a bunch of locusts. Well, now that we know that. I suppose the point there is that it's the belated answer to 'Mommy, why is this happening?' And stripper Mom could reply, 'well, there's this Hollywood system, you see . . ' But I guess that wouldn't be a very satisfactory reply.<br/><br/>In short, it's a watchable film, without the dialog and if you don't try to read lips. Watch for Harry Connick Jr. to embarrass himself in most scenes. You can turn on the sound for that. Will Smith doesn't do badly, but is saddled with more than a few cliches of his own. Goldblum is annoying and obviously uncomfortable, as some have noted. He's most insecure in the spaceship. So that's another bit of dialog to take in. And what's up with the flight suits? That's not a Tomcat. It's a spaceship with a force field around it. But, enough of that. It's a good movie. It's funny. Good fx. Don't expect The Godfather. But it's better than Godzilla."

","A friend of mine said that Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich weren't trying to make a demographic movie, but were honestly trying to make the type of movie that would entertain them, a la Spielberg.  That may be true (in fact, I'm inclined to believe it is), but you also need talent, and they fall short there.  The first half hour of the movie has problems which re-occur throughout(like Randy Quaid; never is he more annoying or condescending than when he's playing crazy types), but grabs us at least, and I can't deny the visceral effectiveness of watching the White House being blown up.  But then the story becomes cliche city.  The only actors who survive are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, because they at least are entertaining.  Some do solid work (Harry Connick Jr., Robert Loggia), some are wasted (Mary McDonnell, Bill Pullman), and some are awful (Quaid, James Rebhorn), and the movie is similarly patchwork.

","Several good reviews (""John"" and anonymous on the Spanish conquest of the Americas), but all generally say the same thing:  Great effects, so-so to lousy film.  The characters here were poorly drawn, the American flag-waving a little excessive, Bill Pullman gives one of the WORST ""rally 'round the flag"" speeches ever (he should see Kenneth Branagh's St. Crispin's passage in ""Henry V""), and a severe drop-off in the second half of the film.  This could have been a great one...I was also struck by how incongruous a couple Pullman and Mary McDonnell were.  And, I was amused by the thought that if all exotic dancers were as attractive AND resourceful as Viveca Fox, the question of who will be the nation's first female presidential candidate is resolved.  Oh, well...what happened to the sense of discovery or wonder that infused the early SciFi films of the 50s and 60s, where real questions about progress and humanity were raised?

"Motoko","3","1","2","28 January 1999"," The greatest science fiction film ever. Not.
","Where shall I start? Do I begin the America bashing now or after I've ridiculed this films shallow and laughable effort at entertainment. Probably best to get it out of the way now I guess.<br/><br/>Now if there are any Americans out there reading this then I'm sorry. I really am. I don't want to have to do this. I'm not xenophobic. I don't have any political complexes. I'm not in the habit of insulting the people that come from the land across the Atlantic. But please, you have to accept that this is tripe. Of the highest possible order. It's success merely proves that the best way to get an American to get behind something is to appeal to that little bit inside them that loves their country. If a film is full of praise for the USA and even vaguely shows it's national heritage being ridiculed (a shot of a collapsed Statue of Liberty usually does the trick) then any self-respecting yank will root for it. And that's it. This film calls to the most xenophobic part of any American and wrenches it to the forefront. As a Brit the most obvious, and insulting, element of this to me is when those two officers from the RAF receive the American plan of action. In a tone of hero worship and admiration they cry ""It's the Americans!"" Well hallelujah. At last we're saved. My ass. I'll bet those two were called Reginald and Jerry and usually partook in cucumber sandwiches and high tea at their house in the country with a butler and 20 servants. When they're not playing cricket that is.<br/><br/>And then there is the film itself. Utter tosh. I wouldn't feel so cheated if it was just uniformally bad. At least then I could watch it in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. Instead I thought the first act, before the initial attack, was quite good. The slow drawn out tension and what-the-hell-is-it paranoia were nicely handled. There was a suitable sense of invincibility about the aliens that suited the film. But then it collapsed. Emmerich and Devlin spent so long on the setup that they had to race through the pay-off. Glaring implausibilities, which I can usually overlook in a good film, just made it worse. For example: when Smith's girlfriend makes it out from the rubble LA is destroyed, laid to waste, ruined, wrecked, crushed. All except four palm trees. Priceless.<br/><br/>Then there is the supposition that crop dusters, cargo pilots and others, including the Pres' himself, can learn enough complex air warfare tactics to hold off a group of advanced alien fighters long enough for the mother-ship to be destroyed. Presuming of course that Goldblum can connect his laptop to the central computer when you can barely get an Apple to talk to a PC. Balderdash. Trashy characters. Bad script. Insensitive stereo-types. Shall I go on?<br/><br/>The end result is a film I'm ashamed to have on my video-shelf (it was a birthday present so I can't really give it away). Starship Troopers, an even trashier sci-fi flick, walks all over it because of it's obvious tongue-in-cheek nature. Serious films like Bladerunner and Star Wars grind it to dust. I believe one commenter referred to it as the best science fiction film for fifty years. I would recommend he has a psychiatric session. For me there's a little too much apple pie for my stomach to take."

I can't add much to the other negative comments that have already been written about this film except to point out another plot problem: beings who were thousands of years more advanced than we are probably would've dealt successfully with computer viruses before, not to mention have had components more advanced than/incompatible with ours...

Secondly, this movie has every tired cliche ever found in any action movie: little cute kids, guy that sacrifices himself, best friend that dies, romances that rekindle, creepy CIA agent.

For example: since when can you knock out a huge spacecraft with a computer virus written on a totally different computer. 90% of Earth's computers aren't even compatible, the probability of an Earth program running on an alien computer is ZERO. Secondly, all the alien spacecraft are apparently destroyed because someone flies into their main weapon beam at EXACTLY the right time. <br/><br/>I could go on like this, but the basic idea is that it's TOTALLY LUDICROUS that a bunch of nit-wits use a couple of fighter jets and one UFO to take out a vast army of highly superior aliens. <br/><br/>Finally, to top it all off, it's again the Americans and only the Americans that save the entire earth.

","Right around the time this movie came out, I became aware of something that turned me off to movies in general. The problem was not, and is not, that Hollywood thinks we're all stupid. The problem is that parents are giving their very young kids way too much cash on the weekends to get out of their hair for the afternoon. They've created a powerful demographic segment, in the form of their pre-teen offspring who are downtown stuffing twenty-dollar bills into theater cash boxes.<br/><br/>And deciding what next year's movies are going to look like.<br/><br/>Well, the culmination of this bizarre experiment has to be ID4. The most telling review you could really gather about this, is that everyone who feels the need to ""defend"" the film from the obvious criticism, uses the same two lines. One, movies are supposed to be entertaining and not realistic; two, the special effects were awesome.<br/><br/>I go to the movies to be entertained, instead of being reminded of reality, just as much as the next guy. But a certain amount of ""Coyote and Roadrunner"" physics, just ruins it for folks like me. Sorry. The President in a jet is really pushing the envelope. Yeah, yeah I know he was a Persian Gulf vet and they had an explanation for all this. But why was it necessary? Couldn't you make an even better movie, having the Prez on the ground, biting his fingernails with guilt over sending men half his age to certain death? That's made some good movies; it just takes some effort on the part of the writers, directors and actors. Maybe they figured the ""Living Legend Captain Kirk"" avenue was just easier here. Unfortunately, that leaves them pontificating for two hours about how we're all in the same boat, and we'd better kick alien ass together; and then having one guy do everything. Essentially, they seriously contradicted themselves.<br/><br/>But yeah, I know nine-year-olds don't care about that, and my money isn't worth as much as theirs.<br/><br/>All this may seem like nit-picking, but it interferes with the focal point of the movie. This is a movie built to make you feel good after the closing credits have started to roll, and maybe more than a bit patriotic. When inside your head, you're going back over all the questionable plot points and wondering just what kind of a pig-in-a-poke they just sold you, one interferes too much with the other. So the purpose of the movie is, in itself, a bit of a contradiction. If you want to get in a patriotic mood on the 4th of July, my advice is to read up on the story how our nation was built.

So, about 6 months past and one night in college halls I rented it with my flatmates and watched it and it was just so funny I couldn't believe it!

If I had gone with my bro to see the movie that night I expect I would have entered expecting a ""War of the worlds"" type movie and would have been disapointed like them- but I rented it instead and enjoyed it for the pile of tosh it is.<br/><br/>Once again, like many other movies in this genre made in America it is unintentionally funny. The best bit that made me laugh out loud was when the fire went down the tunnel and the dog jumped and avoided it, by about half a second. Of course, had this been a European film (imagine Tony Blair giving the rousing speach to the pilots!) the dog would have been incinerated, or would have stupidly have run the wrong way and been incinerated.<br/><br/>
""Mars Attacks"" by Tim Burton takes the rise out of this kind of convinced Americana, and actually does the invasion scenes much better and realistically. Perhaps then you should rent them both and decide for yourself which is better.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Independence Day was one of few movies that very nearly made me leave the theater before it was over. It was full of plot oversights, stupid ideas but the worst part was the ending. The last 30 minutes of Independence Day has to qualify as one of the all time stupidest endings in a movie. I'm sorry I ever saw this sad piece of junk."

","Independence Day, or ID4, is a great example of 'the-summer- blockbuster-we-are-required-to-see-every-year-and-comes-up-at-every-conversation' genre. In 1993 it was Cliffhanger and The Fugitive. In '94 it was Speed. Crimson Tide in '95, ConAir in '97, Enemy of the State and Armageddon in '98, and Star Wars and Deep Blue Sea in '99. For 1996 ID4 shared the honors with The Rock. Every year. No more than two, no less than one. Somehow audiences never get sick of these often brainless, mega-budget, never believable for a second blockbusters.<br/><br/>	Of the eleven since 1993, Independence Day ranks with the better ones. The fx and sound editing is excellent, breaking new ground, and the film manages to be so immensely entertaining that it doesn't allow audiences to think about how thin it actually is. The characters are all one (and sometimes two) dimensional, and the plot line is so implausible that you find yourself laughing. At times it looks like it doesn't even rank with those ten other mega hits, but instead with the star-studded disaster epics of the '70's.<br/><br/>	But we don't tune in for those times, instead we watch for the edge of your seat action sequences, or plentiful one-liners. Randy Quaid is hilarious in one of the film's supporting roles, and Will Smith and Bill Pullman are likeable in the leads.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

From that day on I didn't loose a Will Smith film or single. It was just like ""love at first sight"". And the story? What can I say? Just that it kept me 2 hours on the cinema seat without pop-corn to not loose any single phrase because of the crunching.

","Boys, from the looks of these here comments, you'd think that they were talking about 'Heavon's Gate' or 'Ishtar'...Folks, ID4 is actually a pretty damned good movie for what it is-War of the Worlds mixed with 'Flying Saucers Attack'. It is a clichéd 'Airport'/'Poseidon Adventure' sort of disaster film, with all the stereotypical two-dimensional characters, multi-racial/cultural settings, etc. <br/><br/>You see their lives, then Boom! The Squids attack. Nothing more or less. Now I agree-having the Fresh Prince and the guy from the Fly up there in a saucer nuking the Mother Ship isn't exactly outta George Lucas, but it IS pretty damned entertaining jest the same. Personally, most folks I knew who went to see this(only the biggest hit of '96 by far-over 300M at the US box office...)knew all this going in, and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>ID4 is NOT a Documentary, yeah we know some race of squids smart enough to make 500 mile wide mother ships and fly across interstellar space aren't about to be Mac compatible, Or suceptible to any sort of computer virus we cook up. Fine! But then, these Squids don't exactly EXIST either folks....<br/><br/>Personally I look upon that little computer virus twist as being the same as whatever contraption MaGuyver had conjured outta some toothpaste and popsicle sticks, or the Professor's latest gizmo on Gilligan's Island-impossible, but what the hell? It's Fiction, after all. If it works for the contrivances of the film, that is all is needed. Nothing more.<br/><br/>And it worked here, quite well. I enjoyed the ending, seeing the Head Squid look Death in the eyes as the ticker counted down right before the bomb(s) went off in the Mother Ship, I enjoyed both Smith and Goldblum together in their scenes, heck even liked Randy Quaid and Bill Pullman. Judd Hirsch chews the scenery, while many of the others there ARE scenery, it is true.<br/><br/>But never mind-it works for me, and who can forget the scenes of all those ships coming in over New York, DC or LA? Not me. Like it or not, those images, and the ones where the Squids really let loose, are going to stay round in film culture for quite some time to come yet.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy the movie? Hell yeah! Was it as good as Star Wars? No! Better than most of the Star Trek films? Yup! Would I watch it again or go see a sequel? Yeah I would.<br/><br/>Gazzo 2's rating: *** outta ****-good stuff! Works!"

","I was 14 when I first saw this movie and I liked it very much. Still I don´t think it´s a bad film. I have always liked science fiction and war movies, and this was both. The special effects were awesome, especially the huge spaceships above the cities. But why did I give ID4 only 6 points? The characters were quite shallow, that´s the biggest problem. And I can´t help but I find the american patriotism somewhat comical in the movie. Last time, for example, when I watched it, I ended up laughing my head off during the president´s speech. It was fun, yes, but I don´t think it was meant to be that way. But, if you like sf-movies with nice special effects, this movie is absolutely worth watching."

I thought more of the aliens would be nice, maybe they could've had some aliens land to survey the planet closely. Why the aliens didn't just nuke the planet as soon as they arrived, I don't know.

"Danimal-7","5","1","2","8 September 1999"," Almost as bad as reported
","(Some spoilers).<br/><br/>INDEPENDENCE DAY is the story of an attack on the planet Earth by the dumbest aliens in the universe.  In this movie, a heroic president (Bill Pullman), a crackerjack fighter pilot (Will Smith), and a computer programmer (Jeff Goldblum), with some help, manage to defeat the combined efforts of an entire species that has been scoping Earth out for decades in. . . two or three days.<br/><br/>Words cannot describe how stupid these aliens are.  We'll leave aside the unlikelihood that a species thousands of years ahead of us technologically still hasn't advanced culturally beyond the rob-and-pillage society of the 13th-century Mongols.  It seems unlikely, but you have to admit that we humans have kept on being pretty brutal to each other despite our advancing technology.  But why would such aliens do something like blast Earth's cities, building by building, to get rid of us?  That's something like trying to exterminate ants by stomping on them one by one.  If the aliens wanted to get rid of us, they'd just bioengineer a microbe specifically bred to eliminate only humans, or whatever species they wanted to eliminate. Humans are only a hundred years at most away from being able to do this; to highly advanced aliens it would be routine, especially when they've putatively been spying on us and experimenting on us for decades.  They expose their flying saucers to attack from Earth's combined air forces, for no visible reason.  It's enough to make you wonder how these aliens ever lasted this long in the planet-conquering business.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there's Goldblum using a computer virus to defeat the aliens, which makes about as much sense as the idea of using ENIAC to sabotage a Cray.  No, make that less sense.  And there's an alien that keels over at one punch from Will Smith but then kills half a dozen scalpel-armed lab technicians a few scenes later.  This goes beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief; it's just plain lazy writing.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum's acting is wooden and unappealing, and the characters are extremely one-dimensional.  I know some will say to forget about these matters and just be entertained, but that's not the point; I *need* to see some interesting people to be entertained, and the feeling of having my intelligence insulted makes for a less entertaining experience.  By the same token, thoughtful scripts and fleshed out characters aren't just more prestigious and more ""arty""; they're a lot more entertaining, too!<br/><br/>Anyway, there are some good points to INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Aside from Goldblum, the acting is mostly pretty good.  Will Smith is passably cocky and arrogant, and Bill Pullman has some charisma as the president.  Judd Hirsch is so good that he manages to give some life to his cliche character. There are some humorous one-liners such as ""Welcome to Earth!"" and ""Nobody's perfect.""<br/><br/>The special effects truly are breathtaking at times, as when the shadow of the alien ship creeps over whole cities at a time.  I truly did feel as the Carib Indians must have felt when Columbus landed on Hispaniola and confronted them with something totally outside the range of their experience.  Off the big screen, this effect would be lost, so I don't recommend renting this movie on video tape.<br/><br/>A man like Whitmore could never be president of the United States, but I can see what Emmerich was trying for; this is the guy a lot of Americans wish they had as president, instead of the snake-oil salesmen we usually get. And while it's totally unrealistic, even given his pilot's experience, that Whitmore would fly in combat, it sure would be nice to have a president who knew that the country would survive just fine even if he died.  (America has had five presidents die in office; the country survived each time none the worse for wear).<br/><br/>Oddly I feel compelled to defend this stupid movie from its detractors in at least one respect; its American patriotism.  Patriotism, American or otherwise, is not in and of itself a bad thing to have in a movie. CASABLANCA is loaded with French patriotism (they play La Marseillaise at least twice); THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING is chock full of British patriotism; the Oscar-winning MRS. MINIVER is also full of British patriotism;  EXODUS is to a great degree an exercise in Israeli patriotism; and the much-hailed ALEKSANDR NEVSKI is a celebration of Russian patriotism.  Americans should be allowed their own patriotic movies (though preferably higher quality than this one).  Pullman has repeatedly been excoriated for suggesting that July 4 would become an international holiday, completely missing the point that such a holiday would be celebrating not American independence, but rather the combined efforts of *all* the world's countries to fight off the alien scourge, an event that certainly would deserve international commemoration and which happened to occur on July 4.<br/><br/>Lazy, dumb, overblown and insulting, INDEPENDENCE DAY is not worth renting. But it is not as worthless as some would have you believe, and if by some chance it returns to the dollar theater, you could do worse than see a little humor and some good special effects on the wide screen, if you're in a tolerant mood.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of ****."

","...that is the first word that comes to mind when ID4 is mentioned.  And this even works on several levels.<br/><br/>(1) i am software engineer (and good one at that), and i find the idea of taking down the entire alien defensive matrix by uploading some joe-6-pack virus to be beyond, well, stupid.  And with a Mac, no less!  Most porn sites on the internet have more security than the aliens.  Maybe someone uploaded a plot-retardant virus into the script during filming.<br/><br/>(2) Actually, i would have found the virus bit to be lighthearted, ironic, or funny IF the rest of the movie was in the least say, appealing, or personable.  But that was clearly too much to ask.  The conversations were predictable, cliche, and forced.  The story tried to pack in romance, religion, family values, patriotism, conspiracy, and the kitchen sink and did a horrible job on every aspect.<br/><br/>(3) There were some redeeming qualities to this movie.  The suspense at the beginning was appreciated.  However, the resolution (as in the rest of the movie) was rather preditable and boring.  and uh... well that's about it.<br/><br/>This movie is once again another mindless plug-and-chug of notable actors and special effects into the Hollywood summer-movie formula (hey, at least<br/><br/>Armageddon was kinda entertaining).  lucrative it may be, but automatically make a decent movie it does not."
"Rob Paul","Null","1","2","9 July 1999"," Over-rated by a long shot
","How on earth did this film manage to gross over $300 million dollars? From my point of view, it really did seem like a patriotic flag-waving exercise; containing one of the most cringe-worthy speeches ever made. Will Smith didn't help either, but then he is an acquired taste and appeals to a lot of young kids.<br/><br/>Bad acting in films like this can sometimes be forgiven, but on this occasion we don't really have anything worth cheering for. The script, while not a disaster, doesn't even manage to inject any originality, only adding one cliche after another. But since this is a movie all about visual splendour, maybe I'm being too hard on it? Well, not really since the CGI effects were only average. However, none of this compares to one of the truly dumbest plot devices ever committed to celluloid - yes, that old virus transmission via the apple mac. Hah, if I were Bill Gates I'd be fuming!<br/><br/>This type of movie can be done well, but like the director's previous effort (Stargate), this film sacrifices everything in favour of spectacle, but unfortunately ID4 isn't in the least bit spectacular. Avoid this alien catastrophe, because this ain't even a B-movie, it's more like a D-movie.<br/><br/>3/10."

If you have not seen Independence Day yet, then now is the best time to do so If you are watching this movie to find the meaning of life, you will not find it in this movie. To watch ID4 you have to suspend belief because there are parts to this movie that just don't make sense. For example it is far fetched that a human computer could upload a debilitating virus to the mother ship when in 1996 you could barely have Macs and PCs communicate. Even when the movie is 14 years old, the effects still are very impressive.

The effects are huge in that movie and to feel them right,the way they were originally tailored for you to feel, you need to see it in cinemas but since now it's not feasible to do so, you can still watch it and keep in mind this single info in order not to misjudge the movie.<br/><br/>I remember the scene when the alien they found and grouped around to study awakened all of a sudden and hit the glass. At that moment, every one in the audience even those who were sitting in the balcony, reflexively moved back to their chairs as if the alien is coming towards them with that ""huh"" sound which was heard from all at once. I am not exaggerating that really happened and we are not talking 3D here. That's how good Roland Emmerich! Another scene was that when the lady is driving the car with her son and dog so she manages to escape the fire in the tunnel going into some hole in the wall and then for few minutes she is trying to save her baby and we were all sitting nervous so when she finally does, we were all like ""thank God"" and relieved but that wasn't all because the director made us is a few seconds care for saving the dog as well so back to nervousness until the dog was also saved.

"dairylanddon","7","1","3","9 October 2008"," 3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about... Independence Day
","ONE GOOD THING: The sheer ""popcorn movie"" spectacle of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day makes it highly watchable. The film is one of the first of its era that embraces modern special effects to ""remake"" old movies, which couldn't be made better at the time. Although similar (or derivative) of it's predecessors, it fills the screen with an ensemble cast and delivers disaster scenes you couldn't walk away from if you tried (dog out-running an explosion excluded).<br/><br/>ANOTHER GOOD THING: The sheer panic/confusion/indifference felt by the different characters is an interesting bit of character study. Some people welcome the aliens with open arms, while others pack the freeways to escape major cities, and still others are sitting at strip clubs regardless of what's going on.<br/><br/>EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: The famous destruction scenes of the national and international monuments culminating in the explosion of the White House are quite possibly the finest of their kind.<br/><br/>ONE BAD THING: The wooden performances elicited by Emmerich (10,000 BC) are all quickly overshadowed by the inclusion of the Randy Quaid character. Why in the world is ""Uncle Eddie"" (National Lampoon's Vacation films) in this movie fighting aliens? He is heavy handed in his delivery and should of had his character cut out during initial re-writes. Without Quaid (and Harvey Fierstein's over-the-top comic relief supplied for the Jeff Goldblum character) this movie immediately improves its rating by 2 stars.<br/><br/>OVERALL GRADE: C+<br/><br/>OTHER MOVIES WITH SPECTACULAR DESTRUCTION SEQUENCES: The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Twister (1996), Poseidon (2006), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), The Towering Inferno (1974), Cloverfield (2008)."
"dsmpsm","5","1","3","28 May 2008"," All That's Wrong With Sci-Fi - But Still Watchable
","Full disclosure: I get sucked into this movie whenever it's on screen. It is proof-positive, much like Paris Hilton, that even the most execrable thing can be made to look good if it's got enough money thrown its way. That said, I thank God this type of schlocky, pseudo-scientific ""sci-fi"" movie seems to have died out. So, what's wrong with it? Here are the highlights (THESE CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS): Lasers cannot be weaponized -- especially into noise-making kinetic type weapons.<br/><br/>There is no need to try and weaponize a laser. A lot more damage comes from good old-fashioned kinetic and chemical weapons (bullets and missiles). A truly advanced race would just rail gun us into oblivion from well above the Earth's atmosphere.<br/><br/>Which brings up this point: why come down to the surface to attack? I mean, really? How much fuel is it worth to get a close up of the White House, when a well-placed (and free) asteroid can do much more damage? Remember, these are beings that can travel between stars. Moving a big rock, even a galactic-sized rock, should be a trivial matter for them.<br/><br/>And, of course, the ""comeback."" Any race that kicked our collective arses so hard in the initial encounter would not be taken down by the remaining scraps of the world's militaries. Even with their ""shields"" disabled.<br/><br/>All that said, if you're in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon, and this tripe is on screen, you'll probably get sucked in and you'll like it. Kudos to Emmerich for creating such consumable packaging. If you want a great alien invasion story, read Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Footfall. THAT'S a book that is crying for movie treatment. If you want to watch good sci-fi on TV, catch reruns of Firefly, or watch Battlestar Galactica."

They aliens come, we try to greet them, they blow us up, we fight but our weapons are no match for theirs, we try to nuke them and still no dice, we are at a dismal moment. At the end of ""War of the Worlds"" *SPOILER*, a virus (or many along with bacteria) kills the aliens, as they have no immunity to our parasites. This movie doesn't rip that off directly, but instead, they parallel it with a ""computer virus"" instead of a biological virus. I'm sorry, this was a poor attempt at something ""original"" by stealing from another great. At least ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) called it that and remade a great.<br/><br/>This movie is action packed, with great CG (for 1996 standards) and some good flying scenes. Where it lacks is originality and the characters. Wil SMith is believable, but that is because he is playing his typical Wil smith roles. THe rest of the characters choke. Randy Quaid's character is a total joke, along with the character's kids. The worst still, is Jeff Goldblum's father. I get tired of him saying how much a schmuck he is and how much a schmuck is son is and how much a schmuck everyone is. I know his character is Jewish, but man, they play out the stereotypes at every angle. If I were Jewish, I would be upset with the gross stereotype the convey. Not all Jews call everyone a Schmuck 50 times over.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something to watch with action and you don't want to think at all, this is the movie. If you want something a little more intelligent, do yourself a favor and watch something by a director that is not Roland Emmerich."

It may be far from a gritty and realistic movie but with so many elements blended into it such as action, air combat, explosions, a huge star cast, a feel good story and totally awesome special effects, it has to be one of the best movie efforts ever made. Despite so much content, the viewer never gets saturated with too much and everything has a major part to play. The only bad thing is that the director got carried away by the success of this movie and went and made a crapfest called the day after tomorrow."

","INDEPENDENCE DAY ****1/2 Scripters Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, for the little contribution required of them, go back to H.G. Wells and 'War of the Worlds' for inspiration in this awesome thrill ride of special effects and all-out action sequences. When massive alien vessels start enclosing the earth in what looks to be an extermination process, the take-charge United States President (Bill Pullman) sends out army fleets to combat the space ships. Jeff Goldblum is a computer technology expert who ultimately saves the day when earth's weapons can't seem to penetrate through the aliens' shields; Will Smith is a fighter pilot who also becomes a hero of the day. The momentum slows down when the action/combat department takes a break and all we experience are mediocre character-based subplots. But hey, it did achieve as a terrific summer blockbuster, and I'm not complaining."

"TheNorthernMonkee","7","1","3","4 August 2005"," America saves the world AGAIN, but at least people suffer first
","SPOILERS The biggest, and most annoying thing about Hollywood is the way that so many of it's films feature humanity saved by America. Self obsessed, and often stereotypical, these films can range from entertaining disaster movies to mindless drivel. Luckily for 1996's 'Independence Day' it is closer to the first classification. Explosive and action packed, it is also entertaining at points and well worth someone's evening.<br/><br/>After alien ships appear in the sky, humanity is divided in their opinions. When scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers a timer counting down to an event however, he fears the worse and rushes to the White House. Showing his ex wife (Margaret Colin) and her boss President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) his evidence, Levinson shows them the truth of an impending attack. Unfortunately for humanity though, the aliens are already prepared.<br/><br/>Violent and explosive, 'Independence Day' will always be remembered for the moment the White House is blown up. Impressive effects for the time, that scene is just one of many occasions throughout the film when graphics take over from the human element. For this sort of film, this can only be a good thing. Whilst actors like Goldblum, Pullman and personal favourite Judd Hirsch, all pull their weight during the film, people don't watch for them, they watch for the special effects and the occasional Will Smith quip (of which there are many).<br/><br/>People also watch to see humanity come out on top. It's a strange state of affairs that irrelevant of what fate befalls the world, humanity, and especially America, always manages to survive and thrive. We loose some characters along the way, but for the most part we prove to the universe that we are here to stay. Pessimists amongst us dream of the day when a decent disaster movie exists where humanity doesn't actually thrive (weak films like 'Deep Impact' don't really live up to expectation) and we are on the verge of annihilation. A depressing thought yes, but all too often in these films, there is no way humanity would, or should, survive the situation in hand. Still, that's the Hollywood fantasy for you.<br/><br/>If you love watching monuments get blown up from around the world, then you are never going to run short of options. Over the years practically every single monument has been destroyed. Few films manage this with such panache however as 'Independence Day'. Well acted, but who really cares, and constantly entertaining, it is a violent, explosive movie with some stunning special effects. It is a film well worth watching, although just for once, it'd be nice to see humanity loose."

","I just saw this film for the 5th and cried all over again. I love this movie. It appeals to the child in me. I saw 'Where Eagles Dare' when it first came out and I was 7. Seeing ID4 reminded what's it's like to be 7 watching a movie. It's so well paced that you can suspend disbelief easily as the film races along. It's also a supremely artful movie with references to Star Wars, Close Encounters ( It's a wonderful counter to Spielberg's sentimental and tacky rubbish ), Alien AND Aliens, 2001, Airplane, The Right Stuff. And these were just the one's I spotted. Films are for kids. Remind yourself of the kid in yourself and luxuriate in this wonderful film.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","1","3","7 April 2005"," One hell of a high-octane action-fest!
","TNT packed entertainment, pure and simple. That is what this movie is. Nothing more nothing less. It was obviously made to show off fancy special effects (which won an Oscar) and give film-goers a fun time at the theaters when it was released in the Summer of 1996. And that's exactly what it did, and still does. The ""wall of fire sequence"" was absolutely stunning and frightening when I saw it in the theater and it still manages to impress.<br/><br/>The film is, of course, overly patriotic as the almighty USA saves the day, but seriously what did you expect? Deep thought-out political commentary on how the nations of the world deal with a crisis that could spell doom for the world? If so, that is probably why you were let down. From the very first ads to theatrical release the hype about this movie was kick-ass special effects and explosive action along with a feel good story. That is precisely what this film delivered which is why I don't understand the bashing of it. It was never meant to serious. Also seeing that it grossed over $300 million in the USA and over $500 million abroad making it one of the most successful films of all time, the bashers should just admit it: people like this stuff. It is simple and feel-good, but definitely not trash.<br/><br/>Granted that I can see people finding roaring explosive mayhem boring and not worth their time, so... DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! It was never made to look like anything else. Enjoy. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence and intense action"

","A suitably stiff performance from Bill 'Cardboard' Pullman, with his stapled on, excrement-eating smirk proves almost as irritating as Margaret Colin's Brooklyn accent (""Doivid, Doivid""), but fortunately help is at hand with excellent showings from Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and the aliens who give far more realistic performances than Pullman. Some of the special effects are excellent, others (such as the cartoon style explosions) are atrocious, but it's a lot of fun from start to finish at any rate. Judd Hirsch is good as Goldblum's father, whilst Mary McDonnell's cheesy overacting wouldn't look out of place in one of  DW Griffith's epics; she almost (but only almost) makes Pullman look good - maybe that's why some ""schliemiel"" dreamed up the idea of putting them together in the film."

Independence Day was truly a great movie for its time.  The acting was great - a great mix of stars - playing on an old theme of invading aliens.  I sat in a theater at Universal Studios in California when I first watched it, and came out awe struck. Hmmm, did I go there looking for flaws in the technology, etc.  No.  I went there for great sci fi entertainment, and wow did it deliver or what?  Is it a Matrix?   No, but it was worth my price of admission no doubt about it. I've seen it about a dozen times since 1996, and it's entertaining each time."

","Possible Spoilers!!!<br/><br/>ID-4 was, in my estimation, a fantastic movie.  Yes, there were problems, the Marines being everywhere, forgetting about the U.S. Navy and Air Forces. Not to mention that the only aircraft that the U.S. Military seemed to have was the F-14 Tomcats.  Okay, that was a huge hurtle to get around, but the quality of the story telling allowed me to over look that.<br/><br/>I've heard people talk about the imcompatabilty of computer systems.  And that it would be impossible for a computer to interact with others.  Huh? What do you think that the internet is?  Not to mention networking?  Not a real problem as long as there are protocols set up to interact with the two systems.  And David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) had plenty of time (and know-how) to set up the necessary protocols using his MAC and the alien fighter computer system, after all Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) and his staff had several years to diagnose and determine how the ships systems work together.<br/><br/>The plot weaknesses, I can't think of any right now, weren't enough to distract me.  As a matter of fact when I first saw the movie, after I got out, I turned around and bought another ticket.  (And took several friends to see it - and they're still friends... so I'm glad that they also liked it).<br/><br/>It's a good movie and one that I watch at least once a quarter.

"the_gavin","6","1","3","9 January 2004"," Fun, but supremely annoying if you're not American
","If it wasn't for Will Smith, this film would be one of the most lavishly constructed jingoistic pieces of trash to have hit the screens.  Will's on top form in this one, particularly in his early dogfight sequence (one imagines that he was getting in some early practice for Ali...).<br/><br/>The film is obviously aimed primarily at the American market, but if this is how Americans want to see themselves, then the rest of the world has a lot to worry about.  It's spectacularly self-centred at times (e.g. 15 spaceships over the world, at least 4 of which are over American cities!). The few foreign characters are reduced to cartoon caricatures of their nationalities (e.g. the two British pilots (shown in short 'cut-to' sequences) speak with the sort of public school accents that show up in American sitcoms all the time, such as the butler in 'Fresh Prince', & make most British people I know cringe).  At times it appears that the producers picked out nationalities that they assume are top-of-mind (Iraq, Israel, Japan, Russia & Britain feature most prominently) for the American audience (or at least fairly low-brow elements of it) and then sterotyped them.<br/><br/>
I can accept that, in an American film, it's the Americans that save the world. But the impression you get from the film is that no-one else even TRIES to fight back.  Yes, the other countries do join in the fight, but NO-ONE else shows any initiative.  Would it have been disruptive to show the President consulting with the UN, or to show a Chinese or French plane being destroyed while trying to attack the space ship?<br/><br/>Still, it seems silly to complain about national stereotypes in a film that's chock-full of all sorts of stereotypes.  I kept expecting Jeff Goldblum to start talking about chaos theory, and Judd Hirsch even manages to get in an 'Oy Vey'!  None of the writers or actors seem to have had to stretch too far, but Smith & Goldblum make an effective enough team.<br/><br/>That said, I still quite enjoyed the film.  It's not high art, but at least it made me laugh.  Thanks Will..."

","""War of the Worlds"" has a history in America.  Based on an H.G. Wells story, it caused mass hysteria during the depression when first broadcast as an (unannounced) radio play.  The 1953 movie of the same name has long been considered a Science Fiction classic.  ""Independence Day"" is the 1990s, Hollywood version of the same story.  There are no real surprises on this three day journey of technically superior aliens invading and destroying the earth, but the trip is well worth it thanks to a great ensemble cast, terrific special effects, and a quirky script.<br/><br/>Will Smith heads the cast as Marine pilot Captain Steve Hiller, a one-liner kind of hero whose goal is to be an astronaut, but he is challenged as the star of the picture by Jeff Goldblum (playing David Levinson), the MIT techo-geek who first realizes the threat of the alien ships.  In a wonderfully woven (and very convenient) plot, their lives entwine with those of the President and a drunken crop-dusting Russell Casse. Judd Hirsh and Harvey Fierstein also shine in supporting roles.<br/><br/>But perhaps the special effects are really the star as the aliens rampage and thoroughly destroy Washington DC, New York City, and L.A.

"coolmule","7","1","3","4 June 2003"," Excellent first hour let down by Yankee doodle dandy cheesiness in the last act
","******Warning, Spoilers*******<br/><br/>This blend of 50's alien visitation flick, 70's disaster movie and 90's UFO paranoia has received a huge amount of criticism on this site. Undoubtedly some of it is merited, but much of it is unfair. Firstly, for it's first hour Independence Day is excellent. It comes closer than any other film to showing what the reality of massive alien ships suddenly turning up would actually be like (a mixture of mass panic and euphoria) while at the same time plays like a military technothriller, with lots of tense scenes in command centres, submarines and the White House. The shots of the alien craft arriving over New York, Washington and LA are hugely impressive and ominous, while the frequent use of TV news broadcasts lends the whole thing an air of believability (for more of this check out the 10 minute mockumentary on the DVD). Also, a great sense of tension is built up by Jeff Goldblum's character's discovery of the countdown signal.<br/><br/>
The payoff of all of this is the second reason the film is worth a look, namely some of the most impressive visual effects you are ever likely to see. Even seven years on the shots of the White House and Empire State Building being obliterated are astonishing (although undoubtedly helped by the fact that they taker place in darkness). The effects throughout the rest of the film are excellent as well, and use a nice mixture of CGI, models and puppets, rather than being a total CGI fest.<br/><br/>So far, so good, and if the film had continued in this way it could have been a brilliant, dark sci-fi epic. Unfortunately, the last half of the film is crammed full of some of the most jingoistic, cringeworthy, America-saves-the-day dialogue you are ever likely to hear. To be honest, most of it is so bad that it's not even offensive, just hilarious - it's impossible to keep a straight face when Bill Pulman's President gives his 'Our Independence Day' speech. The English public schoolboy RAF pilots are equally good, for all the wrong reasons - ""About bloody time, what do they intend to do?"" - absolutely priceless!! Thoroughly bloody good chaps, all of them!<br/><br/>While it is possible to just laugh at the above examples, some of the other scenes towards the end of the film really do grate. I'm thinking here specifically of the downright patronising shots of arabs and africans celebrating the destruction of the alien ships courtesy of the good ol' US of A. The rest of the last hour is littered with dialogue which may not be particularly offensive, but is just plain cheesy.<br/><br/>As for other criticisms which people have mentioned, well, yes, the plot is full of holes, but so are the plots of films like The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark (how does the Falcon get to Bespin without a hyperdrive? How does Indy survive the journey to the Nazi hideout on the outside of a submarine?). The fact is that it's a tribute to 50's B-movies, and therefore like Star Wars and Indiana Jones it's plot shouldn't be scrutinised too closely. It has a sheen of reality, and that's enough. And as for saying that it started the trend towards big budget special effects at the expense of acting and story, well that's been said since King Kong came out.<br/><br/>As for the rest, the acting is OK, nothing special (although Will Smith does have some pretty funny one liners), with the music serving it's purpose without really being memorable. This film is very much a product of it's time - REM are on the radio and the X-Files is namechecked. This means of the course that the World Trade Centre is still a part of the New York skyline and it's a little disconcerting, post 9/11, seeing famous New York landmarks being obliterated. Still, the film is worth a look - just enjoy the excellent first hour, then pause the film, go and have a few beers and proceed to kill yourself laughing through the cheesy awfulness of the second hour!<br/><br/>Rating - 7/10"

","Let's face it, this film had a few entertaining moments, mostly thanks to the superior talents of Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith, but 90 percent of this film is embarassingly bad. Almost every cliche and overused idea is present here, and unless you're willing to accept that Americans and ONLY Americans are capable of defeating an enemy like this (with a virus that even Windows could resist), then this is the film for you. Absolutely no effort is put forth here to show that any other country can pull its weight. It's America to the rescue. I can understand this, after a certain fashion, this movie is made in America by Americans, but still, it flies in the face of logic. The acting is hackneyed and unentertaining, except for Goldblum and Smith, who are great talents, and the entire genesis of the idea is stolen from the most overused ""invasion"" plots that date back to the beginning of science fiction. No, no, you'll have to do much better than this to entertain me. If you're reading this, it's because you want to read reviews.

This year, I decided to go ahead and rent it, along with Men In Black (another movie featuring Will Smith and extra-terrestrials).  What I found out was that Independence Day is a long, overblown cliche with predictable subplots, emotionless performances, and special effects that would never let me forget I was watching computer animation.  The best part of the movie, for me, was the allusions to other, better movies (""Looks like I picked a rotten day to quit drinking"" made me wish I had rented Airplane!).  On the other hand, even they were a reminder that there was not a single original moment in this picture.  The bad guys look like ""Alien"" meets ""E.T.""

"jiangliqings","5","1","3","21 January 2001"," It's average, no more, no less.
","** out of ****<br/><br/>It's been a while now since Independence Day had been a reigning box office champ.  I remember all the hype and media coverage over it.  The film broke box office records and had people clamoring over it.  Well, it's pretty much a forgotten film now, as nobody seems to really mention it anymore.  Either the ones that receive awful reviews (Battlefield Earth) or good to great reviews (Star Wars, The Matrix) are the big-budget sci-fi films that stay remembered.  Independence is just relentlessly mediocre.<br/><br/>Taking place over the course of 3 days (basically the first 3 of July), the film begins with a gigantic spacecraft hovering over the moon.  Separate pieces disentangle itself from the mothership, 36 in all, and position themselves over the world's most powerful cities.  At this point, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is undecided as to what course of action to take.  Should they wait, or fire upon the alien ships.<br/><br/>A brilliant cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum)-no kidding-figures out that the aliens are using a code through Earth's own satellites, and is actually a countdown, and when the clock ticks to zero, all of Earth will be decimated in a hailstorm of lasers.  He manages to warn the president in time (he's the ex-husband of one of the president's advisors, no less), and they evacuate just before the ships fire down on the cities, and soon 36 of the world's largest and most powerful cities have been reduced to rubble.<br/><br/>The humans aim for a counterattack, with fighter jets to take down the ships, but as Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and his squad figure out, these ships have some sort of force field that prevent penetration from any object.  With the exception of himself, Hiller's squad is completely destroyed, and he ends up in the deserts of Nevada, dragging an unconscious alien.  Eventually, all the characters meet in Area 51, buried secrets of the past are unearthed, and discussions and plans of ways of fighting back are brought into light.<br/><br/>There's really nothing to get excited about concerning this film.  It has a few exciting action scenes, some humorous bits, and a barrage of outstanding special effects, but it's rather dissatisfying.  There's not nearly as much action as you would hope for, and I would like to have seen some hand-to-hand combat, not just some aerial dogfights.  The movie is basically hollow entertainment, and even then, it tries the patience with the slow buildup in the first hour.  If you want entertaining and non-stop sci-fi action, go with Starship Troopers, and if you want a better film a similar storyline, then just stick with Star Wars.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich isn't exactly a director that's well known for helming compelling scripts and Independence Day is no different.  The screenplay features a bevy of plot holes and blatant stupidity, most of which appear in the final half hour, as the ridiculous plan to fight back the aliens strikes me as lame-brained.  Emmerich is adept at handling special effects and action, but a good bit of it feels like it's for naught with some of the outright idiocy of the story behind it.<br/><br/>The performances are merely average.  Will Smith is a lot of fun to watch as the hero, and he does turn in the most likeable and charismatic performance. Jeff Goldblum plays a genius as usual, and he's good at it, too.  It's just that everyone else is not so good.  Bill Pullman is pretty stiff, and while others do manage to put life into their roles, there's not nearly enough screentime given to them to put any signifigance into it.<br/><br/>I suppose now that all the sound and fury is over, Independency Day really doesn't add up to too much, it's a major disappointment.  It's nowhere near being awful, but it has too many flaws to make this a film worth watching over and over again."

They had a huge challenge, making a stupid plot into a visually interesting movie, and failed.<br/><br/>The ""science"" in this pitiful space opera was consistently stupid.

The only way those aliens could have failed would have been a War of the Worlds defeat by infection -- a virus that actually hurt the aliens themselves. Sure, it's been used before, and isn't very biologically plausible, but it's not as stupid as jet engine technology defeating starship technology.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, but the movie would have been more fun if it had been terrible. That would have at least given the movie some camp value.<br/><br/>Comparisons: The plot of The Fifth Element was silly, but not a ""same old thing"" story. The visual effects in it were sometimes well-made, and sometimes cheesy, but always interesting. Independence Day's effects were well-made, but still not interesting.<br/><br/>Independence Day came out around the same time as the excellent The Arrival, and almost entirely overshadowed it.

","""Independence Day"" is quite possibly the biggest and greatest alien-invasion film ever made (and is also responsible for re-igniting the disaster movie craze of the late 1990s), and I mean that literally. Its budget, its Oscar-winning special effects, its blockbuster status as the highest-grossing movie of 1996 - yeah, all in all, ""Independence Day"" is a big movie, a really big movie. It has a plot that is somewhat of a modern-day revisionist update of H.G. Wells's turn-of-the-century alien invasion epic ""The War of the Worlds."" It also has an all-star cast consisting of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, and Randy Quaid. When massive 15-mile wide alien spaceships darken the skies over the world's major cities, the people of planet Earth are caught in spectacle. But wonder turns to out-right terror when the alien ships begin raining down destructive beams all over the major cities and killing millions in the process. Why do they do it? They're after our natural resources, we learn; they just want to wipe us out first to make it easier for them to get what they want and leave. The plot isn't the best or even the most original aspect of this movie; that's not the point. What master of disaster director Roland Emmerich wants to deliver is special effects, awesome scenes of extraterrestrial destruction, and action scenes detailing humanity's brave fight back against the technologically superior alien menace. ""Independence Day,"" for the longest time, was my favorite movie of all time; I lived and breathed it. All I could talk and think about was ""Independence Day,"" and I'm not sure how or why I didn't wear out my VHS tape from so many repeated viewings. 15 years later, this movie is still as thrilling and entertaining as it ever was.

All I care about is the alien invasion and humanity's desperate struggle to fight back. I could care less if it's patriotism before 9/11 made uber-patriotism the hot new thing to be in America. And oh yeah, ""Independence Day,"" as its title would imply, is set over the course of the American Fourth of July weekend. Oh, well. Regardless, ""Independence Day"" still rocks, big-time!

","so, once again I'm reviewing a movie that i grew up with. i was a child of the 90's, and i distinctly remember 3 films my mom bought on video when they came out: Mission Impossible, Twister, and ID4. ID4 was my favorite of the 3, and still is. there is a lot more to this film then just the special effects. its got heart. thats why i like it. there is also this kind of innocence to it, a child like sense of wonder that has only been seen in films like the original Star Wars. it doesn't take itself ultra seriously but seriously enough for you to feel for the characters. Jeff goldbloom is one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him in this. Jurassic park and ID4 are 2 of my favorite action films so seeing him in this as well was a great treat. will smith, before he became huge with ""Men In Black"" the following year, was also great and funny as well. bill pullman is very good as the president, he definitely looks like one here and is very likable and perhaps a bit too ""calm"" when the aliens take over. if that were me i would have been going crazy, yet Pullman's president stays strangely calm and collected throughout. amazing! we need a president that is that cool under pressure! harry connick junior makes a brief but memorable role as the ""biggs"" character for this movie (for those star wars fans out there, you know what i mean). there were a lot of parts in this movie that seemed directly lifted from the original Star Wars. the giant saucer ships are like the death star, the F-18's have replaced X-wings and likewise the alien attackers have replaced Tie Fighters. you even have a unlikely hero like Luke skywalker in randy quaids character, especially at the very end in the plane.<br/><br/>the movie has enough laughs and suspense to keep you going and is very well cast. the action however is simply amazing. you must remember, this was in a time when CGI had not yet taken over cinema, so computer effects were used at a minimum. but that is what makes the special effects in this movie GREAT! CGI today is terribly overused to the point where movies have come to look like video games. they look awful. the effects in the 80's and most of the 90's still used practical effects using models and miniature's for the action. and boy did they do an amazing job with ID4. the ships, particularly the mammoth command ships, are a site to see, especially if you have an HDTV on bluray. it is MASSIVE. they cover the cities like a huge shadow. it was obviously a real ship they used, not lame phony looking CGI. and the effect would not have looked anywhere near as real or scary if CGI was used. the explosions were also real. when the white house blew up, or the empire state building, or congress, those are REAL explosions, and WOW did it look impressive. you just don't see that kind of explosions today. take for example the newer Star Wars prequels. EVERYTHING looks fake! every set was blue screen and looked incredibly smooth and unreal. almost nothing was a prop or real set, it was just horrible. why don't they just go back to the way they used to film special effects? it looked 1 million times more real and actually were almost TOO real for comfort! again, they just don't make them like they used to and its sad.<br/><br/>another thing to note is David Arnold's INCREDIBLE music score for this film. no, not that retarded REM song. i mean the film score itself. its very heroic, big, EPIC. it really makes you root for our heroes when the triumphant pro-American theme starts playing. it really gets your heart pumping with excitement when you couple the amazing action scenes with Arnold's superb score. the film wouldn't be anywhere near as good without it. parts that kind made me laugh was when they are planning the attack with all the countries, and when they show Russia, this very slavic sounding version of the ID4 theme is heard, complete with deep male singers and tambourine HAHA. this part was very old school. not to go overboard with the star wars references, but there were many moments in the score i noticed where it sounds very john William's-like, but thats fits this kind of movie perfectly.<br/><br/>in the end, this is one of my favorite movies and despite what cynical reviewers may say, this is a great fun night out at the movies if there ever was one, right up there with original Star Wars trilogy! now go out and SEE IT!"

","The two main factors of Independence Day are heroism and the spirit of unity. Actually these two factors are old acquaintances to many film-goers, but they can also move every person who watches this movie. Leading role can focus the power all over the world on saving the earth or human beings. This is the most excited thing in the world I think.<br/><br/>Another theme which is usually talked in this sort of disaster movie is humanity. But there is a little in Independence Day, the shrinking violet Secretary of Defense, who is completely different with our young and energetic President Thomas J. Whitmore. Who can save the world? The answer is clear in every audience's heart I suppose.<br/><br/>As for the golden combination, Captain Steven Hiller and David Levinson, they separately represent wisdom and courage. Two parts of a prefect saver. This method makes heroes more like an ordinary person by giving each part some weaknesses.<br/><br/>David Levinson is a scientist without great aspirations. He has a simple life. He likes laying chess with his old father and riding bike. To him, the life now he has got is the one he wants the most, besides the part of he and his ex-wife. He has been in deep love with his wife even after they got divorced. His charming wife, Constance Spano, is a presidential assistant. Her busy work and his easy life make a sharp contrast in theirs daily life; this contrast is also the reason of their divorce. If Constance were not the Presidential assistant, I think David can't save the world because he has no chance to talk to the President. <br/><br/>Captain Steven Hiller is an excellent soldier with a strong body and honesty. People would simply deem that Steven is a nice guy at the first sight of Will Smith's face. Jasmine Dubrow, Steven's girlfriend, who has a little boy and his father isn't Steven. Steven treats him like his own son. We can realize that in the scene of Steven went back to his base, he made a promise of setting fireworks after he accomplish his mission with that little boy. In the end of the final war, the boy watches the fireworks made up by remains of aliens' spaceship.<br/><br/>One person breaks the code of aliens' communication and comes up with the idea of saving human beings, the other person has the ability of driving spacecraft, strong body to fight with a real alien and the courage to challenge unknown. These two guys make all the expectations come true. David's idea of beating aliens is implant virus into mother ship of aliens to make all spacecrafts 'get cold '. And it just comes from David's father's comforting words. From the very beginning, they two have no tacit understanding in the battle. I think their only tacit understanding is embracing their beloved woman as soon as possible after winning the war. Maybe love is the real theme of this disaster movie.<br/><br/>We have another hero in this movie, the President. He wanted to be a President full of passion and energetic. But there was no opportunity before aliens' invasion of Earth. ""I'm a combat pilot, I belong in the air. "" This is my most memorable lines. Do you like this kink of president? A president attends a war in person, an act to inspire everyone's patriotism to protect their own nation. The President is a normal person, he loves his cute daughter. But he can not be an ordinary person because he is the President of the United States. He is responsible to the whole National; so he can't express his sorrow of wife's death completely.<br/><br/>Aliens are poor, because they are usually beaten by American for strengthening National cohesion and proving the achievement in Special Effects. Everybody has a unique imagination of aliens, but most of them are aggressive. Nobody hates aliens; we all have sympathy for the weak and loathe aggressive part. If men invade other plant for its resource, audiences will also acclaim for men's failure. For example, in the movie Avatar, the audiences applaud for human beings' failure of invading Pandora.<br/><br/>""Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united by our common interest. Perhaps its fate that today is 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression or persecution, but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live, to exist. And should we win the day, the fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declare in one voice we will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight, we are going to live on, we are going to survive! Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!""<br/><br/>This is president's exciting speech before the final war. And remember: we will not vanish without a fight, we are going to live on, and we are going to survive! Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!"
"vahramx","4","1","4","24 July 2009"," Worst movie that made a ton of money
","Independence Day, regardless of its box office rank, does not qualify as even a respectable film. For a number of reasons, primarily the poor script, poor plot, and just plan lack of originality.<br/><br/>I mean come on, do you really believe an alien species that is hundreds of millennia more sophisticated then us, is going to be so vulnerable to destruction that a mere suicide attack from a jet plane could render their entire invasion a failure? Not to mention that an alien species cannot possibly have an aggressive mentality for by the time they reach this state of intelligence they would have destroyed themselves, hundreds of times over.<br/><br/>And if they are this intelligent they would have nanobots to recycle their own waste. And they could simply have gathered the resources of their neighboring planets rather than travel hundreds of light years just to destroy a potential form of entertainment.<br/><br/>The script is cliché 1990's, it incorporates many of the variables that are reminiscent of that decade, particularly nonsensical war-cries that do little to improve the movie watching experience and serves only to give the film an additional aura of ridiculousness. I cannot help but imagine the entertainment potential this film had, if only it were let's saymore serious- a sort of ""War of the Worlds"" type of film, although that was also a very inaccurate assessment of alien intelligence."

They were ably supported by some stars as Randy Quaid, Mary McDonnell and Robert Loggia. In addition, there were some fine beauties sprinkled through the film: Vivica A. Fox as an exotic dancer in her thong; Kiersten Warren and KImberly Beck both appeared in small parts, but their beauty did not go unnoticed.<br/><br/>So, overlook the obvious plot holes that come with this kind of movie, pop some corn and just enjoy."
"blackasp98","10","1","4","27 August 2006"," Excellent film
","OK the premise is yes,earth has to defend itself from the harboring aliens coming to injest everything on the planet.But the one thing about the story,is that one Randy quaids role was a fighter pilot,if you remember the line from the major who was turtoring the would be pilots.Your about to get a crash course in modern avionics.For quaids role he did fly a jet in NAM not Korea,and he did hold a pilots license in a jet so using a modern jet would be but not difficult at best to fly.As for the virus the aliens didn't know if their technology would be superior,i am guessing they felt real confident about taking the earth with no problem,not realizing that the scout ship found at area 51 was from the fifties,so with lacking news from the scout,about technology they thought no problems taking over.The story and characters were excellent,a huge cast of veterans and new faces which made the film very desirable.I for one loved the special effects,and you have to remember some of those takes could only be done once,which is pressure on the film makers of emmerich and devlin.They did win some good awards for the results of plot and special effects,which made some ground breaking openings in other films.I hope emmerich and devlin will come to the audience with a new story and kick butt effects,as for godzilla,not bad i thought doing the story over again was a bit cheesy,but the effects took my breath away.Great work roland bring us some more."

"Mr_PCM","10","1","4","8 May 2005"," Simply a great fun movie
","OK, If you are wanting a film that examines the meaning of life or some such other philosophically clever question, then you might as well stop reading now, for Independence Day certainly ain't for you. What it is is 2 hours of bam-splat mindless action, and a lot of fun. It is a film like this that reminds people what the movies were invented for - entertainment, pure and simple.<br/><br/>The preposterous premise (well, a film like this had to have one) is aliens have come to annihilate life as we know it on earth. It then falls to a few plucky survivors, led by an heroic President of Earth (sorry, USA) to stave off the evil aliens' diabolical plans to use our planet for their own devious ends. That, basically, is it. A simple plot though is essential for a film where you just want to switch off, sit back and enjoy the show, and Independene Day delivers. Just make sure you realise at the outset that the film has its tongue firmly embedded in its' cheek. It is not a film to take seriously.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays Will Smith (as he always does), in the form of a Captain in the United States marine air force. He is aided and abetted by the anally retentive genius Dr Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), the aforementioned gung-ho president (Bill Pullman), and an ex-marine (Randy Quaid) who has been abducted by the invaders before, and whose warnings have gone unheeded for years. Together they must dust off the rubble and beat off the aliens with a lot of big bangs and explosions.<br/><br/>This was one of Smith's first films on the back of the success of the Fresh Prince TV series, and his wisecracking routine is therefore still relatively fresh and humorous here. OK the dialogue is horrendously corny, yet somehow endearing because of (or maybe in spite of) it. The jokes come thick and fast between the explosions, making Smith the perfect popcorn-movie actor. The lines are frequently laugh-out-loud bad, so bad they're good - ""I have got to get me one of these,"" ""Elvis has left the building"" and ""Now that's what I call a close encounter!"" being just some standout ones.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent (and deservedly won an Oscar), the standout moment being the full-frontal blow-out of the White House. Never let it be said that Emmerich wasn't daring! (In case anyone still isn't sure, he goes on to prove it again in The Day After Tomorrow.)<br/><br/>The American jingoism is often hideously over-powering at times, to the extent where you want to stick two fingers down your throat as the world flocks to America's banner. Thank God for the Americans! seems to be the film's message to the rest of the world. Just wait for the President's inspiring speech on the eve of the final attack and his subsequent personal entry into the battle. What a guy! The Hollywood ending is so sugary it should carry a health warning as it may rot your teeth. But for all that, the movie is tremendous film, and if you can refrain from letting the incredulousness of it affect your viewing pleasure, then this is the perfect matinée entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy."

","Yes, I know some of you don't like it; yes, I know the critics trashed it, but I think the critics missed the point: it's the best parody of alien invasion movies that's ever been made; it's just serious enough to apparently fool a lot of folks. It even comes complete with Brent Spiner's send-up of his own image (Data, Star Trek NG) as Area 51's mad scientist, Dr Oaken (sp?), Randy Quaid's parody of Crazy Cousin Eddie in the Vacation movies, Jeff Goldblum's send-up of the eccentric nerd, and a whole cast of familiar stereotypes from other alien movies.<br/><br/>The ""deal"" with this movie is that if you're not a Sci-Fi fan with a history of watching classic Sci-Fi movies, the arcane references will most likely fly over your head.<br/><br/>There's something for every Sci-Fi fan, lines and references lifted straight from ""War of the Worlds,"" ""2001, A Space Odessy,"" and several others.<br/><br/>Watch the movie with a sense of humor and tongue planted firmly in cheek, and if nothing else, set yourself up for a hilarious and sterling performance by Will Smith, in one of his first high visibility roles.<br/><br/>That alone is worth the price of the rental."

","I just finished to see this movie on TV (I refused to see it on big screen because I heard too many criticisms from friends)... Tonight I told myself ""let's give it a chance"". I was expecting a super-turbo action, brainless movie. What a disappointment! The effects are great, OK, but there isn't suspense, there aren't strong emotions nor real ""heroic action"". Maybe Americans skip an heartbeat seeing the White House blown up, but I'm not American. By the way, the ""americanocentric"" view makes me smile. If Americans would really think this way they couldn't be the most powerful country of the world. From a logical point of view, it's an astonishing piece of junk (yes, it's what I was expecting in this way: brainless). I'm a programmer and the idea of a virus is simply idiotic. If scientists were unable to understand the power source of the captured alien fighter (the chief scientist of Area 51 tells that they were even unable to turn the power on until the alien forces arrived to destroy mankind, and all the ship's instruments started to work!), it's impossible they could understand the logical principles of the computer[s] aboard, nor the programming language to code a virus. Even knowing the computer[s] aboard would not imply knowing the computers aboard the main ships: imagine working on an embedded system built in a  Tomcat; knowing it would not mean that you can code a program for, let's say, a mainframe. Anyway, if someone understood everything being a genius monster with an IQ of 938 and a lot of positive imagination, the character of Jeff Goldblum couldn't learn how to code that virus in a matter of hours! ...And what about that hilarious portable Mac ""negotiating with host"" and ""uploading virus""? Well... Let's forget the virus. Could someone explain to me why the fighters piloted by a bunch of non-professionals, overnumbered by technologically superior alien fighters, even without shields, manage to win the 2nd air battle? Probably they would crash the planes simply trying to take off. What about the captured fighter? If it crashed in an accident killing two crew members, how could it fly smoothly? Stop. There are lots of stupid things like these in the movie, but, as I said, I was expecting them. What I wasn't expecting is the complete lack of powerful, heroic action scenes. The air battles are annoying if you don't mind special effects. It sucks."

The scariest part being when it made about 800 billion dollars at the box office and some people of the people (who actually WATCHED THE ENTIRE movie) enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The more intelligent the viewer who watches this movie (full viewing is not needed) the more likely one will be to kill themselves immediately upon leaving the theatre.

I would also imagine that someone like Charlton Heston would clap gleefully throughout, while collecting a lap full of drool the whole while.<br/><br/>I would mention all of the holes in the plot line and every scene where the trillion to one odds are defied, but the good people at IMDb limit the length of these reviews.<br/><br/>The portion of the movie where the world gets pummelled with laser beams is well done (graphically and acoustically) but the rest of the film does an ever higher quality job of making you wish you were dead (see 2nd paragraph).<br/><br/>I just kept waiting to see Jeff Goldblum put his Microsoft Alien Virus '97 CD into the drive before uploading into the (strangely compatible) alien computer system (cough - from his laptop).<br/><br/>So I rated this movie 2/10, and the only reason it didn't get 0 (or less) was because of the somewhat entertaining special effects."

To be fair, some of the building destruction scenes have impressive visuals and are well made.<br/><br/>My main impression of this movie is that it no doubt has a strong element of propaganda for the Jewish and Israel.

"pkarpenko","9","1","5","16 August 2004"," ID4 Accomplished All it Set Out to Do. No More, No Less.
","Reading the other reviews, I cannot help but feel as though people are taking this movie and, in fact, the CONCEPT of this movie far too seriously. First off, let me come right out and say that ID4 is the best disaster film ever made. Say what you will about Towering Inferno, Airport, Earthquake or the original Godzilla, ID4 does it better. <br/><br/>The concept of the disaster film is, in essence, very simple. Have lots of characters representing many aspects of society and perspectives, all dealing with a common evil (be it natural, unnatural, supernatural, etc.) The idea is that people come together in times of crisis to confront a common foe. To do this well in a film requires a specific directorial touch in that, because the concept of the disaster film hangs on its multiple characters and, of course, the portrayal of the actual disaster, these elements must be rendered flawlessly. ID4 does this.<br/><br/>If there is one word to describe ID4's aesthetic, technical and directorial design, it's polished. The special effects, which were NOT cutting edge in the mid 90s (contrary to what most think) looked precisely right. There is really only one way to show a wall of fire rushing down a city, and ID4 pretty much nailed it. The result of using only what was necessary in terms of effects and nothing more is that ID4 STILL looks good, almost a decade later. Also, the writing is concise, funny and direct. Nothing is extraneous or boring. And as far as the characters go, each is given ample screen-time and kept track of throughout the film. This is harder than it seems and, actually, it's also the reason why Soderbergh's Ocean's 11 is as polished as it is. The characters are all kept track of properly. <br/><br/>So ID4 cannot be judged on its realism or any other extraneous factor. It is a marvelously entertaining disaster film. Of course it's oversimplified, of course it's not scientifically accurate. But that's why we go to the movies sometimes."

Next is the popular whinge that 'the Americans save the planet ....again'. Now I'm not American but I imagine - and correct me if I'm wrong - that the $75,000,000 budget was mostly made up from American money, so hell yeah, they paid for it so let them be the heroes.<br/><br/>Finally, the fact that it borrows all its plotlines from other, earlier more groundbreaking SciFi. Well the movies that lend these themes were at the forefront of the SciFi era. So it was easy to be original.<br/><br/>The other main complaint was President Whitmore's address immdiately previous to the climactic battle, ........ well I have to give you that one. I actually thought that someone had fired up a fondue pot in the row behind me the smell of cheese was so strong, and there were other cheesy moments too, but sometimes a bit of cheese is OK, afterall those bastards were about to wipe us out!<br/><br/>This film was never was meant to to be disected in a post end credits, deep and foreboding intellectual discussion.<br/><br/>Its a go in, sit down, switch off, they beat us, we beat them, while getting blown back into your seat by 2-1/2 hours of explosive never seen before special effects, where in the end all is well in the world again.<br/><br/>

","I love this film. I am 16 now and was only 8 when it was released so I didn't really understand it, but having watched it again recently now older and maturer I get the plot and I think this movie is very well written, acted and directed. So overall it is a great movie. It never gets boring for a minute and moves very qucikly with some simply fantastic special effects shots, such as the devastation of New York, Washington and LA along with some great air battles and suspense moments. The plot is simple. Millions of aliens in giant spaceships are moving through galaxy after galaxy consuming every natural resource in its path, moving on afterwards and Earth is next. Jeff Goldblum figures it out and warns the President, Bill Pullman to evacuate the main cities as soon as possible. However by the time this happens its too late. People are so silly and panic driven that they all get blown to smithereens. The survivors around the world (inlcuding Will Smith and Randy Quaid in one of their greatest performances!) then try and try to bring down the ships. They try just about eveything until they finally figure out how to do it.<br/><br/>Anyway this movie is brilliant and deserved to do well at the Box Office considering the amount of effort put into making it. The rating should be in the 8.1 or 8.2 region as far as I'm concerned, not 6.0. The movie as I've already said moves fast and the effects are great but the best part of it are the performances of the actors and the script which I think are both flawless. The scenes where they're talking about there plans to bring the ships down are found difficult to understand by some people but I found them very easy and they are certainly well written. The main characters being Smith, Pullman, Quaid and Goldblum are great and this movie is great!<br/><br/>Go watch it! 10/10"

Sure there's nothing complicated about it, it's cut to the chase stuff, spaceships appear within 2 minutes, def cons are mentioned shortly after. Cue lots of booming sound effects to match the flash cuts as we whip around the globe setting up the alien invasion, whilst maintaining the focus on the US Military. Mr President Bill Pullman doing his breathy, I'm really important act, I'm surprised the TV doesn't explode with testosterone. In fact women are pretty much left out of the story altogether. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the US population watched this and thought ""Hell yeah, we'd show those aliens!"", truth is though that's not the way to enjoy this film. It's a tongue firmly in cheek sort of ride. ""The LA Police Department asks people not to fire their weapons at the spaceship, you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war"". I mean it's got Will Smith in it, not to mention Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum. It's a sci-fi, disaster movie farce with a massive budget. A budget largely spent on explosions. Landmarks blown up, relentless fireballs, flying cars, all in slow motion of course and the audio balance is bloody ridiculous, speaker killing pyrotechnics coupled with rousing score, followed by cheesy exposition heavy dialogue at half the volume. Ah... the dialogue, seriously who wrote this script, that speech, it's so cringe inducing it made my face hurt, as the characters bumble through a solution to their impending doom. I guess if hostile aliens do ever attack us, sticking the gun toting nutjob country in the line of fire isn't a bad idea, as long as we can handle the endless fist pumping gloating that might follow. It's not aged badly though, it is what it is, daft over the top fun, but I guess I'm a bit more cynical these days and I seriously doubt anyone would green light anything like this now... although they did make Independence Day: Resurgence a few years ago, now THAT was a disaster!"

","This is an example of a big, dumb summer blockbuster that's also quite entertaining. As a kid in the 90's I couldn't get enough of this movie. I've probably watched it about a dozen times in my life, but watched it as an adult for the first time recently in preparation for the sequel. As a kid I didn't really see all the flaws that this movie has, and it does have many! I just really enjoyed the spectacle of it all. I can still enjoy that spectacle, but the weak and often ridiculous plot points definitely stand out now as an adult. This movie is full of cheese, which makes it both fun at times while inducing eye rolling at other times. You can't really take this movie too seriously without realizing just how stupid it is, but if you turn off your brain you can have fun with this movie. I think it's able to keep itself from crossing that line into the overly obnoxious that most of these types of movies often go crashing through (ahh-hem Michael Bay!). The special effects still hold up pretty well, especially when compared to other movies of that time frame. Overall, this is not a good movie, but it is fun and entertaining.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>************SPOILERS************<br/><br/>Recommended for those that enjoy alien invasions, hot shot pilots, cable repair nerds, patriotism, rousing speeches, exploding cars, exploding helicopters, exploding jets, exploding buildings, exploding landmarks, exploding cities, exploding spaceships, universal cross- platform compatibility...<br/><br/>...but that's just like, my opinion, man<br/><br/># Of Times Watched: 10+"

","Watching this on a back-to-back with EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, I was surprised to see how similar the two films are. Despite being separated by forty years, the plots are basically the same, both casts are full of military types, and even the way that the aliens are finally destroyed are very similar. It feels like INDEPENDENCE DAY is in fact a remake of EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS, and I'll bet that at least some of the scriptwriters viewed that film in advance (or maybe when they were kids). Anyway, it's sad to think that now we have unlimited budgets and state of the art CGI animation, we still can't do everything right. When it comes down to it, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS is a more enjoyable film than INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br/><br/>The trouble with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that, clocking in at two hours and nineteen minutes, it's just far too long. Sitting through this film feels like a chore and it's difficult to stop yourself becoming bored during the scenes where aliens aren't around. Let's face it, there's just too much sickly sentimentalising of the worst kind in this film, where all I wanted to see was more alien destruction. We are forced to sit through excruciating scenes of the president's wife dying (""she's sleeping..."") and people in love which are totally out of place and quite embarrassing.<br/><br/>Not much of it is original either - when it looks like something clever is coming along, the film makers just decide to blow everything up instead to make the biggest spectacle. I guess the fault here lives in Devlin and Emmerich, the guys who made this film and GODZILLA, but at least this isn't as bad as that trash. At least they managed to assemble a memorable cast, but most people are wasted in their roles and frankly there are just too many sub plots and different characters to make you care about any of them. Jeff Goldblum just plays out his usual lovable scientist routine, like he does in just about every film I see him in. Will Smith enjoys himself in his first big screen outing, yet he's nothing more than a two-dimensional, gung-ho type hero who spends much of his screen time as comic relief. The two partners of the aforementioned are useless too, let's just say I'm not a big fan of television movie-style acting. Thankfully, we've also got Judd Hirsch in the role of Goldblum's father, a grumpy old man, and he's great.<br/><br/>The role of the US President is played as a snivelling, stupid wimp by none other than Bill Pullman, and I hate his miscast performance here. It should be more like Harrison Ford in AIR FORCE ONE, as at least that was fun. Pullman is probably most at fault in the film for his stomach-churning sentimentalising, and it's a shame he didn't die at the end. Randy Quaid is also in the cast, and he totally overdoes it as an alien abduction victim. Robert Loggia appears as a tough military type, and he's well suited to the role - he fits it like a glove. Nobody else is sufficiently interesting for me to mention them.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you watch this film, just forget about the scenes with people in, instead watch the epic destruction of America by the aliens. The CGI special effects come into their own here and they're some of the best we've had for a long time, they truly are visually stunning. The huge alien saucers look amazing, and when the final second arrives on the satellite countdown, the destruction doesn't disappoint as nuclear blasts through cars into the air and demolish buildings within seconds. While the small flying saucers don't look as impressive, at least they have a groovy-looking turquoise shield which protects them from enemy fire, and there are some exciting battle sequences between the humans and aliens. Speaking of aliens, they themselves are not particularly inspired, just tentacled humanoids which we've seen a billion times before, the only different thing this time is that their eyes are shiny and mirrored instead of black.<br/><br/>So, all in all, if you want a modern B-movie, then check out INDEPENDENCE DAY. While majorly flawed, it's worth watching for all the special effects and explosions and has a fun spirit too. In the end, it's not bad, but it could have been a lot better."

","Independence Day is one of the many classics that is still good to this day, but even so people are saying it is cheesy, or even bad. Some people are even saying it is cheesy, but incredibly likable. Personally I don't find this movie the tiniest bit cheesy. It is very enjoyable and packs action and destruction. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman's characters are developed very well and their development really fits in with the story. The acting was really good, and all the characters definitely do feel like there is an alien invasion. And the storytelling and scripting was really good and it definitely puts together a masterpiece of a movie.<br/><br/>My one complaint though is that the plot goes quite slow at first, but it picks up quite quickly and gets the excitement and mayhem going.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very enjoyable sci-fi action and adventure movie packed with disaster and excitement. Go check it out for yourself, it's definitely one to watch before you die."

This movie is over schmaltzed to a degree that had me install a bucket by my side just in case. Randy Quaid must cringe at his over the top drunk ""...hello boys, I'm Baa-aack!"" Whoever came up with the sound effect for the alien fighters needs to stop visiting the zoo for his inspiration. The Neeeeaaaww scream of the passing enemy fighters was cringe making in its corniness. Add to that the cigar symbolism, wielded by Smith and Connick and used as a phallic emblem of masculine power was also cringe making. Its just an over the top unbelievable film I don't need to see more than once a decade and then only to remind me how awful it was!"

","Independence Day (1996): Dir: Roland Emmerich / Cast: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell; Randy Quaid: Biggest hit of the year and not a shred of originality to show for it. Rumors say that it was suppose to represent many nations against one massive foe but all it showcased was Americans fighting the alien spacecraft. Yes, we have the United States President and an unshaven drunk leading the battle. A huge alien spacecraft hovers over the city and blasts the White House. The President declares it Independence Day and strikes back at the unwanted visitors without a clue as to how to destroy it. The climax is an attack on the mother ship, as if that development is suppose to shock us. Impressive special effects accompany a familiar plot that actually starts out well until formula sets in. Directed by Roland Emmerich who previously made Stargate. Only Will Smith as a fighter pilot contains any depth. Jeff Goldblum is typecast as a computer wiz. Bill Pullman is embarrassing as the President who issues this all out war. Mary McDonnell gets dragged into this as the First Lady. Randy Quaid plays this idiot drunk who can conveniently fly a plane. While blowing up the White House seems to be high point in the film, blowing up the film sounds like a better way to pass the time. Recycled idiotic mayhem at the lowest possible cause.

","Independence Day. Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012) just loves the idea of extinction of humanity so he keeps on showing us different ways of having it happened. Here, one alien race threatens the earth at their face to kill all humans in one shot. The movie works big time because it enjoys this idea to the core and then finding the solution in more enjoyable manner. The characters of the American President played by subtle Bill Pullman leading humans from the front, the smart scientist played by charming Jeff Goldblum finding the unbelievable crazy solution and terrific fearless military man played by unmatched Will Smith put up a great show of heroism and courage apart from the amazing special effects done all the way from start to finish. You just feel amazed watching the whole New York going ashes, Will Smith's plane being followed by the alien one and the priceless visual of huge spaceship almost covering the whole city. In one line, if you have purchased a state of the art home theater system with one big projector screen then this movie should be the first one to enjoy."

"gigan-92","7","0","1","14 July 2011"," Hollywood Budgeted Massive Destruction At Its Finest
","C- Lo and behold, it's the only Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin film I actually care for. I saw it at a young age, and have seen it well over twenty times if not more over my years. If you, especially like me as an aspiring film maker, take a gander over the pair's many productions over the years, you'll realize the actual amount of creativity and talent they have can fit inside of a pin head. Their movies are predictable and serve merely as popcorn movies. As far as revolutionary sci-fi goes, it only qualifies in the category of special effects and nothing more. Of course the ships target the most popular cities first, it's movie's basics. My sole praise is to the obvious that of the extraterrestrial ship and body design. Naturally, my favorite part is the alien autopsy scene, the amount of detail put into the creatures. The film's use of miniatures is appreciated as well.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Jeff Goldblum is pretty decent, and Will Smith is the usual gun-ho protagonist. Mary McDonnell and James Duval also star in not too bad of roles. The performances don't bother me; it's just that I'm not emotionally invested in the characters because I know who's going to die and who's not. To truly experience a modern sci-fi achievement, check out ""District 9"", a text book example of a fresh take on aliens, or in my humble opinion Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin's at their finest, if that really say's much but a good ride."
"Mccadoo","8","0","3","1 July 2011"," This movie has become part of my 4th of July
","OK, so plot holes abound in this movie, and Jeff Goldblum being able to actually sync his laptop up to an alien computer is possibly one of the most absurd plot devices in the history of cinema, and the dog should have been flash fried, I know I know... But I don't care, for me this movie always reminds me of the American 4th of July holiday (I'm American obviously) which means summer and fun. I remember the media blitz in the US for this movie, it began months before the release date and all you saw everywhere were black billboards with nothing on them but ""ID4"". The promotion for this movie was huge and very well done. It opened on July 3rd and my then wife and I went to see it that night. It was the only time before or since I've seen a movie on its opening night because usually it's too crowded but my wife actually insisted, she'd been dying to see it for weeks. And it was indeed very crowded but it was also fun, it was the start of the holiday weekend and the movie was playing in multiple theatres and the air of anticipation after that marketing campaign was palpable. It was an event. Did the movie live up to all of that? No, not really, it's not a great film, it's not in my top five or ten favorites. It's a popcorn movie, a check your logic at the door movie. But what's wrong with that? Those types of movies are fun too. And Independence Day is at the very least, good fun entertainment on a big scale. And on that night, at the beginning of the 4th of July weekend, it was perfect. Possibly if I had seen it at any other time I would feel differently but I didn't, and I don't. Another much maligned film that also came out in the mid-90's, Armageddon, is another prime example of a great popcorn movie. Is it great cinema? Of course not, but it is a great sit back and be entertained movie. It's a movie movie, meant to be seen on a big screen and I don't care what anyone says, it's a fun, entertaining way to spend a few hours. Did the people around us in that theater on July 3rd, 1996 cheer or applaud at the end of Independence Day? No, they didn't, and neither did my wife and I, but we weren't disappointed either. It was a great way to kick off our 4th of July. And now, fifteen years later, I still enjoy watching it, I enjoy sitting down with some popcorn and just being entertained by a big budget movie that may not be great, but that gives you a good ride for a few hours. Independence Day delivers that in spades, every time I watch it."

","Nobody is ever going to confuse Independence Day with any kind of work of great cinema. It's fun though. Sure, it's cheesy and corny. Often absurd and ludicrous too. But fun. As big, huge, visual effects summer blockbusters go you could do a lot worse. The aliens have come and they're gonna blow things up real good. And for this movie that's enough. Yes, the dialogue is mostly inane and terrible. Yes, there are some characters who disappoint, adding nothing of any substance to the proceedings. Yes, the movie goes on too long. For any movie of this type two hours will more than suffice. Independence Day careens well past that two-hour mark with a misguided attempt to inject some actual plot lines, some drama and real human emotion, into the movie. Plot? Drama? Emotion? Who needs any of that? Aliens invade. Humans fight back. The end.<br/><br/>It's easy to bemoan what Independence Day isn't. But you can certainly embrace it for what it is. If you're willing to buy in, and ignore the fact that so much of the movie makes no sense at all, Independence Day can be a rollicking good time. Will Smith is perfect for this sort of thing, Jeff Goldblum falls perfectly into his world-saving scientist role, Randy Quaid makes for an entertaining kook and Judd Hirsch provides some laughs. Some of the other performers admittedly don't fare as well. Harvey Fierstein is an over-the-top annoyance, Brent Spiner makes his bizarre scientist much, much too bizarre to take at all seriously and the key female characters, played by Margaret Colin and Vivica A. Fox are pretty much worthless, total bores. And then there's the President, played by Bill Pullman. Confronted with a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, not to mention personal loss, the guy seems utterly devoid of feeling. My country's three biggest cities were just destroyed? Eh, whatever. An inspiring figure this guy is not. Until all of a sudden he is as, before humanity's final assault, he gives one of the most awesome movie speeches ever. OK, the speech is totally cheesy and corny. But awesome. Of course that final assault is based around a plan which is incomprehensibly absurd, defying all logic and reason. Logic and reason have no place in this type of movie. If you accept that than this movie is easy to enjoy. It's the end of the world as we know it. And I feel fine."

But you know if you're looking for a really great plot then don't watch Independence Day. If you want a great plot watch One Flew Over the cuckoo's nest and Schindler's list (i like both of those movies). But if you don't care for action/sci fi movies then don't watch it.

It was, we concluded, a sort of ""popcorn"" outing that was custom tailored for the demographics of the Saturday Matinée set. Our conclusion: this<br/><br/>INDEPENDENCE DAY and films like it, we reasoned, were especially made as a sort of modern day replacement for the Cliff-Hanger Serials and the Juvenile ""B"" Westerns series pictures; starring the likes of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, ""Wild Bill"" Elliot and Sunset Carson.<br/><br/>WELL we do confess that this first screening was done at the ""office"" at Chicago Police Headquarters with all of the interruptions of the ""Police Procedural"" daily routine.

We can hear you crying out in sympathy to our plight with, ""Poor Babies!"" RECENTLY we watched INDEPENDENCE DAY on Fox Movie Channel with an eye toward being both objective and having a fresh and thorough evaluation; with no preconceived notions from the previous experience obstructing the view. Well hush my flannel mouthed face; but, there seem to be many layers of storyline and metaphor present that here to for had gone mostly unnoticed.<br/><br/>CONTRARY to our (really ""my"") previous pigeon-holing, the Film really has a lot to offer to all on many levels.<br/><br/>FIRST of all there was no expense spared in preparation and in laying the ground work for the telling of what could have been a simple, straight forward story of conflict into a grand, even epic tale related in highly complex and intelligent terms. The story, the cast, the Special FX, the Cinematography and even the music were all given extra refining before being assembled into the finished product.<br/><br/>LOCATION shooting included many sites in the United States; as well as Kenya, Egypt, London, ""Down Under"" in Australia and some necessary In Studio This gave the films various scenes a truly World-Wide appearance. The highly complementary use of a highly diverse cast of characters as portrayed by an equally impressive variety of Actors and Actresses* made for a perfect fit with the storyline.<br/><br/>MUCH like so many of the previously produced ""Disaster Movies"", such as EARTHQUAKE (Film Makers Group/Universal, 1974), THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Wayne-Fellows/Warner Brothers, 1954) and THE TOWERING INFERNO (Irwin Allen Productions/Warner Brothers/20th Century-Fox, 1974), the main story of the impending doom is made more interesting and human by having several smaller stories contained within its main framework. These sub-plots are almost usually devoted to personal crises that other wise pale by such comparison to the events of the day. You know what we mean; the quarrels, the divorce, corporate greed vs. individual rights, etc.<br/><br/>AS for these said performances by the various cast members, we believe there was an outstanding collective effort by what has proved to be a sort of supporting ""Stock Company."" But of course, we do believe in giving some particularly deserving players a little extra praise. Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith) and his affianced Bride Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox) provide an excellent story of a couple trying to make it, in spite of so many difficulties. The President, Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) plays a very human, albeit a highly skillful Chief Executive; well counter-balanced by his First Lady, Marilyn Whitmore, who is loving and supportive, yet a strong and independent, ""Her Own"" woman.** <br/><br/>LIKEWISE the on-screen contributions of such film Actors as : Judd Hirsch & Jeff Goldblum as a Father & Son Scientific Genius Duo, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn and Margaret Colin portraying Presidential Advisors, Harvey Firestein as a Super-Scientist and Randy Quaid's interpretation of the alcoholic old crop-duster & actual victim of Alien Abduction. Singer & Band Leader, Harry Connick, Jr., garners our honorable mention award as the ""buddy"" and flying partner to Will Smith's main character.<br/><br/>ANALYZING the overall effect of the film, we have to say that all characters who wore overalls in it did so quite well. (We just wanted to see if you were still with us!) <br/><br/>MAKING a judgment about just INDEPENDENCE DAY really is on ALL levels, we have come to find that it is much more than the ""Bubble Gum"" that we had believed it to be; while watching it in the divided attention mode, back at Police HQ's, so long ago. We now find it to be operating on several levels in addition to the very enjoyable battle scenes; like some advice for our Nation and the Free World. <br/><br/>THE World faced an overwhelming threat in the Movie (Alien Invasion by self avowed exponents of Genocide for the Human Race.) The President is plagued with a plethora of advisors, who all seem to be feeding the Chief Executive with conflicting information. The threat is constantly expanding and at one point, President Whitmore states that we are up against an inhuman and ruthless adversary who will not abide with any ""Diplomacy"". He makes a statement like, ""Hell, we should Nuke 'Em!"" IN drawing a parallel to our situation Today, we too face an enemy who wants only our destruction and a President may well have to follow what will be an unpopular foreign policy, at least for now; all in the interest of our People. It's sort of like what Harry Truman said about the loneliest job; ""This is where the Buck Passing Stops!"" <br/><br/>NOTE: * Yeah Schultz, we know; ""Actress"" is not deemed to be very Politically Correct by the Correct Speech Fascists.<br/><br/>NOTE ** Yes Oprah, that's spelled ""W-O-M-A-N!"" <br/><br/>POODLE SCHNITZ!!"

","I was around 10/11-years-old when this film came out and it still appeals to that part of me. The basic plot of the film is that alien spaceships suddenly come to Earth and hover over major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington, London, Moscow etc. The American government debate on what to do and how to communicate with the aliens. At the same time, a senior engineer at a television company, David (Jeff Goldblum), discovers strangle goings on and suspects the aliens. He realises that they were using the world's satellites against them and were planning to attack the Earth. After racing off the save the American President the aliens attacked and destroyed the world's major cities and planned to attack other cities such as Houston. When the American tried to fight the aliens were far stronger and technologically advanced.<br/><br/>The film is dumb, but that is why it works. You can just swing your brain off and just watch it. Its meant to be loud, its meant to have a lot of action and explosions. It had good special effects for its time and it helped Will Smith from a TV star to a major movie star. This film is Roland Emmerich's best. He is German director who is famous for directing big budget action films. He only other good film was the Day After Tomorrow.<br/><br/>This film does have faults, but it is just a fun movie and to me a symbol of the mid 90s."

I don't understand why people rate this movie so low, it deserves much higher than 6.3 (2/25/08). I know what the most common thought on why this movie is rated so low is: ""Why is America the only country taking any action?"" Well, to answer that stupid question, it isn't. If you weren't so busy criticizing this movie you'd notice that other countries have taken the same affirmative action that America has. ""Why didn't other countries go into space?"" Because America was the only country to have an alien ship in full tact on their soil, duh. And no, they weren't going to wait until astronauts came form other countries to fly the thing, if you listened, the general said ""36 hours until world destruction"", so why waste time? The characters in this movie were great, the storyline was also. The effects were excellent. This movie is a classic, and should be watched more rather than criticized for stupid reasons. 10/10"

","This is the kind of movie I never expected to even like, much less rate a 10!! However, a ten it is for me!! I must have originally stumbled on it on cable (never saw it in the theaters), and have been hooked on watching it many times.<br/><br/>Of major import is the fact there is absolutely no gratuitous violence at all. Of second major import is the humor; third are the special effects...all of which make it highly entertaining without worrying about having to leave the room because of some awful something ""coming up"" I just can't stand to see. (Even the dissection scene is quite fascinating to watch.)<br/><br/>The relationships between the characters are what keep me coming back and back again to watch. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are so terrific in that space ship--great chatter/dialog, delivered perfectly. Judd Hirsch and Goldblum in that car ride to Washington DC are just absolutely perfect. The continual positive forward motion of the story line embedded within a series of scenes focusing on emotional relationships engaged me deeply, in reflecting on my own life's relationships, resolved and unresolved. <br/><br/>I also had a good laugh watching the stereotypes of ""the American hero"" vis a vis the other assembled military groups around the world--so perfectly portrayed how we see ourselves as the ""saviors"" of humanity. One wonders if/when that would/will ever be the case...but for now, we are talking movies and not reality. <br/><br/>David Quaid is as always remarkable; absolutely believable in a character role that has been portrayed a million different ways. Vivica Fox is just fantastic--a great performance, and she is truly a role model and heroine for many young women. Adam Baldwin is excellent as that ""unbelievably cute guy"" in uniform, perfectly groomed, in completely control, doing and saying all the right things. The relationships between everyone are a pleasure to watch unfold. All of these roles may be considered cliché by many, but I enjoyed seeing them nonetheless. <br/><br/>Science Fiction gives us the luxury of going beyond our normal circumstance into new territory in order to work out emotional ""stuff"" within a completely new and interesting framework. This movie does that in a spectacularly entertaining way, and I thank the writers/producers/director for creating this very special ""world"" that I enjoy returning to on DVD again and again when I need a really ""feel good"" experience."

","This film can't be claimed to possess much, if any, intellectual value. It won't change the way we view anything(well, it may have people looking up, and/or appreciating the unblocked view of the sky more than usual). It won't revolutionize film-making. It may not even stay in your mind for terribly long after watching it. But it is an entertaining piece while you do, and hey, it's a chance for Trekkers to see Brent Spiner outside of Star Trek. Also, it never actually claims to be more than what it is, a Summer blockbuster. The film wastes no time introducing the extra-terrestrial element. The pacing throughout the film isn't bad. The plot is decent. Emmerich makes both disaster and action aspects work well. The film apparently holds, and may very well continue to hold, the record for the most miniature model-work in any one movie... that says something about just how much action is packed into this. The acting is fine. The dialog is... not the smartest ever written. The characters aren't bad. The real draw here is definitely the explosions and action.

","I was 6 when I first saw this movie. I really didn't understand it because I was in my early youth. My dad told me when we saw it the humans were fighting to get toys back from the aliens. I thought it was awesome so I saw it with him. <br/><br/>Eleven years later and I love it even more. From my understanding, it could very well be one of those movies that is so gripping and well thought out that it makes us celebrate our greatest holiday ever, Independence Day, even more. But lets get right to the point: it is that darn good.<br/><br/>The story is about Mankind desperately fighting back against an alien civilization that has destroyed every major city on the planet. Their main goal is to exterminate Mankind and take over they're natural resources. Roland put together a very strong story with excellent character development and acting. Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and crew put in star-studded performances. <br/><br/>But like every movie there has to be some things that aren't so good, but lets start off with the good:<br/><br/>1: Acting was amazing and the drama was nice.<br/><br/>2: Special effects in this movie blew everyone's mind on how the future of movies would look and this movie certainly delivers.<br/><br/>3: The action is unbelievably unreal and that what makes this movie stand out.<br/><br/>4: Character development went to most of the main characters.<br/><br/>Now the bad:<br/><br/>1: There were some cheesy moments in the film that irritated me. For example, when the alien tried to break into the President's mind, and it was killed, the President instantly knew the alien's main objective. ""I saw. . . .his thoughts. I saw what they're planning to do."" Sorry that doesn't cut it. There are some of these cheesy moments but they don't cut away the awesomeness of the movie.<br/><br/>2: Little screen time for the actual aliens themselves. You see them almost a total of 15-20 times when the movie is nearly 3 hours. It's OK to have them undercover in their ships and battling the squad planes, but how about a little more interaction themselves.<br/><br/>3: They should have saved this movie until the new millennium. That way it would have looked better and truly overlook every movie hence forth.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is really amazing and it's groundbreaking nature can't possibly be ignored by any SciFi fan. <br/><br/>10/10"

And the scene where Smith is dragging the dead alien through the desert, rambling and gripping about some barbecue.<br/><br/>Bill Pullman certainly wasn't allotted the greatest performance of his career with this so-called provincial presidential role - given a slightly weak and mediocre script he was forced to make do with. Bill is a very fine actor and film star---however this role certainly didn't do him much justice. But again, this tends to happen quite a bit under Hollywood film-making, regardless how much cash producers finance into bigger name projects. Generally it was just the case that millions were bank rolled into what ended up here a mediocre screenplay. Will Smith is given some good characterization to play with, as his adrenalin-pumped, street-witted personification projects. But again, its become his stereo-type with most of the high roller characters he's previously played, and in later films.<br/><br/>Overall -- the action and special effects could have been far better CGI generated, had the producer and crew put more effort into lessening the cheesiness of the alien attack scenes - which from a classic 60's or 70's B movie point of view, probably would be acceptable. But this film is supposed to be modern day. So the half-baked effects do not do it much justice. Very entertaining for the 13 and younger crowd.

And that is why i think this film is so special, it reminds me of my childhood mindset, when America ruled the earth with an iron fist, and i wanted to move to LA to become an movie star.... a rock star, Those dreams have past."

","My husband and I have a 4th of July tradition--after watching the local parade and having a cookout, we go home to watch ""Independence Day"" so it ends just in time to watch the Boston Pops on the Esplanade and fireworks on TV. Like Galadriel's prologue in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I've probably memorized President Whitmore's ""We will not go quietly"" speech--yet another iteration of Shakespeare's ""This day is called the feast of Crispian"" soliloquy/speech.<br/><br/>And now for something completely different...possibility of spoilers ahead for ""ID4"" and other movies.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an alien-invasion movie with rigorous internal logic, this isn't it; try ""Contact"" or ""The War of the Worlds.""<br/><br/>If you're looking for a serious science-fiction movie with inactive humor circuitry, try ""The Andromeda Strain.""<br/><br/>If you're looking for a science-fiction movie with great character development, try Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange""--but don't tell me about your nightmares or PTSD symptoms. I warned you.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a science-fiction movie with an evenly-balanced political world-view, this isn't it. Hmm, which science fiction does? Try ""1984"" (either production), or ""The Matrix,"" or ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or ""Gattaca,"" or ""Equilibrium""--oh, I'm sorry! They're all dystopias; my bad!<br/><br/>If you are looking for a funny, poignant, feel-good science-fiction movie to watch right before ""The 1812 Overture"" and fireworks--this is the movie. My essay's title is a riff on Obi-Wan's subtle Force-filled comment to the storm-trooper: ""These are not the droids you're looking for.""<br/><br/>I read nearly 70 comments posted for ""ID4,"" and I have the feeling that a large number movie watchers and commentators, have either missed the point, didn't catch the details, or just plain Don't Get It.<br/><br/>Firstly, something about David: his father makes a casual remark as they're driving to D.C.: ""eight years at M.I.T. and you're just a cable guy?"" It seems that both Julius and most people have missed the clue-- David's not just a run-of-the-mill cable guy; that should have been evident when he popped the micro-mini directional antenna on the car's roof. I don't know if that's real or just a good prop idea, but I'm sure that, if it weren't a global crisis, the men in black from the NSA and CIA would be visiting David for his antenna after the brouhaha died down.<br/><br/>Also in the You Just Don't Get It department: Did *anyone* notice that David's name is David? Hello?! Small guy outwits a huge, unstoppable force that no one else can beat--does that remind you of anything, like, maybe, Goliath? Or, Sauron gives everyone of importance 'special rings' but forgets the little Hobbits, two of whom are unnoticeable enough to slip into Mordor and destroy the One Ring. Do any of you know what allegory or metaphor means? David's virus is the rock he uses to take down the alien Goliath-- Steve and the alien craft are the slingshot, but they're important.<br/><br/>For the people who complained about a 'human computer virus' infecting an 'alien computer system.' I'm no math or computer whiz, but I do know that to measure and calculate, one has to have numbers, and in prehistoric times, most humans used their digits. And one has to have something that can hold a tool to make things, therefore, hands (and feet, or analogous appendages). If you measure stuff, you need a system to record measurement, and here we go--we use Base 10; if we had 3 fingers and a thumb, we'd use Base 8.<br/><br/>In electronics, there's 0 and 1, two conditions, ON or OFF. Many programming languages exist, but all that code devolves back, is ultimately translated into electronic commands. David's specialty was signal clarity, strength, and the antenna dishes' configuration to receive signals from communications satellites--in abstract terms, encryption-decryption. That's how he discovered the countdown embedded in satellite transmissions--not literally decrypting their code, but finding the *pattern.* For someone to solve a puzzle like that, all one needs is to figure out the base system of the alien computer system; if Congress pays $30,000 for a hammer, then Area 51 probably has a Cray or two for David to run cracking algorithms on, between getting the idea of 'catching a cold' to the officer shooting the soda can off the wing of the alien craft. *We* didn't see the process, and in reality, it'd probably take more time than those people had, but it's a *movie,* and everything gets simplified and compressed; if you want realism, watch a war documentary on the History Channel.<br/><br/>This movie is less about the whole plot and more about scenes setting up events, more about parts than the whole; some people take dominoes or tiles and set them up to fall into complex and pretty patterns, and that's what this movie does. Each scene may be weak, but each falls into the next to create a pretty (or in this case, an explosive) whole. Yes, there *are* clichés--but each scene uses the *right* cliché for the desired emotional effect.<br/><br/>Summer blockbusters aren't meant to make people think, they're meant to get butts into seats and bucks into studio bank accounts. Huge explosions do that; scary aliens, energetic dogfights, last-minute rescues, tear-wringing deaths, and coincidences piled like thick frosting do bring people to the cinemas.<br/><br/>About the dog's stereotypical leap-to-safety: Do you know how many people would have raised a ruckus if the kid's dog was fried in an explosion?! Of course the plucky unmarried mom with a can-do attitude has to have a heroic dog! Of course the dog has to find the First Lady! Of course they're clichés, but they're the *right*cliches for an action-adventure summer blockbuster movie!! For all the weaknesses in plot and characterization, I give ""Independence Day"" 6 of 10 stars; but for the overall whole look, design, and feel (props, miniatures, alien design, casting), I give it 8 of 10 stars."

","This film is a blast to watch, plain and simple. Sure, there isn't a great deal of character development and the plot is very straight forward, but not every movie has to be that way to be awesome. The movie grabs your attention from beginning to end and is very enjoyable throughout. Sure there are some lulls, but the more tense scenes make up for everything and then some. Will Smith is in his classic character here, full of his usual pep and one liners. The others put in good efforts as well, I particularly like Goldblum's role as the cable repairman. The special effects are good, the music is great, and I absolutely adore Bill Pullman's ""independence day"" speech. That alone makes this movie worth watching."

One of the best alien invasion movies ever. Not a buried treasure, this movie is almost as big as Titanic. There's this speech near the end by the President, best damn inspirational speech I ever heard. Made me feel like jumping into a plane and kicking ass with him. Let's talk about the effects for a moment. The CGI was perfect, it looked like there was a giant alien ship menacing Los Angeles and when it fired, it looked like they really destroyed the White House. The aliens were creepy and scary looking design, the most unique monsters I've seen for a long time. A classic science fiction that goes up there with the fifties WAR OF THE WORLDS. I give it...10 STARS!"
"matlefebvre20","5","0","1","16 June 2006"," A movie to love a lot or to spit on
","I know that I've recently written many reviews about sci-fi pics or other special-effects-laden movies and that I've inserted several comparisons with ""Independence Day"", without reviewing the latter movie. Well now, this is a thing of the past and here is my ""ID4"" review.<br/><br/>We can't talk about ""ID4"" without talking about the visual effects involved here. From the beginning, ie. with the arrival of the mother ship above the Moon, till the final battle, which leaves every spaceship destroyed, a lot of laser and missile shots, explosions, eardrum-hurting sounds and other surprises occur.<br/><br/>That's because ""ID4"" primarily is a special-effects machine. These are incredible and harrowing visual effects. I haven't seen this movie in a theater, but I guess it would have shaken the walls and the screen, along with the produced sounds. Sounds are a primordial aspect of the movie. They give to the spaceships a terrifying and monster scream when they come through the atmosphere and hover over the cities (nice wordplay here...). Explosions are eye-catching and the fire waves which break on LA, NYC and Washington are astonishing.<br/><br/>But the problem is you can't do a good movie with over-the-top special effects and a storyline bought in a Dollar Tree store. It's surprising that the movie is called ""Independence Day"" because it itself depends on its visual and sound tricks... Show the example, they say...<br/><br/>With some very iny-tiny exceptions, the storyline and the actors are no more than weak. The story elements are built like in the Bible: they say a lot of things, but they don't give the details about anything. We know the facts, but that's all. For example, we attempt to communicate with the visitors with a helicopter equipped with powerful projectors, which send light spots that are supposed to be some kind of message. What does the sequential message means? It's so cheesy that I guess it's the reason why the aliens shot the copter.<br/><br/>We're introduced to cheap characters into the movie. Jeff Goldblum, best known for his Ian Malcolm appearance in ""Jurassic Park"", is David, a Jewish computer whiz who appears to be the only person in the world who's able to find the aliens' signals, how to interpret them and how to defeat them. It's far from a great performance. He's able to track the signals, while the NASA, the ESA and the different armies are not? Talk about something! Bill Pullman is the President of the United States. He's apparently the youngest president that the country ever had and, as we can hear, he was a fighter pilot during the Gulf War, which occurred only 5 years before the movie was released! Other (cheap) performances include Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an alcoholic ex-fighter pilot in the Nam War, who suffered a post-traumatic incident that makes him believe that he's been abducted by extraterrestrials. Well, guess what? He's about to become the Earth's savior! There is also Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun, an Area 51 scientist who looks like an insane modern Victor Frankenstein, and James Rebhorn, who is the Secretary of Defense, but he acts like if he was in the George W. Bush cabinet, with his words, his ideals and his attitude.<br/><br/>The only actor who delivers a fair performance is Will Smith, who gets his breakthrough role here. He is Captain Steven Hiller, a hot-shot pilot from the El Toro base. He's the most entertaining character of the lot and it's always enjoyable to watch him.<br/><br/>Aliens are briefly described in various parts of the movie. They're mostly a nomad people and their technology is told to be much superior from ours. This is surprising, especially when you watch the end of the movie, when Jeff Goldblum's character is single-handedly able to send a virus into their system. Our technology is already able to produce anti-viruses and theirs is not? Help me, I don't understand...<br/><br/>And finally, let's not forget that patriotic mood that swarms into the movie. It's present from the very first scene, which shows the American flag planted on the Moon's surface, till the very last one with typical fireworks from the Fourth of July's festivities. And among that, you even have the movie's title that's implied into this.<br/><br/>An interesting essay subject for film students, a crowd-pleasing experience and an anti-intellectual presentation. That's what ""ID4"" is. And while it won an Academy Award and became the highest-grossing movie of 1996, there's not a lot to cherish here. But if you just want to get entertained and to escape reality for a moment, ""ID4"" is more efficient than smoking marijuana. And that's enough to justify its existence."

","When released in July, 2 1996, this was slated to be BIG and many people came in wondering what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, I couldn't go to the theater during its entire theatrical run and after I acquired the VHS copy on sale a couple of years later...I really came to regret not seeing it earlier.<br/><br/>10 years later, this movie still delivers the goods. I've seen this so many times, yet I never got bored of it. But why do people rag on it now (and even then for that matter)? Good question, honestly.<br/><br/>I think they need to go back to their little Harry Potter and Shrek 2 movies, because THIS is the definitive blockbuster extravaganza. And not only that, I think it goes a little beyond that as well (and I use the word ""little"" VERY loosely).<br/><br/>This movie had the unforgettable moments (that were parodied or rehashed later on), the incredible acting talent, the clever lines, the then-contemporary music and orchestrated score that still works very well in the movie, the incredibly cool alien designs, the perfect pacing, the very well drawn characters who were all proved integral to the plot, and the dynamic climax!<br/><br/>I won't even bother outlining the plot, since practically everyone reading this knows how it goes anyway. But it was one of those things that was good in theory and even better in execution, no one has made a film like this akin to it until Luc Beeson released the Fifth Element (equally good in my eyes, never got tired of watching that one either).<br/><br/>Since then Emmerich and Devlin went on to create the unforgivable Godzilla (which I thought was good as a kid, but not anymore upon a recent viewing) and so on. But back in the good ol' days, their baby ID4 was one of the good films that made the summer worth waiting for. And to this day, i'm STILL waiting for a GOOD summer blockbuster to come in and entertain the hell out of me ever since the turn of the century. But until then, i'm still watching my classics. <br/><br/>Even when my tape catches itself on fire and burns away in my VCR, I still will never get sick of this movie. As far as i'm concerned, I doubt I ever will either."

","This is one of those entertainment-only movies that often gets a black eye for being something it's not. Hard SciFi this isn't, although its still up a few notches from the 50's SciFi movies that are its historical roots.<br/><br/>Stereotypical or thin characters are required when you have that many actors involved in scenes, although Jeff Goldblum's character, and that of Judd Hirsh as his Dad are quite good. A director makes a choice on the focus, it could follow one character or group of characters and alter the scale to near human dimensions. Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds comes to mind. But more often, particularly if box office receipts are a major concern, it is SciFi as spectacle, and in that realm, Independence Day works very well indeed.<br/><br/>I'm just thankful they didn't include one of those ridiculous scenes where the hero blows up the control panel to open the airlock door. Let's see, design an airlock so when power is removed the door opens and everybody gets sucked into a vacuum. Yeah, that'll work."

","This is what I mean to be a pure action movie.<br/><br/>If you like this genre, in 'Independence Day' you can find all you need to enjoy: large-sized explosions, dogfights, general destruction, great special effects. It has a very good cast, as we can see actors like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Randy Quaid and many more, all of whom are great in their parts. It has great direction, which involves you so much that you would never say runtime is 145 minutes. And finally, David Arnold's original soundtrack is simply wonderful. All of that set on the magnificent background of aliens' invasion. It also shows important values, as fighting against difficulties never giving up, a value that is progressively fading away in actual society.<br/><br/>Most people condemn that movie calling it 'A typical American action movie', I reply them just to put their brain out of window and think to enjoy. There are movies supposed to make think and grow, and movies supposed just to entertain. This is one of them. Without enjoy life is gloomy.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is one of the best movies of the decade, a milestone in the field of action cinema."

It was a fun movie, definitely, had it's comic relief, it's quirks, it's action, it's good lines, it's 'bad' lines, but overall, it wasn't an epic movie. I have it in my collection, and wouldn't mind throwing it on here and there, but it wouldn't be a must-have-if-I-was-trapped-on-an-island type movie. Actually, no, it would be. Why? Because it's a really good movie, and BECAUSE it's not an epic, you can watch it more than once without feeling an overabundance of 'epicness'. I can't watch Lord of the Rings too often, because it's really long, but also, it's too much to take in casually.

This dedication is even mentioned in the intro credits of the DVD. So from that perspective, the film is outstanding. It has the perfect blend of corn and context realism.<br/><br/>The special effect are extremely well done. You can believe the White House and other major buildings explode in billows of fire, because large-scale models really ARE being filmed as they're pulverized. And the ingenious fire setup (explained in a DVD extra) makes the scenes convincing because it's real fire. There's no fakey looking CGI here that detracts from credibility.<br/><br/>I think more people would enjoy the film if they'd view it for what it was intended to be."

What's up with that?<br/><br/>My score: 6/10.<br/><br/>Above, it's a 5. I didn't want to be on the ""Hated List"" so I gave as low a score as I could. I do NOT love this move, nor do I hate it."

It's great to watch for the first time, and the second viewing often has the same effect.

Leopards never change their spots and no matter how hard he tries Will Smith, like Richard Thomas will forever be identified as 'John-Boy' (from 'The Waltons), Larry Hagman will always be known as 'J.R', (from 'Dallas'), Elizabeth Montgomery could never escape the appellation of Samantha (from 'Bewitched'), will never be anything more in life than the Fresh Prince Prince of Belair. He is after all a goof-ball ham. He destroyed Robert Conrad's prideful series reputation of the original 'Wild Wild West' with his purely irreverent mockery of the 'Wild Wild West (1999)'. Robert Conrad personally accepted the Razzie Awards for that despicable turkey of a movie to express his disgust about what was done to his source material by the Prince. Sources seem to differ who has top billing for 'Independance Day', the Prince or Bill Pullman. Even the TV Guides on cable indicate the Prince has top billing so I didn't want to watch the movie. I did finally watch this movie on cable with great apprehension and preparing to barf at another performance by the Prince, but I was not disappointed. The Prince was heavily surrounded with such real talent during the movie that his presence in the movie didn't have a deleterious affect. United States Marine Officers do not swagger down the flight line. They do not whine and have tantrum. The Prince's impersonation of a Marine office was no less shameful and irreverent as his movie the 'Wild Wild West (1999)'."
"craigstealsheep","8","0","1","22 November 2005"," Misunderstood
","My, doesn't that title sound like a pop album. Anyway, this movie was misunderstood. First and foremost, it is a movie. Yes, it is unbelievable, but it is a movie! Second, America is usually considered the strongest country in the world, which I'm sure will be getting many arguments there, and the movie was made in (gasp) America, so naturally the focus would be in America. When you see a British film, where does it tend to take place? Uh... Britian? And who tends to be the protagonist? A British guy? Now, I know this may shock many people, but this was a good movie. It was very entertaining, suspenseful, and actually pretty clever (for what it was, don't worry). The special effects were amazing, and the acting was bearable (which is all you need in an action movie). They weren't trying to make a deep, philosophical movie, or important one for that matter. No, they were trying to make a movie. A summer blockbuster, and that is all. They exceeded that and made one that is still remembered 5 1/2 years later. Now tell me that isn't something. Name another movie from 1996 off the top of your head. I'd have to think about it, but this would be the first one to come to mind.<br/><br/>Everyone probably knows the story by now, but just in case: Aliens invade Earth and blow the crap out of everything in existence there, well, except for some pretty people, and the world must stand against them. This movie does include other countries, granted it is for one scene, but many like this don't as if America is the only country in the world, i.e. Mars Attacks. The Americans have an alien ship, via the Roswell incident, and because of this, CD's and those crazy com-put-er things were invented. But also because of this, Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum (who is the best actor in the movie, I don't care what you say, he seems more like a real person than Will Smith or Bill Pullman, and he is a good actor. Oh no! This Craig guy is crazy for thinking that!) fly the ship to the mother ship, which is above the moon, and blow it up with a nuke. It is not the virus that destroys it, it is the nuclear missile that is shot inside of the ship. The virus just shut down the shields.<br/><br/>The virus: It actually does make sense. The aliens took over using the satellites that we had for TV and such, so everything involved with them was not working well. Because they were using the satellites, all Jeff Goldblum had to do was hack into the satellite and that would let him into the alien's internet provider (which, ironically, was Earthlink) and give them a direct connection. So they emailed a virus to the aliens and bam! it destroyed their systems. Ever had a virus? It can be that bad. I believe Jeff went into the future and got the real Y2K virus, not the one that actually went out, the one in the crappy TV movie that made computers explode into people's faces and kill them. So the virus, which could have just as easily been uploaded by a PC, made their computers crash. The Technical guys could not come in time to fix it, because all they had was a few minutes to fix the computers, and they had to have their Starbucks or their day would just suck. And then, BOOM! Jeff and Will barely escape before the big explosion, Earth wins, and a firework show ends the movie. The End."

Everyone should watch this movie. It's the best!!!!!!!!"

","I like disaster movies which involve cities whose landmarks I can recognise, and especially ones involving stuff falling from the sky. I also like stories involving aliens (regardless of credibility). Therefore, despite various silly bits, I do enjoy Independence Day.<br/><br/>My main criticism: Patricia (President's daughter) does not react to the violence and horror surrounding her. I don't think we even see a tear in her eye. Does she get upset when her mother doesn't reappear as planned? No. Does she get upset when her mother dies? No. Okay, this is meant to be a feel-good movie overall, but as the other characters get into their emotions, why can't she?<br/><br/>My other criticism is the neatness/coincidence factor, where Jasmine stays at the bombed base, Steve goes to the base - ta-da, reunited! And Jasmine just happened to rescue the First Lady. Oh, I bet Mr President was pleased by that! (Does Steve get to be a NASA dude now? He deserves some kind of reward!) I know these points are trivial really - Patricia is not a major character and the Steve-and-Jasmine thing is an important part of the heart-swelling, tear-jerking atmosphere - so I should stop whining and just enjoy the film, yeah? I think the aliens are great - just scary enough, shades of 'Alien' (or rather, HR Geiger) in their design. Also a bit repulsive (the tentacles) so we can go ""ewww!"" with a clean conscience.<br/><br/>There are probably deep meanings in this film, ""a moral of the story"", but I can't be bothered finding them. It's a ""good guys win"" vehicle, with a bit of American patriotism thrown in (they'd have to, given where most of the action takes place). It's good fun, and for this film I don't mind the soppy happy ending."

","This is good dumb fun, however i was quite disappointed, as it's way too long for it's own good, but the performances and special effects were awesome!. All the characters are great, and the story while dumb is not too shabby, plus Will Smith is simply amazing in this!. All the characters were very likable, and there are some very exciting scenes, however it did have a few dull spots, and it just went way too long for it's own good, plus it gets a bit tiring after a while. There are tons of explosions and cool looking Aliens to enjoy, and i thought the ending was pretty cool as well, plus Bill Pullman was just fantastic as the president!. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum had very good chemistry together, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, plus the finale while exciting is also a bit too long for it's own good. This is a film made to please the audiences, not to really be praised by critics or to win Oscars, and i found the opening to be just great, plus there are plenty of laughs to be had as well. This is good dumb fun, however i was quite disappointed, as it's way too long for it's own good, but the special effects and performances are awesome!, and i say it's well worth the watch!. The Direction is good for the most part. Roland Emmerich does a good job here for the most part here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other awesome shots as well, however the pace is terribly inconsistent. The Acting is awesome!. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, had very good chemistry with Jeff Goldblum, is very charismatic, had some very cool lines, and he is just so good at this role, this is the role that really got him noticed! (Smith Rules!!!). Bill Pullman is fantastic as the president, he is very funny did not take himself seriously, and as a result was a lot of fun to watch!, i loved him. Jeff Goldblum is great in his role, he had a cool delivery and was just utterly fascinating to watch!. Judd Hirsch is quite funny as i rather liked him. Robert Loggia is wonderful as always,and did a wonderful job as the General i just wished he had more to do. Margaret Colin is beautiful and does fine with what she had to do, she did a good job. Vivica A. Fox is hot and did great as Smith's girlfriend and also had good chemistry with him i liked her a lot. Randy Quaid plays another one of his great kooky roles and he excelled perfectly once again he was great!. James Rebhorn is great as the sleaze ball i hated him and cheered out loud when Pullman fired his ass!. Adam Baldwin is just there he does OK, did not really have much of a part. Giuseppe Andrews(Troy Casse),Lisa Jakub(Alicia Casse),James Duval(Miguel Casse),Ross Bagley(Dylan Dubrow),Mae Whitman(Patricia Whitmore),Mary McDonnell(First Lady Marilyn Whitmore),Harry Connick Jr.(Captain Jimmy Wilder),all do what they have to do well.

","Okay, well, perhaps it does suck. At least, as far as things important to other films, such as acting and plot, go. But that would be if this movie were ""Lost in Translation."" This ain't ""Lost in Translation."" This is a buy your popcorn, sit your behind down, and prepare for a mind-numbing assault on your senses that will have you screaming like a primitive caveman during the final battle sequence type of movie. This is ""Independence Day."" Sure, you have to suspend reality quite a bit, when you consider things like: 1) A Marine fighter pilot dating a stripper and the two of them living a ""normal"" suburban life with her son in Orange County. 2) The President of the United States and a strung-out drunk climbing into F/A-18s to blow the aliens away. 3) A mid-90s Macintosh PowerBook logging into a sophisticated alien network that probably has better than 2,048 bit encryption. But watching that ragtag wing of F/A-18 Hornets and F-16 Fighting Falcons blow the hell out of the alien battleship over Nevada at the end of the movie is worth every hole in the plot. Watching Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum light up cigars as they blow the mothership away is worth every moment of stiff acting (although we could've done without Goldblum's reprise of the ""Must go faster, must go faster"" line from Jurassic Park). So there you go. If you're a movie snob, this one isn't for you. But if you're a true fan of the movies, you will love this movie from the opening shot of Neil Armstrong's footprints being shaken away to the ending images of burning alien battleships across the planet."

","This movie, as correctly perceived as a modern ""War of the Worlds"", still has me glued to the TV whenever it is on. The plot and FX are especially good even though the movie is riddled with errors during its making. The choice of actors really worked for this movie.<br/><br/>Some people outside of the United States have not seen it as just entertainment unfortunately. Considering the movie was made with American dollars and in Hollywood, would it not make sense that the heroes would be American? Should they have been from the Nederlands (a fine country, by the way)? Wherever a film industry is located the heroes represent that country. Should Mad Max have been Chinese?<br/><br/>From a pure point of entertainment ""independence Day"" satisfies.

","This has got to be one of the best survival of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Lots of action, drama and romance. The speech given by the President in this movie is so moving that it gives me goose bumps even to this day, every time I watch it. It is patriotic and shows that even in the adversity of an alien invasion the President uses every available weapon to protect our country. He is a great example that the current and future presidents should follow. I know this is just a dream for a president to actually act like a hero. But, we are all allowed to dream aren't we? I recommend that this movie be watched by everyone in every language. It is vitally important that we face the fact that someday our whole world is going to be in danger and we will have to work together to overcome our mutual enemy. Something similar is happening right now that is a prime example of this with terrorists attacking all over the world. We need to work together to stop the bombings and bring peace to the world."

"finglonger24000","8","0","1","23 July 2005"," A surprisingly good alien epic
","I found Independence Day to be a complete treat. It was surprisingly good alien epic that I have hardly ever seen. The fair script and the good acting carry the film.<br/><br/>It starts off with city sized alien ships that come to earth from the moon and hover above Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles. The cities erupt in horror, and by nightfall, the ship destroy the city with giant laser blasts.<br/><br/>Its an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end. A story about the world putting away their differences for a worthy cause: to stop the aliens. Its something you don't see these days.<br/><br/>There were several clichés in the film too. Like Will Smith being able to learn how to drive an alien cruiser just after seeing how they maneuver in battle. I thought that that was kind of stupid.<br/><br/>But the graphics were spectacular. its easy to see how the film won the Oscar for best graphics. And the aliens, which aren't computer animated, were cool and believable. But you never really get a good look at them (but its was the same in Signs). Its spooky at times as well.<br/><br/>Its also politically incorrect. The cliché of U.S.A. saving the world is funny and a little predictable.<br/><br/>But if you can't like this film, filled with epic aerial battle scenes and emotional scenes. Its extremely likable, sad, and original. I would recommend seeing it just for the incredible story and where it drags out to a great finale.<br/><br/>So no, its not the best movie ever, but its a damn good one all the same."

I know that it is just another Americanised movie where the U.S. defeats the enemy, but the special effects, the realism of the aliens and the use of Area 51 is just brilliant.<br/><br/>At the time of the movies' release, Will Smith's character was well played, but watching it again today, his character annoys me a bit. He plays the typical black man with an attitude problem. Stereotyped in my opinion. The actor that steals the film for me is Jeff Goldblum. His character is witty yet heroic. This performance helps the film become more realistic in the sense of his ability to act. The film doesn't just rely on special effects."

","I enjoyed this movie, however, I felt it was nothing more than a modernized remake of ""The War of the Worlds"" from 1953 starring Gene Barry. Many of the plot themes in both movies are similar, if not the same. There is the issue of atomic weapons which is the same in both movies. The results were identical. The issue of the common cold in the 1953 movie has been replaced with a computer virus in Independence Day. I hope the 2005 version of ""War of the Worlds"" backs me up and that people who never saw the 1953 movie won't think that the new ""War of the Worlds"" is a remake of Independence Day, which, of course, it isn't."

After the invasion, Earth, led by the United States, has no choice but to fight back. their first attempts failed, but the presence a computer virus renews their hope for survival as the countdown for 4 July-- US Independence Day-- begins.<br/><br/>Super-lick, witty sci-fi movie pulls out all stops. The all-too-familiar Alien Invasion plot is revived with a series of twists thanks to the eye-popping, Award-winning special effects (the spaceships are flawless!). The 3 leading characters steal the show and make the movie fluid and likable. David Arnold's unforgettable and sweeping score also contributes positively to the film's atmosphere (leading to nominations in a number of institutions). Randy Quaid is hilarious as the alcoholic Vietnam vet volunteering in the fight against the invaders. It also manages to sidestep Sci-fi clichès since there is NO single leading character that show the way to battle the Aliens.<br/><br/>But there are flaws as well: the human stories are very dumb and sometimes nonsensical; the movie is overlong and takes a while to get started, and the over-the-top patriotism in this movie sometimes gives the movie a slightly cartoonish feel. There is a high number of needlessly stupid and flat supporting characters.<br/><br/>Despite of that, the movie became the most successful movie of 1996, earning more than $300 million in the US and over $500 million worldwide.

Let's go back to the two-year period between V, (miniseries 1983,) the Visitors, cannibalistic lizards from another planet, many light-years from Earth, how many? We don't know. Come to Earth presumably on a mission of peace. Their giant mother ships appear in the sky all over the world. Los Angeles is where the first miniseries is set. It's also the setting for one of the most ludicrous scenes in the movie Independence Day. That scene has them all up on the roof of L.A.'s tallest building to greet the aliens. One of them, only identified as ""Elvis Fanatic,"" says the following: ""Oh god I hope they bring back Elvis!"" We know what happens after that. Every city on Earth, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles, is destroyed. El Toro, a Marine Corps Air Station, is destroyed. Captain Steven Hiller is shot down by an alien over the Grand Canyon. In one scene, he's trying to get him off his six, and threads the needle with his F/A-18 Hornet. Hiller loses his plane, but the alien that shot him down loses his ship, so it's a fair trade. For most of the film, Will Smith is seen dragging the alien through the desert to Area 51. Since the '90s were a time of militia activity, most people cheered when the White House was destroyed. The aliens are defeated by a computer virus written on an Apple laptop, as pointed out in another review, and Russell Casse, the crop duster who claimed to have been abducted by aliens, carries a nuclear missile straight into the belly of the alien ship after Hiller and Levinson get out of Dodge. Casse is on a suicide mission. America saves the day because America's the only country to bring the nations of the world together. How do does America do it?

","Sometimes it's hard not liking a movie even though it has so many things to dislike. ""Independence Day"" is one of those movies.<br/><br/>I remember when the trailer came out for this movie. It was one of the best trailers i'd seen back then. Simply because it really made med want to see the movie. Everything about it just seemed so cool. And i guess when i saw it at the theater i was not disappointed. It was a fun ride. And seeing it now a couple of years later i may not enjoy it as much as i did, but i can sure understand why i enjoyed it the first time around.<br/><br/>Because let's face it. Plausibility is exceptionally low here. Goofs are present in almost every shot. The dialog is a joke, the characters are caricatures and the plot is basically ""War of the worlds"" moved to present day. But still, like a video game that may be stupid but can still entertain this is not so bad. Admittedly though the movie loses most of it's entertainment value as it slows down toward the end. But up until then it's a lot of fun.<br/><br/>It feels like most people who disliked this movie did so for rather strange reasons. It seems they expected something completely different from what they got. This is a classic matinée movie about peoples fear of the unknown. A classic genre no matter if the unknown factor is Aliens or Russians or whatever. This movie is not trying to be smart, only entertaining. And while the dosage of dull and pompous American self-pride is a little too high, it still manages to rise above it and entertain most of the time.<br/><br/>And when i see a movie like this one i first and foremost want to be entertained.

","The Will Smith reign of terror, errr, i mean reign at the 4th of July Weekend box office began with this modest little movie, Independence Day. One of the most expensive, yet financially successful movies of all time, Independence Day proves that you can remake a movie without anyone knowing it. In case you have not heard of it, the movie War of the Worlds from the 1950s is the inspiration of this aliens-will-take-over-the-world story, whether anyone knew it or not. Will Smith plays a Captain in some branch of the military, I want to say Air Force, but it's not really important, Jeff Goldblum is a cable TV repair man who is the only one in the world to crack the alien code (a fact that is not lost on his father, played by Judd Hersch), Bill Pulman plays the president who was elected president because of his heroism in the Gulf War, and Randy Quaid plays an alcoholic crop duster who claims he as abducted by aliens, possibly to find out what makes the Quaids just so talented. The movie follows a simple formula, aliens invade, great looking special effects show Los Angeles, Washington, and of course New York get blow'd up real good, then humanity comes together to find a way to blow the aliens up real good. The special effects are first rate, the acting is solid, but the ending is really silly and is perhaps the most direct homage or rip-off of The War of the Worlds. The most clever part of the movie is the use of Area 51, which I thought was original and could have been the start to a good sci-fi movie, but instead was just a gimmick to the rest of the formula. This is a solid popcorn movie, people will enjoy it, but let's not start looking for awards for Independence Day."

","The Motion Picture Independence Day was a film that wanted to be liked so badly that it bordered on absurdity,however as a film it possessed enough air head possibilities to make it the highest grossing film for the year 1996.This blockbuster film was not so much a film about aliens and the possibility of life existing elsewhere other than the planet earth but about what would occur if indeed these creatures were more advanced and could time travel and almost the whole family show up on the Fourth of July.I was one of the many persons who learning of the extreme blockbuster status that this movie gathered in the theaters went to see what it was about.There is perhaps good reason why reviews<br/><br/>never get written and indeed I had to think about this blockbuster film to decide if it was worth writing a review.Iam still not so certain that it is worth much of a say outside of the near hysterical non-sense that we get bowled over by,sufficient enough to pick our pockets in exchange for a afternoon at the movies.One of the by products of this relatively new advent of the whole community writing a review about these pictures is that we are encouraged to participate in the activities and become if you will a contributor to its well being.Iam not so certain that such contributions are worthwhile and indeed it is not even the participation which is unwholesome but the fact that there is a very real underpinning to all this that borders on a shameful illusion and it only provides for a lie that gets its way.Some of the problem to judging this film like the motion picture itself, is the value that it provides for,which is not only suggestive but as well unsupported.The boastful goings on of the film are showy and indicate a look at me mentality,however that not withstanding,it isn't where the fault is,it is in the assumption that we all care and that everyone from all around the world is paying attention to the Americans.The undesirable prospect is if that be true then there is reason why this film is so worldly and that is because it wants to be certain that it is noticed and indeed viewed by as many as can be gotten into the theaters.The Gross Figures indicate somewhere around 340 million dollars,second to none for the year.There is an illustration provided as to this films coercive abilities in the two columns along the side of the page.There is a goofs column and a factual/details column and much more.I have never seen so many different errors,details,and goofs at all and yet it sold like a barn on fire.The leveling off is this,the picture provided for a unreasonable assumption that in a manner of speaking was awarded for the ability to do so in its special effects.It does this by creating an idea of importance that some 70 different news broadcasts were used as a means to coerce public opinion,and that if you will is something like a picture within a picture The definition as to the cause effect of the press core and its influence is said to be the equivalent of the event occurring even as suggested only on a television screen.The real point is just how much does so much influence,really influence our daily lives.What in fact is reality?Were paying for it,we certainly have the right to know.This consequence due to non-sense is further highlighted with a series of other questions.The picture being a unsupported position can then be asked what is being encouraged if the premise as to the film is ridiculous? For one thing boasting and showing off and for another,power over another is assumed.That is both blatant in its underpinning as well as seductive.The seduction is provided in the scene where the female who is a exotic dancer is preparing to marry Capt.Hillard.She does a seductive zip my dress up with her angel,who is no more than maybe 9 or 10 years old.I think that that kind of suggestion is inappropriate even bordering on improper.Little boys like Little girls are innocent and though it is suggested that the girls grow up faster then boys,it is the boys who are rebellious. That scene is mean as it is suggestive and even provocative because parents should know better and when they do not provide for the child some moral fiber as to conduct they allow for a fast lane idea which allows a deviate basis as to conduct.Though there is more to suggest all I can say that deviant conduct is not about sexual proclivities it is about crime and a problem in society,all stemming from the child's upbringing.This is not a simple idea and neither is what this film is selling.Hollywood is not such that we should know these back-lots and warehouses lest we stumble upon the next academy award. The special edition provided for the actor Harvey Fierstien making like a Pink Flamingo and planting one on Jeff Goldblum,to everyones surprise.Its not too cool and Iam glad it wasn't the special edition that aired in the theaters.It is difficult to judge performance however the main stay of the film seemed to have actors playing parts but that was the jest of it-It was not much more than that and though this may not mean anything it always seemed that when suggestions were finally set in motion they were objected to inappropriately and out of time.There is a disjointed idea about importance,honesty and this picture and never the twain shall meet.Iam not kidding this really is a very stupid film.The timing and appropriateness of certain comments seemed to be emphasized when the aliens are closing in on closing us out and then we learn that we knew all about them.I don't know but things just had a hard time adding up-the aforementioned columns with the errors and details perhaps will shed some light on all the problems this film exhibited."

One of my main complaints is there are too many characters, just like in disaster movies from the 70's. Problem with the characters is that the creators try to create a story around all of them with as a result needless plot lines and uninteresting situations.<br/><br/>The actors are below average.

","I have seen this movie upwards of 100 times and love it more every time. Just today though, i watched it and noticed a recognizable face among the extras.  In the scene where connie and the president are standing on the front of the white house and he says ""we need to address the nation, there's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there"" and she replies ""Yeah, I'm one of 'em.""  In this scene, the actor standing directly behind connie has appeared somewhere else that I cannot place.  He has no speaking lines in this movie.  Who is he and why do I know him?  (If it's any help, i have the feeling he plays the father on some TV show or in some movie, maybe a disney channel movie or something).  By the way, this movie is awesome and anyone who says otherwise clearly is not worthy of presenting his/her opinion."
"Inishere","Null","0","1","7 March 2004"," I wish I had only seen it once
","I thought 'Independence Day' was hugely entertaining when I first saw it, but I find more flaws in it each time I see it again.  I'll leave aside how Devlin & Emmerich thumb their noses at the laws of physics.  Instead, I'll focus on three gaping plot holes, plus how the humans react to their last-gasp victory.    <br/><br/>1) Nobody has a clue about the existence of the alien mother ship until its with spitting distance of Earth.  But how could astronomers have missed an object with a mass 1/4 that of our Moon lumbering its way through the solar system?  Plus, all the radio telescopes out there would have picked up that alien static well before that. 2) The nations of the earth respond to the attack by launching jet fighters. But where are the cruise missiles & bombers?  You don't risk a pilot's life with one, and you get a bigger bang with the other.  Not that they would have penetrated the aliens' shields either, but it looks like we're fighting with one hand tied behind our back. 3) Levinson's computer virus cripples the shields long enough for the good guys to prevail.  But if the parts of a Mac & PC are incompatible, wouldn't the aliens' systems and any virus cooked up here be more so?  I know its a tribute to H.G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds', where common bacteria wipes out the Martians, but that doesn't change things.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I now find it so hollow as to be scarier than all the sights of destruction earlier in the movie.  The music swells as all the characters are beaming with pride, while looking at the ruins of one of those 15-mile wide 'city destroyers'.  I think a more fitting ending would have been for the cheering to die down, and everyone to stare ahead wearily. They recall now that hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people are dead.  All of the trappings of our civilization are crumpled to dust.  Life will be a struggle to survive for years to come.  And, perhaps, someone could voice regret that our fallen enemies could be so mentally advanced, and so morally backward.  <br/><br/>But such an ending would not jibe with the summer popcorn flick Devlin & Emerson set out to create, I guess."

","(This review contains one or two spoilers, but I'm sure you've all seen the movie anyway.)<br/><br/>With a massive budget, massive special effects and massive spaceships, Independence Day is a massive turkey. This movie is pretty much two hours of jingoistic flag waving, patriotic fervour and really really really annoying scenes of stupid people saluting one another.<br/><br/>The stereotyped characters do little to save this either. Judd Hirsch is little more than embarassing as a typical elderly Jewish world-weary type of guy, and Bill Pullman must be the most expressionless President since George Bush Jnr. The very talented Will Smith tries his best but when the script has him punching an alien in the desert and then muttering some banal dialogue you just know that this is an extremely BAD movie.<br/><br/>From a logical point of view, it defies belief. Here we have Jeff Goldblum (who plays Hirsch's son) managing to figure out the alien's plan for world domination all by himself because he plays chess quite a lot. Also, the Empire State Building is demolished by the aliens and the resulting out-of-control fire is stopped by one female character simply closing a door. Area 51 is shown, and conveniently has a recovered alien space ship which crashed years earlier, and of course Goldblum and Smith figure out how to pilot it without reading any alien manuals. The list goes on.<br/><br/>But the real problem with this movie, as I've mentioned, is the ridiculous level of patriotism shown. It's almost as if the Americans are trying to remind all of us that they are the great super-power, and they'll always be there to save us should 15-mile wide spaceships happen to appear in the skies. As with ""Armaggedon"" there are endless shots of the American flag, predictably nauseating scenes of wholesome Americans huddled around radios and of course that old American stand-by, the endless rounds of people saluting each other.<br/><br/>Judging by some of the other comments on here, even Americans are slightly weary of this movie, which really says it all."

","ID4 is ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" with a budget.  But it also owes a great deal to any number of other, earlier alien-peril/sky-fi flicks. Most obvious among these is ""The War of the Worlds,"" including the unsuccessful use of the Bomb and the ultimate demise of the invaders by means of a virus (albeit a computer virus this time).  ""ID4"" also borrows from the ""Star Wars"" saga, mainly the massive dogfight battles and an against-all-odds, intrusive attack on the Death Star-esque mothership.  <br/><br/>Despite the spectacle of the destruction of entire cities, the movie is tremendously upbeat.  Ironically (since director/co-writer Roland Emmerich is from Germany), ""ID4"" celebrates a lot of traditional American values: bravery, heroism, self-sacrifice, helping one another in the face of disaster, resourcefulness, love, loyalty, faith, the Bomb and the reluctance to use it, marriage, family--and ham radio.  Emmerich also showed a similar grasp of basic Americana in ""The Patriot,"" though his remake of ""Godzilla"" is about as non-Japanese as could be imagined.  <br/><br/>Predictably, a great many critics sneered at the movie for its embrace of such ""old-fashioned"" values.  They preferred that summer's ""other"" alien-invasion flick, ""The Arrival.""  See my comments about that turkey for my take on why that was the case."

","I have heard many people ripping into Independence Day as one of the worst films that they have seen in a long time, I disagree. In 1997 the film won an Academy Award for best visual effects, and was nominated for sound. For the time the CGI in this film was amazing, and the sound wasn't too bad, the nominations and awards were deserving. The film was also the movie that basically launched Will Smith's carreer into stardom, that says something too. I am having to write a college paper on the movie, which has caused me to watch the movie three times in one day, and I must say that the acting hold through the entire movie, and the storyline isn't as bad as one might initally think, The President isn't overly agressive, and violent minded, the aliens are obviously greatly superior, and there isn't too much time taken in Star Trek style explaining, rather the problems are shown to be solved or explained within the natural dialouge. Yeah, there are holes in the story, yeah this isn't the greatest movie ever made, and yeah some of the dialouge is corny, but remember it's an action movie, and made to be fun, not groundbreaking or earth shattering, just fun. And as a fun movie it has succeeded, when I saw Independence Day in theaters it was the last movie I ever saw where the audience actually cheered, when people cheer for characters how can it all be bad, besides, it's no Battlefield Earth..."

","It's been a long time now since Independence Day was released, and indeed a long time since I first saw it, and I have since seen it at least three more times. Each time I watch it I can't help but enjoy it but, increasingly so, also can't help but laugh at the triteness of it all. While it is essentially a fantasy story about fighting for your life and winning, it is all SO cute, and SO perfect, and SO convenient that you can never take it seriously.<br/><br/>Obviously, it doesn't ask to be taken seriously but there are certain parts that really make you cringe. Firstly, I have to say that, as an Australian, I find it a little ludicrous the central American-ism of it all. Naturally I would assume that, if aliens were to invade Earth, our survival would most likely rely on the US, but I don't feel that the movie deals with the rest of the world in a large-enough scale. It does mention Australia, and England, and the Iraqi desert at times, but only briefly, and completely inconsequentially, and I always think that if they wanted to include them at all, they could have delved slightly more deeply into international cooperation and communication, or otherwise just omit it entirely and just leave it to implication that the entire planet is under threat. As it occurs, the references and brief scenes just come off as tokenism and it's frankly quite annoying.<br/><br/>But apart from that little irk that gets me every time, the film is entertaining escapism. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum and Randy Quaid make enjoyably unlikely heroes, while Bill Pullman pulled off, to me at least, a surprisingly good performance as the President. And it is enjoyable and it is triumphant and it does leave you with a good feeling, so at the end of the day, what else really matters?<br/><br/>I just thought I'd put my thoughts to the keyboard.

I remember the first time I saw it in a theater in '96, and I fully admit that my friends and I had a blast.  The action was great, the characters were likable, and even the humor was cute.<br/><br/>Plus, ID was one of the first to really effectively use the theme of massive disaster.  The audience was glued to the screen watching New York and Washington get devastated, overwhelmed by the destruction and loss of life. Looking back and seeing all the copycat films of late, it's actually quite emotionally exploitive, but hey, ID gets credit for being one of the first to do it well.<br/><br/>All in all, I give Independence Day an imdb 6: worth watching at least once."

Perfectly reasonable behavior by the guards, considering what's going on in the movie. Will Smith has an alien in the back of a truck, and he vigorously pulls back the covering on the alien to let the guards know he is demanding passage. The guards, of course, recoil from the sight. As they drive on, Smith dismisses the guards with a wave, and a ""Get the hell out the way!"" For one thing, a Marine Corps Officer would never, never, ever, ever treat enlisted Marines in this way, especially Marines simply trying to do their jobs. I had difficulty getting past this scene. What the hell is the purpose of crap like this? Maybe this was to improve Will Smith's pseudo tough-guy persona?

Duh!<br/><br/>Beyond the throwback quality of the film, it really had all you could want in a Summertime flick: comedy, action, major special effects and even pathos!<br/><br/>My only real gripes with the film were (1) how Jeff Goldblum arrived at his solution to the problem and became an instant alien spacecraft expert, and (2) Judd Hirsch's stereotypic Jewish performance.<br/><br/>I watch this film whenever I need a lift and it never fails to do so."

","INDEPENDENCE DAY is also instantly forgettable, yet another disposable summer movie with little staying power. It gets off to a relatively engaging start, and the alien destruction of various US landmarks is fun to see. Too bad the rest is merely mechanical without the necessary human interest to keep us involved. Hostile aliens traveling in city-sized spaceships have entered our atmosphere and have made rubble of New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Houston, etc. If they keep this up, Clovis will be the largest American city left standing. Scientists must figure out a way to penetrate the spaceships' invisible shields before the entire planet is leveled and civilization destroyed. Not much has changed since the 1950s when planet Earth had to battle unfriendly visitors in INVADERS FROM MARS and WAR OF THE WORLDS. The special effects are, for the most part, more impressive, though some still look a tad cheesy. Jeff Goldblum seems stuck in his JURASSIC PARK mode, but generates a few laughs as a jittery scientist. Judd Hirsch, who is terribly miscast, is most annoying as Jeff's fretting father. Likable Bill Pullman is very sketchy as the US president, and Will Smith (at the time this movie is made) is far too lightweight to register as a he-man action hero. The finale with peoples around the world celebrating the US victory over the aliens is only slightly less jingoistic than NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games."

I guess they were impressed with the effects and a very ominous trailer(which notoriously explodes the White House). But Roland Emmerich, whose sci-fi duds include ""Stargate"" and the wretched remake of ""Godzilla"", hasn't learned much.  Hopefully, his box-office bomb ""Godzilla"" knocked some sense into him.  By the way, if it wasn't for Will Smith, this film would have sunk before it was up.  The most human characters in the movie are actually the aliens!  If our world was inhabited by characters as silly, ignorant, and stupid as the ones in this movie, you wouldn't blame the aliens for wanting to destroy it.  To get through this, you have to ignore the plot and acting, and enjoy the amazing special effects.  However, ignoring a literally plotless plot, without memorable(I meant to say likeable) characters can get a bit trying after a while.  Oh, and if you did happen to like this, that doesn't mean you'll necessarily like ""Godzilla""!"

","The plot is enough to attract anyone to this film. Back in 96, this was really fantastic movie. Now, in 99, it was just your basic big budget Hollywood popcorn movie. I wasn't into analyzing movies back then and thought this was one of the best movies ever made. Looking back on it, and having knowledge of the real SETI program and countless other space scientists, I found it to be an implausible, inaccurate, and unreal flick. But it's sci-fi, so it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>But my comment could be used in how the filmmakers forget their own logic and use it to advantage: referring to the chase scene in the Grand Canyon. If the ships had shields, how could a parachute penetrate? And in that very first dogfight, the alien ships preformed excellent maneuvers. In the second, when they really needed it, they just stood still and blew up. And you'd think with an alien colony as advanced, as they were, they'd have developed virus protection. Of course, if they did we'd have no movie.<br/><br/>But aside from the plot holes and flaws, the fxs were something to watch. I think it was directed well, but needed a few rewrites and a better look into characters and development. I'm not even gonna get into Godzilla. That was just their worst work.

","**1/2 out of *****<br/><br/>I discovered something about Devlin and Emmerich with Stargate that I confirmed with ID4 and Godzilla...their films start with good suspense, but they reach a point in wich their products take a dive into the deep oblivion of cliches. They start writing their scripts by thinking of a movie with epic proportions, but by the time they get to the third act, they have made such a mess of the story that they don´t know how to finish it and think of an extremely desperate resolution.<br/><br/>ID4 trailers were amazing. To me, it was the must-see movie of the year. And the movie starts with the beat of a rock music track. Devlin and Emmerich knew how to capture a sense of reality on the scenes of the chaos and fear the arrival of spaceships the size of cities would cause. Even the cities´destruction scenes were amazing, but after that, the movie failed to surprise me. And the lines! What´s wrong with you guys?: ""The clock is ticking"" ""Time´s up"" ""Now that´s what I call a close encounter"" ""You know how I like to make an entrance""<br/><br/>Here in Mexico, we call those kind of lines...""Gringadas"" But I know it´s unfair to blame all americans for the things a reduced group of people do. I usually reply: ""Why is Mexico never included when something happens in a worldwide level movie?"" I´m glad we weren´t included on this one. At least the thought of being one of the few countries that weren´t destroyed, makes me think it´s really good to be a small country after all.<br/><br/>Then I tried to visualize The President Of The United States aboard a fighting airplane defending his country... Hard to imagine. There´s also one point of the movie that troubles me... With all that technology, wouldn´t the aliens have an anti-virus for a simple human computer virus? Kind of ilogical, isn´t it?<br/><br/>I Know a lot of americans clapped and cheered on the movie theater... patriotism is a rough feeling. I would´ve too, even cried with the president´s speech if I had been an american or if the movie had been mexican...I have to accept that.

","I STILL rank this as top-grade storytelling. In fact I think this is one of the few films I've seen where practically all the main characters (including the females) sound like a group of top-class well-trained professionals trying to work out a complex (if admittedly unusual) situation without all instantly jumping to the stock drama textbook conclusion.<br/><br/>In case you haven't heard how the idea came about, the story goes that Roland Emmerich was giving a press conference in Europe for his film STARGATE when a reporter asked if he believed in UFOs. He said he didn't, but went on to say that if a whole heap of spaceships appeared over Earth's cities, it would cause a lot of people to really sit up and think. Thus the idea for the story was born.<br/><br/>One of the things that attracts me to this movie is the little details that give the story a personality. One of my favorites is the newscaster who says ""LA residents are warned not to fire their guns at the spaceship, as it may cause an interstellar incident"". It shows personality, sounds authentic, and is very ironic considering what happens afterward. And how many standard sci-fi films would have their characters accidentally back the spacecraft up while trying to take off? It's story moments like that which make the difference between a good movie and a great one. Most of the more critically-acclaimed and lower budget films don't have stuff like that (they usually can't afford to). This is when the characters sound like they give a hoot, and not like they're just brainlessly following the script. (Yes, alright; I know they REALLY are, but at least they don't sound like it!)<br/><br/>I think it's what attracted a lot of viewers to the movie and decided to reject the critics' overwhelming advice; which hadn't happened for quite awhile when this movie was released (and the critics are still resentful of that). I can remember on a current affairs TV show when a critic unusually came on and said; ""This is the worst movie ever made! No-one should ever watch it!"" (And the critics accuse the general public of being simplistic and unsophisticated?!?)<br/><br/>Still, I guess that sums up the eternal dilemma. Most film critics go to a movie to see how the film-maker presents themes and how well they live up to the abstract drama theory; whereas most members of the general public go to a movie to watch an entertaining story!"

The special effects are mostly computer generated but seem to have been done with at least some attempt at realism; the characters are so one dimensional they would disappear if turned sideways, but Will Smith [playing Will Smith] is his usual likeable self. I have found out that the best way to view ID is to fast forward through the yucky bits to scenes such as the alien ships peeling away from the mothership, and savour them! Enough praise already; there are not so much plot holes as plot chasms [possible SPOILERS follow]--#1]Since the aliens seemed invincible,why did they co-ordinate their attack with a time signal? #2] Why did the aliens not use Neutron bombs to kill the Humans but leave the cities intact? #3] If mankind communicated by Morse code,the aliens had been monitoring our transmissions for many years so surely they would crack the code immediately? Despite all these criticisms ID is not a bad little movie,so 7/10 or *** out of ****  P.S. Fans of ID Should check out the New Outer Limits episode ""Trial By Fire"" to see how good it COULD  have been!"

","Great film.<br/><br/>If we are to continue to get, what many term 'Hollywood movies', either make them completely realistic, without any innacuracies, or go to the other extreme and make them unrealistic. Namely, go the whole hog, like this, and quite often, like this, it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Don't pussy foot around like Forrest Gump & Sixth Sense do, where half the time you feel you're watching something genuine whilst the other half it's a complete farce.<br/><br/>Yes there's errors & much of this would never occur in real life, but films like this are to entertain the public, which it does. I'd rather have films where one or two scientific facts are ignored, than actual & entire historical occurences being manipulated or reconstructed as you get in crap like Braveheart, The Patriot & even dare I say it #3 Schindlers List.<br/><br/>I dislike an awful lot about America, as I often remark, but realistically if this film concentrated on every country involved in a worldwide battle it would've lasted about 3 days.<br/><br/>People also read too much into the plots of these sort of films. Armageddon and even Tomb Raider the plots are completely incidental. There's basically a lot of fighting, bombing or some sort of action going on, normally to save the world from a villain, darkness, aliens etc & whether it's finding the other half of a coin, blowing up a meteor or anything else I couldn't care less. I never feel a part of the film as we all know how it will end & don't really have any interest in how it comes to that as long as there's some good action.<br/><br/>But this was far better than any of that. It was really easy to feel a part. You could also let your mind wander & visualise what it would be like to be caught up in that sort of thing. The speech by the president was moving, so was the bloke giving his life, especially given recent incidents in the US.<br/><br/>One reviewer complained of there not being enough emphasis on developing characters, but really who cares? Two hours later once the film has ended, it doesn't matter. This was principally a battle by soldiers & scientists to save the world, nothing more, so why spend time finding out what Jeff Goldblum's character was really like away from work?<br/><br/>Of course we'll never see the day a President or leader fights at the front of a battle, but just imagine WE were that leader. I bet we'd all like to think we'd be different & would get involved. So, we can at least hope it may one day happen.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Independence Day. It is a very good sci-fi-action movie with great special effects. It is still #4 in the box office. A few years ago ( about 1997 ) I watched this film with my little sister about 3 times a week. Till now I have seen this movie about 25 times, at the moment there is no film that I have seen more often, but during the following weeks Jurassic Park will catch ID4 up. Maybe Independence Day is brainless, but who cares? It wants to be an entertaining action movie, and it is. Maybe it is the best sci-fi-movie ever.<br/><br/>I have two favorite scenes : the first : the aliens attacking New York and Los Angeles and so on. The second : ""Y'know, this was supposed to be my weekend off, but noooo. You got me out here draggin' your heavy ass through the burnin' desert with your dreadlocks stickin' out the back of my parachute. You gotta come down here with an attitude, actin' all big and bad... and what the hell is that smell? I could've been at a barbecue! But I ain't mad.""<br/><br/>Good points : these two scenes, action, fun, special effects, sound, story, characters, actors, style, Will Smith, beginning, directing.<br/><br/>Bad points : sometimes the score, some goofs.<br/><br/>All in all, I rate Independence Day 9.5/10.

","When I saw ID4 at a New York multiplex during it's July 1996 release, I saw the cities incinerate, and the scene fades out.  The scene fades to a shot of downtown Manhattan.   The Statue Of Liberty pops in the water as the burned out Twin Towers smoulder in the background.   Some jerk in the audience hooted an excited ""YEAHHHHH!""  I wonder where this guy is now? Maybe in search of a badly needed soul! After September 2001, how ID4 is going to feel so dated!  The post destruction humor (Will Smith with his one-liners) will seem out of place. (I hated it back in 1996) Even in 1996, characters seemed far too cheerful after major cities are attacked.       Frankly, ID4 is an oddity.  It begins as a great film with promise then decomposes. It starts with real tension as the saucers loom over our cities, and just sit there.  You get to know certain charcaters (Will Smith's pilot, Jeff Goldblum's techy guy, President Bill Pullman) You actually warm up to these people.  Then there is the attack.  It's all too realistic, sometimes frightening. Then you know what happens?  The movie falls apart, and stays in pieces.  The infantile dialog, meant to be funny one-liners feel so forced. If I was one of these stars' agent, I'd bean Dean Devlin's typewriter with a baseball bat.   The general feeling of ""we have to stick together"" helps the weak second half along.

","With all the money spent and earned, you would think that ""Independence Day"" might offer something different from other run-of-the-mill action movies. Not so. Despite the gung-ho attitude and Will Smith's sense of humor, there's really nothing unique about it. The aliens are given no background whatsoever; all we know is that they have the power to blow things up with powerful rays. The story is standard shoot-em-up with several interesting action sequences thrown in to keep our MTV-damaged attention on the screen. Yes, I did say ""interesting;"" I won't try to be a snob and say that none of the action scenes impressed me. In fact, a lot of them did. But I walked away from the film with an empty feeling inside, as if I had eaten a bowl of pasta without any sauce.<br/><br/>Back in the mid-90's, audiences attended these things in droves, watching the same homogenized schlock from May to August. It can easily be argued that not much has changed in the last five years, with ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Hollow Man,"" and anything else that would insult the intelligence of a five-year-old still holding the #1 box office spot. But there are glimmers of hope, with idealistic films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""American Beauty"" pulling in cash from the audience. Then again, such movies could be showered with all the success in the world and it still probably wouldn't pull Hollywood away from making routine movies like ""Independence Day."" Worse, it probably wouldn't keep people from paying admission price either."

","To tell the truth, I never actually meant to watch Independance Day. I borrowed the tape from my cousin for the South Park cartoons on the end, and Independance Day being on the same tape was just a bonus. Well, it seemed like a bonus at the time.<br/><br/>Indeed, the entire film can be summed up in one word: American. Aside from the storyline, I was intensely irritated by the Americanisation of the whole thing, to the point that I'm commenting on it first rather than any of the good features of the film. <br/><br/>So, the world gets attacked by aliens (actually, I think it's just America that gets attacked by the aliens, you wouldn't know that many other countries existed). Take for example, the two British pilots. ""Oh jolly good, wonder what the Americans are up to?"" Pardon me, but hardly anyone has spoken like that for fifty years. The sort of people who do speak like that would also hardly be likely to be flying a jet.<br/><br/>But, now that's out of the way, the special effects for the film are really very good, and the way the story unfolds works a treat. I especially liked the bit where Jeff Goldblum has the lap-top computer, turns it round and says 'The clock is ticking.' For atmosphere and script, that was brilliant.<br/><br/>But, then we move into the realms of ridiculous again, when we look at just how the alien ship was destroyed. It's laughable and pathetic, and makes Mars Attacks! look like a realistic future.<br/><br/>All in all, it's just too blatantly stupid to warrant a movie blockbuster. I know it will appeal to some people, but it just didn't appeal to me.<br/><br/>4/10 - I can see why some like it, and the special effects are good, but just too American, and the ending is awful."

It is simply great entertainment in the tradition of the big budget Hollywood Sci-Fi special effects extravaganzas. The plot is simple enough, and hardly original. Aliens arrive at our planet and intend to wipe up out. We fight back, and in the end human ingenuity and courage win the day.<br/><br/>
What makes this movie work, quite simply, are the combination of the straight forward way the story is told, the basic competence of the actors (Jeff Goldblum, as always, plays the quirky science geek type character to perfection) and of course the awesome effects. If you see the DVD version of this movie, you can watch the companion disc which explains how they made everything from the aliens to the spectacular White House explosion scene. Clearly the people who made this movie wanted to spare no expense in creating absolutely stunning visuals, and they succeeded on every level.<br/><br/>Quite simply, the way to see a movie like this is to just sit back and enjoy 2 hours of great entertainment. Don't expect anything more, since that's simply not the point. This movie isn't about impressing the critics, but simply giving the viewers a fun time. And at that, it succeeds brilliantly. 8/10"

Of course, Hollywood makes the Amerikans the smart ones who have to lead the fight. After the aliens are defeated, the oppressed may have a revolutionary opportunity amid all the destruction. Still, MIM asks, ""who wrote this?"" For now, aliens are cultural creations, and therefore class creations. If this was a movie written with proletarian politics, advanced aliens would more likely be communists, not evil imperialists. Or in a different as yet unwritten revolutionary alien movie, the proletariat unites with the space aliens behind the bourgeoisie's back.

This is not a Mel Brooks or David Zucker film, but a far more subtle product.<br/><br/>I think a lot more people would enjoy this film if they looked at it just that little bit differently. Though, as a spoof, it does take elements from many other films, it has an incredibly tight and economical screenplay (better than many of the films it takes off, in fact), with not a word of wasted dialogue in the whole 2 and bit hours, and it is genuinely tense and dramatic.<br/><br/>If you watched this film expecting real science in your sci-fi or deep messages from your drama, then of course you will have been disappointed.

The only thing missing was the little boxes with the cast's pictures in them along the bottoms of the movie posters.<br/><br/>And stereotypes?  SHEESH!  There are one-sided portrayals of drunk hicks (Quaid), old Jewish men (Hirsch), hysterical gays (Fierstein), detatched intellectuals (Goldblum), gung-ho tough guys (Smith), gruff military men (Loggia), and a bunch of women (Colin, McDonnell, Fox) who stand around and look worried as aliens blow up most of the world around them.<br/><br/>Although, Fox is about the toughest of the lot; she can kick doors, drive trucks, tend to the wounded and stand up for herself mighty well, which is more than what the rest of the women here are allowed to do.  Quite a shame, too; remember when McDonnell was being lauded for ""Dances with Wolves""?<br/><br/>Even so, the FX are top notch as we see New York City, Washington DC and all the other world capitals blasted to smithereens, alien ships hovering overhead like huge gray Frisbees and aliens that look like a combination between crabs, octopi and one of the cantina dwellers in ""Star Wars"".  Very impressive.<br/><br/>BUT, and this is only a slight problem here, why did they have to paraphrase ""War of the Worlds"" so much?  I mean, with all the technology and talent available, why not do something new and exciting?

","If any of you have read my review on Battlefield Earth, you'll understand why I can get behind this film.  At least this movie had some action that was pretty good.<br/><br/>But at the same time, I felt the way some of you did.  I especially agree with the review by Roddy-15, which is a few reviews down from mine, this movie was nothing more than stereotypical characters and the patriot, gung-ho, America the beautiful stuff that really makes me sick.  How come just the Americans can come up with the ideals?  Why not the Russians, the Chinese, the Africans?  Why the Americans?<br/><br/>Why do all the black characters always have to be the ones who have all the slick one liners?  I get so sick of that.  I think Bill Pullman was to young to play the president, I think some one older should have played the part. Michael Keaton maybe, or Kurt Russell.  Maybe even Morgan Freeman.  But he might be a little to old to jump into a fighter jet.  I don't know.<br/><br/>I did like the acting by most of the actors although Judd Hirsh did get on my nerves playing the old man with little bits of wisdom to spread here and there.  Of course I'm not a real big Hirsh fan.  Come to think about it, I didn't like any of the cast members from Taxi except Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.  But back to the ID4.  It was an interesting movie I'll say that much.<br/><br/>Despite the impossibility of the plot, character development and overall feel of the movie (I just don't think things would be that calm if aliens really did land) I still give it a decent rating, 5 out of 10.  But you have to remember that I have recently watched this movie after seeing Battlefield Earth, the most awful movie made in 2000, so my view on ID4 may be a little warped.

Roland Emmerich is certainly a good director though, he knows how to make visually stunning scenes in ID4, I'll give him that!But his other film, The Patriot was way better than this!!!<br/><br/>And what's with all the token characters though?

Because most of those people don't like sci-fi/action, that's why. Also because a retarded element of this world seem to dislike movies that have a big budget and sci-fi/action films often do.

That must be the only logical explanation as to how anyone in Hollywood would actually give Dean Devlin money to produce a film. Anyway, on to ID4. Devlin and Emmerich approached John Viskovil, I think his name is, who is a special effects artist, the guy known primarily for blowing up the Death Star in the original STAR WARS. Well, they did some of the ""firewall"" shots for Fox, and sold Fox on the idea of this movie based on those test shots. Then they typed out the most clichéd, unoriginal rip-off of George Pal's WAR OF THE WORLDS you can possibly imagine.

So where would they get the additional energy to power the ""firewall"" weapon?<br/><br/>See, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, a little known sci-fi film directed by Robert Wise, has been there and done that. In THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, they proposed that an alien species could be microscopic in size, yet when exposed to the right conditions (as on earth), would multiply. Also, it was made out of silicon, so it functioned as its own spaceship! Genius, if you ask me.<br/><br/>But back to ID4: it was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, and the fact that it did so much business here in America and the fact MARS ATTACKS! did not, just goes to show how gullible the majority of Americans really are.

Certainly I can't detect any creativity on the part of the writers.<br/><br/>Parts are symptomatic of the whole: so I will practise restraint and mention just ONE glaring stupidity.  Just one.  Longer (but incomplete) lists of idiocies may be found elsewhere - the last time I looked there was a decent list on the IMDb itself.  Okay, here it is:<br/><br/>The aliens take over our satellites and no-one knows why.  With the same creative reasoning he displayed in ""Jurassic Park"" when he deduced a revolt of the dinosaurs from the movement of a water droplet, Jeff Goldblum works out that the aliens are using our satellites to communicate with each other so that they will be able to co-ordinate their attack.  ""That's IT!"" everyone shouts.  One wonders how the Allies managed in the Second World War.  Did they use German satellites - or did they simply synchronise their watches?  Here's a hot piece of technology we can sell to the aliens: the WATCH!  It's a little device that enables one to TELL THE TIME!  Everyone can have ONE EACH and then EVERYONE will know what time it is!<br/><br/>My point is not that this is a stupid weakness in the plot.  I mean, it is, but that's not my point.  My point is that we REALISE just how stupid this is, almost before the words have left Goldblum's lips.  We aren't given a chance to be charitable about it.  A hundred weaknesses will make themselves apparent while you watch, however low you set the relevant dials in your brain (some people can go as low as ""dribbling moron"", but most of us can't).  The movie just stumbles from stupidity to stupidity via bridge passages of stupidity.  There's a bit of purported excitement here and there to distract us from all the stupidity but it's so perfunctorily done that it just doesn't work.  Aliens taking over the Earth: it's a grand theme, but there's little grandeur in the treatment.  There is, however, an awful lot of stupidity.<br/><br/>To make matters worse there's some offensive nationalism.

Roger Ebert described it as ""silly summer fun,"" and that it is.  Much of the story remains under-developed (I wanted to know where those beastly little b***ers came from) but the triumphant spirit in the end really is something.<br/><br/>
ID4 also boasts an impressive ensemble of big-name performers.  Will Smith demonstrates he's a darn funny guy.  Bill Pullman carrys himself and his charisma much like the ideal President should--(and whether it's formulatic or not, you've gotta love it when he takes to the skies with the rest of humanity.)  Brent Spiner--Star Trek's Data without the gold makeup, throws in a colored cameo as an underground mad scientist type.  Harry Connick, Jr. is as suave as ever.  Judd Hirsch is Jewish. And of course anything with Jeff Goldblum in it won't be a total loss.  Also, watch for the actor who plays Mr. Nubicki (Bill Pullman fires him in the end.) I swear he's the biggest character actor in Hollywood today--he's everywhere!  (Basic Instinct, The Game, several others I can't remember...)<br/><br/>I also liked the cute tie-in to Jurassic Park.  When fleeing the Mothership, Jeff Goldblum repeats his same line from the dino-fleeing scene in JP: Must Go Faster!  Who thought of that one??<br/><br/>A final note: Independence Day really is a decent film as far as action blockbusters go.

(4) Fill in your own (and, sure, there were plenty from which to choose).<br/><br/>For those who want a summer-time fx popcorn movie, no complaints. It delivered.<br/><br/>For thinkers, the essential theme is overcoming the dark side, as seen in films like Apocalypse Now, the Star Wars story (they shout it in your face throughout the trilogy), or Falling Down (Robert Duvall, Michael Douglas).<br/><br/>The protagonist sees in the antagonist his own dark side. The decision to overcome the dark side usually means some form of destruction of the antagonist by the protagonist, whether in symbol or literal death, to confirm the rejection of temptation to give in to the dark side.<br/><br/>This film symbolizes the alien nature of humans in earth's history. One fellow wrote a review here mentioning the invasion of Mexico in the 16th century; one may also consider what they native North American folks must have felt when the Europeans arrived. Or even how animals feel when they are displaced by ""aliens in flying machines destroying their homes to take away the resources"" (gee, folks, the crop duster character...).<br/><br/>This movie is telling us to feel about ourselves the way we felt about the alien threat. Shucks, they came in the first place because they had consumed their planet's resources. Doesn't that sound like us?! (deforestation, water and air pollution, are we that oblivious to what's happening?) War has involved pillaging resources for thousands of years, from fighting over share of the hunted herds to fighting over the land to cultivate to fighting for the gold...And, let's not even begin to talk about colonialism and slavery...<br/><br/>Notice also that the crop duster is the one ""worthy"" to destroy the aliens by sacrifice; he seems to judge himself at the same time, and as it were justifies his killing them by dying with them.<br/><br/>There is a whole lot in this film.<br/><br/>Compare the presidential characterization in this movie versus, say, The Rock.<br/><br/>Or, how about the scene where Will Smith punches out the alien - preposterous, we might say. But, think about it -- if the creature is carbon-based, and if the whole universe came from one big bang start, why can't it be as fragile as earth-bound carbon-based forms? We have this idea that, if we ever met an alien, it must be stronger - why? who's ever authenticated a meeting with one to say?<br/><br/>If you missed all this (and so much more, but there's a limit here!), you may need to watch it again."

Well, by their definition, I think their movie does mean something, but it could mean a lot more. The characters are likeable and fun, but very poorly written. You mean to tell me that the President of the United States will still have a smile on his face after most of his country has been wiped out ? I don't think so. So I guess I care about the characters. But wouldn't it be nice if the characters cared about what was happening in the movie?"
