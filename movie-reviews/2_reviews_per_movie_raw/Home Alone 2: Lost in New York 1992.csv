"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","167","182","23 November 2003"," Yes, same plot, but it still gets the same laughs as the first one did if not more
","Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun. It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York. Instead of complaining or panicking, he just plain enjoys it. He goes on the ultimate tour with his father's bag of money and credit cards and cons himself into the Plaza Hotel claiming he's there with his dad. But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital. But Kevin is going to make sure that they don't mess around with the kids and has set his uncle's abandoned apartment up for a fun house of traps.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was an absolute blast. The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?!""... the lady just smiles and says ""The finest in New York!"", it was just too funny! I love this movie and I'm always going to recommend it for a good watch, I think you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.<br/><br/>There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.<br/><br/>But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.<br/><br/>The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.<br/><br/>With a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.<br/><br/>It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more."
"Jasper76","9","42","49","23 September 2008"," The cuteness ends here
","This should have been the end of the Home Alone series, seeing that the same premise and cast were used for two films but, naturally, Hollywood just can't resist trying to squeeze more money from a proved formula. I'm not one for sequels but this was one of the handful that I can enjoy time and again, not only because the original cast is in it, but because of Macaulay Culkin's comedic ability (even as a kid) and Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's reactions to getting their butts kicked, booby trap style. Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice). He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY). Who could have thought a vacant New York brownstone could be so much fun? Sure, Pesci's and Stern's characters are more banged up this time but, hey, they started it. (The adventures in the Plaza Hotel are hilarious, as well.) Anyway, this is one sequel worth the time to watch. Just don't bother with the irrelevant, contrived, and unncessary third installment of the series."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","25","28","5 February 2009"," My personal favourite of the franchise
","The first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox"
"dee.reid","8","51","63","7 December 2005"," I love it!
","""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ilovetheredhotchilipeppers","10","65","97","19 December 2004"," Home Alone 2
","I have no idea quite why, but Home Alone 2 is my favorite movie of all time. I have the board game (made a while back), tons of books, the piano book as well which I play all year round and I've watched the movie about 80 times so far. I can recite every line and know pretty much everything bout the whole movie. There's just smoothing about this one that is so much better than the first. Perhaps it's just the whole New York scene and I think the bandits do better acting as well. I CANNOT stand Home Alone 3 though. They totally spoiled it and ruined the whole ""Home Alone"" title. The actors are terrible and the movies just plain sucks. If anyone wants to talk bout the movie with me, don't be shy."

"alicehoc1982","10","42","68","9 November 2004"," I loved that movie!
","I remember I was 10 years old in '92, I used to watch that movie at my old house where I grew up but I was sitting on the floor near the TV in the living room. Oh, yeah, my favorite part is Macaulay (Kevin McAllister) was walking around in New York when he was lost then later, he went to the toy store to buy something then these 2 bad guys found him then Macaulay (Kevin) was screaming same thing then run away from these 2 bad guys in the city of NY but it was so funny because I loved Macaulay's screaming that make me laugh so hard! I remember Macaulay as Kevin put everything for his ideas of his plan to do for these 2 bad guys but it is so funny. His brother Kieran Culkin (Fuller McAllister - Kevin's cousin) was a cute kid and wears glasses in that same movie as his brother Macaulay. I loved that movie very much since I was a little kid. That movie is the greatest and funniest one that I ever seen!"
"learningthelingo","10","7","9","12 January 2010"," Christmas Classic in New York
","Macaulay Culkin – one of the most famous child stars since Shirley Temple – returns as Kevin McAllister in the 1992 nostalgic and sentimental slapstick Christmas classic that has not dated since its original release.<br/><br/>As the sequel of the highest grossing comedy of all time, Home Alone 2 is one of the biggest Christmas films of the 90s. Along with its predecessor, the story is all about Christmas. While the familiar Christmas vacation is shown as chaotic and stressful, it is the essential family element that brings us back to the films main themes of togetherness and (paradoxically) independence.<br/><br/>Becoming separated from his family once again when leaving for a Christmas holiday, Kevin is left alone to his own devices, this time in New York City and causes chaos and mayhem when he bumps into the freshly escaped ""Wet Bandits"", who are once again, out to get him.<br/><br/>The original cast return with Culkin in the lead, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the hilariously dumb, yet slightly endearing criminals with a heart of coal and the fantastic Catherine O'Hara as the mum every child wants, played with just the right amount of fear, guilt, determination and love that is needed. Another noteworthy return is the sequel of gangster spoof Angels with Filthy Souls, Angels with Even Filthier Souls (a reminiscent construction of Angels with Dirty Faces with James Cagney.) New characters are brought to life by Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Dana Ivey and a young Rob Schneider.<br/><br/>Film critics such as Roger Ebert gave the film negative reviews and saw it as portraying violence as too cartoonish. Despite this fact, the mainstream popularity of the film saw it as a success and to most children of the 90s, the second instalment in the Home Alone series is often seen as equal in quality if not better than the first.<br/><br/>This film has been monumental in my life. I cannot remember how I first saw it, but I know that thanks to VHS I watched it a million times. It formed my quintessential idea of New York by using Central Park, Carnegie Hall and the Plaza Hotel as central plot settings. It is as much a Christmas film as it is a New York City film and this familiar touristy promotion shows New York as being a unique ""White Christmas"" town.<br/><br/>So in the cheery Christmas words of Johnny the Crook from Angels: Merry Christmas you filthy animaland a Happy New Year."

","If I was a young child and wanted to get lost somewhere, then the Big Apple would be my first choice.

There's just one snag-Joe Pesci and Daniel Sterns are back as Harry and Marv and once again, young Kevin must outwit them.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty similar to Home Alone but don't let that put you off-it just means you've got more of the same thrills and fun to enjoy.

","HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK, to me, is an excellent Christmas flick. In my opinion, the traps that Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) set for Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were even more hilarious than the first. They were also more dangerous, but not that much more dangerous. I mean, Kevin set two of the same traps that he did in the first HOME ALONE. Personally, I thought that the Plaza Hotel was, indeed, luxurious and spacious. When and if I go to New York City, I'm going to stay there, even though I know it's expensive. If there were two bumbling burglars were after me, I would be really scared. The one thing that really amazed me was that Kevin got around New York City all by himself without getting hurt. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent Christmas flick to all you Macaulay Culkin fans who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to laugh and enjoy yourselves."

"ironhorse_iv","6","4","8","21 December 2014"," Home Alone 2 takes a big bite out of the Big Apple and I kinda like it.
","In 1990, Home Alone came out to great success, so it was no surprise that, two years later, in 1992, they would go on and make a sequel. Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, was mainly a rehash of the original, only it was set in New York City, this time. It's generally considered to be respectful to the first movie and was the second biggest box-office hit of 1992. A lot of the original people from the first film, return to work on this project. Directed by Chris Columbus, and written by John Hughes, the movie tells the story of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) whom once again, finds himself frustrated with his family to the point that once again, he finds himself, wishing he can be without them. We as the audience can't blame him, after all, his family didn't learn anything in the first film. There are still selfish jerks who really do mistreat him. Still, Kevin shouldn't be so happy to get rid of them, too. I thought, he learn that family is very important to have. Geesthis sequel really makes the whole first movie, really pointless. Anyways, instead of getting left home again, he loses track of his father at the airport, and mistakenly gets on a plane headed for New York City -- while the rest of his family fly to Miami. Now alone in the Big Apple, Kevin cons his way into a room at the Plaza Hotel and begins his usual antics. It's there, that he finds out that the two bumbling burglars that try to rob his home in the first movie, the Wet Bandits, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) & Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern) that are now trying to rob a famous toy store. Instead, of calling the police, Kevin should had done, he set up his Uncle's abandoned house with booby traps & forced Harry & Marv to follow him. Will the Bandits get the edge or will Kevin once again, outsmart them? Watch it to find out! In my opinion, the Bandits really didn't need to go into that house, as they honestly could had stolen the money and flee. It's not like they need the camera picture. They're already wanted criminals! This movie really doesn't give us, much that's new to work with. Yes, the New York City setting is cool to see, but honestly, it could had be downtown Chicago. Half the time, it was. Most of the film are shot there, while others were shot in California. The movie recycle a lot of the old gags from the first film, but puts in the extremes. The extreme cartoony slapstick violence, the cheesy one liners, the break the fourth wall jokes, the dim-wits minds of the criminals, and Kevin's hijinks are still worth seeing one more time and very surprising, still very funny. I have to disagree with certain critics that says cartoon violence is only funny in cartoons. After all, this film is no differs to the old school stunts of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers. Those films get high marks; why can this film? I wouldn't say, watch this movie on TV, because it might be deeply cut and edited. Instead, try to find the movie on DVD. Yes, this movie is a kid's movie, but parents should judge if this film is worth their kids watching, because the visual violence are very realism and has some dark humor. The movie came out when I was a kid, and even for me. I was like, how are these two criminals, even still alive? Clearly, Harry & Marv would be dead by now. Like I said in my original Home Alone review, Kevin might be a little too sadistic. God help us, when he grows ups. Still, most of the film has a lot of heart. Like the first film, Kevin meets somebody to help him, understand his family and Christmas. This time, it's a homeless bird lover woman played by Brenda Fricker whom is a pretty good actress. Most of the actors were. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern never lose a beat. Catherine O'Hara is great as the mother role. Tim Curry is hilarious as the side villain, Mr. Hector, the Plaza hotel concierge. Still, it makes me wonder, why the real life Plaza Hotel was so willing to portray their employees as idiots. I guess Donald Trump just really wanted that cameo. Oddly enough, the directions, Trump gives Kevin are incorrect. Once again, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear again. I still love the planning song. Overall: the concept was still fresh enough for a sequel and it was very enjoyable. Sadly, Hollywood made a lot of unwanted sequels like 1997's Home Alone 3, 2002's Home Alone 4, and 2012's Home Alone: The Holiday Heist that didn't have any of the original cast and crew. Indeed, they should have learn, you can mess with a lot of things, but you can't mess with kids on Christmas. In the end, those sequels were a mess, but this one still work. So AHHHHHH!!! Hooray for Home Alone 2!"

"Toronto85","8","2","3","18 December 2012"," Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
","Home Alone 2 picks up a year after the original film in which the McCallister family accidentally left young Kevin alone to battle two criminals at Christmastime. It's Christmas again, and the family have planned another vacation. They don't leave Kevin home alone this time. A mix up at the airport sends the family to France and Kevin to New York...ALONE! Luckily for Kevin, he has his father's credit card which he uses to check himself into the luxurious Grand Hotel. From that point on, Kevin must battle the hotel management staff who believe he stole the credit card he used, as well as a return from the Wet Bandits! Harry and Marv are back and Kevin has a whole new set of tricks and traps that batter the crooks yet again. <br/><br/>I really like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, it matches up pretty well to the first film. Macaulay Culkin does his thing as Kevin, the little boy who finds inner strength during moments of terror. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious again as the bumbling idiot criminals. O'Hara and Heard are back as the parents who have some funny moments as well, and Tim Curry/Rob Schneider/Dana Ivey add much to the film as the hotel staff. The abundance of characters really works for this movie, they each add an important part to it. Home Alone 2 obviously breaks away from the ""home alone"" idea. Kevin isn't at home he is in a giant city. There is however a good chunk of film time spent at an abandoned house in which Kevin sets up his attack against the 'Wet Bandits'.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2 should be seen by everyone in my opinion. It isn't your average Christmas movie, but it does take place at that time in New York City. There are some great location shots at Rockefeller Centre and Central Park. There are also many heartwarming moments between Kevin and a homeless woman he meets in the park. I liked it a lot!<br/><br/>8/10"
"leplatypus","10","2","3","14 June 2010"," A duplicate for the story but also for the good memories (DVD)
","For the inside view of those movies, you can read my review for ""Home alone"". Here, I just want to compare this sequel to the original.<br/><br/>I think ""variation"" would be a more accurate word than sequel, because you find exactly the same ingredients: the family feud, the fast departure, the lone mysterious figure, the wet bandits,  I can't recall a brand where such a copy happens.<br/><br/>In addition, the spirit of Christmas is a bit lost. If New York is a wonderful town, it hasn't the warm of a suburb or a mansion.<br/><br/>However, the movie is more fun than the first one. It's one of the few movies that make me laugh till I cry. Really! I'm just fond of the Joe Pesci whom bad temper grows bigger and bigger as the hits he takes! <br/><br/>And the soundtrack is just awesome: the score from John Williams, close to ""Hook"" written in the same period, is an excellent example of the musical power and how can score is essential to movies (and life)! From my recent watchings, ""300"" is a great movie but doesn't enter my Pantheon because it lacks THE score. I can't even hum the main theme! That's not the case here and that's why I remember to have bought then the audiotape to listen again and again to it, the Darlene love song, the Christmas Carols! Woof: such cool memories! <br/><br/>So it's a pleasure to make them discover to the kid, to hand on the torch"
"axopnk","7","2","3","26 January 2006"," Mediocre
","First of all i'm not going to comment on the first home alone. It was a great movie in all respects. The second one though, gets pretty dry. Don't get me wrong, it had its moments, but the concepts were over done. The first plus i do have to give the movie though is how Kevin got sent to New York. Mistaking one person for another is pretty believable since he's a kid. But from that point it was pretty average. The mom screams again and Kevin is alone in new york having the time of his life. The problem is this really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In the first one, he was like OK somethings up but at least he's in his own environment/city. In the second one a ""normal kid"" would be pretty scared since hes in a city hes unfamiliar with (Then again Kevin isn't a normal kid is he?). So once again he creates mischief which was funny on some parts (rob Schneider and the rest of the hotel staff was pretty funny) but throwing the burglaries again got kinda old. Going through the house with traps was getting pretty ridiculous. The first one had traps that were pretty harsh and you would think like alright, maybe a grown adult could keep going but in this one it was like BullS***! Getting hit in the head with a brick from that height would kill anyone (which is pretty funny if you stop and think about all the misdemeanors and felonies Kevin has committed). The problem with this sequel is the producer wanted to up the stakes and make it better than the first, unfortunately by increasing injury degree of the traps made it seem disbelivable. Another point is the bird feeding lady. So what? Kevin gives her a turtle dove, how is that really going to help her? Of course it was a family movie so she was like ""Thank you"" but seriously, he just helped a major toy corporation from getting robbed, he gets a grip load of free presents, free hotel stay but he can't seem to think that money isn't something a less fortunate individual wants right? (Which reminds me, it really tried to make taxi cab drivers or low class individuals seem dishonest, scary and basically a stereotyped image of what you see in the media.) The robbers were still there classic selves, but they seemed to be just bodies in the movie who get beat up, the movie didn't really give any new angles or character depth to them. Probably the most irritating part was when buzz was doing the whole drum thing on Kevin's head, with everyone laughing, but when Kevin retaliates they get mad at him?! Is it any wonder why he will grow up to be a misled youth. Your supposed to feel sorry for Kevin, and you do, in both movies, but this one went to extreme. He's the black sheep of the family, the one everyone picks on but the movie doesn't give a heart warming satisfaction that Kevin's family will be OK from that point on (which is probably why the producer bailed out on home alone 3 with Kevin in it). Overall the movie was average in some parts, irritating in others, funny in other parts and pretty much unrealistic in other parts of the movie."
"PIST-OFF","1","10","28","14 August 1999"," Bad, really bad.
","This has got to be one of the worst pieces of c**p ever put on film. OK the first one wasn't bad, but the violence in this goes to a bugs bunny G rated level of stupidity. The robbers take a little too much from this kid. Ever heard of a gun? And come on now a 12 year old kid dressed in expensive yuppie clothes walking around central park at night and not being mugged. I don't think so. Then there's another lame happy odd stranger side plot. This is just bad."
"benaboo","8","1","1","4 April 2020"," A sequel that is definitely faithful to the original.
","A lot of people complain about Home Alone 2 being just a rehash of the original and I will not deny that it is a rehash but this is one of those times that it doesn't bother me that much. In fact this sequel is almost better than the original. There are a few things I actually think they do better in this film. Uncle Frank and Buzz are more entertaining this time around, the New York setting gives it a more adventurous feel, the scene where they discover Kevin is missing complete with the iconic ""KEVIN!!"" scream taken up to eleven and Kate fainting in front of the entire airport is better than what they did in the original, and the addition of Tim Curry and Rob Schneider is a lot of fun. This is the closest Tim Curry has come to reprising his iconic role as Wadsworth from Clue. And Brenda Fricker as The Bird Lady brings some heart to the movie. So Lost in New York does rehash a lot of the original but it retains the heart that made the original so timeless and I will take this any day over Home Alone 3."
"swaintastic","8","1","1","29 December 2019"," Familiar, Yet Different Sequel to a Christmas Classic
","I see a lot of reviews faulting this film for basically copying the original. Yes a lot of the beats are similar, but there is growth in the main character that seems natural. Kevin takes on even more responsibilities while trying to make his own way. In the first film Kevin is mainly a selfish child, who by the end of the film discovers he is not as helpless as other would believe. By the end of the sequel, Kevin looks beyond himself and takes responsibility to save Christmas for a bunch of orphans.<br/><br/>It was nice to see that growth in character, while also still being able to capture the magic of the original. Most of the original cast make a return, while introducing a couple of new eccentric characters. And Joe Pesci is still great. The setting is on a larger scale and the stakes are higher.<br/><br/>For me, I believe pairing Home Alone and Lost in New York together makes for a perfect way to spend a night in around the holidays."

","Kevin still hasn't lost his touch. He gets separated this time, happily ending up in New York, while his folks end up in Miami, The McCallisters, not the most responsible of parents (this is the second time). I for one, can't blame Kevin (the odd kid out in the family) for smiling, as having to put up with all those douchebags, he calls family, notably beefcake brother, Buzz and his horrible, irascible Uncle, who I have a pet hate for. Using his parent's credit cards, racking up quite a bill, Kevin lives it up in the famous Plaza hotel, scoring some really suss and sour looks from some hotel staff. And guess who he bumps into, on his travels. So again, he uses his smarts and wits on the wet bandits (Stern so good here) where they take worse spills, and a hell of a lot of pain, trying to overthrow their rival. There are some similarities to the first one, that in no way, dampens this one. Again notable performances are that of O'Hara and, Stern, and Brenda Fricker as a homeless woman, her only friends, manifold of pigeons, and Kevin. Macaulay too is just perfect as before, a role, obviously, he was born to play. It's just a sad reminder, of how he could of been such a bigger star. Rob Reiner too, is very good and memorable as the cutish bellboy. This good sequel delivers, so most HA fans shouldn't be disappointed, especially if you really wanna see what the wet bandits deserve."

"saxguygb","9","1","1","4 November 2015"," A Good Sequel, Despite Being A Carbon Copy of The First One
","With the financial success of the first Home Alone movie, a sequel was probably inevitable. Home Alone 2 is very much the same thing as the first one. Not only is the premise very much the same, but even the littler things are very similar to the first one. Watch both movies and see how many similarities you can find. You'll probably need a lot of paper to keep track.<br/><br/>Even though Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy of the first movie, it still gives you that warm feeling of the holidays and gets you in the Christmas spirit. However, I personally like this one a little more than the first one for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. The Setting: I like that Kevin is in New York City and not limited to his suburban area of Chicago. He has a huge city to explore and a lot of money and credit cards to do so. He visits Central Park and the World Trade Center just to name a couple of places. I also love the shots of New York with all of the Christmas lights and decorations.<br/><br/>2. Tim Curry: Both Home Alone films are well-acted, but Tim Curry gets extra points for his performance. He looks like he's having fun with the role, even though he's not over-the-top or anything like that. He steals every scene that he's in. He's just an overall delight to watch.<br/><br/>3. The Slapstick: This is the main reason why I like the sequel a little more than the first one. The booby traps are a little harsher, but the slapstick is played out like some of the classic Looney Toons shorts and for the most part, they work fine in this movie. The only major part of the slapstick I don't really like is when you hear Marv's bones cracking. However, the rest of the slapstick is pretty good and I find myself laughing at it more than in the original.<br/><br/>Overall, Home Alone 2 is a good sequel that I happen to like a little more than the original. However, if you don't agree, then I totally understand."
"moviemattb","8","1","1","17 December 2014"," Fun movie, but its not that bad
","""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" takes place after the events of the first one as Kevin is finally going on a Christmas vacation with his family, but gets left behind again as he ends up in New York instead of going to Florida as where his family is going. Now Harry and Marv are back as they went from being the Wet Bandits to the Sticky Bandits, try to get revenge on Kevin as Kevin deals with them again as he saves Christmas and stopping them from stealing the money's charity that were suppose to be donated to the children's hospital by Ducan's Toy Chest. Okay, I'll admit that this movie is not as good as the first one but I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. I've seen sequels that are worse than ""Home Alone 2."" Heck, I think the third and fourth are worse than the second; the fifth I did not seen and would not have any desire to give it a watch. I think, in my humble opinion, ""Home Alone 2"" is a fun sequel than any of the ""Home Alone"" sequels that got made. I thought John Hughes did a fine job with the script as well as what Chris Columbus had to do for directing it. John Williams' music is just as good as the first one, and the cast did great. Macaulay Culkin really does well as he did in the first. Even Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern both still made a great chemistry together. Of course, you got to have Tim Curry who is indeed a lot of fun. Brenda Fricker was good too, but she is just another version of Roberts Blossom from the first movie (forgot to mention that Roberts Blossom is also really good in the first one). I thought some of the slapstick in the movie were really good, but some were flat; the movie does have some fine humor, but weren't as good as the first. I really do love some of the shots in New York along with some of the Christmas scenery that are in this movie. I understand some of the similarities that were done in the first one, but it wasn't 100 percent carbon copy. You still get some things that are different. I would have mind if they have tried something new, but I do give it a pass because I was already entertained enough with this movie. I do wonder why Kevin's family is watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in Spanish when they are in Florida as the movie they are watching should have been in English. In the first one, the same movie they are watching is in French which makes sense because they are in Paris. However, you can make an argument if the reason they are watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in Spanish is that there weren't any Christmas movies to watch so they ended watching this movie in Spanish because its a Christmas movie. If its true, then I get it but that is just me. Also, not sure if I'm wrong or not that Kevin's father should have just checked on Kevin on how is he doing as they are running to catch their flight to Florida. It's your call on that. Lastly, I wish if the family would stop treating Kevin like garbage as for what they did in the first one. Should have learn their lessons. With that said, I don't think the movie deserves to be ignore because I think it deserves the attention as what the first one did; the third; fourth and fifth movies are the ones that need to be ignore. That's just my opinion on that. ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a fun movie, but its not that bad; I still think its fun, entertaining, and still has that Christmas feeling as what made the first one so good about it. Not sure if I put this in the underrated category, but I know its not as bad as what everyone makes it out to be. I say give it a chance! I give this movie an 8 out of 10."
"Geeky Randy","9","1","1","10 December 2014"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Very clever sequel to the 1990 blockbuster, with this McCallister Christmas vacation following Culkin as he wonders the Big Apple after boarding the wrong flight, only to bump into Pesci and Stern, whom have just escaped from prison and are still angry about their foiled plan from the previous year. Aside from a couple of minor characters, pretty much everyone from the first movie reprises their roles. Heard and O'Hara are still great (and still underrated) as the parents; however, it's Curry and Schneider in memorable scenes at the Plaza Hotel that make this outing an hilarious classic. John Williams expands on his score, making the soundtrack by itself worth listening to. But the film is not without its flaws: specifically, the story structure is way too similar to its predecessor, and the traps are far more irresponsible and less funny than the first. Still, if you love the original, this one will find its way onto your Holiday Watch List.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

"karl_with-12","9","1","1","22 December 2009"," Filled me with hysterical laughs...great, great Christmas movie!
","I've never been much of a fan of the HA movies. Yes I've heard of them but I never actually bothered to watch them. But after I saw this movie it made me realise how entertaining and hysterical they are. It was just yesterday when I was watching a TV programme, I realised that this film was on next and it was then that I decided to watch it (just to not be bored.) I had my doubts about this film, not knowing what ""joy"" to expect because as I've said, I never seen any of the HA movies nor the prequel: however I was able to catch on during the first 5 minutes of the film. Let me say I was throughly proved wrong during 5 or so minutes of the film. I half expected myself to switch to a different channel, never giving this film a chance as I felt that it was just going to be another boring Christmas movie. BUT, I was so overwhelmed by this film that I set off continuing to watch it...all the way through! I just loved it, I guess it just had that Christmasy spark and adventure. And let me say, it is very rare I would watch a film all the way to the end without even switching channels and feeling bored.<br/><br/>The plot, I admit, was typical yet it had a really big impact on the film as it gave it its surreal adventure. I really enjoyed it but I believe it was utter coincidence that a kid could board on a plane, not knowing that his family was on another flight and finally they are separated all the way across the country. It would be terrifying for me as I do not know what I would do without my family...knowing they're not in the same country as I am and I was alone! But from the movies perspective, some good things came out of it (especially when you're in the city that never sleeps!) Room service, dining, luxurious suites, credit cards..aah! Kid's lucky! And also in this movie the kid acts so calm and independent and yet he's not at all scared that his family is halfway across the country! <br/><br/>And speaking of being scared...how could you not be?? The mom + dad didn't look so worried when they soon found out that their kid is missing. Sure...despite the fact that the mom fainted, she didn't actually show any real worry! I was surprised that her and her husband was cracking up jokes in the police office when their son could be lost anywhere around the world...! And *psst;;;;spoiler;;;;* when the mom actually found her son, she wasn't even crying of joy! Finding your son in a big dangerous city would take a miracle (well, even though it's Christmas) and the mom was just like ""Ooh, I'm so glad to see you!""... seriously! <br/><br/>Speaking of being serious...the films climax was one HECK of a ride! The booby traps from the kid was very creative yet amazingly harsh!! I was expecting that the two bandits were to be killed at the end of the movie as they were heavily electrocuted (you SERIOUSLY could die), pelted with stone-hard bricks,(again!) attacked by a heard of pigeons and various nuts, bolts and hammers and fallen through spaces leading to another cruel booby trap (ouch!) and yet they didn't seem to break any part of their body -- let alone be killed!<br/><br/>Yeah, so the booby traps were (like I said) ""harsh"" and the film makes it look like it's so easy to throw bricks at someone and know they'll be just okay... and not dead!... <br/><br/>MY ADVICE: Don't let your kids watch this, seriously acknowledge the PG rating!! <br/><br/>But in spite of the silly action in the climax, I actually enjoyed the climax!! It was the best part in the movie and let me say it kept me on the edge of my seat! <br/><br/>See that's the thing with Home Alone 2, the action just keeps your eyes glued to the screen! There were also some REALLY funny parts as well, like when Kevin was trying to escape from the hotel and of course, the ridiculous climax! (as I've already noted!)<br/><br/>Pushing on to the characters, the relationship between Kevin and the pigeon lady was quite interesting. It just shows that Kevin was not alone and there was always a helping hand (which definitely came in use!*not saying any more, but you could probably work that out! sorry!*). Plus the scene where they had that talk, comprehending their feelings to one another was sweet, in comparison to the part when Kevin gave the lady a mini pigeon as a token of their friendship and saying ""I'll never forget you..."" <br/><br/>What would make Home Alone 2 even better is if there were two stories. One of Kevin's New York Adventure and also one about the family trying to find him. Sure we definitely touched on Kevins' side but what about the family? It would sort of be good if the film was created into like a 'Finding Nemo' type story (but NOT a big drama!) so we would have both adventures...<br/><br/>Overall it comes down to Home Alone 2 to being THE Christmas movie! I genuinely loved it, it was sweet, funny and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. But seriously if you're watching this film with young kids, watch out for the climax! But other than that, I would definitely recommend it!<br/><br/>*********/10 stars!!!<br/><br/>Merry Christmas and a happy new year, everyone! <br/><br/>~Karl <br/><br/>:D"

It is funny, clever, and it takes place in New York City(where I live).It is also one my favorite movies.  This time Kevin is in New York and must defend himself from the same two robbers.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is when Kevin sets up a ""pretend"" father in the shower.  That gave me some good laughs.  I also liked the part when Kevin throws a big bar down the stairs to hit the robbers.<br/><br/>Overall I love this movie like ""Home Alone"" and suggest anyone who saw the first to see this one.  I give this movie 10/10 stars."

","It is awful for his parents left Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) because they forgot him after he went to New York instead of Florida because he thought but not. I feel bad for him but Funny part, he gets his dad's credit card to buy all the foods in the hotel. He was a cute kid(Macaulay Culkin) when I seen in the movie that time I was 10."

","Okay, so this is pretty much a repeat of Home Alone, but that begs the question, how on earth did it make me laugh so much? The slapstick of Harry and Marv is nothing short of genius, and Kevin is as ingenious as ever. I know that it's cheesy, and I know that slapstick isn't everyone's cup of tea, but come on, just enjoy it for what it is - brilliant and silly comedy."
"SouthNorfolkKid","10","1","1","20 May 2002"," Great Film, Weird Story behind it though!
","Possible Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>Well, I was only like 7 when this came out so I didn't see this film till about 4 years later. I do remember hearing lots about this series so I was tickeled to find find out that Fox was showing it Sunday Night, Dec. 8, 1996. I'd taped the original Home Alone, 2 and a half weeks earlier so now I'd get to have both! 'cuz it was a Sunday night I set up the VCR to record it 'cuz I'd be at church that night, we had to pick up someone who needed a ride too so that would take time. It was dark that night and right as the VRC started taping this film, our car got obilterated by a stupid, drunk driver on I-464.<br/><br/>Back to Home Alone 2! As if Kevin's parent didn't learn their lesson from last year, they again lose him! Well, at least they didn't leave him home. Kevin gets separated at the airport. Not that he minds, the night before he said he wanted a vacation all by himself! Now, he's got it and what fun he has in the big apple. After ringing up a huge bill at the Plaza Hotel he goes shopping for toys. Now if you've heard anything at all bout this film you know sooner or later Kevin will meet his pals from the first film. Well, turns out Harry and Marv broke out of prison and are in New York. In a city with millions of people what are the odds they'd meet? In this film, pretty good! I'm amazed that when they do see him there hardly even surprised! And after the beating the took from little Kevin in the first film, You would think they would be the ones to scream and run away from that ""little bundel of Misery"" well, anyways Kevin gets away but he later finds out the ""Sticky Bandits"" (as their now called) are gonna rob the same toy store Kevin went to. Well, thats going to far right? I think so.<br/><br/>Lucky for Kevin, his uncle has an old abandoned apartment nearby. This place is perfect! I'd suppose Kevin couldn't ask for a better place to set traps! Its got holes, paint cans, staple guns, electric generators, gallons of gasoline and kerosine, tool chests, and all this slimy stuff! What ensues makes the poor burglars wish they had stayed in prison! In the end, those poor dudes are dropped from a flaming rope, 4 stories onto a concrete floor, then hit by a dozen paint cans! What pain and anguish! Surely thats a bit harsh, even for burglery and attempted murder (they put a gun to kevins' sweet little blond hair, though we never believe for  a second he'll fire!)<br/><br/>This is right where I got home from church. A friend gave us a ride back and let us borrow a car for a month (which we needed for our paper route). So I got back just in time to see Kevin get reunited with his disfunctional family and then get screamed at FOR SPENDING 967 DOLLARS ON ROOM SERVICE! Great film. Mac just about reached his best in this film (he was perfect in ""The Good Son"" which was his last Good Film!) Wonderful music by John Williams as usual and well, All around a fun film to watch and as I found out, if your car is on a wrecker being towed to the nearest junk yard it'll put you in a good mood!!!!! Five outa Five Stars."
"Chromium_five","2","16","51","14 September 2006"," Prolonged torture = LOL
","This movie does not work. <br/><br/>Making a movie featuring over-the-top cartoon violence CAN work, but only if you never slip out of cartoon mode. A part drama/part cartoon is not going to work. You can't, for example, make a scene with a little kid having a touching conversation with a lonely homeless woman and immediately follow it up with wacky cartoon antics. When you do that, your movie stops being funny and becomes extremely disturbing.<br/><br/>In the first ""Home Alone,"" Kevin only seemed interested in maiming the villains; in this one he is apparently trying to kill them. Case in point: the scene where he is throwing bricks at Marv's head. Not dropping them, but actually THROWING them at the guy's face. From this point on Kevin turns into some sort of demon child on par with the kid from ""Pet Sematary"" as he tries burning, electrocuting, and cracking open the skulls of his victims while shouting things like, ""Nice night for a neck injury!"" (He actually says that). The thought of a theater full of young children laughing at two men being brutally tortured for half an hour really creeps me out.<br/><br/>The only possible reason to watch this is for Tim Curry, one of the world's greatest actors and who steals every scene he's in, but otherwise it's a waste of time."

","I love HA1. It was pure Hollywood hokum, but with such an engaging script a more than capable cast and some pretty sly digs at consumerism etc it tickled just about everyone's funny bone. I especially loved Kevin's parents, who could easily have been cast as bumbling but lovable twits, were actually cast as self absorbed materialistic shallow people! In that movie the potential plot holes were deftly dealt with by bumbling cops, power outages etc. In HA2 there is none of the charm, just an inferior retread. Kevin could just have called the cops and they would have found his family in 5 minutes, yet for some strange reason this doesn't happen! How can we expect a whole roomful of cops and hotel employees to be fooled by a crummy movie soundtrack. They even have to invent a non existent audio device to explain how Kevin could do this. How about a decent plot line and script? Sorry, but the urge to make more cash with the least possible outlay won out. The pits."

"MovieAddict2016","6","3","6","19 February 2003"," Even Though it's Almost Exactly the Same As the Original, it's Still Worth Seeing...
","Home Alone 2  Some Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>He's up past his bedtime in the city that never sleeps.<br/><br/>After the tragic events of the first `Home Alone' film, a now ten-years-old Kevin McCallister is having a bit of a problem. He's been left by his family. Again. Only this time, he's not at home. He's home alonein New York City! And  wait for it  there are some reminiscent faces in this sequel that may be more than reminiscentcriminals Harry and Marv are in NYC too, and they have payback for young Kevin<br/><br/>The original cast and crew are reunited for an all-too-familiar sequel in this star-studded comic fantasy.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin is (supposedly) ten or twelve in this sequel. I can't remember. Anywho, he looks almost exactly the same as he did in the last film. Maybe that's because `Home Alone 2' was filmed barely a year after the first was released, giving Culkin little room to grow. `H:2' is basically the height of Culkin's career before he went on to star in flops such as `The Good Son' (not only a box office flop, but an awful, dull movie).<br/><br/>
John Heard and Catherine O'Hara are back as well, as Peter and Kate McCallister. Thank goodness they got them back for the sequel, otherwise, this would have been a bad movie.<br/><br/>But the actors that I am very surprised they got back for this sequel, and both really made this movie, are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as Harry and Marv respectively. After Pesci and Stern's characters escape from jail, they come to New York and spot Kevin walking down the street, and instantly plan on getting revenge, all the while planning a heist of a toy store on Christmas Eve! That's where Kevin steps in and creates some all too familiar (literally the exact same as the first) booby traps to stop the thieves<br/><br/>This movie takes some fresh scenes  Kevin checking into an expensive hotel with his father's credit car  but never enough. Almost all the scenes are re-hashed from the original, leaving little room for new material. They even go for a sentimental bird-lady scene, much like the one with the shovel man from the first movie<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the sequel still has some good moments. Hotel owner Tim Curry walking into the hotel room and seeing the outline of a man in the shower comes to mind (Kevin has an inflatable clown his Aunt bought him in the shower to fool Curry), and I only wish they had come up with some more original booby traps at the end. That's the downfall of this film.<br/><br/>
With a few more cameos than the first film (Herbert Hoover), `Home Alone 2: Lost In New York' is worth seeing, even if originality isn't its main trait. I also wish they could have brought back John Candy as a small cameo (reprising his role as Gus Polinski: Polka Band Chief) for the film, but they didn't. Oh well. There are some other good stars in this film, anyway<br/><br/>`Saturday Night Live' skit man Rob Schneider co-stars.<br/><br/>3/5 stars (as opposed to 4.5 for the first film)<br/><br/>John Ulmer"
"dbdumonteil","Null","3","6","23 June 2002"," an useless sequel to ""home alone""
","When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question ""was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?"". The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of ""Home Alone"". Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth."

","If you liked the first film at Christmas, good news, a new goofier sequel with the same cast as the first film. This time the McAllister family are going on holiday to Florida and instead of them leaving Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) at home, they bring him and he gets on the wrong plane. He accidentally goes on a plane to New York, his wish came true again. Kevin decides with the help of his good lying and Talkboy to get himself a room at the Plaza Hotel. Only problem is after a little while he is found out. But a bigger problem, the two crooks from the first film, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) have escaped from jail and are coincidently in New York. Another empty house filled with deadly gadgets and new goofy jokes to be seen. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as Kate McCallister, Tim Curry as Mr. Hector, Hotel Concierge and Rob Schneider as Cedrick, Hotel Luggage & Bell Man. Good!"
"srobi280","3","5","14","9 April 2006"," A bad version of the first
","This movie is so much like the first one. There is hardly any originality. Instead of being left at home, he gets lost in New York. It is the same thing, with slight variations. Same two burglars try to get him. He befriends someone he is afraid of, only this time it is a woman. They do the video-gag again (black and white movie) where they think it is a real person talking. The traps are the same more or less, with slight differences, along with a few extra ones, which are totally corny by the way. And so on and so forth. This movie is extremely predictable. Instead of a sequel, this movie should have been made as a ""Scenario B"" to the first one. It would have been good, had the first one never came out, and we wouldn't realize what a blatant rip-off it is."
"lee_eisenberg","4","6","18","18 April 2006"," Daniel Stern said it best: they repeated everything from the first one.
","When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis and Clark College in September, 2004, he explained that in the case of ""Home Alone"", everything was pretty ridiculous, but at least they only did it once; he affirmed that with the second one, they just repeated everything. He's right. ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" does repeat everything. And is it really appropriate to make various and sundry injuries look funny? Personally, I don't know why they have to make sequels (for the record, there was even another sequel or two after this one; fortunately, this was the last part of the franchise that I ever saw). All that I can say is: trust Daniel Stern and avoid this movie."
"Aaron1375","2","3","7","22 January 2010"," Hey let's make the exact same movie...AGAIN!!!
","I give this movie the same score as the last movie mainly because it is essentially the same movie only with a new setting. Yes this time most of the action of this film takes place in a New York hotel where our hero can make grown people shiver in fear with old movies that never really existed in the first place and the same two guys are after him for revenge for what he put him through the last movie. The additions to the cast include Tim Curry as a rather arrogant hotel person, and a bag lady who will teach young Kevin (I think that is the brat's name) some sort of lesson though you think he would have learned enough lessons after his last fiasco, but then how would we have the sequel which is obviously one of those sequels they rushed to get made like they did with the ""Look Who's Talking"" first and second movie and when they rushed ""Moonraker"" after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Batman and Robin"" after ""Batman Forever"". All those examples basically use the same blue print for there movie so you end up with essentially the same movie with a few new moving parts here and there and considering I hated the first one the change in venue did not do anything to make me like this one any more or less. So I guess that is one accomplishment the makers of this film were able to do, I did not hate it more."

","The whole movie ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" was a much better story than the original ""Home Alone"", even though it did have a lot of the same dumb moments in the movie. Things like Kevin's supposed stories getting him access to a plane to New York and entry to an expensive hotel room. Then his family's insult to Florida with their supposed bad experience. For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.<br/><br/>It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.<br/><br/>Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture. Note, after all of this he actually does call the police effortlessly. The whole movie is, for the most part, unbelievable and dumb as well"

","While the original is rightly considered an all-time classic family film, the sequel is nothing more than a lazy cash-grab. It staggers me that John Hughes could just rewrite the exact same story and think it would be acceptable. The only significant difference from the original is that the main characters become even more slapstick and many scenes are just plain stupid as a result. It's a shame to see great actors like Catherine O'Hara and Joe Pesci reduced to this.<br/><br/>Culkin is still very cute and likeable but his character is so unbelievably corny in this movie that it makes some of his scenes painful to watch. Many of his lines feel like they were taken from a cheap self-help book or a fortune cookie. His scenes with Marley in the original were moving and authentic; his scenes with Brenda Fricker aka Pigeon Lady are just forced and contrived. Speaking of Pigeon Lady, surely they could have at least tried to make her resemble an actual homeless person? She looks like a well-fed piano teacher from Surrey.<br/><br/>I really wish I hadn't watched this movie; it's such a shame when these dreadful sequels take the gloss off a great film. It's only Culkin who prevents me giving this a basement rating."

","Writer John Hughes and director Chris Columbus go back to the well, very quickly, for this derivative sequel/remake. Strike while the swinging iron's hot, I suppose, and while the child star can still pass for a nine-year-old. It's basically the first film all over again, with a few negligible tweaks to satisfy convention, less emphasis on the errant family (Catherine O'Hara is now officially the worst mother in America, no need to dwell on it) and a renewed sense of brutality in all the scoundrel-punishing booby traps. Rather than scarred for life, just about every one of these pitfalls would leave poor Harry and Marv pushing daisies. It's a weird level-up for a family movie, downright mean-spirited at times, but that particular brand of action is saved for the closing twenty minutes and almost entirely self-contained.<br/><br/>The rest of the running time is rehash central, with repeat gags and plot points played over a different backdrop, plus the added bonus of Tim Curry and Rob Schneider as a pair of bumbling, high-class hotel clerks. In the end, Home Alone 2 is nothing magical, just a transparent sequel with enough influential industry minds behind it to avoid being sent straight to VHS."

","Following the smash success of the 1990 original, this sequel was inevitable of course, but even so it's a little jarring how it's basically a remake of its predecessor. It follows the same path and beats, has a similar musical score and use of holiday music, and the same effective performances from its returning cast. What's surprising however is how it works just as well the second time around: Macaulay Culkin's misadventures in New York City follow the ""more is better"" theme of many blockbuster sequels so it's much of the same but it's just as much fun as it was in the first movie. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci look like they're having lots of fun as the Sticky Bandits, and series newcomer Tim Curry is a spark of devilish charm in every scene he's in."

The film stars Macaulay Culkin.<br/><br/>It's the story of a boy called Kevin McAllister being left alone, because he missed the plane where his family was. But he had his father's wallet, so he used the credit card to stay in a hotel. Then his family returned to the New York. But while they were searching him, he meets burglars the knew him before.<br/><br/>The film is really about Kevin because he was not frightened when he found out that he was lost. He was resourceful and clever so he used everything he had to survive in the New York and defend from burglars.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is the gripping and very funny comedy. The acting was also great. Overall, it's really enjoyable comedy"

","Home Alone II tells the story of Kevin(Macaulay Culkin)and his family and this time his family are heading to Florida for the Xmas season but Kevin ends up getting lost and he spots a man who he thinks his father but isn't and he winds up in New York City aka The Big Apple where he later meets his criminal friends again and let me tell ya there is more chaos to bring them back to jail again.<br/><br/>Like the first one this is really funny and heartwarming. Macaulay Culkin is funnier than ever and I love how he causes chaos with the two bad boys and in one scene Kevin throws paint cans at them and even sets the same burglar's head on fire again.<br/><br/>Overall its as good as the first one and you should check it out."
"Robert_duder","8","0","0","25 November 2013"," A worthy sequel that believes if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
","Both Home Alone and Home Alone 2 are films very near and dear to my heart. I fell in love with them when I was a youngster and they have always been a permanent staple in my yearly movie watching. Home Alone is probably in my top ten films of all time and what sequel could live up to that? Well...this one. It isn't as good and it has its faults but they took everything that made the first a near instant classic and kept the key elements the same. When you look at Home Alone 2 up close you'll see that it really is just the first film rehashed but isn't that the idea of a sequel? The key is that the filmmakers needs to make sure they do it right. I feel like they did it very right. It has the same heart, the same level of fun, and the same carefree fantasy aspect of a young person on their own. I will say that I feel like Home Alone 2 amps up the violence to an almost extreme level. Certainly younger people watching this need to be told just how ""fantasy"" this film is because he does some pretty wild pranks to Marv and Harry this time around. There are some terrific supporting roles, plenty of laughs and of course that heart and soul that is Home Alone and will actually bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin returns two years later and demonstrates again how terrific his chemistry was on screen. I said the same thing about Home Alone and that is Culkin wasn't and isn't a great actor. In fact, much of his performance in both films is very stiff and awkward and yet you rarely notice it. He has an indescribable charm and I remember as a youngster completely relating to him and loving every minute of his adventures. This was the perfect role for him. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return as everyone's favourite bufoonish criminals. They are truly terrific and I think this is one of Pesci's best roles because it is fun. He is still a worthy villain and just embodies the role so well. You actually do fear him even though he's a bumbling idiot who gets pranked right into prison. And Stern is similar only an even bigger idiot and the two of them together are terrific. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard return as Kevin's parents who ridiculously leave him behind yet again. O'Hara and Heard are perfect for this series and they do such a great job with mostly small roles. They are just the perfect all-American parents. The supporting cast is far more diverse and significant than the first film and they are all really great. Tim Curry and Rob Schneider are both amazing in this and it is insanely fun watching them get pranked. I find them both irritating quite often but in this they are just perfect. Brenda Fricker does a great job as the pigeon lady that Kevin befriends and the very small role by Eddie Bracken is also great.<br/><br/>You can't expect much less than something truly terrific with a script penned by John Hughes and a film directed by Christopher Columbus. I mean these two guys together are gold when it comes to family films or capturing emotion in a coming of age/youthful sort of way. I've actually seen nearly every film Columbus has done and they all range from really good to amazing so the guy knows his genre absolutely. They knew what audiences loved about Home Alone and they gave them the exact same thing again with enough of a different story to make it stand on its own merits. I will say that Home Alone 2 feels a little less like a ""Holiday"" movie than the first one did. Both are set at Christmas but I felt like this one didn't have quite the same Christmas feel to it perhaps because it was set in the big city instead of a home. Regardless if you like or love Home Alone then you can't help but at least enjoy this decent sequel. Its a little darker and a little less kiddie friendly (I happen to think both films aren't exactly right for the real young ones) but in my mind and in my house these will always be staples. 8.5/10"

","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a great movie with a very well put together family friendly storyline with a great cast.If you enjoyed the first Home Alone,if not better.Its certainly more exciting because the characters go all around New York rather than staying at the house the whole time.Macauley Culkin is great as usual,he was a very good actor for his age and I also really appreciated Tim Curry,I really enjoy the creepy tone of voice he can put on and it really suited the character.The worst part about the movie and the only real problem I had was Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern,as much as I liked them in the first,they were just thrown in to this one randomly and just happened to be in the same city as Kevin,it gets even more ridiculous towards the end when Kevin try's to stop them from robbing a toy store,the two are just getting injured over and over again for about twenty minutes with very little dialogue,I like both if these actors,but I didn't appreciate them in this movie and think it would have been better not having them in it.If you enjoyed the first Home Alone then you will certainly enjoy Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,it's fun for the whole family. <br/><br/>Kevin ends up in a swish New York hotel while his family are in Florida,but meanwhile the two burglars he defeated before plan to rob a toy store"

","""Merry Christmas and a happy new year!""<br/><br/>I remember watching this film over and over in Christmas with my brother, and my mother rolling her eyes saying ""You're watching this again?""<br/><br/>As some people say, I also think the plot is pretty much the same with the first one. The parents leave their young child, Kevin, alone and he defeats the burglars in the last, and this just continues for another 3 more movies. However, what I think made this one so special was because this movie is like a dream for a growing child. Exploring a city you've never been, staying in a big hotel room, going to a big toy store, and finally defeating the bad guys, all alone without your parents telling what you should and shouldn't do. And I'm probably not the only one who tried to make the booby traps Kevin came up with in the movie.<br/><br/>When I was little this movie was everything that I wanted to do, it was a dream. Now I'm older I see this movies as something that brings me back and remember how I used to see things more simple and happily. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a fun movie, perfect to watch sitting in the couch with a cup of hot chocolate remembering how exciting Christmas was when you were younger."

"mike48128","8","0","0","31 December 2012"," A Worthy Sequel. There's More Going On
","Leonard Maltin is wrong. Here's a sequel that almost outshines the first movie. There's a lot more going on in this one. Let's make one thing perfectly clear: The McCallister Family must be filthy rich. They live in a multi-million dollar home and here they go again; jetting off to Florida and then NYC. All the annoying characters are here including cheap Uncle Frank and Buzz. The ""wet bandits"" Harry and Marv are here too, but this time the action takes place in NYC not Illinois. Also, Marv seems dumber (if that is possible) and Harry is meaner and carries a gun.<br/><br/>There are more memorable characters in this one: Tim Curry and Rob Scheider as the Plaza Hotel manager and bellhop. The pigeon lady. The toy store owner. More scenery too: Rockefeller Plaza and New York City at Christmastime, Carnegie Hall, Central Park. More product ""plugs"": The Plaza Hotel, American Airlines, The ""talkboy"" toy recorder. Donald Trump and several other ""walk-ons"".<br/><br/>The basic plot is similar to the first movie. Again, the family oversleeps and rushes to the airport. Kevin loses his way at the airport and ends up on the wrong plane this time instead of missing it entirely. He is hurried on-board without a ticket check. When the family lands in Florida, mom, once again, spends half the movie trying to find Kevin. He is traced to NYC because he manages to use his dad's ""stolen"" credit card to stay at The Plaza. This entire storyline is preposterous today with TSA and airline ticket double checks, but it worked in 1992.<br/><br/>So, Kevin is alone again. This time in New York City. He runs into Marv and Harry by accident. They are fugitives from jail. This time, they plan to rob ""Duncan's Toy Chest"" which is a lot like the F.A.O. Schwartz Toy store, only more magical. Kevin defends the store and takes photos of the robbers, who chase him to a relative's apartment which is in a state of remodeling disrepair. Again, there is no one home.(Marv's skull is so dense that bricks bounce off of it, only leaving minor dents.) Marv wants the camera's negatives, which is impossible-it's a Polaroid Camera! Kevin creates another ""Rube Goldberg"" style obstacle course for the robbers, which seems a bit more tiresome this time. (We've seen it all before, but I love the blowtorch and exploding toilet.) Kevin tricks them into chasing him into Central Park at night. The robbers are thwarted by an unbelievable combination of pigeon feed, hungry pigeons and slippery ice. Kevin shoots off fireworks, and this signals the police to pick up the bandits. Plot holes: Who would sell such powerful fireworks to an under-age kid? How convenient that all the locations are close to each other (?) Somehow, the entire family finds their way to the Plaza Hotel in New York and Kevin finds his way to Rockefeller Plaza. Everyone is together again on Christmas morning, only this time it's in NYC. Another rousing John Williams musical score. It's a bit long with a running time of 2 hrs.<br/><br/>Other comments: ""Fake swearing"" so nothing really objectionable. ""Talkboy"" was an actual Tiger Electronics toy. The comic violence is no worse than a ""Looney Tunes"" cartoon or The 3 Stooges. It's not sadistic, it's totally unbelievable. A silly and funny sequel. Only John Hughes could imagine such a film."
"alex-caruso1","Null","0","0","14 November 2012"," What I call an excellent sequel.
","In my opinion, Home Alone 2 is just as funny if not funnier than the first Home Alone. It was the same idea as the first, but they added different twists that made it a great sequel. The traps throughout this one were almost the same as the traps in the first movie, but they got even more creative. Even the plot was perfectly executed. Instead of getting left Home Alone again, Kevin gets split up from his family at the airport, and accidentally jumps on the wrong plane after he follows a man who looks like his dad. This plane lands him in New York city. The title to the movie is a little misleading, because he's anywhere but home, he's lost in New York. The movie got a lot more cartoonish and unrealistic compared to the first one when it came to all the slapstick parts, but Home Alone 2 had me laughing just as hard as the 1st Home Alone. The idea, the story, how well it was all played out just made this an excellent sequel to the classic Home Alone."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","0","12 May 2012"," He's not really Home Alone, and he's not really LOST in New York . . .
","*** SPOILER ALERT *** Technically, Kevin isn't home alone this time and he is never really lost in New York. Actually, he knows exactly where he is and exactly how he got there. That's not the only plot hole in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, a carbon copy retread of the highest grossing comedy of all time with almost none of that film's wit or charm. There wasn't an urgent need for this movie beyond an opportunity to cash in on the brand name. Hey, money talks.<br/><br/>Whereas Home Alone found a somewhat plausible explanation for Kevin's separation from his family, this one redefines the word ""contrived"". The McAllistar family has decided this time to take a trip to Florida for Christmas. The night before their departure, Kevin's Dad (John Heard, again) accidentally unplugs the clock radio, leading me to ask the following: Since they had this same problem last year, why not take extra precautions and buy battery operated clock? How about an alarm clock? A kitchen timer? A rooster? Because we wouldn't have a movie, that's why.<br/><br/>This time at least Kevin makes it as far as the airport, but the mish-mash that sends him off on his adventure occurs in the mass of humanity pushing through the airport terminal. Kevin loses sight of the family while changing the batteries in his Talkboy. The family gets on a plane to Florida, while Kevin boards a plane to New York.<br/><br/>In New York, Kevin has a ball seeing the sights and touring the town in a way that no kid on Earth could possibly do without parental supervision. He is also able to con a bunch of dimwitted adults into giving him a master suite at the Park Plaza hotel, using his father's credit card. How he's able to do this is something that simply has to be accepted, not analyzed. He is able to fool the staff into thinking that his father is present even though no one on the staff ever sees him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry and Marv (Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern), the two thug burglars from the original just happen to have escaped prison and made their way to New York. Their plot is to rob a giant F.A.O. Schwartz-type toy store and steal the money that is intended to go to a children's hospital. The store is run by Eddie Braken who, in a bizarre (or should I say contrived) coincidence, just happens to have made friends with Kevin. ""You can mess with a lot of things"", Kevin says, ""but you can't mess with kids on Christmas."" So, that leads inevitably to the big pratfall extravaganza of full of fake doorknobs, paint cans-to-the-face and shots the groin as Kevin unleashes a hell-storm of practical jokes. What worked in the original, somehow feels mean-spirited here. The climax takes place in a townhouse that is being renovated where Kevin drops 100 pound sacks of cement on the burglars and even electrocutes one with an arc welder. I don't know why but somehow the pratfalls felt nasty and mean-spirited. What was mildly funny in the original just seems cruel here, right down to the point where Harry gets so frustrated with little Kevin that he traps the kid in Central Park and puts a gun in his face.<br/><br/>So basically, this film, with a change in location repeats exactly the same formula as the first one. All charm and wit (not to mention originality) of Home Alone are gone except for the presence of Macaulay Culkin whose performance here is probably better than the movie deserves. He's a natural actor, yes, but what is special about him is his delivery. There are moments here when he grabs a facial expression at just the right moment. He has a pure God-given gift for comedy.<br/><br/>I just wish that writer John Hughes and director Chris Columbus could have come up with something more original for him to do. Culkin works well under the circumstances, but no one in the cast can escape the fact that is not a formula that can be stretched into a workable sequel. Everything here is a copy of the original right down to Kevin's friendship with a Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) who lives in the park. His friendship with Old Man Marley in the first film was sweet because it had a touching payoff. His friendship with the Pigeon Lady goes nowhere.<br/><br/>If there is one thing (besides Culkin) that I did like in Home Alone 2 it was it was the performance of Catherine O'Hara who again plays Kevin's mother. O'Hara is a veteran of SCTV, and a very gifted comedienne, but something about her performance in this film felt real. Not the comedy bits, but in the drama. She has a son who is somewhere in New York and the fear and confusion that she displays feels real. I only wished that I could have seen more of her and less of the burglars. I also wish that I could have seen more of her with Kevin than just a brief scene at the beginning and at the end.<br/><br/>I am positive that kids will love this movie. There's no doubt. I am hoping that if there is a Home Alone 3, it will move in another direction, maybe embracing the relationship between Kevin and his mother and allowing us to get to know them without separating them. Maybe next time, the whole family could stay home alone. Just saying."

","This is probably the first time that the sequel is just as good, if not better, than the first movie. I find Home Alone 2 is a lot more exciting than Home Alone. First of all, they're in New York City! What's not to love about that? Almost every great movie is set in New York City. Next, instead of being somewhere he knows like the back of his hand, Kevin is all alone in a huge city. He has to fend for himself and make up a lot more lies than in the original, yet still gets away with them - for the most part.<br/><br/>This movie is also a little more realistic than the first. The whole time I was watching the first movie, I was thinking, why don't the parents just call the house and talk to Kevin? I know there's a phone there. In this one, they can't reach Kevin because there's no way. They don't know which flight he got on, so that means he could be anywhere in the world. Of course, what are the chances that you're going to see the same robbers you've put away in jail last year just walking around in New York City? That was very unrealistic, but the movie's just so cute and adorable, I can forgive them for that.<br/><br/>This movie is so sweet, and the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday night. It will undoubtedly make you finish the movie feeling a lot better than before."

","Home Alone 2 tops the first Home Alone. It's even funnier and the the two burglars take an even more savage thrashing this time around from the charming and witty Kevin. It is also a more exciting movie. It makes you feel the rush that a smart young kid like Kevin (if there even are any in real life) would feel being alone in the sprawling metropolis of New York City, having the time of his life. We soon meet Harry and Marv again, but it takes a while for that inevitable moment which we eagerly anticipate of Kevin and the two Burglars bumping into each other. Kevin's final showdown with Harry and Marv takes place in an abandoned three story town house, in which he has some very nasty tricks up his sleeve to keep them at bay. This is where the movie has some minor issues. It is hard to believe how the two burglars fall for pretty much the same old tricks as they did during their first encounter with Kevin in the original. Also, at times they stand around like buffoons as Kevin sends heavy objects hurtling towards them instead of trying to dodge out of the way. Still, some of the slapstick involving Kevin's new booby traps is believable enough, not taking into account some of the physics involved and the amount of punishment Harry and Marv can take. My what troopers they are in this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is solid entertainment for a lazy night in. For vegging out on the couch and switching your brain off, Home Alone 2 is hard to beat."

Thereis nothing particularly unique about the Home Alone series where a precocious kid (Macaulay Culkin) outsmarts some crooks and subjects them to rather painful cartoon-like violence. If anything, the violence is worse this time round. However, the setting is Christmas which gives the perfect excuse for a family-friendly soundtrack. Culkin is decent though a bit too smart while Joe Pesci brings a lot of energy to his role. This is a pleasant watch specially at home on television/DVD.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10"

Director Chris Colombus really shows great talent on producing ideal family films. The laughs are as effective as always and, like the original, it doesn't forget to integrate great family values. This time around, little Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) isn't home alone, he's lost in the Big Apple, and he has his dad's credit card and cash to give him the ultimate vacation, until The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), show up, and plots a big Christmas heist.<br/><br/>Okay, it isn't very different to or better than its predecessor, but at least it's better than the other two sequels.

In Home Alone 2 one year later he is 10. In Home Alone 2 its made clear that its the following Christmas. This mistake has never come up before and I thought others would have noticed. Also, notice how calm the mother is considering her 8 year old is alone. Its amazing that the movie did as well as it did. It was a great film though. But, I wanted to point out that mistake with the age difference. How did he skip an age by the following Christmas. Home Alone is a year round film in my house."

So its easy to see why Chris Columbus wanted to do another again. I have to admit it was a good movie... it was funny and had a great Christmas feel. Too bad it was almost the same as the first movie! Sure, they changed the scene, instead of his own home in Chicago, Kevin is stuck alone in New York. Therefore, it was exciting for about 30 minutes into the movie. This all changed however, when the bad guys appeared... everything, from most of the tricks to meeting a new friend who is much older than him is the same as the first movie! <br/><br/>I'd advise this movie to anyone who hasn't watched Home Alone before, but if you'd watch it, then DON'T BOTHER."

HA2 delivers the poster child for UMC child neglect, Macaulay Culkin to New York wherein he is once again pursued by lunk-heads Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The locale is different, but the story is almost identical.<br/><br/>The only major change is that Kevin and you, the audience, get to see actual homeless people in a big American city, and the audience is expected to tear up at all the meaningful Christmasness therein with a collective sob. This breaking out in a rash of caring, which is slightly less than skin deep, is the only way for the movie makers to mask their greed in making this cynical trash."

","This film a sequel to 'Home alone' which came out 2 years earlier is more of a remake than a sequel, but is nonetheless entertaining for Kids/some adults if it isn't as good as the original. The plot is pretty much the same - The Mccalister family go on a christmas holiday yet again this time to Florida, They wake up late... again, they rush to the airport....again and yes, they leave Kevin (Culkin) behind once again but this time not at home - but at the airport, they run too fast through the building that Kevin can't catch up and ends up following who he thinks is his father but alas is not, The family go to Florida while Kevin ends up in Cold, Snowy New York city. He ends up in a upmarket hotel with his Father's credit card while the slimy concierge (Tim Curry) tries to find out more about him. along the way he meets just released burglars HARRY & MARV (played with enthusiasm once more by Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) once again and has to foil their plan to burgle a Toy shop.<br/><br/>Please be aware:- This sequel is more violent than it's predessesor (i.e while at least 50 feet up on a building Kevin throws a concrete brick at hits marv right on the head - In real life he would be dead - but no he faints and gets up seconds later which is a very bad example to young children who may try and copy it against their family)<br/><br/>The snowy New York scenery is wonderful and makes you feel warm inside and has a great christmasy soundtrack. Pesci & Stern do their best as bumbling burglars. It also has a wonderful role for Irish Actress Brenda Fricker as a pidgeon woman who lives in central park. It's done with a lot of style by Chris Columbus who directed the first and has since gone on to the Harry Potter series of films, and has a pretty good screenplay by Beethoven creator John Hughes.<br/><br/>All in all a great film for almost all the family - it may be bigger but try as they might it's no better than the first<br/><br/>My rating 7/10<br/><br/>Followed By Home alone 3 (1997) & Home Alone 4!!

"Coolguy-7","Null","0","0","31 March 2000"," This time, he's in New York
","This is a great sequel to the first ""Home Alone"" movie. This time we have Kevin being lost in New York after getting on the wrong plane.  I remember seeing this movie for the first time at a theater with my family.  Many of the characters in here are the same including the two burglars, Marv and Harry.  Others such as the poor woman who Kevin makes friends with and the hotel clerk played by Tim Curry(who also plays Rooster in the musical, ""Annie"") are first introduced in the series.  This movie had tons of humor and suspense.  One part I liked was where Kevin played a gangster video in his room and some of the staff came over.  They were standing out of Kevin's hotel room and thought there really was a man in there.  The gangster says ""I'll forgive you if you bend down on your knees and say you love me!""  The staff bent down and said ""I love you!"" The gangster in the movie shot at a woman and the staff thought he was really shooting at someone in the hotel room.  I haven't forgotten about Marv and Harry.  Seeing those two get into all sorts of new (and more violent) booby traps was okay, but it got to be quite painful-looking.  For example, when Marv falls through a hole and lands on the hard cement floor, he turns out to just have minor pains.  In reality of course, that would've killed him.  I think that I like this film better than the first one even though it's a bit more violent, but who cares about the violence.  It's only a movie!"

"DavidSim240183","3","3","8","30 October 2008"," The more things change, the more they stay the same
","Home Alone took everyone by surprise when it became the top money-earner of 1990. Director Chris Columbus, writer/producer John Hughes and most of the cast and production staff reunited two years later for this sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. But the cynic in one has to ask, did we really need a sequel to Home Alone?<br/><br/>It feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure-fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc. This was Chris Columbus' first time directing a sequel, and as expected, he falls into the exact same trap that cripples many a sequel. He fails to do anything different with it.<br/><br/>It may have traded in being left at home for the city of New York, but its still the same exact story as last time. Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, obnoxious as ever) is separated from his family at Christmas. He enjoys the freedom to do whatever he wants. Until things turn sour. The burglars are back, and just happen to be in New York as well. He sets up another mine field of home-made booby traps for them. The lonely snow-shoveller from Pt 1 has been replaced with a lonely pigeon lady. She rescues him. He gets reunited with his family.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2 feels like a much more calculated attempt to recreate the successful elements of Home Alone. The first was not quite a holiday classic, but it was reasonably successful. Due to John Hughes' fine screenplay rather than anything on Columbus' part. Pt 2 sticks to the formula laid out by Pt 1 with an almost alarming reverence.<br/><br/>It ticks off each situation like a check-list. And I'm afraid the fault for that lies with John Hughes. His script has none of the tiny amusements or sharp insights that propelled the first film. He's just copied his own screenplay, and grafted it onto a new setting. I think it was around this point that John Hughes sold himself out to Hollywood. Nowadays he only churns out increasingly formulaic fluff. Merely the same concept with whole different actors.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus has also borrowed an idea or two from his debut feature, Adventures in Babysitting. The story of four kids lost on the streets of Chicago one night. That film always seemed like a missed opportunity to me. Chris Columbus is far too bland as a filmmaker. He played the whole situation too safely, and never really got the best out of it. In fact when I first saw it, I thought if it had been made by John Hughes, it could have been a much better film. I was hoping for that with Home Alone 2, but unfortunately I didn't get it.<br/><br/>This is an even greater disappointment. Columbus' blandness coupled with Hughes' lack of imagination all adds up to a very boring film. Home Alone 2 never really ignites. It misses the natural warmth and amusing developments of the first film by a mile. There is something almost mechanical to it all. Like watching different plot points clicking into place at exact moments. But the one thing that really works against the film is Macaulay Culkin.<br/><br/>Home Alone got a lot of mileage from young Kevin's innocent, wide-eyed view of his predicament. By this point, that innocence has all but gone. Culkin's precocity has completely taken over, and now he's just an obnoxious brat we couldn't care less about. Its impossible to feel for his plight because he's so unlikable. And having him mouth inane sentiments in a shallow attempt to make him seem wise only irritates. They lack any conviction and hollows out an already empty film.<br/><br/>We do get a few amusements from some of the new members of the cast. Tim Curry gets a few laughs as the manager of the Plaza Hotel. In a performance seemingly modelled on Basil Fawlty, his growing suspicion of Kevin is pretty funny, even if he's a bit stupid to be suckered in by Kevin's tricks. And Dana Ivey and Rob Schneider fill out the cast nicely as the equally suspicious (and equally stupid) hotel staff.<br/><br/>But nothing else works. There are times when Home Alone 2 thinks its being really clever, by dropping in knowing references to the first film, in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash. But it is. And its not above reusing the same gags either. We even get another film that Kevin uses to dupe people with. Which also happens to be a sequel. You can almost imagine Chris Columbus and John Hughes patting themselves on the backs at times like that.<br/><br/>Of course what people come to see the movie for is Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) going through another of Kevin's obstacle courses. But where it proved to be the comic high point of the first film, Chris Columbus has blown it up to absurd proportions for this one. The traps in Pt 1 were at least kept within the boundaries of plausibility, but sadly Columbus has thrown all that out the window. Its amazing they're still breathing, much less walking after the things they go through this time. They even fall off the top of a building with no apparent after effects. Its at this point you realise you're watching the live-action equivalent of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Only not as funny.<br/><br/>I don't even want to talk about the improbable, contrived happy ending. Home Alone 2 is a real stinker. Its never as funny as it likes to think it is, or as warm either. Its just a pointless sequel that only reveals a blatant calculation at the heart of the enterprise. Another bland film from the drab Chris Columbus, and the start of the sad decline of John Hughes' once proud career."

","This is my favourite Home Alone movie. I, like many, almost like everything about this movie. Why? In Home Alone 2, the stakes are higher. The clue is in the title - ""Lost in New York"".<br/><br/>Kevin, the central character, is now in unfamiliar territory in one of the world's largest cities: New York.<br/><br/>My favourite parts are those involving the ""Plaza Hotel"" in New York City. Everything about that was brilliant or spectacular shall we say. I'm sure all of you would agree. I liked how Kevin just dupes everyone working within that hotel, and better yet, he's only a kid. That was so cool!<br/><br/>What I find amazing is that his problems doesn't just stop there. It continues further, with the people he ran into before - ""The Sticky Bandits"". Somehow, Kevin just finds his way through unfamiliar territory.<br/><br/>I like the setting of this movie. It was based on New York, and that is why a lot of people liked Home Alone 2 - the setting, makes all the difference. The story is good. It is set one year after the last one. There's no other way Home Alone 2 could've worked.<br/><br/>It's important to remember the title: ""Lost in New York"", and that's what it was. In the first movie, Kevin was all ""Home Alone"". We all knew that and saw that, but in the second movie, he's all alone again, except this time, in a city. That's why it's called ""Lost in New York"", and before that ""Home Alone"" because the cast from the first movie is the same and returned for this instalment. That's why it's Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. People forget to look at movie titles very closely and carefully, especially for ""Home Alone"".<br/><br/>There's nothing to not understand except it's a brilliant film, and one of the best and finest Christmas sequels around."

They quite literally change nothing but the location and the scary man was now a scary lady. Everything else was virtually the same with the exception of some small tweaks. They even got up late again and were scurrying out of the house! It was a regular act of laziness on the part of Hollywood. Without even doing any homework I'm guessing it raked in a gajillion dollars--nothing like the first one, but mad money for a sequel. Yes, it was entertaining... for a rerun."

"Electrified_Voltage","5","2","5","7 January 2010"," An unfunny and fairly tiring sequel that copies its predecessor too much
","I saw a bit of this film on TV as a kid, but didn't know it was ""Home Alone 2"". For many years, I thought maybe it was the original ""Home Alone"" I was seeing, until last year, when I finally watched that successful family Christmas movie for the first time and didn't recognize any of it. I found the original to be overrated, and couldn't understand why it was such an incredibly huge success at the box office during its theatrical run in 1990, but at least I laughed at times. It's been nearly a year since I saw that one, and I finally found a copy of ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" to rent earlier this week. In my opinion, the original is a mixed blessing, slightly above average, but this 1992 sequel isn't even that. It's basically just average.<br/><br/>This year, the McCallister family in Chicago has another Christmas trip planned, a trip to Miami, Florida. On the day of their flight, the parents, Kate and Peter, once again sleep in and have to hurry, but nobody is left at home this time. However, Kevin, who was the one left at home on the previous trip, is accidentally separated from his family at the airport in Chicago, and gets on the wrong plane! While the rest of the family go to Miami, Kevin ends up in New York City, and the others don't realize he's not with them until they have arrived at their destination! Trying to find him will not be easy, as he is not in Chicago, and his parents don't know where else he could have gone! Meanwhile, Kevin decides to make the best of the situation, and manages to rent out a hotel suite using his father's credit card. Unbeknownst to the lost boy, his old enemies, Harry and Marv, have escaped from prison, and are in the same city as him! <br/><br/>Just like the first film, this sequel begins in the McCallister household, with more unfunny quarrelling in the family, and it's sometimes a little too mean-spirited. The part where Kevin sees his Uncle Frank in the shower is pretty lame, and it's not the only gag in the film that can be described that way. The movie continues to be very straight-faced for a long time, definitely longer than its predecessor, and never does get as funny. It often seems like they were pathetically trying to replicate the original ""Home Alone"", which doesn't help. I think I consistently kept a straight face until the part where they've arrived in Miami and Kate McCallister (still played by Catherine O'Hara) faints when she realizes Kevin isn't there. This was the first of several gags that made me smile, but O'Hara certainly doesn't do as much for this film as she did for the original ""Home Alone"". I came close to laughing for the first time when Kevin uses part of a movie to scare off hotel staff members while he escapes, but I don't think the movie gag ever gets as funny as it does in the previous film. I lightly snickered at the part where Marv falls after entering a home under renovation, not realizing there's no floor in front of him, but I never found any big laughs. In fact, there are hardly any laughs at all, and only occasional gags that made me smile.<br/><br/>Watching this sequel made me think of the ""Home Alone 5"" joke in the short-lived mid-nineties cartoon series, ""The Critic"". I think watching ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" helped me get a slightly better understanding of that spoof. This movie does show a lot of repetition after its predecessor. In both films, Kevin is accidentally abandoned by his family, he's afraid of a certain adult stranger he sees more than once but eventually gets to know them and befriends them, he puts Harry and Marv through loads of slapstick mayhem before they finally catch him, and then he is saved by his new friend. Not only is ""Home Alone 2"" not very original, it's also not very funny. After the first two films in the franchise, ""Home Alone 3"" was released in 1997, and ""Home Alone 4"" in 2002. These films both feature different casts (Macaulay Culkin was obviously too old to star in them by the time they were made), and the third one features different characters. The franchise clearly didn't go in the direction predicted in ""The Critic"", but since the two later movies both seem pretty unpopular, and are apparently worse than this mediocre second film, I really don't think I'll be watching either of them."

I get that McCauley Culkin's goofy grin, floppy hair, big ears plus of course that scream of his might irritate some but I otherwise found all these plus his smartness and rebelliousness quite acceptable.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way the writer and director, knowing that this is a sequel bound to end up with the same slap-sticky, booby-trapped conclusion as its mega-successful predecessor found a clever and even credible way to separate Kevin again from his family. I loved the New York winter locations while on the acting side, I equally enjoyed the cameo as toy-store owner Mr Duncan by veteran Eddie Bracken, who starred in so many great Preston Sturges films of the 40's. John Williams also delivers a playful soundtrack in keeping with the frivolities depicted on the screen.<br/><br/>In these and other ways, director Chris Columbus harks back to those Golden Age Hollywood days, not by coincidence is ""It's A Wonderful Life"" referenced again in one of his movies, but here too he contributes a lasting seasonal classic which I dare say will likewise be watched and enjoyed by families at Yule time down the years."

","'Home Alone' bust box office figures when it first appeared in 1990, spawning video game spin-offs and making a celebrity of its star, Macaulay Culkin. A sequel then was a racing certainty. Two years later, it appeared, under the title 'Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York'.<br/><br/>A year has passed ( in the context of the film at least ) since Kevin's hair raising being left at home alone experience. On the night before a Christmas vacation to Florida, Kevin is in trouble yet again after getting into another brawl with his older brother Buzz. After being reprimanded by his mother, Kevin wishes aloud that he was able to go on his own vacation without his family. The following morning, the family ( surprise surprise ) sleep through their alarm again ( as Peter, Kevin's dad, absent mindedly unplugged it the night before ), causing them to leave for the airport in a tearing hurry. Unfortunately, whilst Kevin manages to make it to the airport with his family, he ends up getting lost in the crowd and ends up accidentally boarding a flight to New York whilst his family are flying to Florida.<br/><br/>Kevin's initial shock is turned to joy when he realises he is left alone to have his own vacation and so checks himself into The Plaza Hotel using his father's credit card ( which he has as he was holding his dad's bag at the airport when he got lost ). Kevin eventually flees from the hotel when he is confronted by the staff about the card, whereupon he runs into Harry and Marv, who have recently bust out of jail and have renamed themselves 'The Sticky Bandits' instead of 'The Wet Bandits'. The try to exact revenge on Kevin and follow him when he seeks refuge in the house of one of his relatives, which is under renovation. The goons yet again ( well, you knew it was coming, didn't you? ) fall foul to Kevin's various booby traps that he has hastily set around the house. The two eventually get arrested after their location was made known by 'the pigeon lady', a homeless old lady who tends to the pigeons in the park and ( like Old Man Marley from the first film ) who Kevin was at first afraid of but later befriended.<br/><br/>Eventually, Kevin is reunited happily with his family when they arrive in New York after the police managed to track Kevin down.<br/><br/>'Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York' is in some ways better than it predecessor, partly due to the wonderful location shooting in New York and mainly due to the toning up of Harry and Marv's suffering at the hands of Kevin. At one point, Marv is electrocuted, has a bag of cement dumped on his head, is struck in the face repeatedly with bricks and shot in the groin with a nail gun whilst Harry yet again has his head torched with a blow lamp, is crushed against a wall by a tool chest and thrown into the air and on top of a parked car. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are as hilarious as ever as Harry and Marv but it is again Culkin who shines throughout. John Hughes' script yet again is full of many wonderful one liners, particularly when Harry and Marv arrive in New York after sneaking to the back of a fish lorry, which leads to a hilarious debate between Harry and Marv about the difference between the smell of freedom and fish ( I won't even attempt to do it justice here ). Like the first, a computer game version of this film was released the same year for both the Sega and Nintendo systems.<br/><br/>Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, Devin Ratray, Kieran Culkin and Gerry Bamman all reprise their roles as Kevin's family whilst appearing in the supporting cast are Tim Curry, Dana Ivey, Rob Schneider, Brenda Fricker and Eddie Bracken. Donald Trump ( yuck ) makes a surprise cameo appearance in the first scene shot in the plaza hotel.<br/><br/>Plans for a third 'Home Alone' film came to fruition in the late '90's which was initially to have Culkin reprise his role, this time as a teenage Kevin McAllister. However, Culkin passed on the role and it went instead to Alex D. Linz who played Alex Pruddit. 'Home Alone 3' was not surprisingly as well received as the first two but was successful nonetheless, which is more that could be said for 'Home Alone 4' ( which had Mark Weinberg as Kevin McAllister and appeared in 2003 ). Audiences groaned! The 2012 television film 'Home Alone - The Holiday Heist' was no better.<br/><br/>A great Christmas romp to be enjoyed by the family over and over again!<br/><br/>Funniest moment - the aforementioned 'freedom' and 'fish' moment!"

","Well the Christmas season will be upon us soon! To help celebrate my all time favorite time of year, I have certain holiday movies. Home Alone 2: lost in New York is one of my favorites. This sequel to the 1990 hit is better than the original in many ways if you ask me. Culkin is no different here, he's just fine, like in the original. What is better/different here is the quality of comedy and the entertainment value. The first home alone certainly isn't bad, but I do feel like this one exceeds the original as far as entertainment goes. Joe Pesci and his assistant Marv (the sticky bandits) are even better/funnier here than the first time around. The action is better here, and in my opinion, the acting is better. I really loved Catherine O'Hara here too, thought she was hilarious in her role, and the dialogue her character is given really helps boost her funny, touching performance. ""The way I'm feeling no mugger/murderer would dare mess with me"". Lol bravo. John heard is fine here, his acting/character really doesn't have to be good in any way, his character is okay just kinda being there. The subplot with Kevin and the homeless woman who saves him is very sweet and touching, I really do love that they included that in the film's plot, really added a lot to it. Tim Curry is also to be applauded too for his funny performance as the Ritz hotel manager. 8/10."

","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a Christmas family comedy that was written and directed by John Hughes and Chris Columbus respectively.It was a sequel to the highest grossing holiday comedy,Home Alone.Macaulay Culkin returns as Kevin McCallister,who in the story is once again left on his own by his parents and once again goes up against his former nemeses who tried to rob their house,the Wet Bandits,portrayed by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, Tim Curry, and Brenda Fricker are also featured.<br/><br/>Once again Kevin McCallister's family leave him behind.This time,he he gets on a flight to New York instead of going with his family to Miami. Kevin manages to get a cab and gets into the Plaza Hotel.Using his father's credit card,he was able to rent a suite and was able to escape as well as fool hotel employees. But then he runs into his old enemies Harry and Marv. When he finds out that they plan on robbing the old man's toy store on Christmas Eve,he tries to stop them from succeeding and battles again them just like in the original film.<br/><br/>While this sequel is almost the same plot as the first film,it still manages to provide joy and entertainment to the viewers.Kevin surprisingly was able to show a few tricks as he goes up against his enemies especially being left alone in a big city like New York.The performance of the cast was good.Special mention should be given to Culkin and Pesci as Kevin and Harry.Despite the fact that it provides nothing new,it is still fair to say that the sequel was not bad and it would probably be comparable to the original film.No wonder a lot of people still saw it when it was theatrically released."
"bayardhiler","9","1","2","22 January 2015"," A Worthy Sequel To A Holiday Classic
","Normally, sequels to great films more often than not fail to live up to the first one, usually because the producers feel the urge to rush them out with whatever story they can glue together in five minutes without incorporating what made the original film great. Every now and then, though, sometimes Hollywood gets it right a second time. 1992's ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is one such case. Taking place one year after the events in the first film, the cast once again includes the charming Macaulay Culkin as that devilish but lovable Kevin McCallister and pretty much everyone else, from Catherine O'Hara as the mother, to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the bungling thieves Harry and Marv. Once again the family is readying for another Christmas trip, this time to Miami, and like the first one, the alarm doesn't go off when it's supposed and it's a mad rush to the airport. Only this time, instead of leaving Kevin behind, Kevin manages to get to the airport but alas gets on the wrong flight after following a man who has the same coat, same hair style from the back as his father does! As you can probably guess from the title, Kevin ends up in New York, checks into the fancy Plaza Hotel with his dad's credit card (Were we are treated to a cameo from the Donald himself, Mr. Donald Trump, the owner of the hotel at the time) and living the dream. However, he won't be able to rest for long; Harry and Marv have busted out of prison and they decide to go to (Where else?) New York. Of course, it means another Christmas in the trenches as Kevin must prevent the two heartless but dimwitted thieves from knocking off a toy store whose proceeds are to go to the children's hospital. Can Kevin win again or are the tables to be turned?<br/><br/>Although it may not be quite on the same level as the first one, I can honestly say I have just as much fun watching ""Home Alone 2"" every year as I do the original. A big reason for this is probably due to the return of almost all the cast members, and I do mean almost everyone, from John Heard as the father to Gerry Bamman as the much hated Uncle Frank. Another reason is the return of Chris Columbus as director, whose shots of New York are as dazzling and enchanting as those in the first one. Indeed, Central Park has rarely been filmed as beautifully as it is here. Plus, the script is once again written by the late, great John Hughes, which means the story has plenty of laughs in addition to heart. True, the skits in this one are a bit more outrageous than in the original (In one scene, the film asks us to believe that a person, in this case Marv, can be hit with multiple bricks from a five story window and not suffer death or permanent brain damage!). However, folks, considering that this is a holiday comedy, I don't think it's too much to ask that we suspend our disbelief just a little. As for the music score, once again the legendary John Williams does his magic, producing what could be an even better score than the first, including new songs like the heart tugging ""Christmas Star"", one of the most beautiful and underrated Christmas songs ever. In many ways, you could say ""Home Alone 2"" is remake of the first one, only one that retains both the comedy and magic of the original version (Something that can't be said for any of the ones that followed it!). So, with all that said, gather around children and watch that most rarity of rarities, a truly magical sequel in the form of ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". And, regardless of what time of year it may be, Merry Christmas!!!!!"
"byson5186","10","1","2","25 September 2014"," I Like This Better Than The First
","While not everybody seems to be a fan of the first two Home Alone movies, and it seems like everybody has seen them and remembers Macaulay Culkin mostly from when he starred in these movies. The second Home Alone didn't make as much money as the first Home Alone, and while neither of these movies are bad I'm surprised they made as much money as they did. It seems like movies that have tried to copy off the slapstick humor or even Home Alone theme haven't done as well since the first two. I mean one movie I like more than Home Alone and feel like it has more of a plot, is Blank Check. If you watch Blank Check, you'll notice numerous similarities. While I believe you can find the first two movies on TV all year around, you'll most definitely find them on TV during the Holiday Season on channels like ABC Family. I even have a friend who called the Holiday Season The Home Alone Season, as these films are on TV then and seem like the most popular Christmas films. When movie rental stores were open it was hard to rent Home Alone around Christmas. These Home Alone movies show a somewhat wealthy family getting ready for a vacation. I mean a family that is going on vacation with their extended family to Paris in the first film and Florida in the second. In both movies, the youngest Kevin doesn't get on the plane with them. They're movies that will put you in the Holiday Season spirit. I mean, I'm sure most of us have watched both Home Alone movies more than once. I always enjoy watching them during the Holiday Season as they get you into the Christmas Spirit, and you'll probably really remember the movie from past Holiday Seasons. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside the Holiday Season, because just like you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside the Holiday Season, this movie makes the Holiday Season special, just gives you a feeling of it. But, what I like better about the second movie than first. I watched the first movie like six months ago and didn't enjoy it as much. Yeah, I'm sure I'll see it again especially during the holiday season, but I've noticed the first one seems somewhat dark, quiet, it seems mostly about Kevin, and there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax which we mostly remember the movie for. I like the 2nd one, because it is less quiet, I mean Kevin is around more people while in the first movie he was just in his quiet neighborhood that all his neighbors seemed to leave. In this one, he's in NYC the City that never sleeps, and NYC is really exciting and fun to be at during the Holiday Season as this movie clearly shows, and it shows Florida as not being as exciting to be at during the Holiday Season as like whenever they show his family in Florida, it's raining. Kevin has more excitement, as rather than just being left at home he is having his own vacation in a really nice hotel along with getting a limousine. It shows a toy store Duncan's Toy Chest, which is supposed to be off of FAO Schwartz. The traps in this movie are more funny and violent, I mean I crack up every time I watch this movie, and a lot of the traps would have left the burglars dead. So, it will likely keep you laughing as we see a face off between Kevin and the burglars. It's also a great movie to watch if you want to see the excitement of NYC during the holiday season. While this movie isn't like my favorite movie I give it a 10/10 because I think it is well done."

","This is probably the worst of the sequels, with nothing to laugh at. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a boy named Kevin becomes the hero. It manages to explain events in part 1 that may have been considered plot holes. Stern stole the show for his portrayal of the burglar, I thought. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, but it's still okay. Some of the dialog could be better. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting."

","Home Alone 2 (1992)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A year after the events in the previous film, 10-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) finds himself alone once again but this time in New York City. It doesn't take long for him to run into Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who plan on robbing a toy store for some charity cash. It's funny but growing up I always thought HOME ALONE 2 was better than the original but revisiting it after all these years has me changing my mind. I was really surprised to see how this one didn't quite hold up as well as the original and I think a lot of it has to do with some pretty big errors with the screenplay. Needless to say, the main reason for this thing being made was because the first was such a massive hit. You can expect this type of sequel to be pretty much a remake as everything funny in the first film is copied here. This includes the old gangster movie with the gun, the various knocks and beatings taken by the crooks and of course the ""true"" meaning of family. All of that stuff here is still funny but it just doesn't come close to what the original offered. The biggest problem with HOME ALONE 2 is its running time, which is just way too long for this film and after a while you're really wishing that it would hurry up and end. Still, there's no question that Culkin is just wonderful here in the role that he will always be remembered for. Both Pesci and Stern are fun as the bad guys and we get nice support from Catherine O'Hara and John Heard who have to be the worst parents in screen history. Tim Curry is also fun in his small role."
"Doylenf","6","1","2","25 December 2010"," Carbon copy lacks the wistful appeal of the original...
","MACAULAY CULKIN is back again as the little lost boy who seems to have the ability to lose his parents at airports in HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK. While the plot fails to be as engaging as the original, a big asset is all of the New York location photography that gives us great glimpses of the big city for an added dose of realism.<br/><br/>It starts out pretty much the way the original did, with the family planning a Florida vacation and with Kevin pursuing all of them as they make a mad dash through the airport. This time, he doesn't deliberately stay behind--he mistakenly believes he's following a man wearing a coat similar to his father.<br/><br/>But what's really missing are the characters that made HOME ALONE such a treat--and they aren't topped by the bird lady sequence and her friendship with the boy, nor are the bungling exploits of bad guys JOE PESCI and DANIEL STERN as funny, even though they are as clueless as ever in trying to deal with Culkin's nasty pranks.<br/><br/>The violence employed by Culkin gets even nastier this time, which turns out to be a drawback because, after all, this isn't a cartoon where we know no one is really getting hurt.<br/><br/>But in general, the story moves swiftly, the parents' reaction to discovering that he's lost is just as funny (as is their encounter with an official while trying to explain the situation), and the supporting cast does their best to keep things lively. Nice to see EDDIE BRACKEN as a toy store mogul in a huge toy store where a key scene takes place.<br/><br/>Fans of HOME ALONE will no doubt appreciate this sequel, but they aren't likely to be as fond of it as the original--which had a wistful sort of charm totally lacking here. <br/><br/>John Williams' score is a pleasing asset, once again providing a sprightly backdground that gives the film added cheer."

","Whilst John Hughes did an admirable job in reuniting virtually the whole cast for this remake of the 1990 smash hit, that it about the only positive thing to take from this lame sequel. What is remarkable is that this is virtually a scene-for-scene remake of the original, without any discernible attempt to revisit any new ideas or conceptions. Perhaps given the box office success of the original, the producers were at pains not to stray from the well beaten commercial path of success. Not even the idea of setting the movie in New York does enough to breathe fresh life into the same old premise. Culkin's career never recovered from this, and although the film was yet again inevitably a smash hit, audiences will feel a little short changed and certainly think they've seen it all before (which of course they have)."

I'd say, this movie is not only a funny movie but also it's a very learnable type of movie. Home Alone 1 was great and the story goes how he was left alone home but this one was very interesting that he took wrong flight and ends up in New-York all alone. Kevin is only 12 years-old but in this movie he survives every challenge on his own. In my opinion, Christmas is a family holiday but many people celebrate this holiday on their own because of their job, university and so on.

For starters, a lot of the gags and booby traps are virtually the same as the first film, but perhaps at a magnified level as the gags take place in the old apartment building and on the streets of New York. The McCallister family is the same and they still treat Kevin like scum. High points are Kevin's relationship with the pigeon lady and Mr. Duncan, and of course the funhouse Kevin makes out of the iconic plaza hotel. Keep in mind that this was the time that a certain nyc billionaire owned the hotel and he even makes a cameo. I think even though New York had changed so much in the 26 years since the film has been released, it still stands up to the test of time.

","Kevin is lost again, this time not in the house, but in the airport. It's a progress but seriously, what were the odds? Not too low when you consider the premise of a sequel making loads of money and capitalizing on the first opus' popularity.<br/><br/>But box-office considerations put aside, what's to think about the film? I guess it all comes down to one thing: someone who loves ""Home Alone"" will appreciate the sequel (subtitled ""Lost in New York"") because it didn't take too much distance from the original format. And someone who disliked the first opus will probably hate this one even more. The other possibility is to appreciate the first for its nostalgic value and while not denying that the second is a 90's comedy classic (as a continuation of the first), it's possible to have a few reservations.<br/><br/>""Lost in New York"" reminds me of another sequel: ""Gremlins 2"", the same premise in the Big Apple setting, with little Gizmo as the same heartwarming leitmotif as Christmas in ""Home Alone"". But ""Gremlins 2"" was also notable for its change of tone and pace, compared with the original, too many goofy Gremlins and zany jokes made the film closer to a parody than a direct continuation. I believe ""Home Alone 2"" did the same, it really is over-the-top and goofier than the first (which says a lot) but it also displays an overdose of schmaltz and sappiness and in a weird and sneaky way, it does create some bizarre balance in the end.<br/><br/>The problem of ""Home Alone 2"" is that the film is really capable of mocking its own material in a edgy way, but these brilliant moments get drowned in an ocean of syrupy sentimentality and cartoon-like violence. When after losing their black sheep of a kid again, the parents go to the Police, they almost break into laughter when they say ""at least we didn't lose one luggage"", it's funny in a hilarious Simpson-like way because it's like they concede how awful their parenting is and it's so tragic it's actually risible. That was a hilarious moment. But there aren't many unfortunately as John Hughes, who wrote the script, was busier trying to recycle the original plot.<br/><br/>That would have been fine of course, especially the premise of a kid like Kevin, again brilliantly played by Macaulay Culkin, to spend some vacation in the most prestigious hotel in New York (and meet future President Trump). And when the staff is composed of Tim Curry, Dana Ivey (and even Rob Schneider) you know it's going to be fun. But there's a fine line between funny and ludicrous that the film crosses too many times even within the screwball universe it got us used to. I have a hard time believing that Curry would mistake an inflatable clown for a man. It's not a matter of contrivance but awkwardness, when the ""old movie"" shtick works again and the man on TV mentions ""Cliff"" and there's a staff member named the same, that's a contrivance that pays off.<br/><br/>Another moment of brilliance was the confrontation between the parents and the staff, ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?"" ""The finest in New York City!"" replies Dana Ivey with a triumphant smile in Curry and Schneider's faces, not realizing the joke is on them and when the confrontations ends with a slap on his face, you can almost taste the tear in Curry's eyes. When a writer is capable of such subtly funny moments, you regret that the film followed the same formula as the first and push it to most extreme levels. The best parts are all in the first part of the film, after that, it just goes too far for its own good.<br/><br/>I love a Good Christmas story but talk about overplaying it. All right, Kevin has a poignant conversation with a toy store owner who happens to have the same growl than James Stewart, it was so sappy I thought it would be revealed at the end that this guy was Santa Klaus. I understand the toy shop was pivotal to set up the final act and the moment with the kid is in the hospital important to establish that Kevin was mischievous but with a golden heart. Now, did we need that Bird Lady? Brenda Ficker plays ""Shovel Man"" counterpart very well but that exchange about the meaning of heart and all was quite overwritten. I couldn't believe Kevin would say that after what he said to his mother, and before what he did to Harry and Marvin.<br/><br/>Speaking of them, yes, they're the bad guys all right, we get it. But they undergo so much pain that I found the confrontation very hard to watch. In the first film, the house tricks lasted less than twenty minutes, it's almost twice longer in the sequel and they get the full treatment: bricks thrown from a hundred feet high, ropes soaked with kerosene, electrocution, and always that annoying sliding before falling on their back. Whoever told Hughes that seeing a man falling on his back was funny, it's cringe-worthy at best and no matter how bad they are, it really plays like a disproportionate retribution.
I know I'm reading too much, but there's another fine line between getting their comeuppance and being victim of a sadistic little brat that the film doesn't cross, it flies over it. Marvin screaming with the spider on his face was funny, seeing him scream in a Hitchcok's ""Birds"" remake was quite painful to watch. <br/><br/>""Home Alone 2"" is fun and entertaining but the last part recycles the original's bits by overplaying their effect, sometimes I felt the sentimentality was like the bricks thrown at our face and the violence toward Harry and Marv made me feel more sorry for her than any bird lady or hospital kid."

","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard: Recycled piece of crap that completely copies everything from the first film. Chris Columbus does nothing more than duplicate the success of the innovative first movie only this time Kevin is stranded in New York while his family is flying off somewhere else. And what are the chances of the two criminals from the first film breaking out of prison and ending up in New York? And they fall for the same stupid booby traps. Joe Pesci embarrassingly tries not to swear, and Stern is just plain juvenile in his ""sticky bandits"" bit that grows old fast. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents more or less sleepwalk through this junk. We are given that closeup realization of O'Hara where she screams, ""Kevin!"" Cutting her hair short doesn't render this anything other than a complete re-read. Macaulay Culkin was sighted as the new find when he played Kevin in Home Alone. Now it gets old and the traps are less believable this time out. The Christmas decorations are a sight to see and the atmosphere fits the mood but the screenplay is about as lazy as writing gets. We even replace the snow shovel guy from the original with an old woman covered in pigeons who will come to Kevin's aid. Watch the first film and hope that this dread gets lost in a New York sewer.

"Leofwine_draca","4","1","3","27 December 2015"," An insult
","I've always loved the first HOME ALONE film, ever since I was a kid, but I deliberately put off seeing this sequel after reading the negative reviews back in the day. Watching it now, as an adult, I can see what the reviewers meant: this is an insult, or indeed a kick in the teeth, to anyone who loves the first film.<br/><br/>Given that the original movie was a smash hit, it was inevitably that a rushed-out sequel would quickly follow. And rushed out is right; this is a mere remake of the first film, albeit with a different setting (and nobody gets ""lost"" either, despite the title). The characters are all exactly the same, the gags are the same, everything's the same. A bigger budget doesn't mean improved quality; it means that everyone was in this to grab more dollars.<br/><br/>It feels exactly like director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes are going through the motions here. The bumbling villains are back and have even more ridiculous motives than previously. The crazy pigeon lady replaces the crazy old guy. Even the same TV gag is played out again. Hell, even the climax takes place in a house again, so the whole New York setting turns out to be a cheat. The whole sub-plot with the stressed out parents really drags things down a lot too.<br/><br/>HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK isn't a total loss as a film, even though it's a crushing disappointment. It's hard to dislike Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, two actors giving such physical performances. Tim Curry is a fun addition to the cast too. But Macaulay Culkin's self-knowing, superior attitude is becoming annoying already (and, indeed, his Hollywood star was to quickly wane after this) and there's absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done better previously. It's a real disappointment."
"Gubby-Allen","4","1","3","15 December 2012"," As dreadful as the first film was brilliant
","Home Alone was brilliant, an absolute classic, suitable for the entire family.<br/><br/>This was absolutely dreadful and suitable for 15 year olds and little else.<br/><br/>Home Alone retained elements of realism and you always felt that Kevin's sole intention was protecting his home. Nothing more than that and the traps were amusing ones.<br/><br/>In Home Alone 2, every stunt, trick or booby trap (be it Kevin or Harry) bordered on either the absurd or the sadistic. Add to that the entire airport episode was too nonsensical to take seriously.<br/><br/>Rolling some marbles to cause two men to fall in the street you can laugh off & ignore once, but they were numerous. Hurling bricks from a top of a building at somebody, setting fire to them, filling toilets up with petrol, wasn't funny, was a little uncomfortable to watch with children, who equally found no fun in it at all.<br/><br/>You could make a decent argument that Kevin was actually the sadistic one in this film & could quite easily have shopped them to the Police instead of luring them to the house.<br/><br/>Then they'd have been no film, which in hindsight would've been a blessing.<br/><br/>I'll stick with the original from now on, which was immaculately written in the main, rather watch that twice in a row than this again."
"g-bodyl","9","1","3","19 October 2008"," I liked this movie!
","Home Alone 2 is pretty good, but I liked the first one better. Even though this is a great film, the originality is lost. This time around, Kevin gets left behind at the airport while the rest of the family travels to Florida. Meanwhile, Kevin gets on the wrong flight and heads to New York. While in New York City, Kevin learns that the two bandits from the first film escaped from prison and are planning to rob a toy store. Now, Kevin has to foil their plans while he is dealing with management from the hotel he's at. The formula is basically the same as the first film. There is nothing new, but I liked it anyway. Macualay Culkin is great once again as Kevin. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are funny as the bandits. Even Tim Curry and Brenda Fricker are decent in their roles. The music is something good to listen to with all the great Christmas songs. Overall, this is a great Christmas family film. I rate this movie 9/10."

","Maybe a sequel to a movie like ""Home Alone"" wasn't the brightest idea Hollywood has ever produced, but the result is really something to see. Sure, it's extraordinarily unlikely that any family would lose their child on vacation not long after they abandoned him at home in the original. Nonetheless, ""Lost in New York"" is certainly better than ""Home Alone 3,"" a stupid spy story not even stomach-able. Macaulay Culkin is in peak form as the abandoned Kevin. Tim Curry, Dana Ivey, and Rob Schneider are wonderfully idiotic as the bumbling hotel employees who catch onto the fact that Kevin is really alone. And Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern rule the face of the planet, once again, as the ""Wet Bandits,"" the worst criminals in history. People tend to run this movie down for being ""predictable"" and ""mindless,"" but if you remove the fact that the kid was in a similar situation before, it actually makes for fantastic Christmas entertainment."

"hellraiser7","8","1","4","22 November 2019"," Christmas Vacation Calamity
","This is another of my favorite sequels, childhood gems and an honorable mention in favorite Christmas films. I remember seeing this in the theater, to me it was one of the best times I ever had in the theater as it was just a festival of up roaring laughter. Yeah, it's true this sequel doesn't surpass the original, but I don't feel it's trying to, and yes it's not perfect but it has it where it counts because like with the original it sets itself out for what it wants to be holiday fun.<br/><br/>What I like about the sequel is it has sort of an adventurous feel to it, as we see Kevin is out of his comfort zone and is in a fascinating but strange land. Once again there is sort of that wish fulfilment fantasy tale, as we as kids and even adults have dreamed of having that perfect Christmas vacation someplace, we want and having the time of our life our way. Like seeing Kevin ordering room service eating Triple Scooped ice cream sundae and he says one of my favorite lines, ""make it triple, I'm not driving"" wonder if any kids or adults thought about saying that whenever they ordered ice cream for room service, on a side note, would love to try that hotel's ice cream.<br/><br/>We see Kevin once again watching a sequel (ironically) to that gangster film from the first movie. It's just hilarious as we see once again Johnny whom as usual has an explosive temper. He says another favorite quote, ""I believe you, but my Tommy Gun don't!"" damn this guy has serious anger management issues. On a side note, there were some other R rated films Kevin saw that were stacked up beside the one he is watching, shame there wasn't a scene or two to see what those films are.<br/><br/>I really like that we get to see some of New York if not a whole lot which is one little weak point of the film. From that hotel which is a real hotel I'd someday like to find so I can visit the location of where the film was filmed. We even see him go to a place called Dunkins Toy Chest which is nice looking, though the place has no toys nor even a video game department, it looks more like a ""Hallmark"" store which is weird; Kevin should've requested ""Toys R Us"", damn I miss that place in fact toy stores in general.<br/><br/>Music is good there is the same memorable score by John Williams and some new track one song I really like that's became a Christmas favorites are ""Christmas Tree"" (the version where Buzz didn't frak things up) and ""Distant Goodnights"" which I'll admit really has a sweet but sorrowful feel. There is one scene that is a bit of a heartstring pull as both Kevin and his mom say good night to each other from a distance, it reminds us and Kevin despite all the fun and games, he's still unhappy deep down and misses his family just as his mom feels guilt once again bears the burden of guilt and misses him.<br/><br/>Characters are good, Kevin as usual is Kevin whom to me is the master trickster. Once again, he's on the sympathetic side as he can never seem to catch a break with his family. He once again gets punished for something he really isn't guilty of. Buzz (somedays I really hate that guy) whom as usual is being a idiot decided to play a prank on Kevin in the entire school. Personally after that stunt, if I was the director of that production I would kick Buzz out, you pull crap like that in every production you don't get to perform and seriously McCallister family stop being so leanant toward Buzz that's probably what lead him to doing stupid crap in the first place; sorry this sounded bold but I had to get that out. And once again Karma is on Kevin's side as he gets to have the time of his life.<br/><br/>But one thing I really like that Kevin has is the Talk boy, which I thought was cool at the time, this was way before phone app tech. It's basically a tape recorder, but it has a mike and a way to manipulate your voice to sound like an anonymous voice dub. This device no doubt comes in handy for Kevin throughout the film and it would be cool if they made a ""Home Alone Talk boy"" app where we can recreate those features.<br/><br/>Tim Curry one of my favorite actors is great as the Concierge. He's almost the subordinate villain in film, ok not really, more of just your obstacle. He's a guy that is completely uptight, really wants to run the hotel like a tight ship. But a little on the egocentric side as he really wants to bust Kevin to both keep his hotel intact but also to inflate his ego. It' s just funny the certain reaction he has toward Kevin's trick which crack me up.<br/><br/>The Wet Bandits or Sticky Bandits whichever you prefer, as usual are themselves, they haven't changed as both are still nincompoops. I like the fact that this time they've stepped up their game as their now robbing stores instead of houses. This plan would work if it wasn't for one poison pill in the plan which they're at fault for taking which is a weak point I'll get to latter. But these guys are funny as usual, from their typical back and forth and the spills they rightfully take.<br/><br/>The humor as usual is hilarious just spot one, from another scene with the Concierge and his company when they go to Kevin's room they are once again duped by one of Kevin's tricks as he is playing the Gangster pic loud. I won't give away what happens next you just must see it yourself it's just hilarious.
But of course, down to the final battle which is a physical humor/slapstick comedy fest and even more violent and painful than before. I won't give too much away on that I'll just state a couple of the traps.<br/><br/>The first one is of course the beginning of the battle, where the robbers stupidly think Kevin will corroborate in throwing down the camera and Harry says another of my favorite lines though was common at the time, ""I cross my heart and hope to die."" I snickered when he said that because it's like he's practically telling Kevin to take him out. And of course, Kevin throws down something toward them, lets just say his Christmas gift to Marv.<br/><br/>Another of course is the electrocution scene which I was just laughing my head off toward, that one is sort of a live action ""Looney Tunes"" gag. Just hearing Marv's screams was just music to my ears. But we also see his skeleton as he's being shocked. Another that's sort of a Looney Tunes gag is the teeter totter which cracks me up, but it cracks me up even more the fact that Harry wasn't smart enough to get off it immediately, yeah fast one Harry.<br/><br/>But this sequel does miss a trick or two that really holds it back a little for me, I'll just state a few. I don't like how there are some moments of stupidity that I felt could easily have been avoided in the writing. Like that mis boarding scene, I don't like how that was handled. The whole battery thing was stupid and a cheap device, seriously Kevin couldn't wait to get on board to replace his batteries. Personally, it should have been some sort of holiday rush riot where it was not just the McCallister family but every other family and group that was rushing to their planes and somehow Kevin gets lost in that crowd. Let alone the stupidity of the Robbers whom had a good plain and would have succeeded if they just left Kevin alone, which I'll admit is a plot hole.<br/><br/>There are also a few too many coincidences, from the Robbers being in New York the same time Kevin came. Or Kevin's uncle and aunt having a place they were renovating that happens to be in New York. I do believe in coincidences, but this is just too big to swallow. Didn't like the whole gun thing with Harry and Marv, it felt out of place and out of character.<br/><br/>The film doesn't quite bring much new to the table as it has that fundamental problems some sequels have, where it does seem just a bit like the same film in places just dressed differently make the film a tad predictable; though same could be said for certain slasher franchises out there like the ""Friday the 13th"" films but that didn't make them bad (or not all of them) so I can't complain too much on that.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't care for the bird lady character, she not a bad character but by her nature she really a filler character that I could take or leave but all the same really there to fill in empty space and time much like Harry on ""Doctor Who"".<br/><br/>If Kevin was suppose of have a secondary character along the way it either should have been one of the members of his family which would have been interesting, it would help shed light as to who that family member is in the multitude of members as well as provide depth on the family but may 'be further the stakes for Kevin as he not just has to protect himself but a member of his family, but it would help make the film a little different sort of like a buddy buddy film, could of also meant extra traps see this other member's tactician skills. I don't know it's a nice thought, anyway, shame it was never considered.<br/><br/>Overall, despite being one of those mixed bag movie/sequels I still had fun with this film which really is most of the time all I can ask for sequels. ""Home Alone 2"" like any holiday vacation is worth a trip.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars"
"mark.waltz","5","1","4","23 December 2018"," When the setting steals the show, you know it's a missed opportunity.
","While this has some very entertaining moments, this is really an unnecessary sequel to the first installment of one biggest box office hits of the 1990's. In retrospective, even the first film doesn't hold up nearly 30 years later, being rather violent and cartoonish featuring a family I certainly would not want to be any part of. While this time indeed, the Macaulay Culkin character of Kevin does make it on to the plane, it's the wrong one and he ends up in the wrong City. While his family ends up being stuck in the hotel because of constant rain in Florida, Kevin makes it to sunny Manhattan where once again he encounters the nasty Crooks played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Christmas in New York is said to be magical, and it's up to Culkin to find ways of passing the time while his mother, Catherine O'Hara, strives to get there so she can find her son home she is frantic of having lost for the second time over the Christmas season.<br/><br/>The characters play by Stern and Pesci have outworn their welcome, and this time the violence tossed at them by Culkin in an abandoned family home seems to be twice as ruthless, not that they don't deserve it. But in reality, there is no way anybody could survive any of the self defense ploys that Culkin throws at them, so that aspect of the plot line becomes quite eye-rolling as it goes far too over-the-top.<br/><br/>That means that the film is best when it deals with the colorful characters of New York, particularly Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird lady, Eddie Bracken as a kindly toy store owner and Tim Curry and Dana Ivey as imperious front desk clerks at the Plaza Hotel. What does become equally as irritating as Stern and Pesci is Kevin's family, especially his obnoxious older brother who creates a major disturbance at a Christmas concert Kevin has a solo in that in defending himself, Kevin causes the entire presentation to fall apart. Shots of New York around the holidays bring on a feeling of nostalgia, especially with many businesses which are no longer around as well as a nice shot of the Twin Towers less than a decade before they were destroyed. A cameo by a certain overrated celebrity turned politician is fortunately extremely fast and other than a quick ""eew"" at the side of them is only a minor disturbance. In true Hollywood fashion, this was not the end of the saga, but the last one in my opinion worth bothering with. I used to rank this as much higher in rating, but other than a few sweet moments, including a thoughtful one involving a pair of turtle dove tree decorations, it does not hold up as well as it did on my first viewing when it first opened in theaters."

It uses almost the same script from the first film, and not really any points for originality. You almost feel bad for the cast and crew in this film. Home Alone II is one of the few films to use shameless plugs. The Plaza Hotel is the backdrop for this film and it almost felt like Donald Trump was bankrolling the whole production. Watching Home Alone 2 is like seeing The Harlem Globetrotters more than once: there is always the same gags, but as least the Globetrotters keep there shows fresh. As I said earlier this film has no life and no originality. Still, it didn't matter because the film made mega-bucks and Fox laughed all the way to the bank."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","5","26 December 2005"," A sequel in the vein of Terminator 2
","This is another of those sequels that... suffer(?)... from a not entirely uncommon illness, known as ""The T2 Syndrome"". Terminator 2 may not be the origin of said illness, or even the first film to fall victim of it, but it is commonly accepted as the first recorded case of it. The syndrome renders any sequel as more of a remake of the first than an actual sequel, but the quality is a variable, it can go either way(or nowhere at all). Usually, everything in the film is kicked up a notch, higher production value, more action and more entertainment... sometimes signifying a higher budget. These films are often a desperate attempt by the film-makers to re-create the success of the first without breaking new ground or showing any originality or creativity. For whatever curiosity value it may hold; Charlies Angels: Full Throttle is another victim. As a victim of this illness, the film contains scene after scene(in fact, it's put together by them, it consists entirely of them) that are mild re-writes of scenes from the first. The plot is basically the same, and at best, fairly interesting. The minor lift the film has received in content, the fact that everything is just slightly 'more' than it was in the first makes for a few entertaining scenes scattered throughout the film(good thing, because without them, the film is barely worth watching at all). Apart from the entire original cast(well, the foundation, at least; the McCallister clan is back) returning for this sequel, we are also joined by the comedic talents of Rob Schneider, Tim Curry and Dana Ivey(I know, I know, but think of how she was in the Addams Family films, seriously), which pays off big time. The pacing is fine. The acting is mostly goofy and overplayed, which I suppose is the idea. The humor works, on occasion. There is one thing I just have to say; I don't much mind the silly humor of most of the film, but at the end... when it turns to slap-stick, Looney Tunes-like humor... that was just too much. It was bad in the first, this time, it's worse. I could barely watch. I found myself turning away again and again, taking longer and longer to look back at the screen. The content disgusted me. This is coming from a man who, in the last week, has seen Dawn of the Dead, Saw and Hellraiser: Hellseeker... during which, I never turned away, or, for that matter, regretted that I hadn't. The tone is just too much in this film, during those last scenes. I don't know what disturbs me more; the fact that I, myself, as a child, enjoyed these scenes. The fact that as I write this, there are children enjoying them. Or the fact that there are grown people... not only enjoying watching them, but thinking that it's OK, that it's OK to put that in (children's) films, to tell children that it's OK. That it's responsible. That children may, or even(*shudder*) should think that. It disturbs me. Quite a lot, in fact. That aside, the film does a nice job, through cinematography and dialog, to show the world as seen by a young child... of course, that only makes aforementioned fact even worse. I only recommend this film for people studying films, so they can analyze and debate it, get into the frame of mind behind this film, understand it. Anyone else watching it should take great care to understand that it is, in fact, fiction, and has very, very little to do with reality. I wouldn't consider this proper viewing for kids, unless these are very mature and understand that it's not real. 6/10"

I like to watch the movie specially in winter and around New Year Eve. The movie is about a boy who is trying to escape from unknown guys. The setting is a boy, Kevin have a long trip to Florida and New York. In New York he have a lot of adventures. The main character is a little boy, Kevin. He spent very interesting, fun, adventure and scary time in New York. You will like this movie, if you like fun and adventure stories. This movie will never bore you. Because I watched the movie 7 or more times. But it is still nice for me. The movie is really exciting, creative and well worth a few hours of your time."

","The movie is good. However, the movie literally has the exact layout of the first movie. Kevin is mistreated, he wishes he didn't have a family, his family flies somewhere and forgets him, in the last movie Kevin was scared of an old man, now he's scared of a lady that has some obsession with pigeons, even the traps for the robbers are practically the same. There is much more but I don't wanna bore you."
"spenrh","7","0","1","29 November 2018"," Enjoyable, yet some implausibility
","I've always enjoyed this movie since I was still a kid. I've noticed more of the movie's implausibilities as I've gotten older, and some copying from the first ""Home alone"", but it's still pretty good even now.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie repeats from the first movie: the McAllister house full of scurrying relatives and smart alec kids, a conflict scene with Kevin getting the short end of the stick from everyone and getting treated badly by Uncle Frank and Buzz, Mom (Catherine O'Hara) sending Kevin to his room with Kevin wishing again they would all just go away, and then the family oversleeping and them all rushing to the airport in a panic and just barely making the flight.<br/><br/>The big change in ideas comes when Kevin this time is still with his family at the airport rather than being left at the house. The movie leaving him at the house a second time would really have made it a flop. A couple little implausibilities here included while running through the airport, Kevin's dad (John Heard) keeps looking over his shoulder to see if he's still with him, until Kevin stops cold in his tracks to fiddle with batteries. Of course then, his dad immediately stops looking over his shoulder, or else he would've seen he's no longer there and would've turned around to get him. And Mom tried to stand aside outside the gate to make sure everyone was there, but the freakin gate agent refused to let her. But, I did like the bit with the guy who from the back looked like Kevin's dad and wearing a similar coat running to the New York flight with Kevin following him thinking it's Dad.<br/><br/>The New York scenes with Kevin were a great change of pace from the first film, Kevin at the Plaza hotel with the bumbling staff there led by Tim Curry, Kevin living it up at the posh hotel, renting a limo (once again with Kevin's very own cheese pizza), and going to the toy store and having that good scene with Mr Duncan (Eddie Bracken), Duncan: ""where'd you get all that cash?"", Kevin: ""I have alot of grandmothers"", lol. The pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) scenes with Kevin were OK too, and giving us a good moment of the New York symphony orchestra playing Christmas music.<br/><br/>The two biggest implausibilities were when the hotel staff confronted Kevin about the credit card, chased him to the hotel room, and then Kevin playing a scene from one of those old gangster films from the first film and trying to make it seem to the hotel staff that there was really a guy in the next room holding them up at gunpoint. It really was pretty unbelievable how the hotel staff didn't even see the ""gun man"" in the next room, but still reacted as if he was right in front of them pointing the gun at them in plain sight. And, they couldn't tell it was all coming from a TV? (The movie gun man mentioning ""Cliff"" with the hotel staff member with the same name's reaction was kinda funny though).<br/><br/>The other implausibility was the whole Harry and Marv part again, and all of Kevin's elaborate traps and them getting hurt in ways that would seriously injure or kill someone in real life. Kevin using his renovated aunt and uncle's house in New York instead of his own house in Chicago was the only change from the first film, other than that the whole Harry and Marv running into Kevin's traps section was a complete duplicate of the first time.<br/><br/>The film's still pretty enjoyable overall."

The day before Kevin has to sing Christmas carols with his school. The whole family attends and an accident occurs...Kevin must apologize to his family, but he does not believe that it was his fault and does not ask for forgiveness. He is punished to sleep in the attic and, when the vans arrive to take them to the airport (this time the McCallister goes to Miami instead of Paris), they have fallen asleep again. They begin the rush and everyone goes to the airport. This is where Kevin gets distracted from his parents and takes a plane to New York. New York also comes the ""Wet Criminals"", who have escaped from prison and want to hit a toy store. But they have not counted on Kevin ...<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Even better than its predecessor! For me, it surpasses much to the first part for entertainment and this thanks to the new adventure of Kevin, now it gets stuck in the city that never sleeps and the wet bandits escaped from prison after 9 months of confinement. Things get even more complicated, since Kevin now has a credit card and a lot of money leading him to be discovered for theft. Very good family movie that, yes, is scarce in argument because in this sequel we see the same as before, but I still love it and prefer it instead of the original. Now it has new fun characters like the manager of the Plaza Hotel and the bellhop played by a nice Rob Schneider. The characters of the bandits are again super fun and even more in the classic traps of the end. They are also classic movies that Kevin sees at the hotel and plays with workers, brilliant. Again, Kevin will have a friend who will protect him in this cold environment, in this case he will be a woman who roams the Central Park and who owns many birds as he feeds them. The final message is the same family member of course, leaving us with a great movie that after its predecessor we yearn for more. ""Guess who is alone in New York this Christmas. He gets up in his bedtime in the city that never sleeps. ""- Home Alone."

"DHWaldron","5","0","2","12 October 2017"," Not great; not terrible; ""Home Alone 2"" is an OKAY film
","Unlike the original ""Home Alone"", the situation has developed, spending longer times on the slapstick comedy of the Wet Bandits, depriving the film of its original comfort; the location. Relocating the setting to New York is an act of deprivation of the cosiness of the original. Once more, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is cute yet a smart-aleck kid with an attitude that could challenge even the crudest of adults. He once more gets into mischief, somehow getting separated yet again from his family. Not only that, but ""Home Alone 2"" has basically the same first 10 minutes as the original, which is frustrating to re-watch. Eventually, we learn of the escape of the Wet Bandits, which has excruciatingly painful scenes for any person, let alone child. The acting is fine, with the best scenes of the film including Tim Curry as a hotel concierge, which, by the way, do not involve the bandits.<br/><br/>With this sequel, the film has resorted to cheesy lines, exaggerated violence and repetition, as most film franchises eventually succumb to."
"crash21","5","0","1","9 December 2016"," Unbelievable, but much better than the original movie
","The whole movie ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" was a much better story than the original ""Home Alone"", even though it did have a lot of the same dumb moments in the movie. Things like Kevin's supposed stories getting him access to a plane to New York and entry to an expensive hotel room. Then his family's insult to Florida with their supposed bad experience. For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.<br/><br/>It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.<br/><br/>Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture. Note, after all of this he actually does call the police effortlessly. The whole movie is, for the most part, unbelievable and dumb as well."

There's obviously something comforting in watching a bright, big-budget sequel to a popular family comedy that covers familiar territory (one can sit back, brain in check, and let the picture do all the work), but Hughes' scripted banter is witless, and new characters such as Tim Curry's inept, leering concierge and Brenda Fricker's Pigeon Lady are oddly lacking in humor and charm. ** from ****"

","Home Alone 2: Alone in New York is the 1992 sequel to Home Alone which, like the original film, forces the viewer to accept a lot, but if you can, the film stands up proudly to its predecessor, a rarity for sequels.<br/><br/>Once again, the McCallister family is going away for Christmas and this time they are headed to Paris. Somehow, the entire family manages to get on the plane without Kevin, who somehow ends up on a plane to New York. We then follow Kevin checking into New York's most expensive hotel and actually being reunited with the the bungling hoods (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who tormented him in the first film.<br/><br/>If you can accept the fact that the McCallisters would allow that plane to Paris to take off without a head count and you can accept the fact that the Plaza Hotel would allow a child to check in by himself and don't question him being in possession of so much cash and credit, and you can accept the fact that these two idiot thieves actually somehow put together enough money to afford a trip to New York so that they can rob FAO Schwartz, there is fun to be had here.<br/><br/>Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes have mounted a viable sequel that is served well by its cast. Macaulay Culkin is just as slick and funny as he was in the first film. It doesn't hurt that the screenplay paints Kevin as the smartest character in the movie. There are some funny turns by Rob Schneider as a bellman, Dana Ivey as a snooty desk clerk, Eddie Bracken as the manager at FAO Schwartz and especially Tim Curry as the Concierge, who is onto Kevin and spends the entire running time trying to prove that the child is at the hotel alone and that his parents are not on the way. <br/><br/>A bouquet as well to Catherine O'Hara, who is just wonderful here as Kate McCallister, whose overwhelming guilt about leaving her son behind again has her tearing the island of Manhattan apart looking for her son.<br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, liking this one will not be a stretch."

","This is the typical Hollywood effort to capitalize quickly on a financial success. It's not that there isn't some fun here, but everything seems much more contrived. Of course, the fact that Kevin is left behind again is the first contrivance. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are now the ""Sticky Bandits"" and are out of jail. The family is in New York and things begin to fall apart. Of course, what this is really about, is how much abuse one can inflict on the two idiots as they try to pull off a huge heist. Add the elements of their actions affecting poor children and the appearance of the bird lady in Central Park, we have efforts to pull at our heartstrings. Things ring hollow, mainly because the first movie did this well and this one didn't. There is one nice part of this movie and that is the byplay between Culkin and the irrepressible Tim Curry, the receptionist at the Plaza Hotel. I never miss anything Curry is in because he sparkles with evil joy. Watch this movie to see Curry. I have determined I will never invest on minute in Home Alone III."

","Home alone 2: Lost in New York review<br/><br/>Home alone 2 is a Christmas family film made in 1992. The plot was written by John Hughes and was brought to life by Chris Columbus. It's the sequel to warm comedy Home Alone; Kevin McCallister is played by Macaulay Culkin and the criminals are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard, Devin Ratray, Kieran Culkin also featured. It was filmed in 3 destinations: Chicago Airport, New York and Miami. It was released on 15th November and was awarded the people's choice award for favourite comedy movie. Despite getting mixed reviews, the film became the second most successful film of 1992 (the most being Aladdin) earning over $173 million in revenue in America alone and over $358 worldwide! The McCallisters plan to spend Christmas in Miami, Kevin (the youngest) sees Florida as the worst place to spend it mostly due to the lack of Christmas trees. During Kevin's Christmas school play his older brother Buzz embarrasses him causing Kev to retaliate and ruin the play. Buzz apologises but Kevin refuses, storms to his bedroom and wishes he could go to his own holiday...not with his family, just like last year. On the eve of the vacation- Kevin's dad: Peter- accidentally resets their alarm clock and causes the family to sleep in the next day. Meanwhile, Kevin's nemesis 'the Wet Bandits' (who now rename themselves 'the Sticky Bandits') escape from jail and are in New York. In confusion and rush to get to the airport on time, Kevin gets on a flight to New York and the rest of the family get on a flight to Miami without realising where their relation is until they land in Florida! Anyway, Kevin tours New York and uses his 'Talkboy' to check into the Plaza Hotel, afterwards he gets scared by a woman covered in pigeons in Central Park. On Christmas Eve, Kevin travels to Duncan's Toy Chest in a limo, there Kevin discovers the money made that day will go to the children's hospital and outside he runs into the Sticky Bandits then they chase him back to his hotel. Mr Hector, the hotel manager confronts him on his credit card, which came up as stolen, Kevin try's to run away but is then captured by his enemies. They talk about plans to rob Duncan's toy chest that night, afterwards Kevin escapes on the back of a horse and carriage. In Florida, the McCallisters find out their son is using Peter's credit card in New York, they then fly to find him. Having noted that his Uncle has a house in the city Kevin tries to visit him, he does find the house but the house is undergoing renovations while his Uncle is on holiday in Paris. Later in Central Park, Kev comes across the pigeon lady again, and when he gets his foot stuck in a rock she helps him instead of hurting him as he expected. He goes with the pigeon lady to her storage room flat above a music hall, whilst listening to music he learns how her life has fallen apart and how she deals with it by the seeking affection from pigeons in the park. Kevin vows to her that he'll be her friend. After leaving the flat, Kevin heads to his Uncle's house and sets booby traps inside, like he did with his own in the previous film, he then goes to the toy store during the Sticky Bandits raid. From there, all Hell breaks lose and I won't reveal any more. I love Christmas films but I have high standards for them, honestly I can't be bothered with Christmas light competitions or cringey reindeer stories. Home Alone is something different, the first film was a breath of fresh air, nobody had covered that story before and I think that's why people flocked to see it instead of the same old Rudolph story that was the appeal factor. I'm not sure how much appeal factor the sequel had though, there's only so many things you can do with a kid being at home by himself, but Home Alone 2 rings the best out of the dry towel that is the Home Alone franchise. On some levels it is repetitive, however it's still really good film and more specifically a really good Christmas film, in fact one of the best in my opinion. Plus, Macaulay Culkan jumped ship at the right moment because the rest of the Home Alone films were truly rubbish, (I think that's about the only thing Macaulay did right in his career other than doing the first 2 films.) RATING: 8.3/10<br/><br/>Best parts: Checking into the Plaza Kicking the Sticky Bandits butts The pigeon lady"

"soldier9428","5","0","1","23 December 2013"," Most of the movie was good, but the action scene was horrifying and sadistic
","I will say that most of this movie was funny and that gives it a better rating. The problem is that the action scene was extremely disturbing. One reviewer said this is for 15 year olds, but I'm 15 and I hated the violence in this movie. This is supposed to be a family film but instead it turns into a pg rated torture flick with Kevin throwing 5 bricks at a guys face from a 4 story building. The same guy getting electrocuted and them showing a highly disturbing scene of him getting vaporized with skeleton showing. A man with his hat on fire and his head blowing up in a toilet full of kerosene. To top it all off the kid sets fire to a rope and watches the criminals fall from a 4 story building with their feet on fire. Film makers please stop showing torture and cruelty as something casual to laugh at. That whole half hour was too sadistic and brutal to be in a pg rated film.<br/><br/>Fortunately though the rest of the movie makes up for this horrible and prolonged torture fest. The jokes in the rest of the movie are hilarious and had me cracking up. When the hotel guys were getting fooled by the audio track from that movie was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie. The movie had many other moments that had me laughing and liking the movie. Unfortunately though the action part of the film was so horrifyingly brutal it makes it hard to recommend this movie. Perhaps best to just skip the brick and electrocution scenes, but still enjoy the rest of the movie."

I even own this movie, despite having issues with it. It's still a fairly entertaining film, but I just felt they tried to outdo the first film with a bigger setting, and more violent gags. New York is a huge place, and I'm sure they thought this would be ever better than the original when they thought of it. It doesn't work in the long run, and it doesn't have the genuine feel of the first film. It feels like most sequels, a cash maker. It's also somewhat of a rehash of the original. The Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) is essentially the same as Marley the enigmatic neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who befriends Kevin in need, and gets him out of jams. It wasn't nearly as special as the bond Kevin & Marley had. The Wet Bandits (Brilliantly played by Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) make the same mistakes they did in the original with Kevin, by falling for the same traps. You'd have thought they might have learned a bit after the first one The violence is cartoonish in the original, but it didn't bother me. It's one of the many things I loved in the original, but here it borders on overkill. Onto the positive side of things, Macaulay Culkin is once again hilarious as Kevin. He is a main reason as to why I enjoy this movie. The Plaza Hotel crew is a scream. Tim Curry, Rob Schneider & Dana Ivey are all very funny. Look out for cameos from Ally Sheedy & Donald Trump as well.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Bigger, doesn't necessarily mean better. As disappointing as it is, I do enjoy this movie to an extent, but it's nowhere near the original's class. There are many things to enjoy about this movie, but just don't expect the original. <br/><br/>6.4/10"

","""I won't forget you; trust me"" – Kevin McCallister<br/><br/>These are the last words uttered by Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) in HOME ALONE 2 : LOST IN NEWYORK which is also the last movie of the HOME ALONE duo logy. There have been a few more installments following this to add up to the HOME ALONE franchise however none of them starred Macaulay Culkin and the rest of the cast and none of them really did manage to live up to the first two installments. What more is new when it comes to sequels? <br/><br/>This time around Kevin is not left behind by his family. Whilst the beginning of the movie is identical to that of the first movie, this time Kevin does manage to get all the way to the Chicago airport with his entire family. However a slight battery included incident separates him from his family and Kevin once again is left behind. His family heads off to Miami while Kevin boards the wrong plane and is flown into the Big Apple; New York. Here in New York Kevin keeps on finding trouble and is reunited with his nemesis the ""Wet Bandits"" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern)<br/><br/>I find that Daniel Stern requires recognition in this article since his contribution towards the humorous aspects of the motion is priceless. It's not certain how Stern found the high pitched scream that he nails on many occasions but that scream is indeed his signature move. Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) aka ""The Sticky Bandits"" as they call themselves in HOME ALONE: LOST IN NEWYORK bring to the audience the Scrooge and Grinch that we all dislike. Kevin who is ten years old is the Christmas Spirit that sets things straight once again. Macaulay Culkin yet again sails through with confidence for a 10 year old displays talent that may be considered uncanny. It does not take long to fall in love with the little mischievous Kevin as he fends for himself against the sticky bandit saving Christmas once again; this time not for himself but for some very special children.<br/><br/>Indeed it is a time for giving and sharing. This is what Chris Columbus works his magic around. The entire family motion picture builds around the message of Christmas although there is very little reference to a Church or Christ. One need not be at home nor be in church or even be an adult to spread the joy and spirit of the season. Intently or unintentionally this core message does seep through during this hilarious festive movie. <br/><br/>It took me some time to notice it but did you know that the theme music played in HOME ALONE is very similar to that of the first HARRY POTTER movie? Maybe it is a superstitious belief for Chris Columbus in reaching out for success.<br/><br/>A great movie to spend time on this festive season and as Kevin's quote states neither would I forget HOME ALONE.<br/><br/>TITLE: HOME ALONE: LOST IN NEW YORK DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS. STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN and CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG 13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 120 MINUTES"

","This my be weird too read, but I actually think this movie is better than the original. I'm not talking like Back to the Future 1 and 2 where I like the second one more but acknowledge that the first is better. No, I actually think that this movie is objectively better than the first film. Now don't get me wrong, I like the first film, but I just think this is stronger. But what do I know.<br/><br/>Basically whenever someone criticizes this movie they will say it sucks because it's just a rehash of the first movie. And they are technically right, but that's one of the things I like about it. And the film sort of knows this and pokes fun at it sometimes. For me, the bad stuff boils down to breaking the laws of physics sometimes, and not enough of Kevin's family.<br/><br/>But everything that works in the first movie works here. And it fixes some of the stuff that didn't work for me. In the first movie I thought it was kind of contrived how Kevin just automatically assumed he made his family disappear and how he never called the cops and just tell them that the buglers were coming to his house. In this movie those problems are fixed. I love the scenes in the hotel, Tim Curry is just so much fun to watch. I actually think it's funnier than the first, and it still gives that Christmas feeling.<br/><br/>I know no one will agree with me, but in my opinion, this sequel actually is better than the original."

"johnnyboyz","5","0","1","8 February 2012"," Never mind being Lost in New York, something somewhere got lost in the transition from 1990's functional first outing and the nonentity that is the second.
","I'm not sure 1990's Home Alone was crying out for a sequel, nor indeed do I think the first film was produced with that of continuing the misadventures of its young protagonist in mind. Like any scientist experimenting with chemicals and procedure in their laboratory, burrowing away at what it is they do for that elusive formula which will make them famous and, they hope, the world a better place, American director Chris Columbus toyed with this project about a kid stuck at home; his family's mad dash back to him and a pair of crooks looking to rob his mansion of a home before happening upon something with a shelf-life. The first was a sweet enough tale, this idea of a child at home alone after wishing to be as such whilst learning some home-truths about the presence of one's family and, encapsulated in the supposedly serial killing road-sweep, that life beyond one's homely walls was a little different to what one originally thought. Boom! Ideas and chemicals and experimentations forge together to create something audience's respond to, Home Alone being one of the fifteen or so highest grossing films of all time at the time, and thus a sequel is spawned. Cynicism aside, it's important to establish Home Alone 2: Lost in New York exists for the cash and solely for the cash; a filmic formula that was stumbled upon and saw people react.<br/><br/>In truth, Home Alone conformed to that of a closed narrative structure; by which we mean his stance on things were introduced, befell a catalyst which allowed him to address his views and then came around to realise that things weren't so bad when you've got the sort of family young Kevin McCallister had and you're living in the environment that you are. The framework was established; developed and then closed and there was no room for further development. Lost in New York takes everything the first instalment did, as well as the places it took its lead, and incinerates them in a blaze of smoke within about fifteen minutes: this time, his reaction to his realising that he's all alone with time to himself away from his family is greeted with a grin rather than a grimace. He is afraid, but only of getting caught.<br/><br/>Like number one, it's Christmas time and the greater extent of the McCallister family are going nuts over their annual festive holiday. This time it's Florida, and this time Macaulay Culkin's Kevin makes it as far as the airport departure lounge, in what is an improvement of not even getting out of his bedroom the first time round, but gets mixed up in the rush and lands himself on an airliner to New York. Feeding off what had happened back home in regards to Kevin and his managing to fall out with his family over a practical joke at a school choir pageant, access to his father's credit cards and a wad of existing cash draws him into staying at an expensive hotel and gorging himself on the surroundings rather than turn himself in. First and foremost, New York City dwarfs Kevin; a montage getting across the scale of the place in regards to this overtly street-wise youngster is encapsulated in a tracking shot away from The World Trade Centre as Kevin stands atop it.<br/><br/>Alas, a somewhat hackneyed subplot to do with the two burglars from the first one is cooked up; Joe Pesci's Harry and Daniel Stern's Marv have escaped from prison in amidst a riot and have come to New York as if European immigrants at the start of the century seeking opportunity and fresh starts. In direct opposition to his 5-star living in the mean time, however, is chief of the hotel floor Mr. Hector (Curry), whose gurning face is the subject of a dissolve designed to sync up with that of an image of The Grinch on television. Like those aforementioned bandits from the first, he is indeed out to wreck McCallister's Chritsmas cheer upon happening upon Kevin's scheme to live a high life on his father's card and by himself..<br/><br/>Complaints with the first film came with its tendency to place most of its eggs in the basket labelled ""final twenty minutes"", when a series of stunts and second unit sequences saw Marv and Harry smacked about by a number of booby-traps Kevin had laid for them. Here, one can practically feel Columbus nudging us in the arm and winking at us square in the face as the realisation the film is about to do what everybody responded to the first time, again. It was marginally fun the first time; here, harmless slapstick has crept up a notch to near full on body-horror: where a paint can on the bonce or a pellet gun round to the groin was once as bad as it got, one cannot help but omit gasps of surprise that Stern's character hasn't already been killed five minutes into the final act. This knowing sense about things only really mattering during these sequences is epitomised in Marv's 'knowing' reactions of ""Uh-oh!"" as something else befalls him - a laughter cue is all that's missing. The somewhat brainless and rather unnecessary sentiment of the whole thing is summarised in the reason for the final act to even happen, that of the fact the criminals have been snapped looting a store thanks to Kevin's Polaroid camera and are desperate not to be incriminated further. For whatever reason, they ditch the successful score and chase him into this dilapidated house of traps having already topped the wanted lists as escaped felons anyway. People say Kevin's intelligence in these films is too ""unrealistic"" for that of a ten year old; but with competition like this, are we all missing something?"
"RHewison","7","0","1","3 February 2012"," Surprisingly superior sequel
","Can a sequel ever be as good as the original? In this case yes. Home alone 2 made me laugh harder and louder than the original. The opening of Home Alone 2 was near identical to the original, but it was designed that way to harmlessly mock the former film and make us remembered why we loved it in the first place. However the film has changed location and this time Kevin is lost in New York. In a new and huge city, Kevin's adventures get even better. It was less of Kevin wandering around the house and more him exploring the world and it led to some very funny scenes in the Plaza, the hotel he's decided to check himself into. Acting-wise, I still don't think that his family improved. Luckily they seemed to be in the film less this time so they were bearable. Culkin again was fantastic in his comedy scenes, not so much in sad scenes. The pigeon lady was great and the return of the 'wet bandits' was fantastic. They were just as comedic the second time round, if not even more so. The tricks Kevin pulls on the bandits were even more amusing this time round and led to a lot of laughing out loud. They were much more inventive and the actors played their parts superbly. Such an enjoyable film, that dare I say it; I think I enjoyed the sequel more than the original."

"StevePulaski","7","0","1","18 November 2011"," ""If you can't board the right plane we'll have to cancel future trips, Kevin!""
","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a sequel that is almost identical in quality and plot to the first. The first film was a fresh new idea, but often misunderstood by people who weren't taking into consideration it was an exercise in childhood escapism. When you can look past its implausibility, it's a unique and amusing film for many, but different generations and different audiences will gradually differ in responses.<br/><br/>Now we have a sequel, which right off the bat sends me into useless quibbles. He doesn't have a home in New York, so how is he home alone? This could've easily been its own stand alone film if the characters were all different and just be called the film's subtitle ""Lost in New York."" But would it sell as well? Probably not. So bring back the three actors and we have ourselves a sequel.<br/><br/>The plot seems to be lifted directly from the original film. Due to a severe mix-up at the airport where Kevin (Culkin) follows a man wearing the same coat as his father, he is taken on a flight to New York instead of with his family who is going to Florida for Christmas. Kevin fearlessly checks himself into a hotel, gets settled in, then realizes the criminals he beat the hell out of (Pesci and Stern) in the first film come back and now have placed him back in their cross-hairs.<br/><br/>From there on out the plot becomes more jokes about being hit on the head and running away frantically. I give Macaulay Culkin a boatload of credit for not being one of the childhood actors like the ones on Full House where they spend a lot of their time standing still and looking cute. Culkin provides cute, boyish charm while creating eventful mishaps on screen. Just like in the first film; some antics are funny, some are redundant without being funny.<br/><br/>We also get a strange subplot with an old woman who enjoys feeding pigeons. She has been considered the ""old creep"" in town and has been shunned by her peers. That's how Kevin feels with his big family most of the time. Their connection is slim, but acceptable. While at the same time it feels almost contrived and not a very needed subplot. It does rest the tired hit-on-the-head jokes that have been hit over our head, pun intended, during the course of the film.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York provides some nice shots of New York, some decently executed dialog, and delightful cameos like Ally Sheedy, Donald Trump, and, my favorite, Tim Curry. The only downside is you're watching the same film. It still fuels the ""childhood escapism"" tank like I mentioned before, but it does hardly anything new with it. It just rehashes a formula previously seen before. More imagination to the story could've been taken into consideration.<br/><br/>Or maybe, just not have a sequel at all. The first was an unexpected success, it did very well in theaters, and is still played repeatedly during the holiday season. The concept of a child being left alone to fend for himself by accident is a possible thing. Unfortunately, the sequel does little to expand the idea except by removing the four walls barricading the kid in the first film and giving him a full city to work with. A lot happens in this two hours. Quite a lot of things. Plausible or not, it's beginning to get very redundant. I suggest parental counseling and a dog leash.<br/><br/>Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern. Directed by: Chris Columbus."

","It was not as good as the first mainly because I did not like the Pigeon lady as much as Marley, and also in this one it was also Kevin's fault that he got lost. He could have waited to get on the plane to get the batteries. This is why I think it was also his fault that he got lost. But it was way better than the third because Kevin was in it, the story was better, all the other characters were the same, it was a continuation of the first, the acting was good, and the plot was interesting. So once again not as good as the first but way better than 3 and 4. I also liked the traps. In the third one I did not like the traps very much. I did not like the pigeon lady at all.

"neil-476","8","0","1","10 January 2011"," There's something familiar about it...
","Home Alone 2 could also be called ""More Of The Same"", but that's OK because there's enough different and the same bit is fine.<br/><br/>I'll explain. His idiot family mislay Kevin at Christmas again - this time he is booked into a hotel where he has to bamboozle suspicious concierge Tim Curry into believing he isn't on his own. In due course he falls foul of Harry and Marv, the single minded but dim crooks from the first movie - they want revenge on him, he wants to foil their plan to rob a toy store, and the stage is set for a reply of the siege, full of slapstick violence, and taking place this time in the shell of a brownstone which is in mid-renovation. Finally there is - guess what? - a sentimental resolution.<br/><br/>Yes, the siege is violent, but the violence is cartoon violence: although Marv and Joe are hurt, things which would in reality kill them simply leave them somewhat stunned, following which they get up and resume their single-minded pursuit of Kevin.<br/><br/>I cast my vote, too, for the bricks and the way the sequence keeps you waiting for a variation which never comes. I also have a soft spot for the replay of the paint tins down the stairwell from the first movie, which does carry some funny variations.<br/><br/>And, again, that's the movie's strength - it is very funny."
"bock_g","7","0","1","16 November 2010"," An underrated sequel
","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) is the sequel to the worldwide hit comedy film, Home Alone (1990) starring Macaulay Culkin. <br/><br/>Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is left alone again, but this time he gets on the wrong plane which is headed to one of the coolest but is also one of most dangerous cities in America: New York City. As Kevin realizes he is parted from his family again--carrying his dad's wallet as he was looking for batteries for his tape recording device which caused him to get on the wrong flight as he was following a businessman who was wearing the identical coat to his dad's. In a similar fashion to the first film, he spends quite a luxurious (and somewhat of mischievous) vacation as he tours around New York, checks into the Plaza Hotel using his dad's credit card, and even has a hotel-chaffered limo take him to a giant toy store (like any ten year old's ideal dream of a vacation). His fun time is cut short as one of the hotel concierges (played by the hilarious Tim Curry) mistakenly discovers that Kevin was using a ""stolen"" credit card and chases him out of the hotel. Kevin also encounters the two dim-witted burglars from the first film, Marv and Harry (Played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci respectively) who escaped jail and were planning to break-in to the giant toy store Kevin just visited. Back in Florida (where Kevin's family spend a miserable trip as they are watching another foreign language-dubbed TV show), they get a call from the NYPD as they fly over to New York City to look for Kevin. Kevin befriends a lonely pigeon lady (played by Brenda Fricker) in a similar fashion to the scary-looking neighbor from the first film. Kevin once again, decides to foil Marv and Harry's plan by luring them to another booby-trapped house(his uncle's house under renovation). In the end, the burglars are caught and Kevin reconciles with his family once again. <br/><br/>Although this film was financially successful, it received negative critical responses. I would agree with some critics that some of the cartoon-sh slapstick humor was a little too over-the-top; but then again, thats the running gag of the Home Alone films. Despite the unbelievable actions of a ten-year old kid who checks into a fancy hotel, fights off burglars, and scares away the hotel concierge using a gangster film (fast-forwarding the other character's dialog), I still thought that was well done and imaginable for a witty kid like Kevin. Like the first film, it had the moral lesson of not judging people by looks, the importance of family, and the overall gags and jokes that were even better as Kevin is two years older in this film. I would say this film was even better than the first, a staple Christmas classic. If you ever come across the Home Alone series, rent the first two films and you will enjoy those funny laughs that the late John Hughes gave us."

"Sirus_the_Virus","5","0","1","5 December 2009"," The original was almost ignorable, the sequel, is ignorable.
","The original Home alone film wouldn't have had my interest if it wasn't for Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. Now the two stars, along with Macaulay Culckin star in the sequel,Home alone 2: Lost in New York. Even with the stars of the original returning, they can't even make it work. Home alone 2 is a sequel that is ignorable for many reasons. I'll start naming them off.<br/><br/>One of the flaws with the sequel is that there isn't much of a difference between the two films. They repeat a lot of the same things. There is a person that Kevin(Culkin) is afraid of and them he gets to know the person and realizes that she is actually a nice lady and in the end she helps him out. That happened in the original. Kevin sets up traps against the two crooks. That happened also. Another problem, like with the first one, is that the film is way too cheesy. I hate corny movies. I hate corny everything. As I said in my review for the original, Director Chris Cloumbus is the king of corny. He still holds onto that title.<br/><br/>So what's the sequel about? Well, as the Maccalister family sets off to Florida, they try ever so hard not to forget Kevin(Played by Macaulay Culkin). In this one they don't forget him. The retard goes the wrong way and realizes once he lands in New York""I'm in New York"". So Kevin is alone. In New York. Luckily, He is never raped or molested or mugged. But he does get in trouble with the hotel concierges(Played by Tim Curry, Rob Schneider, and Dana Ivey). And Kevin ironically runs into The Wet Bandits(Played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have recently escaped. <br/><br/>Home alone 2:Lost in New York has a few hilarious moments in it. Mostly thanks to Tim Curry, and watching these crooks suffer is kind of fun. But Home alone 2 is just a repeat of the original. It's also clichÃ©d. And corny. The original is mostly special thanks to Pesci and Stern. The sequel is funny at times, but I still thinks it's a thumbs down.<br/><br/>Home alone 2:Lost in New York:**/****"

The music and characterization of the other actors is still fairly good and the movie still has a nice warm Christmas film. This one, however, still leaves you feeling like you're watching a warner brothers film and after seeing this one you really don't want to see any more. Thus we end the Home alone experience.

","Kevin McAllister is back and alone once again in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. In the second installment of the home alone movies, Kevin finds himself in a similar situation with a twist. He has gotten lost in the airport on the way to Christmas in Florida, and ends up in New York City with all of the families' money and credit cards. Most young kids would panic, but Kevin takes advantage of the situation, going on a spending spree all around New York City, until he runs into a couple of old friends. Fresh out of Prison, Marv and Harry are up their old scheme when they come across the little kid who sent them to jail. Looking for revenge, Kevin must once again defend himself from the wet bandits. This movie is very closely related to the first. The general plot is the same in both movies, Kevin is stranded away from his family at Christmas time and must defend his house from Marv and Harry the criminals. Many of the tricks kevin uses to keep his distance from the thieves are repeated from the original movie, and sometimes can be repetitive. The movie has its own twists and the action is hilarious throughout the movie, much like the first. The ending is almost identical to the first, exciting and heartwarming. The new setting gives kevin a whole new world of toys to play with. The original movie gave Kevin familiar surroundings and a lot to work with, but stranded at his Aunt and Uncle's house in New York is a bit different. Kevin is forced to make do with what he can find, and it makes for some entertaingig action. New York City instead of a hometown is also a big change, and Kevin reacts differently in a unfamiliar city. The plot is able to stay remarkably the same in the two movies and play out so differently in each to the audience. The characters in each movie are the same, yet different. THe main characters are all the same. The family, Marv and Harry and Kevin are all the same from the first movie. This movie allows for a few more characters to be thrown into the mix, including a woman who lives in Central Park, and the Hotel Desk Manager. The interesting people Kevin meets plays a vital role in the attention of the audience, because the humor carries the film. Everyone kevin crosses paths with in the movie has an impact on his success in the big city. Overall the sequel did live up to the original. The first movie was great, but this one had some magic of its own. The New York setting is a perfect backdrop to the action and humor that plays out in this Christmas classic. Watch them together or separate and they are still both fun and enjoyable movies for the whole family."

Now in the sequel, Kevin is at it again except this time he's on his way to New York after getting confused during an airline station where he sees another man dressed in the same coat as his father. While Kevin's parents and relatives are worried that the hero is not in their presence, the young boy is in New York having the time of his life from spending his father's money to living in a luxury hotel at the Grand Plaza along with meeting interesting and weird characters from a homeless lady (Brenda Fricker) who feeds pigeons and later becomes his friend; then there's the hotel staff from the sinister Tim Curry as the concierge who has the smile of the Grinch to Rob Schinder as a suck-up bellboy.<br/><br/>And if you thought that Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were in prison...think again. Kevin encounters the two thieves where he finds out that they want to rob a local toy store.<br/><br/>Home Alone 2 feels like we're watching the same movie over again but in a new setting.

He coincidently meets the villain bandits from the last film, and they are set on robbing a toy store. Kevin sets out to stop them once again, and more hilarious slapstick comedy resumes. Not quite as good as the first film, 'Home Alone 2' still carries the Christmas spirit and spreads that warm, holiday feeling. Along with the comedy aspect come the moral subplots involving friendship/family and the meaning of Christmas.

","One of the funniest movies of all time.  What I really love about the first two Home Alone movies, is how funny they are and still have such heart at the end of the film.  There's always a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end of any John Hughe's movie (most of them anyway.). John Herd and Cathrine O'Hara did a great job in this film as they did in the first.  One of the best scenes is when she screams and then faints in the airport!  Classic comedy. And the best characters and best performances are definitely given by Daniel Stern and Joe Pescie.  They really make you hate them, since they're the bad guys.  And who can forget Tim Curry and Rob Shneider working in the Plaza hotel?  Next to Stern and Pescie, they're my favorite characters in the movie.  And they play them so well, it's hard to remember they're just acting.  Go watch it, seriously it's so funny!

I think it was a mistake that this happened a year after the first incident, that must of been the goof. I mean Kevin is so mature and not at all a hyper loudmouth, he had to be older than 9!

Just the other day, a group of my friends and I, sat down and watched it and I must say that having grown up, I can see that this movie was not so great as the first one. Ok, first off... 1.Kevin boards the wrong plane and is off to NYC while his family is off to Florida.(Here we go again!) 2.Kevin just so happens to take his Dad's bag which is full of cash and a credit card before he gets on the plane. 3.The hotel employees just so happen to let Kevin check in a famous hotel alone. Kevin also views the same black and white ""tommy gun"" video and uses it on the hotel security when they try to catch him. 4.Kevin manages to think up a plan and blow up an 8ft inflatable clown(in a matter of seconds) and disguise it as his Dad so the hotel employee(Tim Curry) can think he's with his Dad. 5.Harry and Marv break out of prison and just so happen to be headed toward NYC also where they ""coincidently"" bump into Kevin when he's in the same toy store the robbers are going to rob. 6.Kevin's aunt and uncle,who live in NYC, aren't home for the holidays and Kevin manages to get in their home and set the booby traps for Harry and Marv. 7.Kevin always seems to make friends with adults.  Like the shovel man and the check-out lady in the first one and now he makes friends with a homeless pigeon lady and the elderly toy store owner in this movie. 8.The robbers happen to fall into Kevin's traps equally and exact like the first movie. 9.For this to be a kids' movie, it's pretty violent, the things the robbers go through and especially when Harry(Pesci) puts a gun to Kevin's head at the end of the movie.(But of course we know even though he wants to, he's not gonna pull the trigger..but it's still pretty violent) 10.Kevin heads to the Rockerfeller x-mas tree, at the very end, and his Mom is headed there too and that's where they meet and reunite. What a coinsidence!! This movie was a little too silly, a little too violent for the younger crowd and too coincidentual!! But all in all, it was a cute sequal that consisted of the whole entire cast of the first movie. I like sequals that contain the people from the original one.

"jhclues","5","0","2","9 December 2001"," Macaulay Who?
","Since the early 80s, writer/producer (and sometime director) John Hughes has had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America.  Responsible for such films as `The Breakfast Club,' the wildly successful National Lampoon `Vacation' series (including `Christmas Vacation,' which to many has become a holiday staple, right up there with `A Christmas Carol' and `It's A Wonderful Life') and another favorite around Thanksgiving time, `Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' he nevertheless achieved his greatest commercial success when he came up with the idea of having a little boy getting inadvertently left behind when his family goes off for a Christmas vacation to Paris.  That, of course, was `Home Alone.'  But he didn't stop there. Some two years later that same little boy boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City while his parents and the rest of his family go to Florida, in `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York,' directed by Chris Columbus.<br/><br/>	Once again the extended McCallister family is off for the Christmas holidays, and this time Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) winds up alone in New York. Luckily for him, however, he somehow manages to end up with his father's carry-on, which just happens to contain a credit card.  And by using the kind of ingenuity that would escape most adults, he successfully checks himself into the Plaza Hotel under his dad's name, whereupon he soon discovers room service.  He also discovers Duncan's Toy Store (to which he is transported in style via the Plaza's limo, complete with cheese pizza just for him), a pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) in Central Park, and some old acquaintances from back home, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), the `Wet Bandits' themselves, though now known (since breaking out of prison) as the `Sticky Bandits.'  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) are frantic in Florida when they arrive and realize that Kevin is once again gone missing.  And with that, the search is on.  Meanwhile, back in New York--<br/><br/>	Opting to ride the `Home Alone' series out as writer/producer, Hughes placed the project in capable hands with director Columbus (who also directed the original `Home Alone,' and more recently the hugely successful `Harry Potter).  This one may not have been a stretch for him artistically, especially since the characters had been previously established in the first one, but comedy of any kind can be touchy, as it is such a purely subjective arena, and Columbus does a good job of keeping the story on track (for the most part) and moving it right along.  Wisely, the filmmakers chose to proceed on the assumption that everyone had seen `Home Alone,' and therefore waste little time setting things up.  Instead, they contrive to get Kevin posthaste to New York -- where the story really begins-- and even if you haven't seen the first one this will work for you, because this, as they say, isn't brain surgery.<br/><br/>	Even so, it's a fairly uneven film.  There's a few laughs in the rush and flurry of getting Kevin to the Big Apple, but at that point Culkin is expected to carry the film, and quite frankly, left alone (no pun intended) it's a task for which he is simply not qualified.  He was veritably propelled to stardom when he played Kevin the first time around, but now-- two years later and two years older-- whatever `cuteness' or magic he may have had then is already noticeably starting to fade.  All that aside, however, the truth of the matter is he's just not that capable as an actor, paling in comparison to Haley Joel Osment or `Potter's' Daniel Radcliffe. Culkin's timing is poor and his reactions lack the spontaneity that would have made Kevin a bit more believable.  His whole presentation of the character just seems too forced; and the attitude he conveys is more caustic than cute, which certainly detracts from his credibility, as well.<br/><br/>	Oscar winner (for `My Left Foot') Brenda Fricker has a dismally thankless role as the `Pigeon Lady' who connects with Kevin in the park.  With her character, Hughes and Columbus are obviously attempting to recapture the poignancy of the Culkin/Roberts Blossom `church' scene in the original (which worked very well); but Fricker's heavy-handed dramatics, combined with Culkin's aloof response to her, is almost too embarrassing to watch. And the sight of Fricker standing statue-like in the park while pigeons come to roost on her head and shoulders is neither comical nor touching, but ridiculous.  In Fricker's defense, it wasn't entirely her fault; she was simply given material that didn't work and a part that was a no-win situation from the beginning.<br/><br/>	The only thing that really saves this picture at all is, without question, the slapstick antics of Marv and Harry.  When they at last engage in battle with Kevin (and you know it's coming), it's more violent than the Road Runner cartoons it emulates, but manages to produce some out-and-out, over-the-top, bona fide belly laughs.  Because-- forget everything else-- these two guys are dumber than a sackful of hammers, and Columbus successfully milks it for all it's worth and then some.  A warning to kids, though:  These buffoons are professionals; do not try this stuff at home.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Concierge), Dana Ivey (Mrs. Stone), Rob Schneider (Cedrick), Devin Ratray (Buzz), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Kieran Culkin (Fuller), Eddie Bracken (Mr. Duncan) and Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank).  Culkin may be the `star' of this show, but without the talent they surround him with, `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York' would've had to be retitled `Lost at the Video Store,' with a shelf life of about two minutes before disappearing altogether.  As it is, thanks to some cunning maneuvers by the filmmakers, this one at least provides some passable entertainment and a few good laughs.  For a satisfying evening at the movies you could certainly do worse than this; but you could do much better, too.  I rate this one 5/10."
"Camera Man","Null","0","1","15 October 2001"," Tragedy and fear on a vaster and yet also intenser scale than the orignal, faced down by the comedy of startlingly emotive child actor, Culkin.
","In Home Alone Columbus threw a child, movingly portrayed by prodigy Culkin, in debut role, into a bleak, wintrous world alone. However, it is in the sequel that the story is truly a success. Home Alone Two, far more successfully than the original, depicts a universal reality of loss and fear, and faces it with courage and hope, beautifully juxtaposing comedy against the tragedy of the piece. The success stems from three basic areas. Firstly it is in the repetition and continuity from the original piece. The premiss is the same, child loses family on Christmas, as are the actors, Culkin shining in his lead role, but with Pesci and Stern wonderfully complementing his acting and contrasting the innocence of his role with their own darkness. However, secondly, it is the progression from the orignal that makes it the greater film. The metaphor, of the first film, of the vast emptiness of each of us having to face the outside world ultimately alone is now intensified: the towering buildings of New York represent the huge power of the unknown with the winter becoming harsher, not the twee, wholesome-neighbourhood, warm white of the first film, but now a swirling blizzard against the backdrop of a dark city. Culkin is now out of his element: the fear is increased. Thirdly, it cannot be denied that Culkin's skill as an actor is responsible, to a great extent, for the perfection of the film. Culkin holds the audience in his hands. To watch him is to watch an artist, crafting his masterpiece on the screen. We fear with him, we laugh with him. Columbus gave Culkin a beautiful, simple, universal, and clearly for both he and Culkin, personal, story, and Culkin turned it into his, and Columbus', masterpiece. Home Alone Two deals with eternal issues of our lives on this earth, issues of fear, symbolised by New York in Winter and Stern's and Pesci's bleak characters, and of hope, personified by Culkin. Many may see the film as a bleak and cynical depiction of humanity, but I feel that whilst this film acknowledges the darkness in the world, ultimately through Culkin we are shown that there is hope."

","Hey I know this movie ain't a masterpiece, it may be just a product of the money-making machine of hollywood, it may be just a way to cash in on the first film's success, but I think this movie has a value of its own, present specially on the way New York itself is also a character throughout the film, which makes it a part of the story and not just a setting. I think this movie does not deserve the rating it has been given, the John Williams score is worth 7 points alone. The movie has also some magic moments, more-than-just-funny performances by the ""Wet Bandits"" and, most importantly (a hint for the makers of Home Alone 3) IT STICKS TO THE VALUES OF THE FIRST MOVIE!!! I mean, they don't want to do it for the slapstick or the gross-out humor, it's really a sequel and not a way to make money out of the first movie.

","Hughes first installment was decent up to a point, before the violence erupted.  Here he somehow was greenlighted even though he used the EXACT same script, at some times right down to dialogue used in the first film. As others have pointed out, the title is a misnomer as Culkin ends up on the wrong flight and wanders New York for a couple of days.  Some said his acting improved, I still found him stiff in his delivery, but that didn't stop Little Mac from netting 6 mil for this.  His adventures this time around are a little duller, as he basically spends money all over the place and dazzles adults with his outlook on life.  It's all filler to lead up to what the kids came for, more painful burglar bashings, even more extended and tortuous than the first movie.  How many times can these take a hit and have it be funny?  After one or two, it just gets unbelievable, and then uncomfortable.  Again, Pesci and Stern squeal their lungs out as they're dropped, slammed, electrocuted, torched, bonked, etc.  At least the gags in the first film had a shread of credibility.  Here, Hughes concocts such ridiculous means of slapstick that you roll your eyes in disbelief.  Take for instance the scene where Culkin magically (thats the only word to describe it) gets Stern to jump on a plank placed over a barrell so he can hurtle Pesci several feet into the air, and land on top of a car, smashing its windows to bits.  Or the dumbest moment that others have mentioned, when Culkin flings brick after brick from a rooftop into a dumbstruck Stern's face.  Didn't anyone on set say ""ok, come on, now this is kind of stretching it.""  This is one of the most depressing ""comedies"" to come along in awhile, that has no idea what Christmas should be about.  But more infuriating for me, is that my writing mentor Hughes has truly sunk with this crap.  Only bright spot is a terrific theme song by Darlene Love, ""All Alone on Christmas"".  Otherwise, nothing of value, except the few hundred million suckered into turning out for this waste."

I'm bothered that the filmmakers were so in love with their first Alone movie, that they decided to carbon copy it for the sequel. It's the same film in every respect, only now it features New York. What concerns me is the danger of having Home Alone become a formula, where people start pitching ideas to studios like ""Home Alone... on a bus""<br/><br/>Actually, forget all that. All that concern fades away instantly when one considers the real problem here, which is that it seems that Hell is actually exporting feature length films for American release. How this deal was negotiated I can never know, but the unavoidable fact is that we now have a horrifying window into the land of the forsaken.<br/><br/>I always wondered what endless torture would look like. How, for example, could one be violently beaten and killed and then instantly resurrected for another session? Look no further than the scene where Joe Pesci and the other guy fall through three stories of a building and then get up for more. They proceed to get beaten, clubbed, smacked, skinned, burned, and walloped in a manner that would make Moe, Larry and Curly beg for humanity's forgiveness.<br/><br/>Or take for instance the scene outside the building, where Culkin, looking just as sweet and angelic as he did in the last scene of Jacobs Ladder, proceeds to lob brick after brick off the roof, where they plummet five stories and hit the burglar in the face, again and again, and again. Now I've become fairly desensitized to violence over years of TV and movie watching, but having to watch this lesson in cruelty, being so diabolically presented as banana-peel slapstick and a bad guy getting what's coming to him, just made my skin crawl.<br/><br/>Is there any worse fate than a cherub faced boy throwing brick after brick down at you, and no matter what you do, each one will hit you full force in the face? If you've ever wanted to see what this might actually look like, it's all in Home Alone 2.<br/><br/>The final scare here is that the other people here who have reviewed the movie have generally liked it but warned everyone to stay away from Home Alone 3, which apparently is very bad."
