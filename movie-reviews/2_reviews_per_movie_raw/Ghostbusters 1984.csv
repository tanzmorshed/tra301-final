","This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! ""Ghostbusters"" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. <br/><br/>This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best ""a-hole"" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, ""Dickless"". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. <br/><br/>Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!<br/><br/>They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From ""This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head"" to ""Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947"" to ""Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! "" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). <br/><br/>Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. <br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

"eamon-hennedy","Null","168","194","25 February 2004"," My favorite film as a child and still brilliant today!
","I have special affection for this film. When I was a youngster, growing up between the ages of four and ten, this was my favorite film. I loved the whole Ghostbusters thing. I loved the sequel, the cartoon series, I had to have the toys and merchandise every Christmas, you name it. Strangely, as I have gotten older, I find myself appreciating the film more and more. When I was a child I loved it for the special effects, the gadgets and the ghostbusting especially. Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I'm older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like Venkman's line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like Slimer being the ghost of John Belushi and Venkman rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80's hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.<br/><br/>Unlike many of today's blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against Slimer, Gozer and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80's, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. Bill Murray, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as Peter Venkmen who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the ""there is no Dana, only Zool"" moment. Murray's priceless reaction to Dana Barrett's possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as Murray, we have co writers Dan Akyroyd and Harold Ramis sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver making a wonderful damsel in distress, Rick Moranis is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a  neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.<br/><br/>Add to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made."
"magic_marker","9","252","296","16 September 2002"," A severely underrated film
","What's that you say? Ghostbusters, one of the most financially successful and over-hyped comedies of the eighties, underrated? Yes. Precicely because it was so over-hyped and made so much money, there has been a stigma attached to this film identifying it as a childish FX piece, when it is nothing of the sort. Most of the lines people remember(""He slimed me,"" ""OK. So? She's a dog,"" ""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"") are not its funniest or wittiest lines, which often are missed on first or even second viewing. I laugh every time I observe a gag or a quip that I somehow missed the other 20 times I viewed a scene; ""Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?"" ""That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me"", or, to the driver of a van from a loony bin, ""Dropping off or picking up?"" Brilliant.<br/><br/>Not only is Ghostbusters funny, it manages to include some truly scary scenes. And not just lose-your-popcorn moments like the fridge from Hell, but also scenes of quiet, thoughtful chill, like Egon's retelling of how the possessed apartment building came into being, or Winston recalling the Book of Revelation. Which other film has managed to combine the Marx Brothers with HP Lovecraft?<br/><br/>The special effects hold up well, besides some obvious studio sets and models, but what really creates this film's world is the stunning cinematography. Manhattan, perhaps the pinnacle of Gothic architectural evolution, is brilliantly utilised here to create a sense of menacing grandeur. After watching ""Ghostbusters"" I couldn't imagine the realm of the Old Gods opening into our world from anywhere else. The soundtrack is great, not the overrated theme (Which was in fact lifted from Huey Lewis' ""I Need a New Drug""), but the wonderfully blusey ""Cleaning Up the Town,"" the creepy proto-techno chiller ""Magic"" and also the wonderful score by the late and much lamented Elmer Bernstein."
"Don-102","Null","111","132","12 October 1999"," Film Has Endured the 80's and Stayed Sharp Through the 90's
","Bill Murray is one of the best wise guys in the business.  I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical 'Dr. Venkman' cuts loose throughout this good comedy.  Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with ""getting into Bill's mind"" as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character.  Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look).  Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80's and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.<br/><br/>Murray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork 'Egon'.  The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events.  Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.<br/><br/>This was a picture I loved when I was a kid.  I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed.  It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the 'Busters turbulent jobs.  The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan's movie library.  SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred.  Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now. <br/><br/>It is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the 'Busters, for he was originally cast.  The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.  It has spanned these phases for me and still works wonderfully. <br/><br/>
RATING: ***"
"smatysia","7","21","23","20 December 2018"," Still pretty good
","Many comedies age poorly, but I thought that this one has held up pretty well. Lots of special effects (which have also held up pretty well) but the comedy does not get lost in them. Murray does his absurd deadpan, Ramis his low-key deadpan, and Ackroyd his high-energy weirdness. Sigourney Weaver proves that she has comedic chops. Still pretty good, not great."
"AlsExGal","10","16","17","29 June 2018"," Just a perfect piece of comedic timing and so 80s
","Ghostbusters was so great because it took the science fiction and fantasy part seriously (considering how Dan Aykroyd IRL is a strong believer in the paranormal this makes sense), so the humor was almost entirely from dialogue and the performance of the cast. It takes the simple concept of ""people who start a ghost catching business"" and adds things like multidimensional gods and giant killer corporate mascots. These are things you wouldn't expect from a comedy movie at the time. Apparently, Aykroyd's original draft of the story was almost entirely sci-fi action with little humor.<br/><br/>The resulting story was dead serious, and rather terrifying. A woman becoming possessed by a demon just because of where her apartment is? Being transformed into a monster, then into stone while she was unwillingly in service to a dark god? That is scary, not funny. What MADE the movie funny was how the actors responded to the situation. They were just like normal people, put in an abnormal situation, and responded in line with their own personal character, which was mainly to crack jokes so they could handle the fear. It was just four guys, out of their depth, going in with a grin because backing down wasn't an option for them.<br/><br/>Bill Murray just shows outstanding comedic timing in this one. He had me from the opening scene where he is shocking a male subject in an experiment while simultaneously trying to ""get the girl"" by convincing her she is psychic.<br/><br/>What was 80s about it? Well, the triumph of the private sector over academeia - ""I've worked in the private sector, they expect results"", and the EPA contributing to the end of the world. Everybody could forget about Watergate, recessions, and nuclear war, and just laugh at the movies for a change. If you've never seen it I recommend it . The comedy is timeless."
"cricketbat","10","10","10","27 December 2018"," A timeless classic
","There aren't many movies better than Ghostbusters. This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","76","95","10 June 2006"," Still Very Funny & Entertaining
","There is no set definition of the word ""classic"" but I'm sure this film qualifies as such or will in the near future, since it was so unique and popular....and remains so today, over 20 years old later. It's just one of those films that you remember seeing when it came out at the theaters. I doubt if anyone has forgotten the catchy theme song, either. <br/><br/>Despite numerous viewings, I still find this very funny as I suspect many people do, because it entertains so well. I know the story is ludicrous and I don't believe for one second in ghosts so I ignore the ""theology"" and just laugh at Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson. <br/><br/>Murray, as he tends to do, grabs the spotlight more than the rest and delivers more laughs than any of the cast but my favorite was Moranis as the nerdy ""Louis Tully."" I wish his role had been bigger. All the guys, however, plus Sigourney Weaver, the love interest of the always-horny Murray, are fun. I even liked the sequel because most of this cast was included."

","Ghostbusters was an incredibly huge smash hit on its original release back in `84  and its not hard to see why - its a  funny , exciting  and imaginative  thrill ride. There is a lot to like about  ghostbusters , like bill Murrays  constant and always funny wise cracks,  the films constant shift  from a light hearted comedy to  intense ghost busting thriller and of course , the technically flawless attack of the marsh mallow man  that is probably one of my favorite parts of this film.<br/><br/>In this day and age of computer generated  fx wizardry   the completely analogue special effects  still look  great ( especially the stay puft marsh mallow man , its rampage through the city   looks incredibly   real ! ) and the film it self is still better and more imaginative  than  a lot of event movies you will find in a cinema near you  today .<br/><br/>And to top it all off  Ghostbusters is one of the few films out there that actually  had  worthy TV spin off that was the ""real Ghostbusters"", a cartoon that  i loved as a kid.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is a film that truly deserves its iconic status.<br/><br/>The screen dwellers mark (out of 5 ) : * * * *"
"SmileysWorld","8","61","76","8 August 2002"," Great marriage of comedy and spookiness
","Very rarely can you pull off a successful blend of two separate movie genres,but the makers of Ghostbusters were overwhelmingly so.On the one hand,you have the comedic charm of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd,and on the other,a genuine ghostly spookiness that makes you want to hide under a blanket.I recently bought a copy and watched it for the first time in several years,and it's still just as fresh as it was in it's initial release in 1984.It has a great supporting cast for Murray and Aykroyd,including the always great Sigourney Weaver,Rick Moranis,Ernie Hudson,and Harold Ramis,who is just as talented behind the camera as he is in front of it.Watch it with your family,but keep an eye on younger children,as the spookiness may be more than they can handle. Great stuff."
"Somebody_Has_Stolen_My_Name","Null","99","131","14 April 2005"," ""We got one!""
","The first thing that needs to be said is that Ghostbusters (1984) is possibly the funniest film ever. That's quite the bold statement to make but with good cause. This film holds up probably more than any other comedy in existence. You know how there are those movies that you see that are hysterical the first few times you see them? This one just keeps on coming. I remember when I was a kid, I wore our copy of Ghostbusters out. At the time, I thought it was a horror movie (I wasn't the brightest bulb) so I watched it constantly (Being that I am a horror buff) never realizing what it truly was. I hadn't yet caught on to a lot of the humor. About eight years later, I noticed that I hadn't seen the film for forever and a day. I popped it in and oh my God...I just about died with laughter.<br/><br/>This movie has something for everyone. Director Ivan Reitman said that he found a comedic formula for films...it works as follows: There's the brain, the heart, and the mouth. Ghostbusters scored with all of them. As the brain of the bunch, Egon Spengler's (Harold Ramis also co-wrote it) use of witty humor is hilarious. If you have the right mind set, almost everything Spengler says is laugh out loud funny. At the heart of the Ghostbusters is Dan Aykroyd's (Who created the idea for the film) lovable fool, Ray Stantz. Ray has a tenacity for saying simple minded things and using very little logic and yet somehow the man got a P.H.D. (Probably through studying habits, despite ignorance.) There's a line that he says involving a smell in the beginning of the movie that I am chuckling at just thinking about it. This of course leaves Bill Murray (He was nominated for a Gloden Globe) as the sarcastic Peter Venkman (The mouth of the beast.) Peter is likely the one that gets the most laughs because he, being the mouth that he is, never stops making fun of everything. It's like Rodney Dangerfield in the party scene in Caddyshack but a whole lot funnier and continues the rest of the movie. The film also produces some laughter out of the minor characters as well. The scatological humor toward the end of the film between Rick Moranis (In a role intended for John Candy) and Sigourney Weaver is quite laughter inducing. Ernie Hudson in one of his first big roles has a few good lines as the other Ghostbuster, Winston Zeddmore (The only one who's not a doctor) and William Atherton of Die Hard fame plays the ultimate annoyance as Walter Peck. Not to be forgotten in the mix is Annie Potts as Janine who has some rather memorable humorous lines, for instance the one I've written to summarize the movie. Numerous other well known faces are seen on screen too, which includes John Belushi (Or rather his continuation of the character Bluto, from Animal House) as the principal image used for the now famous 'Disgusting Blob,' Slimer. Like any good comic will tell you, good comedy is generally about setting up the other guys around you. Well, it just so happens that the characters all work well with each other to set the great comedic moments staged in this film.<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten however in all the funny one liners and set ups is the overall film. Ghostbusters was nominated for numerous awards including Oscars for best song (Courtesy of Ray Parker Jr.) and special effects, which are now slightly dated but possibly work even better with the wacky style being consistent with the rest of the movie. Along with Parker, there are numerous other great songs including a song by The Bus Boys that climbed charts and a rather creepy seeming song (But works well) by Mick Smiley. Another thing that should not be forgotten is the horror elements of the film. Though purposely outrageous, the effects do serve as some potential scare moments. Among the most frightening involve stop motion animated puppets called Terror Dogs. Though the scares are few, they do work fairly well (They had me convinced as a youngster) bringing enough threat to the ghosts that haunt New York City. The story itself is interesting as well, involving some intriguing mythology of Sommeria among other countries.<br/><br/>Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!"
"MovieAddict2016","9","92","125","20 December 2003"," One of the funniest films of all time. Who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!
","I have a small posse of favorite comedians. Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He's been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world.<br/><br/>I like all of the comedians in ""Ghostbusters,"" come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for ""The Blues Brothers."" And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as ""Vacation,"" ""Groundhog Day,"" and ""Analyze This.""<br/><br/>Then there's also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in ""Spaceballs,"" Barney Coopersmith in ""My Blue Heaven,"" and that wacky inventor in ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids.""<br/><br/>Yes, one could say that ""Ghostbusters"" is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (""Kindergarten Cop""). It's a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they're in over their heads.<br/><br/>It starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a ""ghost-busting"" company.<br/><br/>But they immediately realize that it won't be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.<br/><br/>They pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.<br/><br/>However, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn't believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana's apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.<br/><br/>Sounds corny, huh? It's meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.<br/><br/>I don't know, there's something in me that loves ""Saturday Night Live"" humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don't find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as ""The Simpsons,"" but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.<br/><br/>Part of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, ""Ghostbusters"" is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn't always a howler. It's more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from ""Saturday Night Live"" and such backgrounds.<br/><br/>Murray steals every scene he is in. This, along with `Groundhog Day,' is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff'd man, check out Murray's face. This is classic stuff.<br/><br/>As much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray's flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff'd Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd's performance in this film, I think of that scene.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It's light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors' and writers' backgrounds of ""Saturday Night Live"" -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"
"andrewnmiller","10","7","7","14 October 2018"," A comedy that never seems to age.
","My first exposure to Ghostbusters happened when I was quite young and I do remember watching it a few times and rather enjoying it even if there were moments that scared the ever-loving crap out of me but as I got older, the film dropped out of my viewing radar until I decided to rewatch it last year and low and behold, it still holds up just as much as it did back in 1984. From it's ingenious mixture of horror and comedy to its perfect casting and catchy theme song, Ghostbusters easily stands head and shoulders above most of today's painfully unfunny comedies.<br/><br/>The film starts with a ghost haunting an old library and freighting a librarian. Following this incident, three out-of-work parapsychologists named Peter Vankman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler, who have started their own business called Ghostbusters, are called in to investigate but are scared out of the library. Upon being fired from their jobs at a local university, the three move into an abandoned fire station and make it their base of operation. Meanwhile, a woman named Dana Barrett returns to her apartment and soon sees a carton of eggs cooking themselves on her countertop as an evil demonic spirit speaks the words ""Zuul"". Faced with the increased paranormal activity around New York City, the team hire another member named Winston Zeddmore but now they also must face an even greater threat then Dana is possessed by Zuul and prepares for the arrival of a Sumerian god known as Gozer and only the Ghostbusters can stop it.<br/><br/>In light of the awful 2016 remake which felt more like an unintentional parody of a Ghostbusters movie, the original film still remains a high-water mark for comedies that deal with supernatural elements like Dogma, Young Frankenstein, and Beetlejuice. It's always been a hard nut to crack in terms of balancing the line between horror and comedy just right and while movies like Evil Dead II pulled this off perfectly, Ghostbusters remains the perfect cinematic model to use when it comes to approaching the area of supernatural comedy. Give how it was Dan Aykroyd who came up with the idea for a team of men traveling through time and different demotions hunting ghosts as well as writing the first outline for what the movie would later become, this idea is nothing short of interesting and original but when director Ivan Reitman got ahold of it, he told Dan to scale it back a notch and make it more grounded but nonetheless, it did provide a strong base for Reitman, Aykroyd, Harold Ramis as well as the rest of the cast to build upon and add in new ideas as they saw fit. Plus, the screenplay for the movie is a perfect example of how to do characters in a comedy without having them come across as painfully unfunny stereotypes or characters with no depth or personality. Over the course of the film, there are times where the character of Peter Vankman is doing things that any normal person would deem to be unappealing or downright offensive as shown in a scene where he deliberately gives a student a shock while carrying out a cognitive test. Now, does the scene make the viewer assume that Vankman is the kindest man on Earth? Not in the slightest. Does the moment make you believe that he is funny as all hell? Absolutely. Out of all of the characters in the movie, Vankman seems to be the one who grows the most as a person over the course of the story as he starts out as a flirting twit but once he meets Dana, he begins to change into a more bona fide and honorable character as well as having something worth fighting for ay the end of the film. As for the other Ghostbusters, they really don't get much in the way of development but with that being said, they really don't need any as they are flawless in their own right and have no reason to be developed. All four of the Ghostbusters are engaging, comical and serve the film's plot as they are needed. One thing this film does so much better than the remake was the handling of the character of Winston Zeddmore in that he isn't portrayed as a scientist but rather an average working-class guy who just needs a job which makes him a character anyone can relate to instead of a screaming African-American stereotype in the remake. Even the other side-characters like Janine Melnitz, Louis Tully, and Dana Barrett are great characters and they never feel like they overstay their welcome nor are they ever aggravating to the point of stupidity unlike some characters in recent comedy films. <br/><br/>Something else that Ghostbusters does so it is making the lead characters the little guys who have to break the system and while the 2016 remake attempted to do the same thing, there it just felt automatically given to the 4 leads rather than have it be earned but in the '84 movie, that element of the story feels natural as the team really do feel like they are the underdogs as at first they all lose their jobs and are seen as deranged or hustlers by a large array of doubters. The '84 movie takes this idea even farther as by way of the character of Walter Peck: a pompous attorney for the EPA whose desire is to pull down the Ghostbusters at every turn and nearly achieves his goal. This idea not only provides the viewer a feeling that the team is doing battle against government officials and the order of things, it also gives the Ghostbusters some tangible blockades to conquer along with giving them the necessary character growth as a team. <br/><br/>With the aid of Reitman and Ramis, Aykroyd grounded the movie's story in reality much in the same way Christopher Nolan would later do with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so that not only do the Ghostbusters have to do battle with legislators, attorneys, and hotel supervisors while doing their job but also the world they inhabit looks real and lived-in rather than overly fanciful or dark and gritty. The romantic subplot between Peter and Dana is nicely handled as both characters have wonderful chemistry with each other and the romance never feels like it's just there for the sake of the plot not to mention Dana actually speaks like and acts like a real single woman in New York City which makes her character all the more likable and enduring and we understand why Peter is fond of her which is more than I can say for the overly-feminized and unlikable characters Paul Feig and Katie Dippold gave us in the remake. The romance between Vankman and Dana adds another grounded and adult aspect to the movie. Throughout the course of any action or action-comedy film, it's always a total blast to see the heroes having to something they shouldn't do in order to defeat the villain and save the day. Much like the air tanks in Jaws or Dr. Strange's plan in Avengers: Infinity War, the ex machine that will destroy Gozer is implied earlier in the movie. Not only is it essential to put your characters in a no-win scenario, but it's also a great innovation to have them win by shattering the rules. The crossing the streams idea isn't just a convenient resolution to the film's climax but it also adds to the movie's motifs of identity and anti- absolutism that run throughout the film. This is one of the many reasons why the original Ghostbusters is still seen as a beloved classic while the 2016 remake will likely continue to ridiculed and hated for years to come. <br/><br/>Even though Dan Aykroyd required other people to help him get the story more grounded and less out there but simply put, there would have been no Ghostbusters if it wasn't for Dan and his zeal for the supernatural. The original movie never once demoralizes its ghostly aspects. Even those characters who are shown to be total cynics are soon convicted otherwise. The movie takes it's lore passionately and much of the movie's humor comes from how the characters respond to the eerie circumstances instead of the situations themselves. The Ghostbusters is in no way a camp movie but rather a supernatural comedy in the vain of what Tim Burton or Mel Brooks do with their films where the reaction is just as important as what we're seeing on screen. Even the arrival of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man at the end battle is more of a joke about Ray's childhood naivetÃ© being used against the team. The film was realized by a man who wasn't just fascinated by the paranormal but also had a great level of admiration for it as well. Regardless of whatever idea a movie has, no matter how outlandish or far-fetched, the more genuine it'll be if you put the effect into your film's screenplay and make that idea come alive, then the more convincing your movie will be to the audience and the more they'll respond to it. <br/><br/>Unlike some modern-day blockbusters who feel like they need to be dull and grandiose in order to give the impression that they're somehow deep and thought-provoking films like Batman V. Superman and therefore lacking in any sense of fun or excitement, Ghostbusters is both a hilarious and entertaining film about the supernatural world that is able to work without having to talk down to it's audience. The action set pieces of the team catching Slimer in the hotel and the scene of them battling Gozer and the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man are all perfectly executed to a high standard and looks incredibly real as well as a lot of fun to watch instead of the giant CGI eyesore action set piece that the 2016 movie gave us. As for the visual effects, they may look cheesy by today's standards but they still work in the movie's favor when working with the more comical style as well as being compatible with the overall story. There are even some genuinely frightening moments in keeping with the horror aspects of the film such as the stop-motion Terror Dogs or the scene of Dana being processed by Zuul and while the scares are few and far between, they still work wonderfully well. The soundtrack for Ghostbusters is composed by the great Elmer Bernstein and it's easily one of the best soundtracks for a comedy movie I've ever heard. The opening theme of the film"

","Love this movie! Seriously one of the best comedies ever made. If you haven't watch this movie, what are you waiting for?!?"
"Old Joe","Null","52","76","13 October 2002"," Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!
","For it's time, Ghostbusters would have to be a classic. Visiting such realms as the supernatural, is sure not meant to be funny, but this film does stretch that rule a little. Thankfully it does, as it allows those among us (like me), who do not believe in ghost and goblins, to sit back, relax and enjoy the funny antics of these ghost-busting heroes. Although it might be a little dated in the new millennium, 'Ghostbusters' is still one of the 'great comedies of the 1980's' in my view.<br/><br/>When the University downsizes the parapsychology department, Doctors Venkman, Stantz and Spengler make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters, investigators and exterminators of paranormal pests! When the bewitching Dana Barrett discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, our heroes come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to raise hell in Manhattan.<br/><br/>When reviewing a movie, I try to be as fair as I can be. However I feel that by only viewing a movie once, we can not comprehend or appreciate the work that has gone into it, as a lot of work goes into bringing a movie to 'life'. For me that is no more apparent than with this classic hit. The time spent doing the script, special effects, production designs all have their merit and make this movie great. It is not just actors doing their job, as that is only one small part of the movie.<br/><br/>Most of 'Ghostbusters' success must be given to director Ivan Reitman. He did a fabulous job directing the Ghostbusters. I am certain that he left no stone unturned when it came to getting this film right and I am so glad he did. What also made this film more unique was that two of its stars wrote one very very good script. I am of course talking about Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. Their originality and comedy on paper, made watching this film a real joy. It is not often that stars write good scripts, but this time these guys got it right.<br/><br/>The cast that this film has was amazing to say the least. The four Ghostbuster characters were all different, which made them great to watch. I love the way that director Reitman summed up the Ghostbusters. He said of the three main guys that, Bill Murray was the 'mouth' or the smart ass of the film, while Dana Barrett says of Dr Venkman, ' you're more like a game-show host' and I have to agree with that, Dan Akroyd was the 'hands', meaning the person who was very hands-on when came to the ghostbusting, and finally Harold Ramis was the 'Brains' or the smartest one of Ghostbusters. Add in the cheery Ernie Hudson, who played Winston Zeddemore, making them the perfect team.<br/><br/>However, the Ghostbusters are a little different when it comes to doing their job. They have funny facilities, which only they could invent, a car that is as wild and conspicuous as its owners are, while the tools that they use to trap there supernatural phenomenon are weird and crazy. I love the traps, 'nuclear accelerators' and other bits and pieces they simply refer to as 'toys', when they are anything but that.<br/><br/>Then take into consideration the other great roles in this film, as without them this film would not be as good. Sigourney Weaver was very 'spiritual' when came to being the normally delightful Dana Barrett. I really enjoyed the onscreen chemistry between her and Bill Murray. Rick Moranis played the moronic '' as only he can. I always think of him as the man from 'Little shop of horrors', but there is no doubting his acting talents. Add in the very 'unusual' and eccentric Receptionist Janine, who was amusingly portrayed by Annie Potts. I love it when she screams 'we got one'. Yet I still say my favourite character in the Ghostbusters, over the silly Venkman (who is second), is the funny ghost Slimer. While Murray is as insane as the ghosts were in this movie, Slimer steals the show in my view. He is wild, 'slimes' people and makes the Ghostbusters all the funnier. Whoever invented Slimer is a genius!<br/><br/>There are some very funny scenes and lines in this movie. I love how we are introduced to the first ghost in the movie, who is part of the library in New York, then the mayhem and chaos we see slimmer cause in the Hotel is classic cinematography. The Venkman line at the end of the scene is priceless as he says 'we came, we saw, we kicked its ass!' Throw in scenes with the monsters that run around New York terrorising people, the unlocking of ghosts by the Environmental Protection jerk and the Marshmallow Man are all hilarious parts to a movie that is full on from start to the finish.<br/><br/>
I wish I had been old enough to see the opening of 'Ghostbusters' in the cinema, as I am sure it would have had a huge cinema release. When I remember the Ghostbusters two things come to mind. One is the hypnotic tune 'Ghostbusters' written and performed by Ray Parker Jnr., and two is that my mother and one of her friends said that they banned their children from viewing such rot. I certainly missed out on seeing many great facets of what the Ghostbusters spawned, such as two ingenious cartoons. I sort of understand what they were on about, but I would have preferred being allowed to watch it and then just forget about it. This film has a lot to like about, it is funny, crazy and a little bit different. If you are yet to see what the great fuss is about the 'Ghostbusters', then please do yourself a favour and pick up a copy today. Yes, they are ready to believe you!<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Ghostbusters': 5 (Brilliant Film)"

It is a movie that is suitable for the entire family. Yes, it has something for everybody.<br/><br/>There is no need to go into details about the story for ""Ghost Busters"" as it is a story that everyone with an interest in movies is familiar with, and if you aren't familiar with it, shame on you, I guess you have been hiding under a rock somewhere.<br/><br/>Effect-wise then ""Ghost Busters"" is okay for a movie from 1984, and it most definitely was state of the art and visually impressive back in the day. Yes, certain effects are quite fake and poor by todays standards, but you bear with it because this is a movie driven by a solid story and a rich character gallery. And while not a main character, the ghost Slimer will always be remembered fondly when talking about ""Ghost Busters"".<br/><br/>The acting is good, and there is a good ensemble of talents on the cast list. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson will always be the original Ghost Busters.

"Desertman84","10","4","4","9 December 2019"," Bringing Me Back To It After The All-Female Version Was Released
","Hollywood made a 2016 version of the ""Ghostbusters"" with an all-female cast that were SNL performers. This led me back to the original version in 1984 and apparently,I was surprised to know that I haven't reviewed it yet despite having seen it many times since the year it was released. Before the review,this is a little information about the movie.<br/><br/>Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson lead the cast as a quartet of ""paranormal investigators"". This led them to these career as three of them ran out of government grants and hired the fourth member of the group. They were tasked New York to run out the ghoulies, ghosts,ghosties, and long-legged beasties. Later,they were hired to run out an army of unfriendly spirits as well as a long-dead Babylonian demon.At the conclusion,we get to see a glorious army of monsters battling against the so-called ghostbusters.<br/><br/>No question that this was a great comedy involving ghosts instead of horror films.Added to that,we also see a great performance from Bill Murray. His one-liners were definitely a delight to hear. Despite the fact that the special effects are obsolete by the present standards as it was released more than three decades ago, the movie still holds up for present audience to enjoy. In fact,it is even better than the all-female version released three years ago."

"moviemattb","9","4","4","2 June 2018"," The Brave, The Best, The Only...Ghostbusters!
","""Ghostbusters,"" is considered to be one of the greatest sci fi comedies of all time, and it has endured by many generations as they had grew up with this movie and still cherish it til this day. This movie was definetly a childhood of mine, as I watched this on an old VHS that was recorded on TV before having an actual copy of the movie; then it came to DVD, and now we have Blu Ray. Now I'm an adult, the question is: does it hold up? Well, here is my review. The movie is about these three scientist: Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler as they all got fired from the university, so now all they have left is to start a business of their own by catching ghosts. Furthermore, we have Dana Barrett, who has a ghost problem as the building she lives in is being taken over by the evil Gozer as her minions known as the Terror Dogs to posses both Dana and her nerdy neighbor Louis Tully as they are about to bring the end of the world. Its up to our heroes to kick some ghost, and to save the world. Its as ridiculous as it may sound, but it works and definetly well executed. The movie's screenplay is written cleverly by both Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis, and they both have given great performances. Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddemore, doesn't show up into the second half of the movie but he does he give a good performance too. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis are both excellent for the roles they were given to play. Annie Potts does fine for playing the secretary. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, as you really love to hate him. The villain Gozer is definetly a real threat, and really has a strong presence in this movie. As for Bill Murray, he is the man! He really steals the show, and his lines of dialogue are outstanding. Speaking of dialogue, the movie is definetly quotable for such great lines like ""Nice shootin' Tex,"" ""Nobody steps on a church in my town,"" ""He slimed me,"" and of course ""Back off man, I'm a scientist."" The movie itself is really funny, and all thanks to its cast as they know how to make the comedy work. Even Ivan Reitman's direction is really well done as he balance it really well for mixing both the comedy and horror elements into the movie. The movie does go at a very good pacing as it feels tighter, and doesn't drag too long. The ghosts in this movie are memorable as you have Slimer, Gozer, Terror Dogs, Librarian Ghost, Stay Puft, as well as the Dream Ghost which I'll get to. The gadgets as everyone remembers the PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, Ecto Goggles, and the Proton Packs. Cannot forget the Ectomobile! Elmer Bernstein's music is definetly one of his greatest scores, and does have a great soundtrack such as the theme song by Ray Parker Jr., ""Cleanin' Up The Town,"" ""Magic,"" and ""Savin' the Day."" The special effects may have some bad ones that don't age well, but for the most part, they are really good as this was all done practically without any use of CG at all. That is minor issue, but the major issue, which I am not a fan of is that dream scene where Ray has sex with a female ghost. I thought it was totally out of place, and should've been left on the cutting room floor. That is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless, ""Ghostbusters,"" is still a classic as it is funny, exciting, suspenseful, creative, and has a good heart. I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10!"

"stormhawk2019","9","4","4","12 June 2017"," Who you gonna call?...Ghostbusters!
","Ghostbusters is quite simply one of my most beloved films of all time. The iconic production is a perfect marriage of a special effects extravaganza with spectacular performances to create one side- splitting gem. Bill Murray is the undeniable star and he's in top form as Dr. Peter Venkman a sly, laid back scientist with deadpan delivery that seems more concerned with dating his pretty client Dana Barrett than actually getting to the bottom of her disturbances. Sigourney Weaver nicely straddles the line between exasperated annoyance and charmed love interest. Bill Murray likewise has great camaraderie with his fellow Ghostbusters Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Those two are also responsible for writing the finely tuned screenplay. It zips, it pops and it never lets up. Ernie Hudson joins them later as Winston Zeddemore. He delivers my favorite quip after the group is blown away by the lightening bolts of an evil entity from another dimension. There is a slew of funny dialogue and Rick Moranis' nerdy portrayal of Louis Tully delivers a lot of it. He's hilarious. ""Okay, who brought the dog?"" he grins after hearing the growl from the long horned beast hiding in his closet. The spectacular special effects support the story, but they never threaten to overshadow the actors. The technology was state of the art at the time, even earning an Academy Award nomination. But it lost to the mine cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Perhaps time has rendered the optics a bit quaint to a modern audience. The sight of that devil dog leaping from the closet and running around the city is the most dicey. But it's the comedic interactions between characters that hold our focus, not the whiz bang appeal of the visual displays. OK so there's that ""monster"" near the end that dwarfs everything else. When the Destructor of their choosing threatens the city and their very existence, it's memorable. That's the kind of silly moment of brilliance that make you realize you're watching a work of creative genius. Oh yeah. I adore this film."
"classicsoncall","8","4","4","17 February 2016"," ""Gotta run. Got a date with the ghosts!""
","The film answered at least one of two important questions coming out of the Eighties - ""Who you gonna call?"" and ""What about the Twinkie?"". I still don't know about the Twinkie.<br/><br/>I just watched this again after many, many years, probably since the picture first came out come to think of it. My rating is partly based on nostalgia factor, this was a really fun and novel picture when it came out. Like ""Star Wars"" that preceded it in 1977 however, a lot of the effects don't hold up very well today and almost look cheesy compared to modern day special effects. But what can you do about that, it's just the way it is.<br/><br/>The principal characters did a nice job here of bringing their total protonic reversal skills together to battle ectoplasmic residue on a grand scale. Back in the day I wondered why the original trio didn't have another Saturday Night Live alumnus as part of the mix, but Harold Ramis did just fine. Rick Moranis was hilarious as next door neighbor Louis Tully, the story probably could have used a little more of his goofiness. And Sigourney Weaver, wow, how'd you like to get stuck on an Alien spaceship with her on board? <br/><br/>Anyway, it's cool to take a step back in time every now and then to revisit an old favorite. Making the effort even more memorable is the catchy theme song which kind of stays with you a couple of days after hearing it. Now if I can only figure out about that Twinkie."

","Laughing at someone is an easy way to make comedy. It's the way school bullies operate. Laughing at an unwilling comedy vehicle also gives to ones doing the laughing a sense of superiority, tickling the satisfaction centers in our brain.<br/><br/>This is not the way Ghost Busters work. They had every possibility to ridicule various groups of humans, but luckily decided not to. The humor here is benign, well written, and constant. The humanity of all characters present is both endearing and an endless supply of laughter.<br/><br/>But what makes Ghost Busters a classic is the fact it doesn't stop here. The story is exciting, with a real sense of adventure. Still, not missing a beat, it never goes overboard, helping audience to laugh whenever laughs are provided.<br/><br/>This movie is comedy gold, and a must for everyone with even a mild love for movies and entertainment.

"ultramatt2000-1","10","4","4","15 September 2014"," Awesome 80's classic!
","Before I saw the movie, I know that there was a cartoon. I was familiar with it, but what I did not know that there was a live-action movie. The movie is great, it is so cool and the theme song is so catchy. I knew that in the cartoon the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man was a nice guy with a dopey voice, but in the movie, he was a terrifying monster! My brother and I enjoyed Slimer as well. Just look at that big fat green blob of slime (inspired by Bluto from ""Animal House""). I always wanted to see the movie as a kid (despite the fact that I saw the cartoon and clips from the cartoon ""Muppet Babies""), but my parents wouldn't let me due to the creepy nature of it. I saw it on TV a few times whether it was on Bravo, Esquire, or VH-1. Finally I saw it on the big screen recently and it was like the time I took a time machine and went back to the 1980's! 1984 to be specific. Kind of like the time I saw the original ""King Kong"" at an old art house theater, was like going back in the 1930's. Specifically 1933. Speaking of which, there were a lot of scenes that paid homage to ""King Kong"". For instance, the giant temple with gate that opened with Gozor in it, looked like the gate with Ann Darrow being sacrificed before Kong's arrival. The Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man climbing up the building and getting destroyed at the end was like the climax in the old 30's horror film. Apart from the films theme song, there was another cool song that screamed 80's, ""Saving the Day"" by Alessi. When my brother and I were very little, the cartoon was as popular as the movie. We had this coloring book called ""People in your Neighborhood"" (not related to ""Sesame Street""), and there was this page that showed firemen fighting fires with hoses shooting water. I went haywire coloring it all up and my brother said that looked like ""Ghostbusters"", so we ended up turning their hoses to zappers that shoot electricity we drew a ghost in it and he is loosing. My dad had a friend named Bob and he came to visit us when we were little and my brother called him Peter Venkman because he looked like the one in the cartoon than the film. OK, childhood memories aside, as for the special effects, they changed a lot over the past 30 years. I have been watching a lot of movies with special effects that used a ton of CGI such as those super hero movies and monsters such as The 2014 ""Godzilla"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"", ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and Michael Bay's ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". People these days are wondering that if we are spoiling ourselves with a ton of CGI. Are we getting tired of it and do we miss practical effects? Seeing the Terror Dogs growl and leap made me think about it. Fortunately, J.J. Abrams is making ""Star Wars Episode Seven"" and he will use CGI and practical effects marry in this movie. James Rolfe of ""Angry Video Game Nerd"" fame made movie based on his web series and he used practical effect like those seen in old Japanese monster movies like the original ""Godzilla"". ""Jurassic World"", which is coming out next year, is said to have practical effects with the help of CGI. Bottom line: this is a great movie! I highly recommend it. Followed by an animated series and a sequel. Rated PG for violence, profanity, peril and a ton of scary scenes."

","Even now, nearly 20 years later this film is still as good as ever. Sure, the special FX world has moved on but they do not get in the way of a superb script and excellent direction from Ivan Reitman. How anyone can call this film 'boring' is totally beyond me.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is absolutely superb in this - some of best work with the fantastic Groundhog Dog just beating his work in this. Some of his one liners are just hilarious and the cast's interaction with each other is a pleasure to watch (bar Ernie Hudson who just seems out of place and is the film's biggest weakness IMO). Sigourney Weaver does a decent job though her work as Ellen Ripley in the Alien series taxes herself a little more. Rick Moranis is fantastic though and its a shame he never seems to get more recognition than he does nowdays.<br/><br/>If you've never seen Ghostbusters, then I implore you to go and grab it on DVD - its action packed, funny and even scary in some places.

","This was one of the first films I grew up with as a child. I remember watching Ghostbusters on video, and then I would rewind it and watch it all over again. I must have seen this film at least 100 times, and I'm happy to say it is still enjoyable to me even today.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the film is rather daft, but because of such a great cast, Ghostbusters rises far above what might have been a completely idiotic film, and instead becomes a comedy classic.<br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't seen Ghostbusters (if such a thing is possible), it is about three parapsychology professors Dr Peter Venkman (the wonderful Bill Murray), Dr Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are booted out of Columbia University because of their sloppy research methods.<br/><br/>Now faced with unemployment, our trio decide to go into business for themselves. They set up the first 'paranormal, investigations and eliminations' business ever to grace New York City. In short, they are the Ghostbusters, our first, last (and only) line of defence against the paranormal world.<br/><br/>Their first customer comes in the shapely form of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who has just had a nasty encounter with her fridge! It turns out to be something much more than she ever could have imagined, as she is possessed by something called Zuul, and is now preparing for the coming of Gozer, the demi-god.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters are now suddenly faced with an army of ghosts, an officious EPA inspector, and a possible apocalypse. These are all the plot threads neatly woven into the story, right up to the hilarious ending with Mr Stay Puft, the Marshmallow Man. (I kid you not).<br/><br/>Directed by Ivan Reitman, and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, they have truly created a masterpiece. Bill Murray is perfectly cast as Venkman, His typical deadpan routine and laid-back manner is a perfect foil when faced with such other-worldly things. He gets all the best lines, and his delivery is spot-on. For example, when Dana is telling them what she saw in her fridge:<br/><br/>""Generally you don't see that kind of behaviour in a major appliance"".<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd is good as 'the heart of the Ghostbusters', a well-intentioned man who has a tendency to cause problems for the group, (after all he does think up Mr Stay Puft. He co-wrote a well thought out, witty script.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis manages to be funny in a way I can't properly explain. Some of the faces he pulls when in conjunction with the dialogue of the other cast members are hilarious. He is funny in a serious sort of way, if that means anything. He is the brains of the group, which means he is the only one who really knows what the hell is going on. He has shown a dab hand at directing in recent years, and I'm sure he came up with a lot of good ideas for this film. The best film he directed was Groundhog Day, pairing him up once again with Bill Murray.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver gives a solid performance, and Ghostbusters is one of the first films that launched her on the road to stardom after Alien. She's certainly not out to play the damsel in distress, and carries herself strongly enough almost as she did as Ellen Ripley. She is certainly one of the first actresses to provide a role-model for other women as strong, female characters.<br/><br/>The other characters have their moments too. Rick Moranis is not really that memorable as Louis Tully, but when possessed as the Key Master, he is quite funny. (Especially the scene where he gives the wagon driver the evil eye). Annie Potts is great as Janine Melnitz, their acerbic secretary. Like Murray, she is quite deadpan in her delivery too: (""I've quit better jobs than this"").<br/><br/>Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore only comes into the film about halfway, and he always seems like an outsider when compared to the other Ghostbusters. However, he has a good chemistry with Aykroyd. The scene where they're talking about the end of the world is good, and its just a shame they weren't partnered up together more often.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects have dated a little, for example, the Devil Dogs look a bit fake now. But some of the other special effects are still pretty good, like their proton packs, Slimer, and Mr Stay Puft is a magical marvel of special effects work. I understand some of the effects coordinators were the same people who did Raiders of the Lost Ark. That must have been the scene where the Nazis opened the Ark.<br/><br/>Where the quality of the effects may have diminished a little, the film more then makes up for it in comedy. Some of the gags are quite subtle, written on a personal level that only the Ghostbusters could understand. With excellent lines from Murray, you can't complain, such as:<br/><br/>""Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back"".<br/><br/>The ending is suitably daft, but doesn't cheapen the story in any way. All the actors have a terrific chemistry, and they obviously enjoyed making this film. They have all met before on shows like Saturday Night Live, where they learnt to understand each others abilities and compliment each other to come across as funny as possible. This film really enhanced their careers. The theme song may seem a bit cheesy to some people, but I like it. Sometimes I find myself humming it without realising.<br/><br/>Definitely Ivan Reitman's best film, and (with the exception of Evolution) its just a shame he can't make films like this more often. It's a pity the sequel didn't live up to the excellence that was Ghostbusters."

","This is the movie of the 80s, plain and simple. It has most of the best and stars of the time (Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Weaver). The whole concept of 'ghostbusting' is very, very creative and ends up laugh out loud funny seeing people who dont even know who to use equpiment they designed. The dialogue is about as good as it can possibly be, but i felt that some of the deleted scenes should have been left in, most notable the fort scene. It spawned countless toys, 2 cartoon series, and left an entire generation of children born in the mid/late 80s (including yours truly) thinking they were their favorite ghostbusters and used the various kid-sized toys to catch imaginary ghost. Its sad that some people :shakes fist in murray's direction: dont want to make another, even though this ghosthead like the sequel a lot."
"heavenluvz","10","12","17","30 June 2004"," Hilarious!
","One of the most genuinely hilarious comedies out there. The dialogue in itself makes me laugh every time I watch this movie, and on the DVD if you turn on the extras you will see how many things are adlibbed right then and there by the actors.<br/><br/>Bill Murray undoubtedly delivers his stellar performance as Venkman, and Harold Ramis is perfect as Egon. They both have a wonderful deadpan manner, especially in a library scene very early on in the film.<br/><br/>Dan Akyroyd is the naive mistake maker Ray Stanz, as his thoughts bring on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Ernie Hudson rounds out the cast as Winston Zedmore, who is the last Ghostbuster to join up but is necessary.<br/><br/>With Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's gorgeous love interest and Rick Moranis as her yuppie neighbor, this movie is a classic for anyone and definitely one of the best comedies EVER filmed!"

","Some movies come with a surrounding story that makes it a richer experience.<br/><br/>This one's enriching story is that it is largely accidental. They had a different movie in mind, then changed it in a rush, making changes and inventing every day while shooting. Usually this results in an incoherent mess, but in this case it became ever so MORE coherent.<br/><br/>The reason is that all the principles are strongest at improvisational comedy. And they had worked together intensively and knew how to make each other look good. Its a funny thing about acting, especially comedic acting in the long form : you almost never can actually make yourself a success. You have to trust your partners to make you a success.<br/><br/>I always enjoy this movie. Like ""Holy Grail"" its charm is in referencing a mature world of slightly twisted forces, keeping some constant. Its a familiar place, naturally found. Its that natural access that makes it so endearing. Nothing is forced; no one is trying very hard. They go there easily and we do as well.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Unlike the last person to comment, who found this film unfunny and less than memorable, I submit an opinion completely opposite to that.  The one-liners and sarcasm throughout this movie are both extremely funny AND extremely memorable.  20 years later, the jokes still hold up, and people of all ages still quote it in everyday conversation.  Even though I've seen it a hundred times, I still laugh out loud every time.  Every actor is superb in his/her role, and the comic timing is brilliant.  Plus, this is one of those movies with tons of nuances and silly little things that you have to watch dozens of times to catch.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this movie comes highly recommended."

The timing is perfect, all the actors are on the ball for the duration of the film, and the effects, for their time, are unparalleled. But it's not just that the film is well-made and technically proficient, it's also that it's obvious that a lot of time and energy went in to actually making it great. It's obvious from the opening at Columbia University that everyone involved with the production is having fun, and they want us to have just as much fun. Luckily, it works. I have never seen a film that is more fun, not to mention endlessly quotable, than ""Ghostbusters."" It's become a film that people go back to again and again for the simple aim of enjoying themselves. It's a film that makes people feel good and have a good time. Of course, this also extends to the film's life outside the cinema. Nine times out of ten, you can make a person born in the 70s or 80s crack up laughing simply by saying ""Important Safety Tip,"" or ""It would be bad,"" or ""If someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"" There are hundreds of other quotable lines from the film, but hopefully you get what I'm aiming at. The film is a joy to watch, and is one that you'll want to rewatch countless times."

","There are plenty great comedies of the 80s but within the Mount Rushmore, ""Ghostbusters"" is perhaps George Washington or Lincoln. Well at least to this 80s kid who remembers the film (and, yes, its cartoon), it is one of the greats. The song is iconic, ghosts turned loose on NYC when damned Atherton and that punchable face insist the Ghostbuster team shut off their ""ghost concealment machine"" at their headquarters (refurbished firestation that perhaps, as Egon says, should have been condemned) because he considered their whole operation a farce (despite evidence that proves otherwise), the entire classic pursuit of Slimer in the fancy hotel which leaves the building a mess due to their protopacks missing the green, floating ugly with mouth and teeth gobbling food from trays inside the building's floors), the library ghoul that sends Egon, Venkman, and Ray running for their lives, poor Alice Drummond in the library scared half to death, Moranis who steals every scene he's in as the well-meaning but feckless neighbor in Weaver's apartment complex pursued by one of the demon hounds (The KeyMaster) who can't get any help from a restaurant full of uninterested patrons, Weaver possessed by another of the demon hounds (The Gatekeeper) who becomes a client of the Ghostbusters when her eggs crack and cook on her counter and pursued romantically by Murray, Hudson's Winston telling Ray that when a Sumerian demon asks if he is a god he says YES (seriously, Hudson never gets his due but he's so funny as the straight man to his goofy scientists, reacting as we might to their pseudo-paranormal babble), Murray's Venkman ""testing"" Steven Tash and the lovely Jennifer Runyon for ""psychic abilities"" (using his ""jolt device"" for kicks on Tash, while also looking to date Runyon), Aykroyd and Ramis' straight-faced ""paranormal speak"" often poked fun at by Murray with Hudson humoring them even as he clearly wonders what the hell they are talking about, Murray's dedicated quest to woo Weaver and her clear inability to totally avoid his charms, Moranis constantly locked out of his apartment, the Mayor (David Margulies; I just love this guy) having to respond to the inexplicable ramifications of Atherton's ordered release of all the paranormal activity trapped by the Ghostbuster team on his city, Annie Potts (another perfect casting choice) as the nasally, quirky secretary at the GB headquarters who proclaims the immortal line, ""We got one!!!"" while flirting with Egon (""I collect spores, molds, and fungus""), and all the neat special effects (one of my favorites is the rotted cabbie!) make up just some of the highlights. This cast is such an epic ensemble. ""Back off, man. I'm a scientist""."
"Thrashman88","7","3","3","21 April 2019"," Still Fun To Watch
","I was never a huge fan of this movie, but having watched it last night I must confess that it still holds up pretty well. The premise of a group of ghost hunters could've crashed and burned instantly, but the quirky dialog and dead pan acting of Bill Murray (the main Ghost Buster) really saved the day.
Unfortunately, the only thing that doesn't stand up are the special effects. Even by 1984's standards, Ghost Busters falls way short with its cheap looking effects. What leaves me scratching my head is that Richard Edlund (Star Wars) was behind the SFX and was even (gasp!) nominated for an Academy Award!!! ""Poltergeist"", which came 2 years earlier has SFX that for the most part, stand out quite well even today.<br/><br/>Still, Ghost Busters is still a fun, if slightly dated, classic to watch."
"Cineanalyst","7","3","3","30 September 2018"," Phallic Phantasms
","While the three pseudo-scientists of ""Ghostbusters"" occupy themselves professionally with the paranormal, their sexual desires likewise are abnormally characterized by paraphilic tendencies. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) takes joy in the sadistic torment of other men, which ordinarily is limited to mere sardonic remarks and poking fun at supposedly less masculine men for their nasal congestion, short height, or what have you, but at its most violent also manifests in his electric-shocking of a male test subject in an experiment of which the validity Venkman jeopardizes in the pursuit of his perverse pleasures. Perhaps, ashamed of his own desires, he also makes excessive displays of his supposed heterosexuality, including flirting with the female test subject and later aggressively, if clownishly, making passes at Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ray's (Dan Aykroyd) paraphilia extends to a complete displacement of other people as the source of sexual attraction; instead, his spectrophilia appears as a dream where a female ghost signifies further sexual displacement by disappearing before performing fellatio on him. Later, his fantasizing of another non-human humanoid object is made real in the form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a figure from his childhood, which is the time when all of those Freudian quacks like to locate the origins of sexual feelings. And, of course, there's the obviously-symbolic pole he's so enthusiastic about in their repurposing of an old fire station. Egon, on the other hand, seems to be entirely consumed in his pseudo-scientific pursuits, even seeming to not react in the least to the advances of the Ghostbusters' receptionist Janine (Annie Potts). Rather than being asexual, his interests are displaced in the phallic guns or wands of the Ghostbusters' ""proton packs,"" which they employ to ejaculate energy streams, trapping gooey ectoplasmic matter into a shared box. Perhaps, like Peter, Egon also fears his homoerotic tendencies, though, and insists that the men avoid crossing streams.<br/><br/>But, of course, crossing their streams is what the entire male-bonding narrative is building up to. Being the 1980s, this includes the homophobic government, in the form of the ""dick-less"" EPA man, butting in, protesting the Ghostbusters' pollution of ejaculating streams and captured slime and even the propagandic effect their activities have upon society. This backfires, however, unleashing the latent desires the Ghostbusters themselves feared and contained in the ""closet""--the unleashing of them taking the form of flamboyant streams of light and sparkling stars in a rainbow of colors spreading throughout the city. The Catholic mayor's kissing of the Archbishop's ring and turning to him for approval/guidance also plays into the unleashing of the Ghostbusters' phallic powers, but I'm not going to look into that plot point any deeper than that. Now, freed from the closet, so to speak, and after a stint in jail, the Ghostbusters' antagonist takes the form of Old-Testament Biblical proportions in the form of a heterosexually-coded coupling of ghosts: the ""Keymaster"" (read ""male"") and the ""Gatekeeper"" (read ""female""). And reigning supreme is the god Gozer, who takes the shape of the Ghostbusters' gendered ""other,"" a woman. The men's triumph is in defeating this ghastly heterosexual and female gendered possession of their city.<br/><br/>After the men cross streams, resulting in the explosion of white goop from Ray's latent childhood desires pouring over them, the three doctors quickly resort to their prior postures of homoerotic denial: Peter to the rescue of the damsel-in-distress Dana, and Egon and Ray to the safer confines of the short and daft male subject Louis (Rick Moranis), for whom Egon quickly remarks on his desire to perform pseudo-scientific tests upon. The fourth Ghostbuster, Winston (Ernie Hudson), however, the only normal man among them and who, presumably, has a healthy sexual attitude, proclaims with pride, while covered in goo, ""I love this town!""<br/><br/>This makes me rethink what may be underlying the outcry over the casting of women in the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" reboot, of what is one of the most, let's say, male-centric of classic comedies. Or... ""Ghostbusters"" is just a silly comedy with the best zingers coming from Bill Murray, a catchy soundtrack and a production design and dated visual effects that remain charming."
"geekscompendium","9","3","3","25 May 2018"," Ghostbuster 4k Bluray Review
","This is the fourth release of Ghostbusters post DVD era and the first and most obvious question is, is it the best release to date or even worth the upgrade if you own the previous releases? In short, if you have the right TV and AV equipment then the answer is YES!.<br/><br/>Picture Quality:<br/><br/>Sony has done a fine job of improving the image of a film that is now well over 30 years old, upping the resolution to 2160p and adding HDR could have been an easy way of just churning out another release of a film that has a gigantic following for an easy cash-in. Yet adding this new technology to this disc helps the picture quality by improving the contrast, colour and brightness which make this release a real enjoyment to watch (again).<br/><br/><br/><br/>First thing first, does Ghostbusters have the polish and glitter like some of the more modern movies that have been released? No, the grain of the original is still there and present throughout the entire film, however, the image has been enhanced and in places looks tremendous with primary colours, in particular, making the picture pop. Skin-tones are more natural looking than ever and there is plenty of detail to be found where it could not be found before. One drawback I find on a lot of older films that have had a 4k transfer are the darker areas where the blacks become pixelated which I am glad to report I did not see once whilst watching the film in its entirety.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Audio Quality: <br/><br/>If you are unsure as to why you should buy/upgrade to this release this is one area where this disc excels. Adding a Dolby Atmos soundtrack to a film of this age could have just been done to get the ""Atmos"" badge on the box to entice people to make a purchase, but this really does excel and I was amazed how good of a job Sony has done in this area.<br/><br/>The previous Blu-ray releases have a True HD 7.1 track onboard which is great and a vast improvement over the original VHS and DVD versions, but the Atmos track supplied on this 4K disc is a major upgrade. Using the object based technology adds to the atmosphere right through the film in particular towards the end of the film where our team of parapsychologists are in a battle with main antagonist Gozer and this is where the Atmos truly shines with pieces of the building noticeably falling from above. The charge of the proton packs humming in the background the proton beams blasting from every angle. As the saying goes they saved the best to last, in the scene where Gozer asks Ray (Stantz) ""Are you a God"" the booming voice of Gazo surrounds you from everywhere like a voice from God and is truly one of my favourite parts of any Atmos track I have heard to date.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>There a few points I would like to make here. As I said at the start of this review to get the most out of any 4k release you need the right equipment, If you have a 4k TV and 4k player and are using TV speakers then you obviously will not be getting the required effects from the Atmos track, for this you will need either an Atmos-enabled soundbar or preferably a capable AV receiver and speaker setup to maximize the effects from these releases.<br/><br/>Also, the scores below are based on the age and previous releases of the film, the video is a huge improvement from earlier releases but when compared to the likes of Dunkirk it is somewhat left behind for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>(I will be writing an article soon on what equipment Is required to get the most from these newer releases)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Score:<br/><br/>Video: 4/5<br/><br/>Audio 4.5/5"

","Ghostbusters is a movie from 1984 starring Bill Murray (Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters Franchise, Trading Places), Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Ghostbusters Franchise) and Sigourney Weaver (Alien Franchise Avatar). It was written Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis (Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Spaceballs, Strange Brew) and is directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Franchise, Up in the Air, No Strings Attached).<br/><br/>Ghostbusters follows three scientists: Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) as they start their own ghost catching business and their biggest job yet is in a musician named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) own refrigerator. <br/><br/>This hilarious movie is carried by is fun characters brought to life by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. They are each very different and very funny in their own ways. Murray plays a classic, sarcastic Bill Murray character, Aykroyd plays a nervous quiet man who is really excited to be living out his dream and Ramis plays a very smart, nerdy, and odd man. They ad-lib most of their lines which makes this all even better.<br/><br/>I actually think the success of Ghostbusters led to all of this ghost hunter reality show crap we see on TV today. This was the first movie to really have the idea of ghost hunting itself which means it is very original and started a ghost craze and a (not so good) sequel.<br/><br/>Most of the effects in this movie do look quite dated while films like Blade Runner (which came out two years earlier) do not. But all of this adds to the fun of this incredibly fun, hilarious movie from the 80's."
"lasttimeisaw","7","3","3","9 September 2014"," an 80s classic fun-raiser
","My belated visit to the 80s classic ultra-popular American supernatural comedy directed by Ivan Reitman, indisputably his most successful directorial work to date, the Hollywood veteran is now in the inevitable course of being eclipsed by his son Jason Reitman, who is already a two-times Oscar-nominated director (JUNO 2007, 8/10 and UP IN THE AIR 2009, 7/10). <br/><br/>The film stars Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as a trio of nerdy parapsychologists in New York, after being dismissed by the university, they initiate a service knows as Ghostbusters to deal with the more and more frequent paranormal activities in the city, things then trace back to Gozer, a Sumerian amorphous god of destruction, who is going to wreck havoc on the city, with the aids of its two servants, Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster, two ferocious dog- shaped demigods.<br/><br/>The core trio (later joined by Ernie Hudson as the fourth member to appear politically corrected) predates the current trend of brain-is-the-new-sexy, Peter Venkman (Murray) more or less is a philanderer and particularly disarming in his aloof attitude to the gravitas of their cause. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) has a more guileless mindset, a man-boy hybrid will lovably bring about a beast of a giant marshmallow man. Egon Spengler (the late Ramis) is the geek among geeks, a stern-looking scientists with fully-functional apparatus to bust some ghosts. Peter's new love interest is Dana (Weaver), their first client soon to be possessed by Zuul, so is her neighbor Louis Tully (Moranis), as the receptacle of the Keymaster. <br/><br/>The special effects are very much 1980s, but they are also the brainchild of a genuinely extraordinary creation, massively uproarious in its pokerface seriousness (not to mention its contagious theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The wacky script written by Aykroyd and Hamis is the mainstay of its distinctiveness, Murray's iconic personification of his on-screen image is droll to watch, Weaver is beguilingly titillating after the possession and Moranis's loquacious improvisation slightly overstays its welcome, but appropriately dovetails itself into the demigod.<br/><br/>Very rarely a comedy can blend well with its spectral fodder and family-friendly closeness, GHOSTBUSTERS is far from being a perfectly executed masterpiece, or a cutting-edge cinematic pioneer, but its common-or-garden stance effectively boosts the ""everyone can be a hero"" message, no wonder it has been an enormous crowd-pleaser and bred into a beloved franchise since the inception. I may skip its 1989 sequel but a long-delayed third installment doesn't seem to a bad idea at all, or the latest rumor is the BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10) helmer Paul Feig is eying for an all-female reboot, it sounds much more enticing, Bill Murray even gives his own suggestion of the casting, see here"

","""Ghostbusters"" has a place in our heart because it's silly entertainment, the kind that we looked forward to seeing when we were children. We loved ghosts stories and special effects that scared us just enough, nothing with gore and slashers. Just an old fashioned time when we had fun looking at ectoplasm and enjoying the heroes' adventures when they tried to solve the problem. It was comedy with special effects, and ""Ghostbusters"" works for the most part.<br/><br/>Yes, the effects are a bit cheesy. Maybe they're meant to be that way, and it's got an innocent feel to it. The ultimate monster is a marshmallow man that will destroy civilization as we know it. One's worst fate is to be slimed or turned into a dog, and it's a lot of fun most of the time, but it could have used more Bill Murray and more editing to give us a better experience.<br/><br/>Most of the joy is seeing all that talent in the screen. Bill Murray's dry approach is just a delight. Everything from his one-liners, his gestures, and his exchanges with Sigourney Weaver who is truly a sport while sparring with him, growing to like him as the film progresses, and Rick Moranis plays his nerdy part so well, it's hard not to start laughing every time he jumps in the scene. Everyone else does well, but the three standouts are the ones mentioned before.<br/><br/>NYC is threatened by a surge in supernatural activity, and soon references such as the key master are thrown around. It's all very simple. People are possessed, bureaucracy makes mistakes and our heroes get to save the world. One goes to see the film to have a good time."

","A trio of misfit parapsychologists set up business as Ghostbusters. Ideal really because although slow at first, their business starts to boom as New York comes under threat from a supernatural force.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd had this idea about space Ghostbusters in the future and the plan was to have himself and fellow Blues Brother, John Belushi, star in it. Pitching it to producer and director Ivan Reitman saw the basic concept retained but eventually it became what we now know as Ghostbusters. Co-written with Harold Ramis {also a co-star}, Aykroyd's genesis turned not only into a ""monster"" smash it at the box office, but also into a pop-cultural ""phenomenon"". In fact it actually is nice to re-visit the film these days without the public euphoria that swamped the movie for what seemed like a decade. T-shirts with the Ghostbusters logo on were everywhere, a telephone number if you rang it would have the Busters on answer phone, whilst the title song from Ray Parker Jr could be heard on the hour every hour on the radio. Even the catch phrase of ""who ya gonna call?"" was being used by the young, the old and the restless. Marketing genius or cynical tactics covering a sub-standard film?<br/><br/>Well ultimately the film is really rather ace, it has some problems for sure {the effects were bad back then, never mind now and Ernie Hudson a token addition to the team} but it's razor sharp with its wit and has a mass appeal to people of all ages. It's a basic odd ball's to the rescue plot, but the differing characterisations and comedy lift it considerably higher than similarly themed films that had come prior to it. That it boasts a bigger budget and Bill Murray of course helps the cause. Murray was brought in after Belushi had left the mortal coil, and promptly owns the film. His Dr Venkmen is a fusion of sarcasm, biting one liners and sees science as a way of getting girls. All of which blends mirthfully with the polar opposites that are Aykroyd's Stanz and Ramis' Spengler. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen as the soon to be possessed, and chased by Venkmen, Dana Barrett and Rick Moranis does meek goof-ball supreme as Louis Tully. There's also value to be found in the script courtesy of some political nudging as the mayor is aware of vote power, while the human element badness and cynicism comes from William Atherton's {suitably weasel like} stiff suit Walter Peck.<br/><br/>Given its success {it made a worldwide profit of almost $262 million} a sequel was inevitable. Amiable enough as it was, it was a pale shadow the first film and even recycled the ending. So stick with this bad boy then, a fun film for all that serves as a reminder of when the world went Ghostbuster barmy. 8/10"

Not to mention it's unique idea of a story, while most ghost stories are supposed to be scary, Dan Aykroyd and Harrold Rammis made this into a genuine comedy that is so much fun to watch while it still has it's spooky moments here and there. They also picked the perfect cast and great characters, they clicked so well, and I think that's what made the story work so well. Not to mention one of the funnest songs of all time was made with this film, OK, a little off the subject, I know, but I had to mention it.<br/><br/>Peter, Egon, and Ray are three unemployed fella's when they come up with a great idea. New York is being haunted by ghosts lately and no one can come up with a plan to get rid of them, well, instead of a typical exterminators, they become the Ghost Busters! The Ghost Busters are like the police only they know how to face these ghouls and they come up with a whole business with it. Peter's girlfriend, Dana, has a problem with her refrigerator, it has demons inside of it, not to mention the whole building is being taken over by evil forces that only the Ghost Busters can handle.<br/><br/>Ghost Busters is a fun film that I guarantee you a few laughs with. This is a film that will be remembered for years to come. I think my favorite scene was when Louis Tully is having a party for the building and is trying so hard to get everyone to join, he was so cute.

I can't believe how strongly I disliked it. I actually tuned it out halfway through, and read books/magazines while it played, then paid attention again during the final scene which I had specifically remembered from childhood.<br/><br/>There are no likable characters in this movie, with the possible exception of Louis (Rick Morannis) , who I found endearing. My biggest problem with the movie was Bill Murray's character. I think his character was trying to be funny. Maybe? My reaction to Murray's character was to intensely want to punch him in the face. Why didn't Sigourney Weaver punch him in the face? I don't know. Why didn't the overworked secretary (Janine) punch him in the face? I don't know. Why didn't his colleagues, the EPA guy, the list goes on and on, Bill Murray was a jack-a$$ who mocked everyone in the movie, yet inexplicably, everyone puts up with it.<br/><br/>A lot of people will dislike this review, because perhaps they really liked Murray's character. That's fine. But he wasn't funny, and he was a &^%#@ the whole movie. And the movie revolves around him.<br/><br/>There was one line, ""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!"" That made my lip curl up, in the closest thing to a smile that the movie made me produce. This line was not delivered by Bill Murray."

","Ghostbusters is nothing more than an inconsistent mess of a wannabee comedy. I am indeed a fan of Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver, but honestly, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sure, the effects were state-of-the-art for 1984, with all of those hideous monsters, but that was simply just a way to cover up the absolutely awful screenplay.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where all of this acclaim comes from. Just like Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the story jumps all over the place. Yes, they stayed true to one aspect, the line with the wicked Zuul, but the rest just seemed out of place."

","Some people have those favourite films as a child, something they sat, watching in front of the TV while playing with their Rubik's Cube or eating their Gummi Bears. Precious memories are made of such things. This is not one of mine.<br/><br/>Yes, it has a great theme tune, and okay, the special effect were revolutionary for the time. But another viewing confirmed what I thought back when I was a wee sprog: The plot is a mess... Amongst other such nonsense, Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis turn into giant dog statues, and this is supposed to bring about the apocalypse. I thought as a young 'un I could write a better screenplay... And I still do.<br/><br/>It also tries too hard to be amusing, with only Bill Murray's deadpan delivery providing a few chuckles... Everything else is just desperate banter. Other 'highlights', like the giant Stay Puft marshmallow guy going on a rampage, are just gimmicks designed to distract us from the lacklustre action. If only more people would take off their rose-tinted glasses, they'd be able to see this for what it really is: An average time-waster.<br/><br/>It could be worse, though.

"jimbo-53-186511","5","22","42","28 May 2016"," Loved this as a child but wasn't quite as impressed watching it again as an adult
","When three parapsychology professors are fired from their university they decide to set up shop as paranormal investigators or ""Ghostbusters"". Their first client is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who approaches the Ghostbusters after witnessing strange visions and hearing the name ""Zool"" when she opened her fridge. Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) checks out her apartment but finds no evidence of paranormal activity. However, when Dana starts exhibiting strange behaviour, the professors investigate further and discover that the apartment complex that she lives in is a gateway for the occult. With paranormal activity now reaching epidemic proportions The Ghostbusters must now try to save the city against seemingly impossible odds.<br/><br/>I, like many, have fond memories of Ghostbusters as a child and hoped that I would have the same feeling again when watching it as an adult. Unfortunately, I only found moments of this film to be enjoyable rather than finding it enjoyable as a whole.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is memorable and the 3 professors all seem to be setup as very different characters which generally produces an interesting camaraderie between Aykroyd, Murray and Ramis. The first 20 minutes or so are a lot of fun from Venkman's fraudulent shenanigans to The Ghostbusters chasing Slimer round the hotel. It's explosive and fast-paced, but after these scenes it seems to fall apart slightly and the middle portion of the film bogs down too much with uninteresting and unnecessary scenes (Venkman's creepy stalking of Dana being one example). Rick Moranis' turn as Dana's nerdy neighbour Louis Tully also wasn't particularly funny and was more annoying than anything else. A large portion of their story arc sees them as Gatekeeper and Keymaster in the occult world which was an aspect of the story that wasn't that involving and also one that never really had a particularly satisfying pay-off.<br/><br/>In fact watching this again as an adult I noticed both the plot and the story are extremely thin; there certainly isn't enough of either element to warrant its 2 hour running time. Considering the title is ""Ghostbusters"" it would have been nice to see more examples of ""Ghostbusting"" which sadly only seems to feature heavily towards the end. There's also no ignoring how silly the film is for most of its running time, but sadly for me a lot of it was silly in an eye-rolling way rather than being silly in a funny way.<br/><br/>Ultimately with Ghostbusters you're left with a film that has impressive beginning and an impressive ending, but one that has an unsatisfying middle-section which always felt uncertain and at odds with the rest of the film. Older teens (who are prepared to overlook the rather thin plot) may still find this to be quite enjoyable, but as for me I only found some parts of it to be enjoyable and feel that I may have just outgrown it."

","""Ghost Busters"" is a 1984 comedic film that follows the jobs of 3 parapsychology scientists as they capture and destroy ghosts from their town.<br/><br/>While searching for good comedy films to watch, the recommendation of ""Ghost Busters"" (1984) kept on coming up. I then remembered vaguely that there was a TV show version of the series. I never really watched even an episode, but I do remember seeing the opening credits and tidbits of the show here and there. So I thought I'd give it a try. I was in the mood for some laughs, after all.<br/><br/>The film worked well in the first half. Though I never really laughed out loud, I could see that it was entertaining. But after the actual plot took place, I lost all interest. It became too boring and took away the movie's charm. The jokes started to get old, too. The visual effects didn't help keep my interest, either. I found my eyes drooping!<br/><br/>I understand that this movie is pretty old, so it may have been amazing for people who watched it first when it came out in the 1980's, but when you watch it in the late 2000s, it doesn't really do anything for you.<br/><br/>Viewed on: May 3, 2011"

"generationofswine","10","5","7","19 September 2018"," An Honest Review
","Like my review of Footloose, this is a classic, everyone has seen it, everyone loves it. It's one of those movies that came from your childhood and lasts well into the adult manboy years.<br/><br/>So, we're going to do a comparison with the remake.<br/><br/>For starters..the Ghostbusters plays it straight. The comedy is presented like a drama and that is usually the absolute best way to do comedy...straight.<br/><br/>And conversely the remake is just sort of over the top. And when comedies try that hard to be comedies, they stop being funny.<br/><br/>Another part would be scene length. And again, playing it straight, the opening of 1984 is short and honestly kind of scary...<br/><br/>...when the remake drags on and deals with characters that honestly have nothing else to do with the film but introduce it. You lose interest sort of fast.<br/><br/>And this can be seen again with the humor. The introduction of the car in the remake is prime example. Pulls up with a hearse, someone makes a joke about checking to see if there is a body in there....<br/><br/>...the scene SHOULD stop when they look at the hearse and cut away to a different scene. But the remake drags on and the joke loses momentum and falls flat when it COULD have been an easy laugh.<br/><br/>Conversely in 1984 you have jokes like the Twinkie that ends with ""tell him about the Twinkie"" and it is funny because it doesn't drag on in an effort to be funny. The same can be said about testing the proton packs, the joke ends fast enough for it to actually be funny.<br/><br/>And then there is the script and direction, the 1984 version stuck to it and made sure everything was tight, even when it was improvised, it wasn't allowed to get out of control.<br/><br/>But the remake the actors took control and the improvisation went on too long, even with scenes being cut.<br/><br/>So what you have is a tight and fast film that is a comedy played straight like it should be...and one that everyone knows and loves because of it."
"crash21","9","5","7","13 June 2016"," Classic comedy
","From the beginning through the end, Ghostbusters was a classic comedy. The movie has a really good soundtrack, which includes a uniquely-excellent theme-song, with great characters and the whole movie is very funny.<br/><br/>They start the movie with the guys working with the Department of Psychology and Pete is torturing a guy with apparent psychic abilities, possibly just to get himself a date with the girl that is getting everything wrong. Then, when they go to the ghost event in the library, it has things in there that are so funny that it makes you wonder how the actors actually kept straight faces when they were acting this.<br/><br/>After they leave the University and start the business ""Ghostbusters"", the movie's action scenes seriously picks up. Especially when Pete first gives the guy from the EPA a hard time, after that failing in the later shutdown of their ghost storage facility, one of my favorite moments in all of this is where Pete finds Dana floating around her room saying she is the Gatekeeper and that Dana is gone.<br/><br/>The movie had a good ending too, with their fight against Gozer and the Staypuft Marshmallow Man. It was all very funny and is definitely worth watching many times over."

","One thing I like about re-watching movies from my childhood is the fond memories it brings back. ""Ghostbusters"" did that and it was definitely one of my favorites.<br/><br/>All of the characters are great but my favorite remains Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis). Rick Moranis has since disappeared from the silver screen (not until after making the ""Honey I Shrank the Kids"" movies) but he left an indelible mark upon this movie. He was so obliviously nerdy it was hilarious. Added to that was his puppy dog attraction to the more suave and sophisticated Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) which made his character even more likable. He so wanted to impress her with his odd habits but could never seem to win her over.<br/><br/>And of course who could forget the theme song by Ray Parker Jr.? I think the line ""Who you gonna call?"" was mentioned in pop culture repeatedly at the time.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" is just a fun, family-friendly movie that can be enjoyed over and over."

","We all know the theme song. Society has long been ingraining it into our heads since forever. And no matter where you stand on the Ray Parker Jr./Huey Lewis debate, we can all say that, when it comes to Ghostbusters, the good looks don't outweigh what's on the inside. The film, even today, is as fun a movie as ever. It's a microcosm of the era--perhaps not as much as Back to the Future was a year later, but in 1984, the decade was just about forming into itself.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of perverse scientists who have long been trying to uncover the world of the supernatural. After ominous events start happening and their radical ideas get them fired from the University which they work at, they form their own business as ghostbusters. <br/><br/>Even though it works, Dan Aykroyd is slightly underutilized here. He and Harold Ramis serve very little purpose as either straight man or top banana. But Bill Murray and Rick Moranis prove to play the funny guys well enough.<br/><br/>Murray was the king back then. He could say or do whatever he wanted without outshining any of his costars or commandeering a film. What he does so well is give the audience both broad and subtle humor, letting them chose for themselves. And he's at his best here. Moranis is phenomenal as well--although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. He and Murray stay comedically brilliant without ever having to step on each other's toes.<br/><br/>It doesn't hold up quite as well as some of its contemporaries, but it gets better with every watch.<br/><br/>It can be slow intermittently, but that's just a sign of the times. Slightly dated, sure, but Ghostbusters still gets the job done.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 93"
"williampsamuel","10","5","7","7 December 2014"," The Ultimate in Paranormal Comedy
","What a movie! What an original, goofy, side-splitting movie! Ghostbusters is one of those projects were everything just came together. Somebody had an idea, somebody else believed in it, all the right people got involved, and everything just flowed, producing an instant classic and a landmark of popular culture. From one idea that Dan Akroyd worked on in his spare time came on of mid eighties' best pictures, and perhaps the best horror-comedy since the days of Abbot and Costello.<br/><br/>That idea of course, is 'What if there really were ghosts? And what if there were people who made a living catching them?' And the screenplay has a lot of fun with that idea, treating it like real life, down to advertising blitz and regulatory headaches. Yet at the same time it embraces the more fantastic aspects of the story, playing up hauntings, possessions, and the apocalypse to great comedic effect. There's a real blending of the supernatural and the mundane that you don't see a lot, certainly not with such hilarious results.<br/><br/>Equally important is the superb casting. Every actor and actress is perfect for his/her role, which is not surprising considering that some of the roles were written for them. Akroyd, as the co-writer, created for himself a role that plays wonderfully to his natural talents. In real life, he's a smart, earnest, kind off nerdy guy, so naturally it follows that he should be an overly-excitable, somewhat gullible nerd who pours himself into his work. Harold Ramis is brilliant as Egon, the straight faced dry intellectual, and Ernie Hudson brings a real down to earth likability to Winston. Sigourney Weaver shows that she definitely has what it takes to play comedies; I have no idea how she managed to keep from cracking up during the 'possessed' scenes.<br/><br/>But it's Bill Murray who really steals the show. One if Murray's greatest strengths as an actor is his shiftiness, his blatant insincerity, and as a result he's at his best when playing the schemer, the con man. And Peter Venkman is just such a man. He's a fraud, a charlatan who makes his living studying things he doesn't even believe in- and a shameless womanizer to boot. His chemistry with Weaver is priceless, and throughout he maintains the comedic balancing act that he does so well; never flat or deadpan, but never quite over the top. It's really his character driving this whole enterprise, even if he has no idea what he's doing.<br/><br/>There are some good action sequences here, and a handful of truly scary parts, like the now-famous librarian. I especially love the ending, with what is surely the funniest giant monster ever created- nice going, Ray. The special effects are generally pretty good for 1985, and even when they aren't it only adds to the movie's goofy feel.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is also one the most quotable pictures since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There are plenty of instantly recognizable one-liners, like ""He slimed me"" and ""Back off man, I'm a scientist,"" and some wonderfully tongue in cheek speeches, like the famous 'Twinkie speech,' or the one early on that begins with ""Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma."" It's hard to pick just one, but I would have to say that my favorite line is """"Man, the superintendent is gonna be pi**ed!"" And the dialog works even when being 100% serious. The conversation between Ray and Winston about the book of Revelation is a minor masterpiece in its own right.<br/><br/>What else is there to say about this movie? It's got a wonderful score by Elmer Bernstein, and a killer theme song by Ray Parker Junior that actually went to number one on the singles charts. There are gorgeous views of New York City and a double serving of Big Apple attitude. Any way you look at it, this is a great production with everything done right from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, do so, and soon."

","This really is one of the best things to have ever come out of the 1980's, let alone the magnum opus of all the comedy talent involved. Incidentally, ""Ghostbusters"" did to ghosts what ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) would do to dinosaurs just a few years later. The effects and designs of these spirits are fantastic, and transcended extraordinarily well when it came to the merchandise and that classic cartoon series.<br/><br/>Three men (The nerd, dope & slacker) open up a ghost busting squad that while ridiculed, accidentally ends up as a thriving and legitimate business. This all leads to a fourth member (The inevitably cool black guy) and enlisting help against an ancient Demi-God of ultimate evil, taking a bizarre form in one of the funniest climax's in motion picture history.<br/><br/>Really what isn't there to like about Ghostbusters? Re-visiting it did I realise just how genius the writing and dialogue is delivered, and while it'll continue to hold up way beyond that of just a catchy Ray Parker Jr. song. While there has been talks of a ""Ghostbuster 3"", there is no doubt that the fans love and ""kind of"" own this franchise. It's so universally loved by all, I would probably rate it as my 2nd favourite comedy of all time (1. goes to ""The Big Lebowski""). I can't tell you how thrilling it was to be on the motorway onetime and have the ECTO-1 roar pass you (Presumably coming back from a showroom event, but nevertheless lights and alarms all functioning).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: They just don't make comedy films of this calibre nowadays, but it's very comforting to know everyone involved went on to star in other comedies that continued to spin this special kind of comedy gold. 10/10. A MUST SEE comedy giant!"

","Growing up as a small kid in the early and mid 80's I remember when this film came out and the crazy feel and fever it started. It had everyone going around saying in 1984 ""Who you gonna Call""? ""Ghostbusters""! And clearly without a doubt 1984's ""Ghostbusters"" was one of the most memorable and better known films of the 1980's, as it's a sci-fi comedy that's feel good and well remembered. As it was well written with smarts and wit still the funny one liners and comedic parts are often overshadowed by the well remembered ghosts(green ghost slimmer) and monsters(the stay puff marshmallow man) of the film.<br/><br/>Also well directed by Ivan Reitman the plot is pretty good as it is set in New York City and it features three college professors of parapsychology named Dr. Venkman(Bill Murray)Dr. Stanz(Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Spengler(Harold Ramis)who all of a sudden find themselves out of a job as the university starts to downsize as they have cut their study department due to lack of interest and the mid 80's recession of the bad economy. Yet never fear an ideal has sprung to mind just like it did with all great minds from Einstein to Gallo, and Pluto the trio decide to open up a business and go the entrepreneurial route as they specialize in everything from chasing ghosts and unappetizing apparitions. Also a good supporting role is given from the elegant and classy Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barret a single woman who even discovers her apartment's refrigerator door has became the door for the gates of hell! And thru the film it's interesting and memorable with funny one liners and chase scenes of strange ghost, yet thru it all the ""Ghostbusters"" will conquer all of New York City from the ghastly ghost and make it safe again in this very funny haunting action comedy. Well remembered film at a time that features the comedy trio of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis in their prime and in top form and the lovable and cute ghost like green slimmer and stay puff are very memorable images of joy and fun. Overall one of the better feel good comedy films of the 80's a real treat."

It's also one of the greatest movies of all time, it's a Masterpiece of Cinema & the best movie ever in my opinion.<br/><br/>This is an absolute all time CLASSIC, anyone growing up in the 80's & 90's loved Ghostbusters & it's BRILLIANT underrated Sequel!!!
I love both movies & both are a huge part of why i love MOVIES so much.<br/><br/>Now Ghostbusters '84 was always my favourite movie since tiny & other the years i started to like Ghostbusters 2 more & more & claimed it was my favourite movie of all time, but as much as i enjoy & love that sequel i can't help but notice now I'm alot older the things wrong with it!!!
Such as the fallen Statue of liberty & how did it stand back up & get back to where it originally stood? Why did it even fall down?
Also who did that painting at the end of the Busters & baby Oscar?
Also i notice now how bland & cheap looking the cinematography & lighting is in nearly all of the day scenes on the sets such as Dana's Apartment that looks like a cheap set & all the actors are glowing too bright under what i can imagine is a massive lamp!!! Everything is always way too light & clear like a commercial or something, it lost that deep rich & textured cinematography & lighting from the 1984 Classic!!! The river of slime tunnel scenes are probably the best looking but nearly everything else has a cheap look.
I hate saying this about a movie I've always loved & have deep Nostalgia Love for but it's true i still love GHOSTBUSTERS 2, but the first is better in it's quality of production design, look & cinematography.
I think i still like Ghostbusters 2 more though even with it's faults.<br/><br/>GHOSTBUSTERS has all great all the elements,cinematography, music, cast,special effects & locations of New York City are absolutely iconic & burned into my mind since being tiny,i have so much Nostalgia & love for these Ghostbusters movie's.
I've been obsessed with Ghostbusters all my life & adore the characters who feel like family to me & everytime i watch these film's it's like seeing old friends again.
Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) will always be my favourite character in the franchise.
I grew up watching the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, Extreme Ghostbusters, i collected all the Action figures & watched both FILMS on video over & over growing up,so yes i grew up on Ghostbusters.
This movie made me fall in love with New York City for how it looks on screen & the beautiful & detailed cinematography, both films look beautiful!!!
I could go on & on about my love for Ghostbusters & still never completely explain it lol, the truth is Ghostbusters & it's characters touched something in me at a young age like most fans & never let go!!!
Ghostbusters opened my mind & curiosity to the supernatural, PARANORMAL & my sense of wonder about the world.
Ivan Reitman is one of my favourite movie Directors ever, he sits comfortably next to John Carpenter, I've always loved Reitman's films like his ""Kindergarten Cop"" & ""Stripes"" & ""Twins"" & ""Junior"" & ""Evolution"" & of course his masterpiece films ""Ghostbusters 1&2"" he's a legend of cinema.
From the beautiful opening music & into the iconic Library Ghost scene, Ghostbusters is a phenomenal Comedy Horror Classic, with a perfect blend of silly humour & Scary frights, the cast are Amazing & all four busters our like Super heroes to us film geeks!!!
Bill Murray is a Comic genius, Dan Aykroyd is a Comedy legend & fantastic writer, Harold Ramis R.I.P was a fantastic Director & a the brains on screen & good old Ernie Hudson is an underrated Every man of Cinema.<br/><br/>Love you Ghostbusters.
Thank you Ivan reitman.

I loved the movie when I was young, and then, when I grew up, it became even better when many jokes and plot points I didn't get as a kid, finally made sense. But the question remains, why this movie is so good?.<br/><br/>I think the enduring charm of Ghostbusters is that is a perfect mix of comedy and horror. The movie is a comedy, but it takes itself completely seriously in its absurd premise, so the movie feels completely grounded in reality. It's basically our world, but with real ghosts in it (I think it helps that Dan Aykroid actually believes in all this weird stuff). This makes al the tension in the movie feel real, and the action looks compelling and believable. The effects sometimes have some failures in some animations, but all in all, it looks great, and really spooky.<br/><br/>Regarding the comedy, the main point is that the movie is not over-indulgent in its humor. Of course, Bill Murray is the funniest character in the movie, but he is restrained, and, although he's basically a meta-guy of sorts in midst of the ridiculousness of the plot, in the end he is really commited in the action, and gives an excellent performance. He is, of course, the fan-favorite character of the movie, but let's not forget all the rest of the cast, which makes this movie a memorable experience.<br/><br/>I think Ghostbusters is perhaps the best comedy of the 80s. I think to further describe it would be redundant. My recomendation is just watch it, and enjoy it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Ghostbusters is considered a classic of the comedy genre. It's a very well paced film and the acting by everyone involved is top notch. Unlike the female remake the great thing about this film is how the acting compliments the script and nothing seems forced. Another great addition is the sparing use of CGI which compared to the overindulgence in the remake really stands out. Bill Murray excels in his deadpan and Sigourney Weaver looks ravishing and proves she is a great actress. The direction by Ivan Reitman is crisp."

","Ghost Busters is an excellent film, that falls a little short of greatness.<br/><br/>Bill Murray carries the film mostly with his antics, with help from Sigourney Weaver and the riot Rick Moranis, Aykroyd has his moments too. A funny film, though it's story and seriousness give way to light shows and laughs to be likable by the masses and family audiences. Peter's hopeful relationship with Dana and his relationship with his co-worker buddies and every appearance of Louis, is the film for me. Going to vanquish Gozer's only an inhibitor, so the ending's a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>Peter: No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve. Man at Elevator: That's gotta be some cockroach. Peter: Bite your head off, man. Raymond: Going up?<br/><br/>Peter: I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.

","For this film everything simply worked, it is one of those ""lightning in the bottle"" incidents! The main cast is great and very likeable, their interactions and comedic timing is impeccable, they work off each other in a sublime way! The side characters are similarly memorable and help to shape this incredible film. It's comedy meets fantasy/horror setting is one of, if not the best of it's kind! The effects are great and hold up, mainly cause they are practical effects combined with early CGI, creating many memorable monsters and scenes. Add the legendary theme song and the ingenious idea of having Ghostbusters in the first place - guys who are kinda like firemen, but bust ghosts, using cool gadgets and what you get is a timeless classic!"

","This is one of the all time great comedy films. I laugh so much every time I watch this movie. The effects don't hold up as well as they could but they are still pretty solid considering this movie is from 1984. Moranis, Murray, Aykroyd etc are all really hilarious in this. Great acting, great writing (Ramis), great direction (Reitman), everything is great in the comedy here."
"seti-66114","8","2","2","8 April 2018"," A full experience
","Oh, childhood, seeing Ghostbusters for the first time, it tickled my imagination. Seeing it again in my thirties I must say the experience was a bit different. Of course the obvious great acting performances were more apparent this time around. Bill Murray is a lot more of a ""dog"" than I remember, being weighed perfectly by the co-actors who all have their own personalities which help to advance the story.<br/><br/>The plot... its quite simple really. Quickly moving to the core, Ghost Busting, moving ahead fast enough to keep the audience engaged while ticking all the usual boxes of love interest, comedy and villains. The chemistry between the lead actors feels natural and having Sigourney Weaver gives the possession part of the movie more weight. <br/><br/>What I really took away from the movie was what I miss in most movies these days. Great characters, good balance of action and dialogue as well as genuine fun on the actors part . This is a fun movie which gave me a few chuckles and felt like it was really invested in, both in terms of budget (the special effects are a bit dated) and the apparent enjoyment of the actors.<br/><br/>Honorable mention. Bill Murray gives his hallmark performance and in my opinion is the pivot of the movie without being overbearing. Sigourney Weaver is strong also.<br/><br/>The music is 80's flashback which highlighted the the happy-go-lucky feeling of the movie. What I will say is the the music was implying a sense of mystery or even horror at a few places which to me didn't work at all. There is very little suspense in the movie and even when the score tries to work up a mood of mystery it kind of fell flat for me. Its a comedy with a supernatural context and that's it. Granted, it does it damn well."

","'GHOSTBUSTERS' - 1984<br/><br/>Directed by Ivan Reitman{Stripes; Meatballs}<br/><br/>Starring Bill Murray{Caddyshack; Stripes}, Dan Akroyd{The Blues Brothers; Trading Places} and Harold Ramis{Animal House; National Lampoon's Vacation}<br/><br/>Plot Overview: After encountering a librarian ghost, three scientists setup a new protection agency: The Ghostbusters, specialising in the busting of ghosts. No one takes their craft seriously, but when a demonic force begins to threaten the city; it's up to the Ghostbusters to stop it before it is too late.<br/><br/>I know, I know. It's criminal that I only just got around to seeing this wonderful movie. If you haven't already seen this movie, I urge you to see it now, and not wait as long as I did to do so. Everything about this movie is good, pure, family fun and entertainment. Some idiots would say that that is a negative, but I very much so disagree. This movie is accessible to ALL people, no matter their age or background. It's excellently crafted fun that the whole family can enjoy and laugh to.<br/><br/>What are this movie's major pluses? The FANTASTIC chemistry between the cast certainly comes to mind. Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis are phenomenal in their distinctive and memorable role as Peter, Ray and Egon respectively. I've watched this movie once and I can easily remember everything about their characters. They are all fun, memorable and unique. As for Whinston, that's another story that I'll touch on later.<br/><br/>Accompanying the holy trio is a side helping of Sigourney Weaver{Alien; The Year of Living Dangerously} and Rick Moranis{Acting Debut}. Both of these actors do extremely well in their unfortunately minor roles. I particularly loved Moranis as the socially awkward, inept next door neighbour to Signourney Weaver. He NAILED this role and was responsible for a great deal of the film's laughs, after Murray of course.<br/><br/>The humour in this movie is awesome. I dare say it's a universally loved classic of comedy. Murray delivers some of the best one liners and jokes of the 1980s, and the remainder of the cast do their very best to support him. I'd say only two characters didn't have a funny line and that'd be Dana Barret(Sigourney Weaver) and Egon. However, Weaver isn't in the movie that much, and Egon's straight faced attitude ironically makes for a barrel of laughs. Even characters I didn't like(more on that later) had couple of good lines and jokes.<br/><br/>As far as more minor praise, the soundtrack for this movie is flawless. The now iconic Ghostbusters theme tune could genuinely go down as one of the greatest theme tunes of all time; it is that excellent. <br/><br/>What issues do I have with the movie? I take issue with a couple of the characters. Firstly, Whinston. What is the point of this character? He shows up. Makes a decent joke or two. And nothing else. I know this film has a sequel so maybe he'll get more screen time then, but as it is - there are only three Ghostbusters worth talking about, in my honest opinion. Next, the secretary was also pretty dull and useless. Like Whinston, she showed up, made a decent joke or two, and nothing else. There was literally NO point to her being in the film. Like, none. I don't understand why she was here because she contributed negative things to the plot. And finally, the villain. Ghostbusters' villain is not scary; it's not funny; it's not even a decent blend of the two. The villain in Ghostbusters is just plain bad. There is no interest in the character and no likable, charming or frightening qualities to even make them somewhat compelling. Such a weak villain for an otherwise awesome movie. <br/><br/>I'll also say that the action in this movie is very weak. It consists of pointing a stick at a monster. BRILLIANT! No. No it's not. Without the comedy, action sequences in this movie would be remarkably dull and boring and just plain awful. I really wish that A LOT more effort was put into it because that(and a somewhat compelling villain) would have made this movie a 10/10, because it certainly has the ability to go for it.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved Ghostbusters. It was fun, fast, inventive and had a heck of a lot of heart. Sure the antagonist is mediocre and the action leaves you feel unsatisfied, but the main trio of Murray, Akroyd and Ramis help make this movie the comedic classic that it deserves to be. I definitely recommend 'Ghostbusters', and I'll rate this movie 8 'MASS HYSTERIAs' out of 10!"
"MikeSNation","10","2","2","11 February 2017"," A Comedy Classic!
","This movie is an absolute classic! It still holds up today, has amazing comedic talent in almost every role, and is pretty much universally loved for very good reason. Even today, 30 years later, everyone loves Ghostbusters. Even it's Ray Parker Jr theme song is still loved.<br/><br/>It's obviously a rather silly story but the cast does great with it, and if you go into the movie just expecting to have a great time and to laugh you won't be disappointed. I've seen it probably eight times and still find it just as funny today as I did the first time I watched it.<br/><br/>Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis (rest in peace), Rick Moranis (I love Louis Tully!), Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson all shine, but most especially Bill Murray in a role he was born to play. <br/><br/>The sequel's not nearly as good but is still quite funny and worth watching. The remake I did not like at all, other than a funny and visually stunning opening scene."

","I was six years old when this movie hit theaters, and as such it definitely has a place in my heart. That may or may not affect my objectivity in this review, but tonight I watched ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time since I was a kid, and I found it to be the perfect 80's comedy. <br/><br/>Is the movie a bit cheesy along the way? Sure. But it's also iconic, and more importantly it's just plain fun. There's so much to pick up on with this movie when you watch it as an adult vs. as a kid. I laughed and laughed at the sight of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Sure, that scene is funny at any age, but you really have to be an adult to appreciate the absurdity of the towering monster roaming through the streets of New York with a huge smile on his face. <br/><br/>I also found the acting in this movie to be great. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd steal the show, along with Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis. And I kept on thinking to myself, ""Who is that woman?"", who plays the lead actress. I was stunned when the credits rolled to realize it was Sigourney Weaver. She's quite the looker in this movie--a big improvement from the Alien movies when she didn't have hair.<br/><br/>All in all I have to give this movie 10 stars. That's a rarity for me, as I seldom give a perfect score to any film. But ""Ghostbusters"" is just too fun and too well made not to warrant this distinction. This well done, well made film is a pleasure to watch, no matter your age!"
"The_Orenda","7","2","2","11 July 2004"," Two Thumbs Up.
","One of the best movies of the Eighties, Ghost Busters is one of those must watch movies. The special effects may be dated now, but the conviction and comedy of the actors are still very much up to par with today. One of Bill Murray's best and most certainly Reitman's finest. A definite well done job.<br/><br/>After getting kicked off campus, three professors sell the house of one of their to get the money to become 'paranormal investigations and exterminations!""<br/><br/>Ghost Busters has not really stood the test of time as many other classics have. What once was original has now been beaten down by so many imitators that it is hard to give credit where it is due. We take it for granted essentially but it's all good. Ghost Busters still gets a thumbs up."
"bunny-68656","6","22","46","16 May 2015"," Unremarkable
","Just watched this movie after having it hyped by all my friends "" You have to see ghost busters!"" ""You gotta see ghost busters!"". And I have to say what I got was a major disappointment. In fact I believe it to be highly over rated.<br/><br/>For one thing, none of the characters had any depth. They either spewed one liners like they had a fatal disease, explained the plot, or were sex objects.<br/><br/>SPEAKING OF SEX OBJECTS; This movie is quite sexist. There are two main female characters in this film ,neither of whose names I can remember, ( I watched this half an hour ago) one of whom is pining for one of the male leads, the other who is possessed and gets turned into a sexy goddess dog... Thing.<br/><br/>And just too add to that, ghost busters isn't that... Well, funny. I think I laughed out once in this movie, and that was the first scene where Bill Muray's character is attempting to seduce some woman through his weird physic test... Something . ( I don't really know, it's never explained that well) The rest of it was unfunny one liners or bad situational comedy.<br/><br/>But Ghostbusters worst crime is that it's just kinda... Boring. The plot is unremarkable end of the world stuff with a dumb Bill Murray's character trying to seduce Sigourney Weaver's character subplot thrown in there too.<br/><br/>So in the end, if you like this movie, by all means, go ahead like it! Who am I to stop you? But personally, I thought it to be incredibly unremarkable. Not bad, just unremarkable<br/><br/>(For the record, I love all the actors in this movie. Just not in this)"
"BA_Harrison","6","14","28","3 October 2009"," There's something weird, and it don't look good.
","After losing their university grant, paranormal scientists Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) set up business as Ghost Busters, professional exterminators for those with supernatural pests, unaware that New York is soon to become plagued by spooks as an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer prepares to enter our realm.<br/><br/>When Ghost Busters was originally released, way back in 1984 (bloody hell, that's a quarter of a century ago!!!), cinema audiences went wild for the supernatural adventures of spook wranglers Venkman and Co.: the film was the definition of an 80s, crowd-pleasing blockbuster, with an impressive cast of hot comedy names, a script packed with witty one liners, bucket-loads of flashy, state-of-the-art special effects, and, of course, a catchy theme song that couldn't fail to please.<br/><br/>So this afternoon, I sat down to re-live the magical experience with my children (aged 6 and 8), but to my disappointment, discovered that the film really hasn't aged that well. Despite some classic moments of dry humour from Bill Murray, the impressive sight of a Godzilla-size Mr. Stay Puft trashing New York, and the even more impressive sight of Sigourney Weaver's lovely, long legs, the film just isn't as great as my memory had led me to believe: it's rather cheap looking at times, with shonky props, unconvincing sound-stage sets, and crowd-scenes of, oh, at least 50 people; the effects that once dazzled now look embarrassingly bad, with iffy stop motion animation, crap matte work, random flashy lights, and Richard Edlund's Oscar nominated 'ink in water' clouds looking just like... well, just like ink in water; and rather than being a roller-coaster ride of laughs and scares, the film is actually pretty dull at times. Sorry kids, but I was so sure that this film rocked; instead, it's just another passable piece of 80s nostalgia for the middle-aged.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least the theme song is still a corker; all together now....

","Just like ""Stayin' Alive"" or ""Mrs. Robinson"", Ray Parker Jr.' ""Ghost Busters"" is one of these instantly identifiable songs as the first four seconds are enough to make you recall the lyrics that go along. Indeed, who doesn't know whom to call if in their neighborhood there's something strange. Ever since 1984, the movie has been a cultural phenomenon and speaking for myself, I learned to draw the iconic logo before I even saw the film.<br/><br/>But let's get back to 1984. There's something very revealing about that year's ten highest- grossing movies, in order: ""Ghostbusters"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", ""Gremlins"", ""The Karate Kid"", ""Police Academy"", ""Footloose"", ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Star Trek III"" and ""Splash"". Think about it, six comedies, variously overlapping with romance, adventure and horror, but still comedies; only two sequels, and one of them so over-the-top it is funny in it own twisted and politically incorrect way, the rest consists on a musical and a sports underdog film, typical feel-good movies.<br/><br/>Those were the good old days, when the box-office champs weren't made of franchises fillers or heavyset blockbusters, when there was still room for originality, even of uneven quality, when the special effects driven movies didn't take themselves seriously and were more fun to watch than these depressingly square and clinical universes today's directors embark us in. Now that the 80's enter their thirties, we realize how entertaining, imaginative and fun they were. You went to the movies to have a good time.<br/><br/>And if there ever is one film that encapsulates that spirit, it's the story of three outcast parapsychologists with gray uniforms chasing ghosts with a vacuum-like device attached to packers. Of course, it sounds better as ""Ghost Busters"" and much cooler with the logo that became a defining sign of the 80's, one I'll take before any Batman or Superman shield. Seriously, let these guys fight together, I'd rather have a hot-dog stuffed green monster charging at Bill Murray, and sliming him in the process. Forget the truth, justice and the American way, some psychic nuisances and a trio of misunderstood weirdos will do.<br/><br/>And ""Ghostbusters"" is a movie made by performers who knew what the 80's was about, what the public wanted and it doesn't come as a surprise that these guys come from TV. It was a project written by SNL alumni Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd with John Belushi in mind, but his untimely passing entailed many changes in the script. And with gentlemanly class, Ramis and Aykroyd let the lion share of one- liners to Bill Murray, giving him the role his comical legacy needed: a wisecracking scientist named Dr. Peter Venkman, such a constant jerk-ass you can't even tell if HE can tell whether he's serious or not.<br/><br/>Ramis plays Egon Spengler, the egghead and Ayrkyod is Raymond Stantz, the good friend and most emotionally involved of the three. You have the trio made of the mind, the heart and the crazy spirit, and their chemistry is the key to the film's success. They're later joined by Ernie Hudson, who plays Winston Zeddmore, the everyman of the group, and to some extent, the needed 'voice of reason'. A lot has been said about the way Hudson was treated by the film's marketing, but I don't think the race card is to be brandished here. And there's something oddly original in the way a significant character pops up halfway through the narrative.<br/><br/>The film also counts on nice supporting performances. There's Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, a cellist who's the 'first to call', after witnessing some strange phenomena in her kitchen. There's also a familiar face of the 80's, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully, the meek and geeky accountant who's obviously infatuated with his beautiful neighbor. For some reason, she unable to see what he's got to offer, and the eight inches between them don't help. She also doesn't call Venkman's 'romantic' tirades but the ghost storyline finds a smart way to reassemble these two romantic subplots, when Dana is demonically possessed by a spirit.<br/><br/>And Venkman's reactions to her exorcist-like condition proves at least one thing, it takes a lot to shake the guy. And that's the most brilliant aspect about the film, the special effects can satisfy any sucker for horror or Sci-fi movies but the fact that the three players handle it as pure routine is a great example of tongue-in-cheek humor and a subtle satire on New York's inner wackiness. After all, where else can you see a TV ad about ghost busting? I also love how the blasé secretary played by Annie Potts doesn't even question their works, and when she asks Winston whether he believe in these things, he tells her that for money, he'd believe anything (I thought there was a waste here for a funnier line but never mind). <br/><br/>Everyone is so crazy that the closest to come to a sane person is the antagonist, an EPA lawyer who had all the reasons not to trust these guys who use radioactive material for their jobs. But only William Atherton, the soon-to-play Thornbug in ""Die Hard"" could have made himself more unlikable than jerk-ass Bill Murray, and he's the one who by turning off the power that stocked all the taken slime, liberated them and turned New York into the outlet of the most demonic presences, using Dana's building as a channel. We get then to a climactic showdown, whose special effects might distract from the comedy for a little while, but not too long.<br/><br/>Indeed, the masterstroke comes from the form taken by the evil presence, and this is the stuff iconic movies are made of. ""Ghost Busters"" isn't without flaws, but they're of such microscopic and negligible nature compared to its iconic magnitude, that the film works as a ""Critics Buster"" too."

If so, time for a revisit: you'll be surprised how bad it is.<br/><br/>Such weak writing!  The humour is all in the wisecracks, but not one of them is memorable or (in itself) funny or in any way witty.  If we are fooled into thinking otherwise, it's due to Bill Murray.  It happens in every film he appears in (that is, those that aren't antecedently funny).  His character is cynical in the most innocent way, his delivery is impeccable, we really want his words to be amusing as well - so much so that we're prepared to pretend.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Ghostbusters"" is cool, too.  We want to be transported into a world in which there are ghostbusters of this kind, so much so that we're prepared to overlook the fact that we're watching fumbled comedy rather than successful fantasy.  Again, Bill Murray helps.  His I'm-game-for-anything character is the only one who seems to belong.<br/><br/>Surprisingly good is Elmer Bernstein's score.  Strange how I hadn't noticed the general decline of film scores over the past seventeen years.

"Atreyu_II","6","8","15","3 May 2008"," One of those cases which big expectations can turn into a disappointment
","""Ghost Busters"" is an okay film, but not all that potato bag for me. In fact, I think it tends to be overrated and a little too overvalued. If you ask me, people tend to give this movie more credit than it deserves. But I respect other people's opinions, even if I disagree with them.<br/><br/>""Ghost Busters"" is reasonably entertaining on its whole. The first half, without being spectacular, is nevertheless entertaining, fun and has its moments of comedy. In the second half, the movie becomes extremely dark (with all those monsters and strange creatures), losing interest for me (although that giant Marshmallow Man is a curious figure).<br/><br/>In fact, those hideous creatures that appear in the second half, that wizard-like woman and some very disturbing ghosts are mostly what ruins the movie for me.<br/><br/>However, not everything is bad about this movie. It has a delightful soundtrack theme which is a classic: the song ""Ghostbusters"", performed by Ray Parker Jr. What else? The special effects are, most of them, awesome (typically 80's, which is a good thing). And finally: both Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are quite funny in these roles. Bill Murray has a very particular sense of humor. Dan Aykroyd, on the other hand, is an actor which I've always seen playing serious and sometimes grumpy characters, so I never expected to see him in a comical role like this. But in ""Ghost Busters"" he's quite funny and he does some hilarious facial expressions.<br/><br/>Rick Moranis is cool as Louis Tully, but I honestly rather him as Wayne Szalinski in ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"".<br/><br/>Conclusion? It's not a boring movie, a bad movie or a big quality movie. Overall, it's just an okay movie made mainly for some fun and entertainment. «Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!» My rating is a 6/10. I think it's a fair and deserved rating for this movie: neither more neither less than that."

","""Human Sacrifice, Dogs and Cats living together, MASS HYSTERIA"" said one Peter Venkman.  And that could pretty much describe this goofy comedy from the great minds of Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.  <br/><br/>But the plot is pretty interesting also.  It shows a trio of scientists (funny ones at that including Bill Murray in one of his best roles) turn from college rejects to the biggest hit in New York by being 'profesional paranormal investigators and eliminators' (AKA- Ghostbusters).  There are plenty of funny parts, but they are overshadowed by parts of ridiculous (yet remarkable) effects which showcase ghosts of plenty. <br/><br/>But thanks to great writing, great directing (Ivan reitman), and great acting, this film gets to be a great example of comedy in it's finest form and It's one of the best films of the 80's as well."

"StoryIsEverything","10","3","4","25 January 2016"," A true classic
","I should begin this review by stating that Ghostbusters is my all time favourite film. It has been ever since my father took me to see it in the summer of 1984. The film made a huge impact on me as a child. I loved it then and I love it now. Do I think its the best film ever made? No. But if were talking sheer entertainment value if there's one film I enjoy watching more than any other it's this one. Why? Lets start with the concept. Ghostbusters premise is simple but genius. A group of men who create a ghost catching business. It's such a unique and interesting idea which really shouldn't be overlooked. Next is the tone. This film perfectly balances horror and comedy. It offers equal doses of scares and laughs. There are parts which are pretty frightening , especially for kids but the scares are quickly countered by something funny. The film also does an impressive balancing act of mixing the berserk with the mundane. The goofy looking ghosts and ridiculous situation that the characters find themselves in is made believable due to the tone of the acting, the convincing ghost catching technology and Elmer Bersteins epic score. This brings me on to the music. Ray Parker Jrs theme tune, like the film itself, is genius. Apart from it being an incredibly catchy tune it acted as a perfect advertisement for the film and works well in the places its utilised. Due to the popularity of the theme tune the score by Elmer Berstein is often overlooked. Bersteins score is pitch perfect and his epic sound elevates the film making it feel as big as a one hundred and twelve and a half foot tall Stay Puft marshmallow man. The films strongest point though is without doubt it's characters. Peter Venkman is the wisecracking cynical ladies man. Ignorant and uninterested in science and the supernatural his character is the polar opposite of the educated and highly motivated Ray Stantz. Egon Spengler is the genius of the group who serves as the one who provides the other characters with his insight. Then there's Winston Zeddemore. An everyman who joins the group pretty late into the story but fits into the team really well. I wont go into the rest of the cast but they all do a great job. The dialogue is extremely memorable. It's full of funny one liners and unique scientific jargon. The story is simple but we'll written in its structure. The film is well paced. Each scene plays it's part in moving the story forward and isn't a moment longer than it needs to be, something that many films today should take note of. Though some of the special effects look a little shoddy most of them still look great. I could go on but I think I'll end my review by saying watch it and if you have watched it, watch it again."
"kelly-gaudreau","8","3","4","13 February 2015"," All Hail Bill Murray
","Who are you going to call? F&@# the rest of them, I'm only calling Bill Murray. His deadpan humour makes this film. Now, don't get me wrong, Ackyrod and Ramis are great, as well. However, Murray is like a god. Another highlight of the movie is Rick Moranis. Originally, John Candy was to play the role as a conservative business type. I think that would have bombed. Moranis's version of Tully was perfect. A low point in the movie was Sigourney Weaver. She is much better at fighting aliens. This movie definitely brings me back to my childhood. I never could figure out the Slimer character. When I see him I say, ""Hey, Look it's a ghost."" No, I'm more likely to say, ""Hey, Look it's the kind of S#%t I have up my nose."" Bring on the third installment!"
"The Grand Master","9","3","4","8 January 2015"," A childhood classic that is still enjoyable
","I first saw Ghostbusters when I was 8 years old after watching the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters during Saturday morning cartoons when I was younger. The movie is still a delight to watch after many years, and the comedy and special effects are still enjoyable. Who would have thought the Ghostbusters symbol would still be popular after many years, particularly on many t-shirts.<br/><br/>Take away the comedic elements and Ghostbusters would not be the same. It is due to the efforts of Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis that makes it possible and has created one of the most popular comedies of all time. Bill Murray's deadpan delivery of his many humorous and sarcastic one liners are still a classic.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the discovery of apparent paranormal activities and the three scientists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Ackroyd), and Egon Spengler (the late Harold Ramis) are called in to investigate. After losing their jobs at Columbia University the three decide to start up a ghost busting company specialising in capturing ghosts. Although business is slow at first, the Ghostbusters make their mark in New York after their first call in which they capture their first ghost in the Sedgewick Hotel and their business is in high demand across New York. The Ghostbusters also enlist a fourth member to join their team Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson).<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters are later called to investigate the apartment Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) lives in after she finds that her apartment is haunted by the demonic spirit Zuul. Venkman finds himself immediately attracted to Dana Barrett and also takes a keen interest in investigating this further. Dana has to also contend with her neighbour, the nerdy accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) who Dana constantly but politely rebuffs.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters future is almost put in jeopardy when a hard-nosed lawyer representing the EPA Walter Peck (William Atherton) orders the business shut down following breaches of the environmental act as well as inadvertently releasing all the ghosts captured to wreak havoc across New York. He also orders all four of the Ghostbusters arrested and thrown in jail. They are later released by the mayor to combat the paranormal activity across New York, in particular Zuul who has Dana and Louis possessed by demons.<br/><br/>Bill Murray steals every scene he is in as Peter Venkman. Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis also counter balance the movie with their unique humour.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is certainly Ivan Reitman's finest movie and Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis prove they are not just a pretty face as they are responsible for writing the movie. Harold Ramis also proves that he is a good director, as evidenced by Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>There's no doubting that Ghostbusters is still an enjoyable special effects bonanza and a great comedy. If anyone could compile a list of the greatest movies of the 1980's, Ghostbusters has a well deserved spot on the list.<br/><br/>9/10."

In this hilarious movie the three decide to set up a business that catches ghosts and spirits, they recruit a fourth member and they wind up uncovering an ancient prophesy foretelling the rise of a Sumerian Goddess.<br/><br/>A tribute to the great city of New York, Bill Murray is exceptional as the cynical Ghostbuster. The soundtrack that accompanies this movie is epic. From Slimer to the Marshmallow Man and the Vicious Dog the special effects for the time were quite good. A real sense of fun permeates the film.

","Ghostbusters has all the ingredients that go into the making of a good comedy. Subtlety, wit, good performances and a smart and crisp story. Three out-of-work, oddball scientists found a company that gets rid of ghosts from haunted places. They encounter myriad spirits and are put to test when they have to face the mother-of-all-ghosts in a riveting climax.<br/><br/>The movie is just a cascade of one comedic situation after another and at the same time, we are also interested in the big picture. Bill Murray is one of the ghostbusters and his character is unusual for a scientist; he appears bored throughout the movie, when he is chasing ghosts or courting the Sigourney Weaver character. Weaver herself is brilliant as both the cynic and the temptress, before and after she is possessed respectively. All the supporting characters are memorable. They all have their own weird personalities. Heck, even the ghosts, big or small, cute or fierce, have personalities. Top it up with some witty dialog and you have a thoroughly enjoyable film."

","3 would-be scientists working at the University are looking into the paranormal and testing students. They get kicked out of practice due to some slightly unethical tests (and the fact that everyone doubts their field of study and thinks they are nuts!) so they decide to go into business for themselves as ""Ghostbusters"". They create all manner of tools and gadgets in order to hunt for and trap ghosts, expanding their business and eventually recruiting help along the way too. Unbeknownst to anybody a long dead Sumerian deity called Dozer is attempting to make a come back and it's up to the Ghostbusters to put an end to the chaos and evil. <br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films of all time and is a classic film which stands out as one of the best in the 80's.

Ivan Reitmen did an excellent job with the film as director balancing the effects with genuine dialogue acting, he let some of the actors improvise their own lines to brilliant effect. I reckon that Ackroyd and Ramis's script was already creative and hilarious but it's not often that you get a director who gives control to some of the stars to do what they do best when they aren't in feature films (most of the main stars were comedic stars on late night American TV shows). Some of the special effects look a little dated nowadays but not all of them, some still stand up as effective and as appealing as they were in the 80's when this was wowing audiences around the world. You have to remember this was before what we consider to be modern CGI so a lot of the effects you see are lessons learned from cinema over the years. As for music or a soundtrack, can you honestly say you've gone through life without hearing Ray Parker Jr's classic titular anthem?!<br/><br/>The success of this film led to cartoons, comics, a sequel, a range of toys, and whole host of moments which still get referenced today. <br/><br/>Family friendly, full of fun, great visuals and soundtrack, memorable to this day, I could write soo many great things about this but I'll end by saying that you really can't go wrong watching this great film!"

","If one could get his or her tongue any farther into their cheek, I don't know how it is possible. Here we have the Second City people and they play this for everything it's worth. No one really ever asks why these ghosts have appeared or why Ghostbusters exists. It is taken for granted. Of course, they have all these machines that are based on some made-up scientific principles. But who cares? The movie is really a series of hilarious encounters among the characters and their effort to rid New York City of the threat. Bill Murray is the wise cracking leader of the group with sidekick Dan Aykroyd following suit. Sigourney Weaver supplies the female interest and then there are the amazing special effects. This is a sojourn into utter craziness with an almost Marx Brothers kind of mentality. I always get kick out of this movie. Rick Moranis is also a great character, unflappable to the end."

"maxastree","9","4","6","12 January 2015"," Greatest 80s movie of the 80s - thankfully doesn't look too 80s.
","This movie was a huge commercial success when it opened, partly because it mixed big budget visual effects with small scale human comedy, but also because the perfectly cast and designed Ghostbusters created such a memorable impression that audiences seemingly had the movie etched on their consciousness for decades afterward.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters follows basic comedy plot tropes, broadly speaking; when three unsuccessful parapsychologists are removed from their campus, they face the reality of starting a business in a competitive, uncaring world. In doing so, they offer to capture ghosts with high end industrial lasers, and along the way, lovable goof-ball Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) falls in love with Dana Barrett, a concert cellist who initially rejects him.<br/><br/>The movie effortlessly combines sci-fi with horror, fantasy, comedy and romance elements, and no element ever feels out of place or at odds with the underlying structure. The films classy, almost fifties retro visual style has weathered well, and László Kovács classic cinematography is put to good use in the films various comic set ups and large scale visual effects set pieces, as is Elmer Bernstein's classic score. <br/><br/>What's little known about the film is that a T.V. series from the seventies ""The Ghost Busters"" already existed a decade earlier, although unrelated to the film except in name only, also some of the visual effects appear to be an extension of the effects created for the 1982 movie Poltergeist.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the cast of Ghostbusters have gone on to do other things, although internet fandom has made noise about a new film for a decade or more, but none has actually come to light. Plans for a female-led Ghostbusters installment are in the works, but really, who cares? It would mean more to create something new and challenging, but the temptation to rework a successful franchise is too much for the for-profit investment model associated with Hollywood filmmaking.<br/><br/>That said, for all of the fans/collectors/geeks/obsessives who love Ghostbusters, its official sequel from 1989 is flat in terms of fantasy OR comedy material, and its also surprising how many utterly hopeless films have been made with the names ""Ivan Reitman"" or ""Dan Ackroyd"" attached to them in the passing decades."

","Another movie I've been missing out on...until now! This movie is just hilarious, with everyone giving a terrific performance. The main cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are great together and Rick Moranis is awesomely funny in a smaller role as a nerdy accountant who lives in the same apartment building as Sigourney Weaver. On Sigourney Weaver: there was nothing particularly bad about her performance, but she did seem a little underwritten. There was one great scene she had with Bill Murray after she gets possessed, but other than that she was merely a plot device/damsel in distress. Moving on to other facets of the production, I thought the soundtrack was top-notch, cheesy 80's goodness and the title song was especially memorable and catchy. Visual effects is one area where I felt the film to be a bit lacking, although it probably was some of the best effects the early 80's had to offer. In my opinion, the animatronics and claymation/stop-motion work was better than some early CG. This especially becomes apparent in the ridiculously convoluted final act, and is preceded by a hastily (but hilariously) resolved conflict with an EPA agent. Other than, I didn't really see any major problems with the writing. It just seemed like the scope of the film could have stayed smaller towards the end and been just as enjoyable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the film a lot and am now ""in the know"" about a film that has left an indelible mark on pop culture. So, who ya gonna call? I know who I would...Ghostbusters!"

"StevePulaski","9","4","6","1 September 2014"," The thirtieth anniversary re-release
","Much to my dismay and disappointment, I am usually never able to catch films that are re-released into theaters on account of an anniversary or a 3D upgrade. This is mainly because so many films often come out the same weekend as the re-releases to, leaving me strapped to make the decision to rewatch an old favorite in theaters or seek out and review the new releases, the ones people want to read reviews of. As somebody who watches anywhere from forty to sixty films a month, I need to choose wisely, and never, until now, have I chosen a re-released film over a new release.<br/><br/>This all changed when an unsurprisingly slow film weekend in August revealed the thirtieth anniversary release of the 1984 classic fantasy-comedy ""Ghostbusters"" in about seven-hundred theaters in the United States. In a time where some of the strangest, most unremarkable releases come out of the woodwork in American cinema, ""Ghostbusters"" seemed like a perfect break from the drudgery of blockbusters, under-impressive sequels, under-performing risks, and so forth. Even as I sat back to watch one of the funniest and most original comedies of the 1980's on the big screen, I felt like I was taking a mini-vacation from this gig I call my side-job/passion.<br/><br/>I doubt ""Ghostbusters"" needs more than a brief plot summation, but the film concerns Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), three misfits interested in the idea of supernatural forces and paranormal activity. The three men find themselves caught up in a whirlwind of popularity after being called to The New York Public Library to take down a ghost that has been haunting the library for sometime now, and following their success at identifying and capturing the being, the three decide to open up their own business as professional Ghostbusters, working with the city of New York to stop paranormal forces dead in their tracks. They are soon approached by Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to function as their fourth member, and attach themselves to Dana Barrett's (Sigourney Weaver) specific case, which concerns her apartment complex being overtaken by the demonic spirit known as Zuul, who's spirits are worshiped by Gozer the Gozerian, the God of Destruction.<br/><br/>At first thought, the film sounds overstuffed and complicated, but as anyone familiar with the film knows, it's anything but. This is mainly because it would appear writers Aykroyd and Ramis bear the similar attitude about the entire project as the character Peter Venkman, sarcastic, lax, and carefree. This sounds like a criticism, but the fact that ""Ghostbusters"" bears such a collective and relaxed aura about its story and its characters never makes the film fall prey to any confusing subplots or technological jargon. It can be sarcastic, it can be smug, and it can be just plain silly, but all of the above reasons, and the fact that the idea is executed to the fullest extent, are the reasons this film is so loved and cherished, albeit worthy of a thirtieth anniversary re-release.<br/><br/>Being that there's little to critique, as most comments have already been made and mine will sound very much like a reiteration of old reviews, one must comment on the joy of seeing a re-released film on the big screen. For starters, ""Ghostbusters"" has a great deal of elements that make it worthy of a big screen viewing. From the montage of catching ghosts, to the actual, developed scenes where catching Slimer is the gang's main objective, to witnessing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man come to life on screen all compliment the inherent largeness of a theater screen wonderfully. Combine all of those elements with the terrific sound editing and elaborate special effects, which still look pretty good thirty years later, and there is an arguable reason to make a trip to the theater to see ""Ghostbusters."" Then there's Ray Parker, Jr.'s infectious theme song, which brings a smile to a nostalgic face, especially when heard through the expensive, surround-sound speakers of a theater. It's this song that is the bow to the entire experience of seeing ""Ghostbusters"" alive on screen again. If the joy of seeing Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson interact and exchange the same classic, witty banter we can all quote flawlessly isn't enough for you, Ray Parker, Jr.'s theme song will surely place the icing on the timeless cake.<br/><br/>Being that this is a different review than usual, I'll end the review not necessarily recommending the movie (you should know by now if you are or are not a fan of ""Ghostbusters"") but recommending the experience to anyone who has yet to witness the phenomenon on a theater screen. The entire experience could make a wonderful introduction to classic, eighties films for the new generation, and for once feels like a genuine appreciation of the classic film without unnecessary upgrades in the third-dimension.<br/><br/>Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Rick Moranis. Directed by: Ivan Reitman."

","John Winger, Bill Murray's lovable loser in the boot camp comedy STRIPES, the second of three collaborations with director Ivan Reitman beginning with MEATBALLS, had his very own theme song: a lazy piano-bar riff, whose likeness can be heard in GHOSTBUSTERS throughout Elmer Bernstein's immense score, but only when Murray's sarcastic Peter Venkman flirts with Signourney Weaver or clashes jovially with Dan Aykroyd's rambling Dr. Raymond Stanz, who Venkman describes as ""the heart of the Ghostbusters.""<br/><br/>And that would make Harold Ramis's Egon the lungs. Murray's reluctant sidekick in STRIPES and the director of CADDYSHACK and GROUNDHOG DAY, Ramis is an essential ingredient to make the gadgets and demonic backstory completely believable.<br/><br/>As a team-up, one of the great things about GHOSTBUSTERS is seeing Murray play off of two science-minded serious guys. Aykroyd and Ramis wrote the film and obviously knew Murray had the stuff to steal scenes. Although the lead role was originally intended for Aykroyd's cinema partner, the late John Belushi: who inspired the iconic green ghost, Slimer. <br/><br/>For years, Murray and Aykroyd were in the groundbreaking original Saturday Night Live cast after Murray replaced Chevy Chase in the second season. GHOSTBUSTERS was the peak of the SNL surge that also included ANIMAL HOUSE, THE BLUE BROTHERS, 1941 and TRADING PLACES.<br/><br/>The original three-hundred-page script by Aykroyd began with a callused trio already fighting specters in New York City. It was Reitman's decision to show the boys origin, and some of the best scenes occur during the first fifteen minutes. One in particular involves Murray seducing a beautiful blonde in a fake telekinesis test followed by a hilarious attempt to snare a ghost within an immense library.<br/><br/>A big budget comedy mixing horror/thriller and disaster film elements, GHOSTBUSTERS also makes terrific use of montage. After capturing a troublesome green wraith in a fancy hotel ballroom, we get a neat five-minute glimpse of the once almost-broke team becoming successful and famous. This is a surprise to Sigourney Weaver's lovely Dana Barrett, a classy violinist who, having witnessed something otherworldly in her fridge, becomes the core of an evil god's domination using an antique high-rise as the epicenter, turning the Big Apple into a Gothic medieval liar.<br/><br/>With an exception of the stop-motion gargoyle mutts, that still look pretty cool despite Gumby-like movements, the special effects are hardly dated and show up fantastically on the big screen. But the true villain is a human being... You probably won't find any more heavies actually trying to save the environment. William Atherton's EPA weenie Walter Peck makes a terrifically uptight foe (playing a similar character in the following year's REAL GENIUS).<br/><br/>Other side-characters include Rick Moranis as Dana's dorky neighbor, who fares better than Anne Potts annoying Busters secretary. But it's African American character actor Ernie Hudson, as newly hired Winston Zeddmore, who really shines. The forth Ghostbuster becomes, during the final battle verses a giant Marshmallow Man, just as important as the other fellas. And his mellow conversation with Ray about the Book of Revelations is a deep departure from the jokey action.<br/><br/>GHOSTBUSTERS is a perfect combination of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd's talents. Aykroyd does most of the work, spouting rambling expository about the origin of the demonic presence while Murray remains the constantly wry non-believer, grounding a story that could have easily came off as too far-fetched but winded up one of the best character-driven comedies of the 1980's.<br/><br/>With the chart-topping Ray Parker Jr. title song and a cute NO GHOST logo, the subtle traits of GHOSTBUSTERS are often lost in the shuffle, making CADDYSHACK and other smaller films more significant in cult cinema status... <br/><br/>And yet, Egon's line ""I collect spores, molds and fungus"" invokes a bigger laugh than the famous Murray quip ""He slimed me,"" but only to us, the true believers who watched GB over twenty times and have a lifelong subscription to Tobin's Spirit Guide... Who says print is dead?"

","What happens when a guy finds himself losing the woman he loves to a bloodthirsty Sumerian god? Can a trio of determined men capture a Class-5 full-roaming vapor without destroying a hotel ballroom? Is ""crossing the streams"" dangerous to one's health?<br/><br/>If you are like millions of other people, you already know the answers to these and other questions. A giant comedy smash in its day, ""Ghostbusters"" is still a lot of fun, and perhaps the most successful cinematic showcase for veterans of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV."" While not as hilarious or as scary as its reputation suggests, ""Ghostbusters"" is clever and amusing and goes by fast.<br/><br/>The star of the show, Bill Murray, plays Peter Venkman, a university professor we meet playing a shady psychic shell game in order to score some time with a young lovely. When forced to relocate, he and his friends Egon (Harold Ramis) and Ray (Dan Aykroyd) set to work as freelance spook catchers, fortunately for them just as the the Big Apple is about to be swallowed by the gates of hell.<br/><br/>""We could really bust some heads, in a spiritual sense of course,"" Ray notes.<br/><br/>The casting really brings out the best in the movie. Sigourney Weaver as the imperiled love interest Dana brings the right snark to her role, comparing Venkman to a ""game show host"" with a withering stare as he attempts (hilariously) to put the moves on her. Rick Moranis, like Ramis from ""SCTV"", is a nerdy accountant who chases after Dana like a dog, then as a dog. He throws tax-deductible parties, then brags to his guests: ""I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense...that's why I invited clients instead of friends."" And then there's William Atherton's nasty EPA official Walter Peck, sneering wonderfully at it all.<br/><br/>As a fan of the old ""Saturday Night Live"", I guess I wanted more chemistry from the classic SNL cornerstones here, Murray and Aykroyd. Instead, Aykroyd doesn't do much to establish himself. Even though he concepted and wrote the film, his character is even less interesting than the fourth Ghostbuster, recruit Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), who is a bit of a bystander in this film though he does have one great line. ""If someone asks you if you're a god, you say 'Yes'!""<br/><br/>Murray of course gets all the best lines, delivered in his signature deadpan style, like ""Back off, man, I'm a scientist"" or ""Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance."" Director Ivan Reitman leaves Murray plenty of space in-between the special effects to establish a ""Ghostbusters"" voice; even if to me it seems at times more of a collection of catch phrases, I see Reitman giving the film enough shape and subtlety to make those catch phrases click.<br/><br/>Yes, the effects are dated, and there are odd moments that don't connect (Ray being seduced out of nowhere by a ghost, for example). Still, ""Ghostbusters"" is a smart genre-bender with the ability to fly through generations like that Slimer ghost goes through walls."

","Combining big-budget special effects with irony and sarcasm-laden dialog, ""Ghostbusters"" is a one-of-a-kind sci-fi fantasy comedy as entertaining as it can get.<br/><br/>The movie stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, three graduates from the great schools of ""Saturday Night Live"", ""SCTV"" and ""National Lampoon"", as three ""scientists"" whose specialty is to detect and hunt down ghosts of all kinds. They form a team called the Ghostbusters and they offer their duties to whoever wanting to get ridden of a ghost.<br/><br/>After some troublesome beginnings, the team quickly becomes very popular and is able to eradicate dozens of paranormal creatures from every corner of Manhattan. They are in such demand that they need to hire a fourth crew member, played by Ernie Hudson. However, their skills and their knowledge are soon going to be rudely tested when a destroyer god from the Babylonian era is getting ready to penetrate into our world and to spread chaos in a Judgment Day fashion.<br/><br/>This kind of scenario could reminisce anybody of such disaster movies from the middle of the 20th century, monster movies such as ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"", or even contemporary blockbusters, filled with rumpus, destruction and special effects intended to terrify and provoke some panic. ""Ghostbusters"" is all of that at once, but it dissociates itself from the bunch in its own particular way.<br/><br/>Instead of presenting itself as a drama, a thriller or an action flick, ""Ghostbusters"" is introduced as a heavy special FX comedy. Chimeric idea? Maybe. But the result is simply delectable, because of the quality of the special effects, but mainly because of the humor brought out by the stars of the picture, beginning with the master of irony, Bill Murray.<br/><br/>Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the unofficial leader of the group. His on-screen appearances are always delightful, his lines being almost always stamped with irony and impassive humor. Murray is very much at ease and he does whatever he wants in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Murray's two accomplices (and the co-writers of this movie), Aykroyd and Ramis, are not relegated to oblivion anyway and, together with Murray, the three of them have a good lot of chemistry. At moments, they can become as funny as Murray is.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is also a part of the cast in ""Ghostbusters"". She plays a violinist who quickly realizes that her refrigerator could very be some kind of portal towards a parallel dimension. Rick Moranis plays her nerdish neighbor. Sometimes nice, sometimes unpleasant, it's actually very hard to really care about Moranis' character in this movie. It becomes easier when he is pursued and possessed by the Sumerian demons, but we actually do care much more about Sigourney Weaver in that situation.<br/><br/>Ernie Hudson, a relatively underground actor, is fairly attractive as the fourth Ghostbuster. He represents somehow the link between the ghost trackers and the ordinary people.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the actors from ""Ghostbusters"" are generally overshadowed by the impressive special effects required for that kind of movie involving creatures from another world and innovative technology to hunt ghosts. But the actors find themselves rewarded from that move. Thus, we see ""proton packs"" with extremely dangerous, but extremely convincing beams. We also see ghosts that are both frightening and funny, the green wiener-eating ""Slimer"" being the best example.<br/><br/>But how could we forget the unforgettable climax starring the most unlikely destroyer in New York City history: the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man? It is without any doubt the most famous scene of the whole picture and it's not without reason. His arrival unleashes the greatest panic attack from the movie's extras, because of his menacing stature. But in the viewers' case, they can't help themselves from smiling and laughing when they see that surreal giant walking in the streets of Manhattan, even if they know that this monster is not so much different from Godzilla, save for the hideous and repulsing appearance.<br/><br/>So ""Ghostbusters"" is technically innovating, comically revealing, but it's globally some really tasty entertainment that everybody will be able to appreciate. Everyone will be able to find at least one element that will satisfy them. Those who love spectacle and eye-popping sequences will be delighted by the special effects. Others will respond to Bill Murray's lines with an inescapable smile. And let's not forget the eponymous theme song from Ray Parker, Jr. that will play in the heads of people long after they've seen the film.<br/><br/>So, twenty-five years later, we can still watch ""Ghostbusters"" without telling ourselves that this picture comes from another era. The majority of the special effects have aged well, even if some of the moves from the demonic dogs begin to look like those created by Ray Harryhausen for ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"". So, it's still easy to love the movie, just like if it was just being released.<br/><br/>Since the first silent movies of the early 20th century, there have been a lot of comedies that were created. But among those which tried to insert big-budget special effects to counterbalance their comic moments, ""Ghostbusters"" is among the best, if it's not THE best. It's really some pure crazy fun."
"cindy-346","8","4","6","4 March 2008"," A massively underrated masterpiece
","""Ghostbusters"" is just one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life. Although I can't think of a person who hasn't already. Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.<br/><br/>I think the power of ""Ghostbusters"" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.<br/><br/>The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.<br/><br/>Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular. For some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Yet ""Ghostbusters"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and is one of those movie's I have fond childhood memories of."

","Still very much a classic and favorite of mine, after all these years. Bill Murray is still the film's resident scene stealer.<br/><br/>His Peter Venkman is a fantastically sardonic opportunist, he falls just short of being both nasty & sleazy. He spends half of the film trying to get Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett into bed. ""I'll take Miss Barret back to her apartment and check her out."" The lethargic, laid-back manner with which he greets unimaginable confrontations provides some of the film's best moments: particularly his first 'contact' with ""Slimer"" and of course the scenes at a possessed Dana's apartment. "" I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.......Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule..."" Another strength of the film is the way it balances the comedy and terror. Years later, there are still some pretty frightening scenes. I'd easily count the scenes where both Dana and Louis (Rick Moranis) are both attacked.<br/><br/>I swear every single year, there is some rumor about them re-making this film........."

Determined to continue their practice they set up a business that investigates and removes paranormal activity from ""haunted"" places. After initial difficulties their popularity skyrockets after ridding a hotel of a ghastly nuisance. However, it isn't long before an ancient evil, prophesied by the Baylonians, threatens to make its way into our world through New York City. That's when things really heat up.<br/><br/>The result is a ridiculously entertaining movie that's part serious, part funny, but in the end, just seriously funny. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and the whole cast, but especially Murray, give highly amusing performances under an admittedly impressive (for those days) direction by Ivan Reitman. By now, acting for blue screen and managing multiple locations in the form of sound stages comes with the territory for making a spectacle science fiction fare, but that art we now take for granted wasn't nearly as developed in 1984 and this film does a really good job. Featuring the finest in pre-digital special effects, whose limitations are quite apparent, but that is all part of the fun in watching a classic.<br/><br/>Also, of note, is the story, which is quite well thought out and developed for a goofy movie like this. While it has an overall lighthearted and amusing appeal throughout, many of the elements are things that would make ""weird fiction"" master H.P. Lovecraft proud. It is just genre bending fun for all. 8/10 <br/><br/>Rated PG for scary stuff and mild profanity"

","GHOSTBUSTERS was a smashing and innovative 1984 comedy that was the perfect blending of clever comedy, eye-popping special effects, and supernatural silliness that was one of the biggest box office smashes of the year and deservedly so. Three professors doing college research on the supernatural lose their funding and decide to go into business for themselves as paranormal investigators. Bill Murray towers over all with his near perfect comic performance as Dr. Peter Venkman, a sort of wise ass guy who doesn't take this ghostbusting stuff seriously until they start making real money. Dan Aykroyd is a charmer as Ray, ""the heart of the Ghostbusters"" and Harold Ramis, who would gain greater fame as a director, generates real laughs here as Egon (""I collect spores, moles, and fungus."") Sigourney Weaver makes an intelligent and refreshing damsel in distress and Rick Moranis steals every scene he's in as Weaver's nerdy neighbor who also becomes part of the story as we learn the apartment building where Weaver and Moranis live is on top of some ancient burial ground. Annie Potts (DESIGNING WOMEN) also scores as the guys' secretary and William Atherton is funny as an EPA exec out to ruin the Ghostbusters. But it is mostly Murray's beautifully flippant performance laid against some awesome (for 1984) special effects that made this movie work. It even has a very catchy title tune that became a top ten smash for Ray Parker, Jr. An instant comedy classic and deservedly so."
"Snake-666","9","4","6","6 June 2003"," One of the greatest family/comedy movies ever made!
","Ghost Busters is quite possibly director Ivan Reitman's finest hour (and forty minutes)! Written by stars Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd, Ghost Busters' is a rollercoaster ride of awesome special effects and intelligent humour which features the undeniable talents of Bill Murray as the sarcastic, but loveable character of Dr. Peter Venkman.<br/><br/>After being thrown out of the University at which Ray Stantz (Akroyd), Egon Spengler (Ramis) and Peter Venkman are scientists and researchers they decide to put years of their research and thousands of dollars into starting up their own business  Ghost Busters. To begin with it seems that this risk will not pay off for them as they run out of money and Venkman's attempts at romance irritate their only customer, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). However this all changes when they get their first big job, after that they're the talk of the town! Unfortunately, there are some people who aren't very impressed with the Ghost Busters and seek to shut them down.<br/><br/>This film stands out amongst the movies of the Eighties, and indeed the movies of all time, as being one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and that is a reputation it quite rightly deserves. Unlike many of the movies I watched as a child this is one of the rare movies that I still love now as an adult. The jokes are still as funny, the action is still as exciting, the movie is still as watchable and the genius storytelling is still undeniable. <br/><br/>This movie appeals to me on two levels. There are the immature and rather childish jokes and moments of the film that although are funny they require little thought. On top of this we have some rather intelligent and more adult jokes that as a child I didn't catch on to, as an adult it helps me appreciate the movie all the more. Bill Murray is at his best in this movie, delivering sharp and witty one-liners as if they just rolled off his tongue. Dan Akroyd also provides a great comedy element to the movie in the form of the brilliantly minded scientist, but socially slow Ray Stantz. Ray's behaviour provides much enjoyment and this accompanied by Bill Murray's excellent performance makes Ghost Busters' one of the greatest comedy films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett works perfectly as the romantic interest for Venkman and this is complimented by Weaver and Murray's performance on screen together. Despite the obvious absurdity of the central plotline the Dana/Peter relationship storyline works out very well and allows us to see a more sensitive side to Venkman. All of this helps in adding realism to an otherwise unrealistic film.<br/><br/>The special effects are something else that must be praised, they have certainly stood the test of time and I would even venture to say they have stood up better than the Eighties other Special FX-Extravaganza Poltergeist'. I've heard a few negative remarks about them but I find them to be very effective even to this day.<br/><br/>I have to say that I recommend this film to everyone, there is so much to it and the movie works on so many levels that it has to be seen. If you haven't seen this movie yet I would check it out as soon as possible because I think it is one of the greatest films of all time. My rating for Ghost Busters'  9.5/10"

Admittedly I must confess that I am slightly biased. I was two when this was made and therefore I have grown up with it. Some of my early memories involve Ghostbusters. I officially got the video for my fifth birthday, however I snuck an early look at my birthday presents and pinched the unwrapped video, which means that I have been watching this film for twelve years through bad times and good times. Whenever I was glum it was there to cheer me up. Whenever I was bored it was there to entertain me. It's mix of comedy, fantasy, sci-fi and horror means that there is always something new to pick up on and to enjoy especially when watching the original widescreen version. Which leads me onto the superb DVD. I live in England and import many DVDs from America but none have ever excited me as much as the Ghostbusters one. The remastered widescreen print, the 5.1 channel sound, the live commentary, the deleted scenes, the OK OK I'll shut up now. I like, no... I love this film, if you haven't seen it - watch it - you will love it too. If you know someone who doesn't like it spurn them, mock them, if you really must then sympathise with them but most of all, the single most important thing is - try and convert them."

","This movie about three university professors of parapsychology who open their own ghost-hunting business after being turfed by the university isn't the greatest comedy I've ever come across. To be honest it isn't even close. But it is a fun little movie, if a little bit over-rated, featuring a solid cast and a good story.<br/><br/>Everyone does a good job of treating the material seriously enough to make this funny, and pretty much everyone (with the possible exception of Rick Moranis) seems to be playing this ""straight."" I suppose one of the weaknesses I see with this movie is just that - everyone's too much of a ""straight man."" The end result was that I smiled a lot during the movie, and chuckled a few times, but never really burst out laughing at anything.<br/><br/>The major stars (Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, etc.) all moved on to other projects over the ensuing years and, in my opinion, to better performances as well. If that sounds like a criticism, it really isn't. They were all fine in ""Ghostbusters."" It's just that I think their better performances were ahead of them. The one exception might be Moranis, who I mentioned earlier. He is very funny here as the geeky accountant Louis Tully, who is infatuated with Weaver's Dana Barrett, but is also frustrated that she doesn't return his feelings, until, of course, the two get together in the spirit world. Moranis, I think, did some of his best work here. Unfortunately, it was in a limited role.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant movie to watch and there's nothing particularly wrong with it.

But a wittier script by Bill Murray would have helped. <br/><br/>In other words, I can take it or leave it--that's exactly how I felt when this comedy was over. Sure, there were some fun moments with Rick Moranis as a nosy neighbor and I'll admit Murray and Dan Ackroyd have some good one-liners. Then too, Sigourney Weaver is amusing as the gal with a fridge from hell, but by the time the overlong story got to its mindblowing conclusion, I was longing for ""The End"" to appear on the screen.<br/><br/>Not my cup of tea as comedies go.

Ghostbusters. The university didn't like their theories about catching ghosts and their studies, so they say, ""screw you"" and they're off to become famous celebrities of their art. The police even like them, and they are making some good success. Who doesn't like them? The EPA, and when they shut down the storage of ghosts, something goes wrong to their building, and when one client still hasn't had her problem solved, something goes wrong, too. Two problems collide and the Ghostbusters have to leave jail to the request of the mayor to solve them. How did they get in jail? Find out yourself.<br/><br/>This was a very silly movie, and while some things are too intense to even have this PG rating, which I think they should still change, go ahead and watch. An 80s classic that will blow you away, and maybe make you understand the Ghostbuster parodies you might see on some of your favorite TV shows."
"barnabyrudge","6","6","11","13 September 2007"," Loud and brash supernatural comedy, greatly bolstered by in-form comic performances.
","A considerable box office hit in 1984, Ghostbusters is a simple-minded and very American supernatural comedy that provides quite a lot of entertainment if you don't expect anything too profound of it. This is a film that exists as enjoyment for its own sake  there is no wider intention beyond mixing laughter and spectacle in an appealing way. The film could have been instantly forgettable in less assured hands, but director Ivan Reitman deserves credit for pushing the right buttons. He is helped out immeasurably by the comic talents of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis  all four are in uncommonly good form throughout this film, and it's their funny interaction and clever sense of timing that makes numerous scenes stick long in the memory.<br/><br/>Three parapsychologists are thrown off campus after bringing themselves into disrepute. Driven by unemployment to take drastic measures, they set up a ghost hunting business. The mismatched trio comprises of enthusiastic Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), technical boffin Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), and incompetent faker Pete Venkman (Bill Murray) who has virtually no scientific understanding but coasts by pretending that he has. Under the name ""Ghostbusters"", they prove a surprising success as they ride around New York responding to ghost sightings and capturing the spectral critters. One lady, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), phones them from a high-rise apartment block after undergoing a weird supernatural experience in her kitchen. When the Ghostbusters arrive, everything in her apartment is back to normal, but Venkman  ever the womaniser  takes a shine to their latest client. Only later does it become clear that Dana's apartment is built over an ancient gateway and is about to become the scene of an invasion of demonic forces. The Ghostbusters find the world turning to them to save the future of mankind when all the malevolent spirits converge.<br/><br/>Murray makes the best of his role, using deadpan delivery to ensure his lovable liar is the film's most endearing character. Moranis comes a close second as Dana's hopelessly dim neighbour, a small insignificant mouse of a man who ends up working for the forces of evil after being possessed. The film relies heavily on special effects and, generally-speaking, they are cleverly done (especially for the time). In fact, the film was nominated for an Oscar for its Visual Effects. The ghosts blend fairly seamlessly into the live action, and characters like the destructive Slimer and the gigantic Marshmallow Man are brought inventively to life. The story (by Akroyd and Ramis) tends towards broad slapstick, but it's an epic sort of slapstick that takes the genre to staggering, destructive and spectacular levels. Murray does manage to sneak in a few sly, underplayed gags that are wittier than the demands of the film overall. In summary:- Ghostbusters is brash, broad, and overblown. but a lot of fun!"

","NYC is inundated with ghosts, leading to steady employment for a trio of ghost busters. This is supposed to be a comedy, but there's hardly anything here that's worth a chuckle. The script is meant to deliver both thrills and laughs, but fails miserably on both fronts. To paraphrase the only piece of dialog that is even mildly amusing here: this film is witless - it's true; it has no wit. Aykroyd and Ramis co-wrote the uninspired script and gave themselves boring straight-man roles. Murray is supposed to be the funny one and he tries to enliven things, but he's given little to work with. The special effects are cheesy and this lame film rambles on far too long."
"fredprincess","5","11","24","14 October 2006"," 80's movie, it's that simple
","Ghostbusters is an 80's movie through and through. It has an odd set up for the plot, and some typical characters pop up throughout. These three parapsychology professors get canned from their job (Murray, Ramis, Aykroyd), and decide to start a ghost catching business based on hardly any data, and with virtually no funding. After they get up and running, things get ugly when the environmentalist steps in and demands they be shut down. Well, the fragile ghost holding tank does get turned off, and guess what, chaos ensues (you have to watch the movie to find out, because I'm not telling). The sub-plot is very strange, because all these released ghosts are really going to be a part of the great Gozer's plan that started with the Hitites in 6000 B.C. What is that about? I found the plot to be a bit confusing, the characters ill-developed, and there were some definite lags in dialog. But, the movie also had some very funny scenes, and light-hearted feel, and a very large marshmallow (gotta see that part). I also found the secretary (Potts) to be a source of comic relief.<br/><br/>The characters I felt were typical were the evil business guy who tries to shut down the ghostbusters, the sexy, girl next door lead (Weaver) whom the sleazy professor (Murray) wants a piece of, and her dorky neighbor (Moranis) who just can't catch a break. The typical plot was that the evil guy shuts down business, and from there things get ugly. Overall, the movie is worth a watch, and theme song is very catchy. But it is not going to be a part of my DVD collection any time soon."

I remember it has having some really impressive fireworks, fast-paced action, funny repartee, good characters... Gosh, in fact it's pretty lame! Just like in Star Trek, when the final showdown between the good guys and the bad guys is taking place, they sort of just stand around there, cracking weak jokes, and then shooting off some low-budget flames.<br/><br/>It's weird how some movies can stay fresh forever while some go stale quickly.

Another great classic film from the 80s."
"kira02bit","9","5","9","22 July 2016"," Rare successful blend of comedy and visual effects
","Watching the trailers for Ghostbusters back in 1984, one could be forgiven for dismissing it as a silly looking, overextended Saturday Night Live or SCTV sketch. One would have been wrong. Which is why when the film actually came out, it unexpectedly became the surprise smash of the year and a much beloved comedic classic.<br/><br/>The film opens when three parapsychologists (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis) are dismissed from their cushy positions at Columbia University and decide to go into business for themselves as Ghostbusters, ridding Manhattan of its problematic paranormal denizens. Their first client is classy high society concert musician Sigourney Weaver, who is dismayed to find a Sumerian deity living in her ice box. This ultimately builds into an apocalyptic battle atop her bizarre apartment complex.<br/><br/>Given the number of productions completely unable to meld the combination of successful comedic bits and dazzling special effects, the fact that Ghostbusters seems to flow so effortlessly and hits the mark so often is really quite astounding. People not interested in the comedy can actually enjoy the light-hearted action and effects, people not interested in the action can enjoy the comedy, and those who like both will have it made here. Plus, watching the film more than 30 years later, it manages to entertain new audiences as well as keep prior fans coming back for repeated viewings.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the film does not have a couple of minor nuisance issues. While the cast is by and large great, that is not to say they get equally funny material, which is a shame. Murray pretty much plays his usual persona of smug smart-ass in the lead role and he has a lot of fun material to back him up. He and Weaver have some amusing banter and chemistry, although the latter is largely forgotten for much of the middle section, before being allowed some fun comedic moments near the climax. While one must give a nod to the generosity of Aykroyd and Ramis in handing over nearly all of the funny material to Murray, I am not sure it was the wisest maneuver to give their own characters so little to do. Ramis (always an underrated comedic actor) at least doubles down on his world class deadpan as the most techno-savvy of the men, but poor Aykroyd really suffers for this sacrifice. Although no one comes off worse from this than Ernie Hudson, who is a late arrival as the last Ghostbuster, and literally has nothing to do other than be the token black guy.<br/><br/>Oddly, while the other three Ghostbusters are busy allowing Murray to steal the film, supporting players Rick Moranis (as Weaver's nerdy neighbor drawn into the mayhem) and Annie Potts (as the Ghostbusters' acerbic receptionist) make some really strong impressions. As do some of the bit players, with my personal favorite being whoever that old woman was who comes out of her apartment to investigate the racket made by the creature trashing Moranis' apartment and her reaction to it. Priceless! The film could have benefited from a central villain. The late arrival of a pasty William Atherton as an EPA agent out to close the GBs down just does not cut it. Largely, because Atherton essayed so many similar roles at the time and the thought of the EPA, which was a de-fanged government agency even in the 1980s (moreso today) as having any kind of clout to do much of anything is in itself a comical notion.<br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman has never been as assured behind the camera as with this film. The special effects are amazing and do not forget to be comical as well. It would have been so easy to just go for broke and ride out solely on the visual effects at the climax, but the film remembers to even keep the effects comical. Who can forget the first appearance of the destroyer of the world - the hilariously deranged sight of a giant marshmallow man laying waste to Manhattan? Or, for that matter, the introduction to the legendary Slimer ghost, which culminates in Murray's memorable line.<br/><br/>There is very little that does not work for this film and continue to do so decades later. And one can also not underestimate the added success of Ray Parker's catchy title tune. ""Who you gonna call?"""

The story of 3 guys fighting off ghost that have invaded New York is visually effective, a good story-line and was well written. The idea of the big Marshmallow Man at the end of the movie was very humorous and they could not have come up with a better villain.

","Something about this movie doesn't really gel for me anymore. It definitely used to be a movie I loved. I remember having a lunchbox with the logo on it. I remember even loving the second one. My latest rewatch of this was one of the strangest and flattest experiences I've had with a previously beloved movie.<br/><br/>I'll start with the biggest gripes: firstly, it's sloppy. Winston is an almost comical afterthought, and the whole absurd (and hastily dropped) story line with Peck is shoehorned into the movie because they'd written themselves into a corner with no way of linking the story line with Sigourney Weaver into the main narrative. The earthquake in front of the apartments just before the climax is pointless and only seems to be in the movie so it could reach the allotted running time. Secondly, and it pains me to say this, for the most part I don't find it funny. There are jokes that I enjoy, and Rick Moranis is so, so perfect, but it's just really not what I'm looking for anymore. Finally, I was bored, and that was the most surprising thing to me. In many cases the more I'm familiar with a movie or song the greater my love grows. In this case, it just left me waiting for the parts I thought I liked, which never seemed to come.<br/><br/>This sounds like a pretty negative review. I think that's just the disappointment talking. I didn't hate anything about this. There are scenes and performances that I really like. The ghosts and demons are fun. The theme song is my jam. It was just an empty experience when I thought it would be anything but. Though I certainly would prevent anyone from watching this if they were so inclined. I just wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone anymore."

Not only does Ghostbusters work as a piece of entertainment it captures New York during the political and social Reagan-era, a different time. <br/><br/>The ghost wrangling cast are excellent, Bill Murray gives a hilarious deadpan performance as the team come together. Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson offer great comic turns. The supporting cast are also strong, Sigourney Weaver is on fine form as Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis as Louis Tully and William Atherton as bureaucrat Walter Peck are particularly notably. Annie Potts is humorous as crabby but likable Janine Melnitz. Tully's crush on Barrett is humorously played out. Weaver gets to give a full range of emotion, right down to playing possessed. As well as eggs cooking on worktops and ghouls in fridges there's also a horrific scene where Barrett is gagged and dragged by evil hands across a room on a chair. Many of the effects still hold up and the optical ghosts remain eerie.<br/><br/>There's a perfect a blend of special effects and comedy, too many moments to mention, notable is the scene at the hotel where armed with their proton weapons the team go to capture a greedy ghost and Venkman gets slimed. Packed with quotable lines, Reitman offers paranormal and supernatural hi-jinks including demon dogs, skeletons, spectres as well as chuckles. Together Aykroyd and Ramis along with Reitman and crew not only deliver a great film but they forge some pop-culture equipment, the iconic Ecto-1 that the Ghostbusters use to travel, proton packs, the P.K.E. Meters, containment unit and the like.<br/><br/>From the New York Public Library where they encounter a elegant ghost that transforms into a horrifying spook, to the showdown against Gozer and the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the witty jokes, the chemistry on screen and the effects are magical.

"lee_eisenberg","10","3","5","27 July 2005"," The first time that I ever watched this movie, it scared me (don't worry; I later found it funny).
","When I was about 3 and 4, I used to watch ""The Real Ghostbusters"" on TV. When I was 7, I noticed that my parents had a video tape that said ""Ghostbusters"". I asked them if I could watch it, and they said yes.<br/><br/>The first thing that threw me off was that it was black and white. Moreover, it was clearly not a cartoon. The lion statue outside the library probably confused me further. Then, after the woman saw the ghost in the library basement, I could only interpret the movie as scary. Literally every scene invoked fear in me, especially the monster in the refrigerator. By the time that it was over, I thought to myself ""I'm never watching that again."" Then, when I was 9, my mom convinced me to give it a second chance. So, I watched ""Ghostbusters"" again, and I laughed my head off. I felt so idiotic for having gotten scared by something so hilarious. As everyone knows, the story has Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) battling spooks in New York, and they have to go up against an ancient evil god. Among the supporting characters, one finds musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and dorky Louis Tully (Rick Moranis).<br/><br/>Probably what embarrassed me the most about getting scared by ""Ghostbusters"" was the fact that I didn't even interpret Louis Tully and his mishaps. The first time that I watched the movie, I literally did not realize that his character was there.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a veritable comedy classic. It was like nothing that had ever come before. With a catchy theme song (that I play every Halloween), this is a movie that's impossible not to like.<br/><br/>Oh, and I should probably explain the ""black and white"" part. When my parents taped ""Ghostbusters"" off of the TV, it was in color on the TV but it came out black and white on the tape. My parents have never been able to figure that out, so their only explanation is that the tape was haunted. If so, then this was the perfect movie to record onto it."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","3","5","31 October 2000"," Ghosts! They're real!
","Let me begin my review with a frank statement. I am sick of people calling Ghostbusters 'the funniest comedy of all time'. Why? Because I never once saw Ghostbusters as a comedy. As a young kid, as a teenager, and as an adult I always saw this film as 'a supernatural thriller with humor'.<br/><br/>It's not shot, edited, performed, scored, or designed as a comedy. No way! Aykroyd's genuine interest in the paranormal is where the idea for the movie began. When he teamed with Harold Ramis to write the script there's no doubt in my mind that his intended tone was serious, but with touches of light relief (mainly from Venkman and Louis). Listen carefully to the dialogue, it's peppered with loads of credible scientific jargon and multiple cryptic references of almost Lovecraftian lore. This serious subtext weighs the film down in the thriller category more than comedy.<br/><br/>The trio (and soon quartet) begin as researchers at Columbia University in NYC. But Venkman, only in it for an easy scam, ends up getting them thrown off campus. Ray and Egon have a plan for catching and eliminating paranormal threats to the public. With Venkman's conman skills, they take a chance and found 'Ghostbusters' in a derelict firehouse. Business is pitiful until Dana Barrett shows up claiming a voice from another dimension spoke to her through her fridge. Venkmen, enchanted by her, goes to her apartment to check her/it out. He finds nothing, unaware that behind her fridge is a secret doorway to a rooftop temple built as the venue point for Gozer, a destructive inter-dimensional traveler.<br/><br/>Almost every aspect of Ghostbusters is honed to perfection. Ivan Reitman has never directed a better film. Elmer Bernstein's sumptuous score (often overshadowed by Ray Parker Junior's pop song) is utterly bewitching. The effects, while old-school, don't date the film one bit. The chemistry between the cast is wonderful, you actually believe that these guys have known each other for years. The fact that Harold Ramis plays the deadpan, deadly serious Egon despite having directed Caddyshack and Vacation (two of the most anarchic films ever) gives the chemistry a nice edge, since beneath the serious exterior you know he's actually the maddest one of the lot.<br/><br/>However, I WILL complain about one thing (though it is relatively minor). I understand that movies need to be tightly edited to stop the audience from nodding off (but no one possibly could with Ghostbusters), but Reitman's last-minute tinkering renders a large chunk of the film senseless. It begins as soon as Winston arrives. He claims to the Mayor that he's worked with the company for a couple of weeks, but within the timeline of the movie he's only worked for them for a single day. Venkman's impromptu meeting with Dana at Lincoln Center is badly pasted on over Winston's 'interview'. Venkman arrives at the firehouse covered in slime, warps to Dana without slime, arranges a date for Thursday (which actually appears to be later that same night), before warping back to the firehouse, slime intact for his confrontation with Walter Peck (William Atherton, who has been typecast ever since).<br/><br/>The original flow of the film included a scene at Fort Detmerring in which Ray and Winston investigate alone. Part of this scene is in the final product (Ray's encounter with a female ghost while dressed as a General) and the scene where Ray and Winston discuss the end of the world was actually their trip back from this scene. With this complete sequence intact, and the surrounding scenes rearranged, the timeline of the film would have made much more sense. Ivan Reitman has shown this complete version as private screenings, but I doubt the public will ever get to see it. The closest you will get is Richard Mueller's novelization 'Ghostbuster's: The Supernatural Spectacular'. You can hunt it down, but it's very expensive.<br/><br/>With much of Winston's screen time cut back, the character almost becomes largely redundant. Thankfully, he was developed more in the animated series and the sequel. And, redundant or not, it just wouldn't be the same without him.<br/><br/>I'm not one for nostalgia, but 80s kitsch aside, Ghostbusters truly will stand the test of time forever. It's an absolute classic that'll never get old and truly deserves to be up there with the best of them."

","Released in 1984 and directed by Ivan Reitman, ""Ghostbusters"" chronicles events when three former parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis) set up shop in Manhattan as a curious specter removal service. Annie Potts plays their secretary while Ernie Hudson hires on as one of the team. Sigourney Weaver appears as the wannabe girlfriend of one of the ghostbusters (Murray) while Rick Moranis plays her geeky neighbor down the hall. <br/><br/>There's always been some confusion about ghosts: Are they the disembodied souls (life forces) of dead people stuck on this plane? Are they 'flashes from the past'? Or are they demons (aka fallen angels or evil spirits) deceiving people into thinking they're 'ghosts'? ""Ghostbusters"" interestingly addresses all three, sort of, which I found interesting. It's an amusing horror comedy with a classic early 80's cast and soundtrack. The F/X are well-done for the time, although quaint today, which I suppose is part of the movie's charm. <br/><br/>Yet I think the high ratings are largely due to nostalgia because I wasn't entertained nearly as much as I thought I'd be. ""Men in Black"" (1997) took this prototype and arguably made a better film. Still, ""Ghostbusters"" is a fun, iconic flick and certainly worth checking out if its attributes trip your trigger. <br/><br/>The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles with studio stuff done in Burbank, California.

","Ghostbusters is proof that it doesn't matter how absurd or outlandish the premise of your movie is, if you have intelligent writing and humour.<br/><br/>As the movie was written by two of it's main actors, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, the premise comes across as something that two little boys would write when they dream of being superheroes when they grow up. <br/><br/>Three parapsychologists (Nerdy Egon, well-meaning and enthusiastic but bumbling Ray and sarcastic joker Peter) are fired from their cushy jobs as researchers at a New York university and decide to go into business for themselves.<br/><br/>They are joined later by a fourth member of the team, Winston who is not as prominent a character as the other three (his role was allegedly reduced when they couldn't get Eddie Murphy to play him) which is a shame because he arguably gets some of the funniest and most memorable lines in the movie. I still crease up with laughter when he, as the only black Ghostbuster tells the mayor, ""I've seen s*** that'll turn you WHITE!""<br/><br/>For me, the charm of Ghostbusters lies in the details; they get about town in a hearse and use an abandoned New York fire station as their base. A lesser movie wouldn't have put any thought or effort into these details.<br/><br/>The movie is sometimes unfairly classed as a children's movie, and sure, everyone I know who watched Ghostbusters as a child loved the big showdown with the giant Stay-Puft Marshmallow man at the end, but our heroes smoke, drink, swear and even indulge in a little adult fantasy humour. <br/><br/>It's actually one of the few movies that not only held up but improved upon watching it as an adult."
"ResidentEvil2Fan","10","2","3","12 November 2014"," The funniest movie I've ever seen
","This movie is just so hilarious from beginning to end. The screenplay is wrote so brilliantly by Harold Ramis, but he also allowed room in the script for the ad-libbing that the movie has become known for. To add to Ramis' contribution to the movie, he played Egon Spengler, the nerdy Ghostbuster that delivered the majority of his lines in a nasally dead-pan tone unless angered. The directing of this movie was brilliant and Ivan Reitman did a fine job in allowing the actors and actresses all the flexibility they wanted with the script and his added ,and sometimes very forgotten voice roles as Zuul and Slimer. And I will not leave Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, William Atherton, and David Marguiles either since they contributed to it in so many ways that it would take too long to list them all. This is, without a doubt, the funniest film I've ever seen because everything that could be done to make it funny without going into childish humor was done it seemed like."
"megancedwards","9","2","3","16 September 2014"," Classic!
","Ghostbusters (or Ghost Busters, not sure which since the two movies both seem to use different spellings for their own name which drives me nuts for some reason) is a comedy classic and a perfect marriage of spooky ghost movies with comedy. As much as I loved Scooby Doo when I was a kid I loved Ghostbusters even more. Bill Murray is at his perfect comedy best in this movie.<br/><br/>It is too bad the sequel is not nearly as good (in my opinion) but we will always have this classic original to watch and it holds up all these years later.<br/><br/>RIP Harold Ramis!"
"manitobaman81","7","2","3","18 August 2014"," Good
","I like all of the comedians in Ghostbusters. One could say that Ghostbusters is built on a firm base. The acting is very effective. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It starts in New York City. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent. Sounds corny? It's meant to be goofy. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose."

","For years my wife has quoted phrases from this movie at me, such as ""Don't give me those bug-eyes Janine!"", to ""Are you a god?, No, then die!"" and ""It just popped in there"", so, with only this and my liking of the sprightly theme song by Ray Parker Jr to go on, I finally tuned in to watch it. The thing is too, that I usually bypass most popular culture from the 80's (the decade that taste forgot), for instance I've never watched ""Ghost"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Top Gun"" or ""E.T."" and won't be rushing to in the near future, there are far too many earlier movies I've still to see. But hey, I really enjoyed this unusual mix of frat comedy and supernatural / science fiction thrills.<br/><br/>I liked the three amigo scientists right away, the womanising Bill Murray, earnest Dan Ayckroyd and professorial Ivan Reitman. Sigourney Weaver adds the sexiness (eventually) and Rick Moranis outdoes the three busters in geekiness as Weaver's lovelorn neighbour. The natural landscape of New York is effectively blended in, the special effects are fine for their day and the script delivers excitement and humour in equal measure.<br/><br/>Not every idea from the Saturday Night Live team hit the jackpot but this one certainly deserved to, helped by an offbeat idea with broad appeal, a good script and a nice story arc which not only delivers a big finish but also sees Murray get the girl.<br/><br/>Call again!"

","Let me set the perfectly assembled cast aside... let me set the effects aside... And concentrate on how Ivan Reitman orchestrated the tale of three reject paranormal investigators and an unemployed desperate man whom decide to make a business saving humanity from ghosts in the great style of common pest exterminators. One of the aspects that makes this genius is how the film brands itself all while the loony entrepreneurs brand there business with an annoyingly catchy Ghostbusters song, old hertz turned company vehicle and the old fire station turned into ghost headquarters. Add to the mix their first and most important client played by Sigourney Weaver whom questions her sanity not because of the ghosts she sees in her Manhattan flat but because she decided to employ these silly men whom call themselves Ghostbusters..<br/><br/>Lets say this was a film fitted for its time and that is that.

","Three unemployed parapsychologists set up a business in New York City as a unique ghost removal service.<br/><br/>A hilarious and ground breaking film that has not only stood the test of time but still resonates firmly with many viewers to this day. A classic comedy film with a bit of horror and action elements to it. Bill Murray and cast does a wonderful job portraying there characters. This film spawned a sequel and many fans clamor for another. The story is original, and the pacing follows suit, the dead pan and dry wit comedy of the film makes this film not only charming but a great comedy with an original concept. I highly recommend this film and one of my favorite films of all time. Crossing several different genres, from comedy, horror and action this film has a little bit of everything for everyone. A film that can be enjoyed by children to adults alike. This film will fill you with laughter as well as some instances will add to the tension of the supernatural story."

","""Ghostbusters"" is what I think one of the best movies of the 1980s, and and still stands out as one of the best movies overall even today. Scientists Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) get canned of their positions a New York City university and, as a result, they find their new workplace in an old firehouse and study the paranormal there, turning themselves into the Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>With all the romance, drama, comedy, war and science-fiction movies in Hollywood, it is refreshing to see a movie that blends in adventure, humor and horror at the same time, all focusing on the paranormal. In this film, it is fun to see the Ghostbusters trying to rid the city of pesky ghosts, goblins and poltergeists, and then facing the ultimate ghoul of all in a portal to another world, where untold evil is threaten to be released.<br/><br/>The special effects for the ghosts were nicely done - believable and creepy at the same time. Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis did a great job on the story - exciting, adventurous and humorous. And, Ivan Reitman did a great job directing, providing us with a movie with a solid plot and story and character development.<br/><br/>Composer Elmer Bernstein provided a catchy music score, and the famous ""Ghostbusters"" song is sung by Ray Parker Jr. in this movie, making it one of the most recognizable piece of music in the world. In addition, the ghosts Slimer and the Marshmellow Man are also introduced in this movie and became some of the most iconic and recognizable movie characters.<br/><br/>A great movie overall that has come to symbolize the 1980s, but has stood well through the test of time - one I would watch over and over again.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","Ghost Busters (or Ghostbusters I can honestly never really tell which one of those spellings is actually supposed to be the correct or preferred one) is one of the best comedy movies of all time. This is the kind of movie that made Bill Murray famous and vice versa as he was made to play this role. He is so smarmy and hilarious in this movie almost everything he says makes me laugh out loud even today and I have seen this movie I'm not kidding probably at least 20 times now. My friends and I watch it and we can say most of the lines along with the characters. This is an all time classic movie and I hope they do a third one and that it does not suck!"

","This is one of my favorite movies. Three college professors who study paranormal happenings get fired from the University. They decide to start their own business catching ghosts. They go from a joke to New York heroes. It's also an incredibly funny movie. Bill Murray plays a sarcastic, and humorous scientist called Dr. Peter Venkman. Dan Akroyd plays Dr. Ray Stanz, he acts like a little kid but he's an incredibly technical speaker. Harold Ramis plays Dr. Egon Spengler. Egon is the human encyclopedia of the group. Later in the film they are joined by Winston Zeddemorre played by Ernie Hudson, he's the cool one. As funny as it is, I would not recommend it to kids who are easily scared. Otherwise go see it."

","Director Ivan Reitman has created one of the funniest comedies of the 80s. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis played three professors studying the paranormal. When they get kicked out of university, they start a business to fight ghosts.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is at his sarcastic best. The guys' chemistry is superb. The three guys fit each other perfectly. Murray is the loud mouth. Ramis is the nerdy brain. And Aykroyd is the nice guy to glue everybody together. On top of the three leads, they have Sigourney Weaver who is a viable partner for Murray to spar with. She's not just a dumb hottie. Her persona could actually take on Murray in everyway.<br/><br/>The jokes are hilarious even after all these years. I still laugh whenever I catch it on TV. That's the biggest test of any comedies.<br/><br/>Don't cross the streams!"
"Woodyanders","10","2","3","13 September 2009"," Still hilarious and immensely entertaining after all these years
","I first saw this film in a theater at age twelve way back in 1984. I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it a great deal. I vividly recall the audience roaring with laughter at regular intervals. Well, I rewatched this movie after having not seen it for at least fifteen years and boy did it ever hold up. It's partly because of the witty and ingenious blending of a Lovecraftian the end of the world as beget by ancient and powerful phantasmagoric beings premise with a delightfully broad and playful sense of infectiously irreverent and anarchic humor, partly because the special effects are extremely impressive and accomplished even by today's more sophisticated standards (the gluttonous Slimer in particular is a splendidly disgusting wow!), partly because the movie breezes along at a brisk clip without any dreary lulls, and mainly because it's just so much incredibly off-the-wall absurdist fun.<br/><br/>The cast is sheer perfection: Bill Murray lands a plumb part as the lovably smarmy Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd is likewise excellent as the overzealous Dr. Raymond Stantz, Harold Ramis plays it suitably solemn and humorless as the deliciously dour Dr. Egon Spengler, Sigourney Weaver is simply ravishing as fetching musician and appealing love interest Dana Barret (and man is she smoking hot when she becomes possessed by the lascivious spirit of the evil, yet enticing Zuul), Rick Moranis exquisitely nerds it up as hopelessly dweeby accountant Louis Tully, Annie Potts adds considerable spark as sarcastic secretary Janine Melnitz, Ernie Hudson is quite engaging as the easygoing Winston Zeddmore, and William Atherton makes for a marvelously smug foil as obnoxious EPA jerk Walter Peck. Ivan Reitman's deft direction maintains an appropriately zany tone throughout while tossing in plenty of neat throwaway gags and culminating in one rousing doozy of a pull out all the stops crazy apocalyptic climax. Among the choice gut-busting moments are our protagonists attempting to nab a pesky ghost at a library, the Ghostbusters corny TV commercial, our boys' first assignment at a posh New York hotel, Stantz's erotic dream, and the first appearance of a giant deadly marshmallow man. Kudos are also in order for the first-rate rockin' soundtrack, with Mick Smiley's hypnotic ""Magic"" rating as an especially awesome tune. Elmer Bernstein supplies a fantastic spooky and spirited score. Laszlo Kovacs' glossy cinematography makes fine use of the widescreen format. Popping up in nifty bits are Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, ""Playboy"" Playmate Kymberly Herrin, slinky Russian beauty Slavitza Jovan (as Gozer), Deborah Gibson, and even notorious porn star Ron Jeremy. But what really clinches this picture's status as an all-time classic 80's winner is its exceptionally inspired and energetic sense of blithely ridiculous merriment. A total treat."

They go into business for themselves by tracking and exterminating supernatural spirits all over New York City, and unexpectedly turn into an overnight sensation. As with most lucrative business endeavors, they're forced to deal with lawsuits, scheduling conflicts, public criticism, and worst of all the forthcoming of a dreadful and potent evil. Refreshingly original, high-tech, snappy sci-fi comedy with imaginative visual effects, likable characters, and hoards of unconventional, screwball laughs.

","I loved the movie as a child and even watched the cartoon that somehow turned Slimer into a good guy. Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures.<br/><br/>The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straight man, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly.<br/><br/>In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper. Then there are Annie Potts as the token New Yorker secretary and Ernie Hudson, the only ghostbuster without a Dr. in his name that keeps the group grounded and keeps thing in perspective from a regular guy's point of view.<br/><br/>The movie itself maybe not be as quote worthy as other 80's classics and some of the CG has not stood the test of time (where George Lucas when you need him) but the movie as a whole is still worth watching especially with Halloween coming up. So fire up the DVD and let the Ray Parker Jr. blare (which I don't think sounds anything like Huey Lewis' I Want a New Drug). And don't forget to roast some Staypuft Marshmallows over the fire."
"caspian1978","8","2","3","22 July 2004"," A Comedy Classic?
","Almost, the 1984 Blockbuster can now be considered a comedy classic. 20 years later, the move that was way before its time is still a delight for any audience. Many horror comedies fall short and can't find an audience. Ghost Busters is an original idea that wasn't too unique to make millions at the box office. Bill Murray adds to the genius of the movie as a modern day Charlie Chaplin with addition to slap stick and Flip Wilson humor. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Moranis complete the wild comedy that makes up Ghost Busters. While remaining to be somewhat serious, the film throws a series of jokes, gags and innocent humor that isn't found in many movies. Weaver had never been sexier whether she was fighting ghosts or aliens. A comedy that stands alone, Ghost Busters is great"
"bravesman1983","10","2","3","5 November 2003"," The Greatest Movie Ever
","Ghostbusters is by far the greatest movie in the history of modern cinema. It may seem corny at first, but in order to really appreciate it you have to watch it a few times.  Or a couple hundred, like me.  Bill Murray is great, providing the obvious jokes and sarcastic comments.  Dan Akyroid is great as well, but I think that Harold Ramis is the best in Ghostbusters.  You have to watch him and pay attention to what he says, or else you'll end up missing the funniest (yet most subtle) moments.  Add straight guy Ernie Hudson and 80s big time hottie Sigourney Weaver to the mix, and this cast is awesome.  The scene in the mayor's office........priceless.  Listening to Murray call the EPA guy Pecker instead of his real name Peck, wow.  ""Yes it's true.....this man has no dick.""  The funniest line in any movie ever, no matter how childish you may think it is."

Even the special effects (though slightly dated) were impressive.  It was atmospheric, funny, clever, and just a great experience.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone of any age.

He didn't need to hear the response. Would we make it in time for the last screening? Yes! We were actually allowed to go in whilst the preceding screeing was playing. It had already got up to the Ecto on the Brooklyn Bridge shot by then. We watched it all from there, and then watched the entire film again from the beginning. I was seven years old and that was the moment I fell in love with cinema.<br/><br/>The comedy/horror ever? Maybe (though American Werewolf In London comes close too). Certainly the most successful. The DVD release was an absolute godsend for any Ghostbusters fan and I thank the good people at Columbia for putting so many fantastic extras on it.<br/><br/>The greatest film of all time?

"departed07","10","2","3","23 June 2003"," A blend of comedy, horror and special effects that go together very well
","Ghostbusters came out in the summer of 1984 just before I was born and would later be a fan of the film along with its products as I got older with age.<br/><br/>The film's premise involves three scientist at a local college in New York where they get kicked out due to lack of funding and poor judgment. The leader of the trio is Dr. Peter Venkman (cool performance by Bill Murray) who not only experiments with people as part of his project, but if it's a seducing woman then Peter would do his best to get the girl. His life is basically sex, money and rock and roll while his two associates Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd delivering major punchlines) a free-spirited scientist that loves his work around the paranormal and Dr. Egon Spangler (Harold Ramis) a no non-sense scientist take their work serious and need to do something once they get kicked out of school. Peter decides that with their knowledge they could open up a business of getting rid of the paranormal after encountering a ghost in the library.<br/><br/>Somehow things don't go well until the three members (who are known as Ghostbusters) meet a woman by the name of Dana Barrett (Sigorney Weaver of ""Alien"" fame) who believes that her apartment is haunted after getting notice from a neighbor that her TV was turned on loud and didn't even know about it along with seeing a creature inside her refrigerator. Peter has taken interest in Dana Barrett while seeing that nothing is wrong in her apartment just before getting called into action as the Ghostbusters take their first job before being famous. With so much ghosts in the area of New York they hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) before more things come in their way from a pesky environmental agent (William Atherton) who wants to shut down the good guys while Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) get attacked by the spirits in the apartment where later all havoc breaks loose and it's up to the Ghostbusters to save the day.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" has three things that made the film successful: comedy, a spooky element and a special effects movie where they all work without letting the audience down. Bill Murray is classic where most of his lines will be forever be quoted by fans while at the same time blends comedy in the first act of the film while being serious in the second act when things get out of hand. Aykroyd and Ramis, who wrote the script, make sure they can write a comedy without losing the audience and be subtle at the same time with certain scenes. The spooky parts involving the monsters will more or less likely scare kids away while the special effects will have you begging for more."

"DapperDuck713","10","1","1","24 February 2020"," A Film of ""Biblical Proportions.""
","""Ghostbusters"" is one of the best and most iconic movies of the 1980s! It's brilliant core concept, quotable script and fantastic cast has cemented it as one of the most beloved comedies of our time!<br/><br/>Even after 34 years, a decent sequel and a controversial yet painfully forgettable reboot, ""Ghostbusters"" is still just as well-regarded and popular as it was when it was unleashed upon the world in 1984! There are many reasons why it remains a landmark in pop culture, the iconography, the song that will never leave your head and the fact that the film employs a perfect blend of humour and spooky moments, there is so much to love!<br/><br/>One of my favourite aspects of ""Ghostbusters"" is its original and creative premise. The story of blue-collar, ordinary people capturing extra-dimensional beings and Spector's is such an awesome and ingenious idea. Unlike the Men in Black, the Ghostbusters aren't specially trained agents, but average men who do their jobs not to save the world, but to get a paycheque (at least that's how they start out.) This unique plot makes ""Ghostbusters"" such a special and re-watchable film and gives the characters a relatability that makes them feel like real people.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast in ""Ghostbusters"" is absolutely incredible! Every actor gives the film their all, the excellent dialogue manages to balance scientific mumbo-jumbo with realistic speech that, as previously mentioned, makes the Ghostbusters act like people that you could meet in the real world.<br/><br/>I love every character in this amazing movie so it is almost impossible to decide who my favourite is! From the wise-cracking Peter Venkman (""Back off man, I'm a scientist."") to the loveable Ray Stanz (""Listen... you smell something?""), the deadpan Egon Spengler (""Sorry, Venkman, I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought"") and the sadly and often forgotten Winston Zeddmore (""This job is definitely not worth $11,500 a year."")
The excellent performances and razor-sharp script gives the team a level of comradery and bravado that makes their interplay so enjoyable!<br/><br/>The supporting cast are just as fantastic as the leading actors. The always stellar Sigourney Weaver and zany Rick Moranis provide more comedic situations for the filmmakers to play with and adds dimension to the movie's world.<br/><br/>For a film that was released 34 years ago, it is surprising how well the visual effects, production design and creature designs in ""Ghostbusters"" have held up.
The ghosts and spirits in this movie are so awesome; the unique aesthetic makes the world that these characters inhabit feel distinct when compared to every other supernatural films. Although I love Slimer, my absolute favourite apparition in ""Ghostbusters"" (and my favourite part of the movie) is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. He's visually striking, hilarious and downright amazing! I was shocked to learn recently that Mr Say Puft wasn't a real American mascot, but was created solely for this movie; I had always made the assumption that his inclusion in the story was simply an ingenious idea for product placement.<br/><br/>There are a long line of epic cinematic cars from the 1980s. Owning a vehicle such as the Bluesmobile from ""The Blues Brothers"", the time travelling DeLorean from the ""Back to the Future"" Trilogy and the Batmobile from Tim Burton's gothic 1989 hit ""Batman"", is the dream of many a movie fan. The Ecto-1 is just as striking and memorable as all of the previously mentioned automobiles, you can tell, just by looking at it, that the car can perform dozens of spook-catching functions. As with the DeLorean, the Ecto-1 looks like it was built in a shed/ garage, not on a conveyor belt, which means that the personality of the vehicle makes it a character in its own right, not just a prop.<br/><br/>On a quick note, the ""Ghostbusters"" logo is undoubtedly one of cinema's best. It's so simple yet so iconic, even before I'd seen the movie; I knew what ""Ghostbusters"" was.<br/><br/>One of the most recognized elements of this film is its ear-worm of a theme song! Everybody on planet Earth knows the ""Ghostbusters"" tune; I don't believe that the movie itself would be nearly as popular if it weren't for Ray Parker Jr.'s contribution!<br/><br/>I find it so amusing that at the time, ""Ghostbusters"" was considered to be a family film that all ages could enjoy. Whilst I don't dispute that kids can watch this film (as nearly all of us watched ""Ghostbusters"" as children) the fact that the movie contains an abundance of swearing, smoking, the greatest jump-scare ever filmed and occasional crude humour makes this a far more interesting watch than, say, ""High School Musical.""<br/><br/>To summarise, I absolutely love ""Ghostbusters!"" It's hilarious, cleverly written and one of the most quotable and iconic motion pictures of all time. I shudder to imagine a world without ""Ghostbusters""...

","The stand out definition of an actual ""timeless"" film. There is NO...WAY I can or could say enough about this film - cuz it IS that, a ""film"", not a ""movie"". ""Film"" stands the test of time & is the label given to a movie that is just more, & Ghostbusters is.
If you haven't seen this film you've apparently been under a rock for the past 35+ years!ðŸ˜‚ This film kinda wrongly gets labeled as a ""comedy"". While it does have its share of comedy, it was always 1st & foremost a scary/seriously taken film which is where the comedy comes from & makes the comedy work. The fact that the whole movie has a serious tone. Off topic for a second, this is why the main reason the 2016 movie didn't work...AT...ALL. Their frame of mind was it IS a comedy. Every single actor in that movie that had even the smallest role always tried to be funnier than the other person. There was pretty much ZER0 seriousness in the entire movie! Which is why the comedy '&' movie itself floped.
Back on topic, enough things happened just right to make this whole film work & make it the pop culture phenomenon. Whether it was thankfully that John Candy just couldn't understand & wrap his head around the role of Louis Tully, therefore Rick Moranis getting the part. Or in a kinda messed up way, the death of Jim Bellushi made it possible that Bill Murray filled that spot, originally made for Bellushi. Everything that had to happen happened to make it what it is.
I'm sorry & know this was supposed to be a review & part of this wasn't."

","While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, ""Ghostbusters"" is one good movie which I really enjoyed watching. However, I found it to be really full of sexual innuendos which I remembered from when I watched the movie as a kid. I am not a snowflake and I grew on far worse stuff, but PG rating for this movie seems a little bit off. Still, it's very good and fun, so what more can you ask from the movie about catching ghosts?

"bowmanblue","10","1","1","21 June 2019"," Never to be bettered
","'Ghostbusters' was one of those films where lightning just struck in all the right places and was - seemingly - impossible to recapture. The story is so simple that it's amazing no one ever tried to do it before - four men set up a business capturing ghosts. End of. It could have been awful. I'm pleased to say it was perfect.<br/><br/>Recently, I've read that all sorts of actors were attached the to the project before the final cast was signed. I don't know what it would be like with anyone but Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson (oh, and Sigourney Weaver is along for the ride, too - no bad thing to also have 'Ripley' on the cast list). They made a direct sequel which - sort of - worked (I liked it, but the popular consensus is that it was vastly inferior to its predecessor) and then a half remake/half reboot in 2016 (and the least said about that, the better). Neither direct attempts, nor any half-baked rip-offs ever lived up to the original and I doubt any ever will.<br/><br/>Like I say, it's first and (possibly main) selling point is its simplicity. We get to know all major characters straight away and none require any lengthy plot explanations to 'explain' who they are and their various motivations. The action (i.e. appearance of the ghosts) happens almost within the first quarter of an hour and this is probably as good a time as any to make mention of the special effects - they're pretty fantastic, not just for 1984, but - believe it or not - basically stand up to scrutiny to this day (okay, so the 'dogs' look a little 'stop motion,' but apart from that...).<br/><br/>I could say that the uber-catchy theme song and subsequent cry of ""Who you gonna' call?"" went some way to establish the film's hold on popular culture, but, ultimately, it wouldn't be anything without humour. The cast are - as mentioned - perfect and play off each other like few ensembles can ever do. Just as the special effects hole up today, so does the humour - effortlessly.<br/><br/>If you're looking for comedy - look no further. The fact that it's - loosely - sci-fi is secondary to the charm of its stars. In many of today's films (and I'm thinking of the Marvel movies, mainly) many lament the lack of a 'strong villain' for our heroes to go up against. Here, interestingly, there isn't really one central bad-guy to fight. I suppose you could argue that a pen-pushing civil servant who's constantly trying to shut the Ghostbusters down is a 'semi-baddie,' but the 'true' nasty doesn't really show up until the final act, but, that doesn't really matter. The film is perfect and will truly stand the test of time. I can't see today's generation being any the less taken with its brilliance."

"SimonJack","8","1","1","23 June 2018"," Comedy film spoofing with the spooks
","Comedians Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have fun in this 1984 film as ""Ghostbusters."" They are booted out of Columbia University where they've had their own parapsychology research office. <br/><br/>Murray's Dr. Peter Venkman is some sort of bogus parapsychologist. He plays at tests to study telepathy and similar mental games. But, he's mostly interested in female students. Aykroyd's Dr. Raymond Stantz and Ramis's Dr. Egon Spengler, on the other hand, are into the paranormal. That's the realm of the unknown outside of science. But unlike the psych field, things here can be seen in real life. <br/><br/>Venkman is mostly clueless to their work, but he goes along with it. So, they go into the business of catching ghosts. The team invents a trap to contain or imprison ghosts they catch. They have proton weapons that sort of lasso ghosts electrically or by their zapping energy. Venkman is more interested in pursuing Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett. who becomes a client.
 
For comedies such as this, one doesn't have to question the fact that there wasn't such a business before because there was no apparent problem. While the para designation says it's outside of science, Stantz and Spengler have made it a science of studying the para field. <br/><br/>All of this contributes to the comedy. The humor isn't in clever, witty dialog, but in rapid-fire nonsensical stuff about the paranormal. And, in some satire and the antics of the Ghostbuster squad as it tangles with ghosts. A fourth ghost fighter joins them. Erne Hudson plays Winston Zeddmore. The various ghosts are mostly funny caricatures. <br/><br/>The best comedy is provided in the spoofing jabs of the mayor of New York City, city government, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. William Atherton plays Walter Peck, an EPA honcho who shuts down the Ghostbuster's power supply that keeps its huge collection of jailed ghosts confined. Pandemonium results, and the guys become the heroes of the city for shutting down organized spookery. <br/><br/>This is an enjoyable fantasy and sci-fi comedy. It was deserving of the two Oscar nominations it received - for best visual effects and best original song. Toward the end, the ghost fighters encounter their biggest challenge. This is approaching the demonic, and the scenes could be scary for young viewers."

I admit from any other angle this movie is stupid and childish, but from the comedy lens its exceptional. So many great quotes in this one. I laughed often and out loud. So don't take it too seriously and enjoy it. The public - the ones who actually go to movies and spend money - are the true test and this one has passed with flying colors. Great cast"

","Poor New York Public Library. The big famous Schwartzman building on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue has been plagued by floods, mutants living in the bowels underneath the city and gang members of the future, not to mention in real life, the oldest book on the world, snooty librarians and over diligent security guards. But long before it became a sanctuary from the eye of the storm in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", it was the home of some really spooky ghosts, maybe not living inside one of the lions like Ted Ross in ""The Wiz"", but present none the less. <br/><br/>A huge blockbuster when first released, it was a triumph for ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd, along with Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as the team of spook hunters, Sigourney Weaver as their first client, Rick Moranis as her pesky next door neighbor, and Annie Potts as their wisecracking Eve Arden like secretary. Weaver gets a glamorous role that is a total contrast to her character in ""Alien"", utilizing sly and subtle comedy as she deals with trained comics who obviously showed her a thing or two.<br/><br/>While everyone is great, Murray is the major scene stealer, and it's easy to see why for a while, he was one of the most sought after actors in films. "" He slimed me"" couldn't be funnier coming from anybody else. Ackroyd does a variety of his familiar Saturday Night Live characterizations, but Murray has a way of delivering lines that has a greater impact. Ramis, a funny guy in his own right, plays the role completely straight, but it's insinuated that something's going on between him and the cynical Potts.<br/><br/>Along with that bouncy title song and vintage New York location shots, there are some terrific special effects and some amusing references to social trends of the time. Back in 1984, if you weren't entering Indiana Jones' temple of doom or warning Zach Galligan about ""Bright light, bright light"", you were shoutin' ""I ain't afraid of no ghost!"" A sequel wasn't horrible, but a recent ripoff of the original was justifiably criticized. This was original in every way, and no modern update could improve on that. Calling ""Remake Busters!"""

"Idiot-Deluxe","10","1","1","6 March 2017"," Prepare yourselves for the coming of Gozer, in this timeless masterpiece of cinematic macabre!
","Ghostbusters is one of the most original and beloved films of all time, with it's unbeatable combination of sly humor and electrifying action, barring an inferior sequel and a questionable re-make, there's no other movie remotely similar and for over three decades it's stood the test of time, as a lasting tribute to the exceptional people who created it. If one had to place this one-of-kind movie into a category, it would have to labeled as an ""action-comedy"", because that's what this film undoubtedly brings to your screen - in massive quantity. Upon it's release in June of 1984 Ghostbusters was instant smash hit and still today is regarded as one of the best and most imaginative movies ever created, having both universal appeal and a timeless sense of charm.<br/><br/>So whats it all about? Ghostbusters revolves around three struggling hack-scientists and their unique specialty service, surely a niche-market, of ""Supernatural Elimination"" which they offer to the people of New York City. Along the way expect to see the likes of a beautiful cellist and a nerdy accountant to become inseparably intertwined in the story, a story which plays out in a most unusual and colorful series of events, that indelibly sew the threads that which forms the fabric of this wickedly funny and off-beat tale of the supernatural. The cast of Ghostbusters (which boasts not one, but two SNL alumni) is sheer perfection and it would seem impossible for the movie to be cast any better then it was. But perhaps on even an higher level of perfection is the movies script, which is a masterpiece screen-writing (primarily the work of main-man Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis), that endows the movie with an incredible abundance of the most singularly distinctive dialog ever written for the movies; and because of this superlative level of writing talent Ghostbusters, to my way of thinking, is -by far- the most quotable movie ever. <br/><br/>When speaking of the human talent that's behind this exceptionally witty masterpiece of the macabre, it's cast takes full advantage of a near-perfect script and deliver their performances with an infectious, often exhilarating, level of energy. The end result is a film that simply works well on all levels and it's cast of oddball characters instills the film, ever so potently, with a one-a-kind vibe that no other movie has matched. Ghostbusters is unquestionably a first-rate comedy, but it also so much more than that. But back to it's script and all the sparkling Aykroydian-genius that's behind it, but not even with a script of this caliber did all of it's ideas pan out. As proof of this, if you've seen the out-takes of this film, it appears that Bill Murray completely rewrote the first of the two scenes where they're in Danna Baretts apartment; in which the original dialog is terribly awkward and was wisely replaced with something much better (which I think results in one of the most charming scenes in the movie). ""They hate this (piano keys tinkling) that right boys it's Dr. Venkman!"" - as well as few other scenes that didn't make the final-cut at all.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly for a movie that revolves around ghosts or more accurately the capturing or ""busting"" of ghosts, there's a lot of special effects work to speak of and the sheer quality and quantity of FX is just another part of the grand sum that is Ghostbusters. Had the movies effects not been so brilliant, well then it stands to reason that the movie simply would not have been as brilliant either. The type of effects one can expect to see in vast quantities are photographic effects, aninmatronic puppets, models and miniature work, and I think there may also be a little stop-motion magic worked into the mix. Not to forget all the great stunts and remarkably effective practical effects which are showcased throughout the film, these effects were created by means of compressed air, wires, mist machines and a lot of pyro-technics - my favorite among them literally involves a ton of shaving cream, which was dropped from a great height. As with with all other aspects of this movie, the effects have aged very well. Also there are some impressive sets to speak of such as the earthquake-simulating set and the spectacular astral gate set.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters, not JUST a feast for the eyes, the late-great Elmer Bernstein would go onto compose his best and most experimental film score of his storied 50-year career, which is ultimately an inspired masterpiece of film composition. Bernstein's grand musical vision was brought to life by a standard full orchestra, AND was further accented -to brilliant effect- by the ""ondes martenot"", a rare electric instrument of French origin, whose tone does not sound entirely unlike that of a Theremin. This rarely used instruments (unless your Elmer Bernstein, he would go on to over-use it in future works) ethereal intonation was the perfect choice for creating the movies ""musical ghosts"" and it's unique coloring adds immensely to the overall feel of the film. Also when speaking of Ghostbusters one cannot fail to mention it's iconic and universally known theme song, a brilliantly catchy pop number with fantastic lyrical writing and singing, that which was written and performed by Ray Parker Jr. - but yet thee ole' Hughie Lewis (winner of the law-suit) may tell you differently.<br/><br/>So if you are one of the many who saw Ghostbusters 30th anniversary re-release in the theaters, not but a few years ago, or have seen the newest Blu-ray version of the film. I think you'll agree that time has proved to be kind, irrelevant even, to this seminal classic of the supernatural. In fact you might say that Ghostbusters is ETERNAL, a testament to it's well-tested and long-standing appeal and popularity for which the reasons are as numerous, as they are well-founded. And for this reviewer, the only other movie I'd rather find myself watching is - Evil Dead II."

","In this supernatural comedy that blends the paranormal, when Columbia University downsizes their science department, Doctors Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters - investigators and eliminators of paranormal pests. When the team's first client Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, the Ghostbusters come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to destroy Manhattan and the world along with it.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" has a lot of neat effects, some of them mind-boggling, others just quick little throwaways, as when a transparent green-slime monster gobbles up a mouthful of hot dogs. No matter what effects are being used, they're placed at the service of the actors; instead of feeling as if the characters have been carefully posed in front of special effects, we feel they're winging this adventure as they go along.<br/><br/>This was a movie that was crafted in a way where its sincere, dry humor relied mostly on witty dialog and delivery rather than sight gags. It's the comedy, the acting, the writing, and the creativity behind the film that truly make it succeed. <br/><br/>The comedic genius of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, coupled with the intriguing and exciting idea of ghostbusting (those proton packs are almost as irresistibly cool as a lightsaber from Star Wars), really make this one stand out. The guys play off each other like a modern day Marx Brothers team, lead by the ever-talented deadpan humor of Bill Murray.<br/><br/>But the idea behind Ghostbusters feels as though it could have been adapted from a famous comic book. However, its completely original story and realistic portrayal set in New York City really adds a lot to the film. While many of today's comedies probably would be more vulgar, more silly, and more campy (you can look at director Ivan Reitman's abysmal 2001 mistake Evolution as such an example), the comedy in Ghostbusters just seems more honest and real.<br/><br/>The jokes, the chemistry on screen, and the effects all fall into place. As entertaining today as it ever was, it's a classic to be treasured by all."

The ghost busters ride to the rescue, armed with nuclear-powered backpacks.

","Ghostbusters is one of the great interactive movie experiences. It does a great job in calling and letting for viewer participation. Ghostbusters communicates comedic intelligence as it plays to your personal intellect. It has a great nerd factor. The ghost hunting scientists speaking their brainy paranormal jargon with their high-tech ghost trapping equipment coming to the rescue to damsels in distress who've seen a ghost, is every nerd's dream, or something close like that. Ghostbusters does a terrific job melding a ghost haunting story into a competent comedy. It does a terrific job in having ""real life"" comedic humor; the humor's very authentic feeling. Ghostbusters does a fabulous job at framing and rating the ghost scenes; they're presented very well. The ghost scenes are satisfactorily approving so allowing the lot of the time for great, slapsticky, goofy dialogue. Bill Murray is nothing too short of great as Dr. Peter Venkman. Dan Akroyd is marvelous as Dr. Ray. Harold Ramis is very well as Dr. Egon. Ernie Hudson is well-cast as Winston, just like the rest of the Ghostbusters. ""That's a big twinkie."" Sigourney Weaver makes the movie so great as Dana Barrett, the Gate Keeper, as Weaver's wonderful in one of her most memorable parts. I'm a big nerd for Sigourney. The Key Master, Rick Moranis, is kind of the funniest part. Moranis is really good. I really love his kind, silly character. Gozer is a good enough enemy for Ghostbusters but Gozer is tremendously overshadowed by the doglike creatures, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Slimer, especially Slimer. The old lady spirit reading quietly in the library at the beginning's one of the great movie introduction scenes; it's just really fun, and really scary. Ghostbusters is a great overall family film. It has great music and great sound effects. The Ghostbuster's theme song is forever memorable. Ghostbusters is nothing short of a smash hit, a great film to enjoy with family and friends. I must point out Ghostbusters is not some kiddie movie; it's a great success.<br/><br/>""I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that.

Actor Bill Murray essays the role of Dr. Venkman and is highly entertaining as a source of nonchalant humour. The sci-fi special effects are overall quite impressive for the 80's but even those lack a ghoulish air. Every single minute of the film is light and comical.

","Every time I sit down to revisit Ghostbusters, and that's not too often, sadly, I keep forgetting how incredible and richly funny this movie was. So much so, it should never be considered an adventure or supernatural action movie up front; it should, by and far, be under the comedy section. And I'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there's barely anything on screen but Bill Murray's comic genius delivery.<br/><br/>While I might have seen this in theatres – I was only ten when released, I don't recall. Unfortunately, my family viewed very few films back in the early eighties and I didn't start my movie obsession until the late eighties. I know I caught it somewhere, sometime following the release and did like it, but never, ever appreciated it until I got older. I don't think I was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie made a ton. Sure, it was a bona fide summer blockbuster. But, I think people just expected such quality back then, they probably had no idea how influential, how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact. For, I see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so, that are strictly made for profit. Made to be released, one after the next, while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a Redbox a couple of months later. Movies with very little heart inserted, too much CGI and less care taken. Despite just ""being a comedy,"" Ghostbusters was made correctly, down to the core.<br/><br/>Three paranormal doctors/buddies at a university find themselves out on the street in New York just as their ghost theories become reality. Hilariously gathering the funds to make it big in the Big Apple, they open the Ghostbusters pest control business and take offeventually.<br/><br/>One of their first clients is Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver,) a tough, but vulnerable broad who has an extra visitor in her refrigerator. While 1/3 'Buster at the time, Peter (Murray,) is more infatuated with her than her ghost fridge, they do follow up on her story while simultaneously capturing ghosts in the city and rise to fame.<br/><br/>Her storyline might be more of final clue for the upside in business for the Ghostbusters and then things get real.<br/><br/>Above all else in this movie was the flawless performance from Murray. While every single actor involved was also fantastic, namely Harold Ramis as Egon and Weaver's Dana, Murray's Peter was pitch-perfect. His deadpan humor was so great, that I almost feel guilty for not appreciating Dan Aykroyd's Raymond role more, or Rick Moranis and Annie Potts in their third-tier, but important characters.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; on the whole, they all did great. I just couldn't keep my focus much further than Murray during this film.<br/><br/>Beyond Murray and the wonderful supporting cast, was the infamous and beloved title song ('in' due to the countless times it was played,) a good score, special effects decent for the times and fairly good cinematography.<br/><br/>This movie screamed what I love about Summer Blockbusters, but haven't seen in about two decades. Sure, there have been plenty of great films; fun and exciting and memorable films. But, rarely will I see one that's more heart than just trying for the Box Office dollar. I miss these types of movies.<br/><br/>Well, I don't have to any more. For, I bought this one on BluRay and can revisit the ""good ole days"" any time I feel like it. Recommended!"

","With lines that you can quote on a daily basis, and a theme song that just sticks to your head, the Ghostbusters is a movie to watch. The line ""Who You Gonna Call?"" is well used in real life and even in the movie world as a tribute to the theme music. Ghostbusters is a film that has been tagged as one of the best comedies of 1984, the movie used a lot of special effects to pass it's message across, and the powerful acting of Bill Murray (Peter) made this movie an infectious plague that as soon as you pass by while it is running on TV you just take a sit to see it again.<br/><br/>The film was followed by a sequel, Ghostbusters II in 1989 and the movie franchise grew to include two animated television series one named The Real Ghostbusters show casing more adventures of the original four and Extreme Ghostbusters about a new team of busters mentored by Egon.<br/><br/>Written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis the movie is about three eccentric parapsychologists in New York City, who start a ghost catching business. The movie original idea which was written by Aykroyd was a little too bogus and out of this world to have worked, as it features a group of Ghostbusters travelling through time and going to other dimensions fighting ghost. They group used wands instead of proton packs to fight the ghosts.<br/><br/>When the story was pitched to the director and producer of this 1984 classic, Ivan Reitman, Reitman bought the idea but felt the script was just off, so Harold Ramis came on board and he and Aykroyd worked on the script for a three week period, making it more realistic and more tuned down.<br/><br/>The Characters for the movie were meant to be played by Belushi, Eddie Murphy, and John Candy. But Belushi died during the writing of the screenplay and Murphy and Candy didn't want the roles, so Ayrkroyd and Ramis re-wrote the characters took the roles themselves and brought Bill Murray on board, an addition which was well received.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about three unemployed parapsychology scientist who got fired from their jobs in the university for their weird behaviour and intrigue by the paranormal. The trio Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) decided to rent an old firehouse to set shop and started trapping ghost, spirits and poltergeist for money. They decided to hire an extra help and got Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) in on the ghost busting business.<br/><br/>But things took a change for the worse when they stumbled upon a gateway into another dimension and an evil waiting to break free into this world, the group now have to go save the world from this impending disaster.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters is a classic comedy/Sci Fi movie that all should watch and own, the movie has so much details and fun that you find yourself captivated by the whole idea of Ghost busting. The sequel was just as good.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","1","14 December 2012"," Childhood favourite and all-time classic
","GHOSTBUSTERS was one of my favourite films as a kid; I first saw it when I was about 5, and it scared the hell out of me (that librarian ghost - jeez!). My old VHS tape was worn through by the time I grew up and forgot about it. Now, years later, I decided to give it another spin and discover whether it was one of those films that holds up even when you're an adult...<br/><br/>The answer is a resounding YES! GHOSTBUSTERS is still a great movie, a thoroughly entertaining classic for all ages. It's an out-and-out comedy featuring my favourite performance from a beautifully deadpan Bill Murray, who's perfectly supposed by Dan Ackroyd (who makes a great butt for the jokes), Harold Ramis (as the straight guy), Ernie Hudson (underrated), Sigourney Weaver (a delightful role reversal from Ellen Ripley) and little Rick Moranis, who's always hilarious.<br/><br/>Although the film was made nearly 30 years ago, it hasn't dated in the slightest and the detectives vs. spooks storyline still holds up really well. I just can't get over how well made it is, with scenes that should be ridiculous (such as the climax) just totally gathering you up and immersing you in the experience. I love the Lovecraftian undertones, and the way the special effects are still much, much better than most of the CGI in modern movies. Those stop motion dog-creatures, absolutely fantastic, even now.<br/><br/>Okay, so the sequel wasn't so great, but I'm a firm believer in the fact that no matter how many bad sequels or remakes, you can never spoil the entertainment value of a classic movie. And GHOSTBUSTERS is exactly that: a classic for all ages, a genuine family movie that never panders to a young audience and remains timeless because of it."

","When there's something strange in the neighborhood, who ya gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS! <br/><br/>How can you not love this movie? For starters it's written by none other than Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd. Dan Akroyd stars as Ray Stanz the enthusiastic character known as the heart of the Ghostbusters. Bill Murray plays Peter Venkman the parapsychologist with a dry humor and laid back attitude. Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler the brain of the gang. And Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore the voice of reason, and the last person to join the team. <br/><br/>The movie is basically about four rather unusual scientist that gets kicked out of the university, and decides to start a business involving ghost catching. Meanwhile they're first customer Dana Berrett gets haunted be a creature called Zuul and the team find themselves in the midst of the return of the demigod Gozer and the awakening of the dead in the city of New York.<br/><br/>The characters amateur approach, slime spitting ghosts and a 112 ft. tall Marshmallow man, makes this movie hilarious and a true classic and is a must see for everyone. <br/><br/>""Call the Ghostbusters.

","What can be said about this movie thats not been said before?!...probably nothing to be honest, but I am such a fan of the movie I want to give the film the 10 star rating it deserves. At its best its possibly the wittiest script ever produced from Hollywood, with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and the beautiful Sigourney Weaver all on top form. Bill Murray does steal the show with some of the best dialogue and one liners you will hear in a comedy. Everything about the movie is likable, the stories fun, the script and dialogue is pin sharp, the direction is spot on, the eighties special effects are top drawer and still look impressive to this day (give and take a couple of dodgy moments), the actors all give excellent performances from the A listers right down to the smallest of supporting roles. As a child the movie scared the s#*t out of me, but now watching it as an adult its just a wonderfully enjoyable timeless classic which is to be respected when you compare it to the total c#*p that comes out of Hollywood these days. The eighties were a time of fantastic blockbusters from Back to the Future to Raiders of the Lost Ark. I'm Glad a grew up in that cinematic era, but for me out of all the wonderful movies to come out of that time, Ghostbusters is by far my favourite, its the movie I will always go back to and stick in the DVD player and watch again and again....Anyone who has not seen it should head down to the local DVD store and buy a copy, not rent, BUY a copy as you will watch it many times over I'm sure. 10/10 TOP CLASS!"

","I can't let that other review sit here alone, especially when he doesn't know what he's talking about.  GhostBusters was a great movie.  Everyone who is old enough has seen this movie and is filled with great, quietly comic performances.  Bill Murray, Akroyd, Ramis fill the bill just right.  This shouldn't have been serious, Ivan Reitman doesn't write serious.  If you want slapstick, outlandish comedy, this isn't your movie, but then Bill Murray movies never are. If you don't like Bill Murray, who makes the movie, don't bother to pick this one up. Truly worth a watch and, usually, a buy. 3 out of 4 stars.

"weezite03","10","1","1","17 April 2004"," How can you not like Ghostbusters?
","Ok, so I sound a little obsessed, but Ghostbusters is probably one of the better movies and most catchy and popular movie franchises out there. Honestly, who didn't want to be a Ghostbuster when they were younger?  It seems like it would've been so cool to go and use a proton pack and trap ghosts, spooks and all that.  The sci-fi factor alone was awesome.<br/><br/>And it was very funny.  You couldn't have a better cast(with the exception of perhaps adding John Belushi like that had originally intended).  The comedic chemistry between the four of them was flawless, and each of their personalities molded together for perfect timing and very much enjoyment. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were ingenious in, and writing the film, and Bill Murray couldn't have been funnier.  Even Ernie Hudson added a much needed balance to the original 3 Ghostbusters.     The other popular actors in the movie were very enjoyable to watch as well.<br/><br/>And yeah, so the special effects looked fake...for 2004.  Back then, it was awesome, and the movie wouldn't be the same without them.<br/><br/>The movie made perfect sense for the time and place and still rocks to watch today.  It's a pure classic that will hopefully be revived again and again in generations to come."

","Ousted professors and researchers of the after life Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves as the Ghostbusters, paranormal investigators and elimantors. ""The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams,"" says Peter. Initially laughed at and mocked, they get their first customer in the form of the beautiful musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who's fridge is possessed by monster dogs. Then the G-men capture the green ghost Slimer (originally called ""Onion Head"" during production; Slimer later became their mascot of sorts on the cartoon) at a restaurant and before long they become a media sensation with ghosts coming out of the wood work left and right. This leads to them recruiting Winston Zedemore (Ernie Hudson). Then they discover that they're on the edge of the end of the world and Dana's building is the key to the whole thing, but first they must overcome William Atherton's misguided by theoretically well meaning EPA man before they can confront the monstrous Gozer and save the world.<br/><br/>
In a role originally intended for the late John Belushi, Bill Murray is a hoot as usual as the dead panned yet sardonic salesman professor Peter Venkman. Writers Aykroyd and Ramis have a little less to do but they're fun to watch as the overly enthusiastic Ray and Spock-like Egon. Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson do what they can with their roles of Dana, Janine and Winston respectively. You have to admit, it may be a step down from ""Alien"" but Weaver manages to imbue Dana with more grace, dignity and warmth than the usual love interest. Rick Moranis has a fun bit as Weaver's nerdy neighbor.<br/><br/>Not only is the film funny, the film is also surprisingly creepy in places and boasts some great special effects along memorable music by Elmer Bernstein and the title theme song by Ray Parker Jr. Memorable moments include the library ghost, the eggs popping on the counter, the entire Slimer sequence, the appearance of th Stay-Puft-Marsh-Mellow Man, Harold Ramis attacking William Atherton, William Atherton being burrowed in marsh mellow, and pretty much any time Bill Murray is on screen (like when he yanks the tablecloth out from under the flowers), which is quite often. Don't miss the ""Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!"" line, or Winston telling the white mayor ""Since I joined these men, I have seen s**t that will turn you WHITE."" Film is dated only by certain 80s wardrobe and the excessive amount of smoking down by the characters.<br/><br/>
The sequel is funny and better than most sequels but still not quite on par with the first one. The first cartoon was good but impossible to find. ""Extreme Ghostbusters"" you can skip.<br/><br/>As a trivia note, Bill Murray's character was voiced by the late Lorenzo Music in the cartoon series. Lorenzo Music was also the voice of Garfield the cat. Bill Murray has now replaced Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield for the new movie.<br/><br/>Deleted scenes on the DVD include Janine giving Egon her lucky coin before he goes off to fight Gozer and the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man's hat falling on the populace after he gets blown to bits. Commentary by Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman is also fun to listen to."

"johnnyboyz","6","4","9","5 July 2013"," Confident, often brash, depiction of thriving corporatism; punishable atheism and a hybrid of new means to defeat old beliefs in a soufflé of comedy and horror.
","I suppose there is an idea at the core of Ghostbusters somewhere; a high-concept film, about a group of people essentially adopting the role of contemporary exorcists, that straddles some sort of often vacant place on a line that separates non-reality with what could feasibly happen if you were religious. It is a curious thing when a text attempts to handle that of demons, ghouls and ghosts. Deep down, I suppose, it is somewhat perversely pleasurable to convince ourselves of their existence. As years have passed, germs have replaced the invisible monsters that-once-were as the cause for illness; technology has been able to deduce whether or not haunted locales truly are as such while science; theories on evolution and modernity in general has done 'wonders' to disprove the idea that religion and so forth are as genuine as everybody thought they were for so long.<br/><br/>There was a line in the Tarantino-penned 1996 horror film ""From Dusk til Dawn"" when the anti-heroic lead states that ""if there is a Hell"", and that the monsters occupying an adjacent room ""are from it"", then there's ""got to be a Heaven"". Should the existence of ghosts, demons and whatnot run in tandem with the theory that there is a heaven and an afterlife? Probably, and yet in spite of all this sweeping modernity doing well to disprove the spirit world and the idea of an 'afterlife', there are still those who remain unconvinced of a ghost's inauthenticity; remain staunch that they've encountered one and remain adamant that the line between our world and the next not only exists, but is thinner than you think. One of the (admittedly, few) charms of the 1984 horror/comedy Ghostbusters is how it exploits the belief of that line while keeping everything as reigned in as it does. This is not, for the best part, an all-out horror film depicting nasty, invading spirits doing their utmost to invade a densely populated human locale, although it does descend into that by the end. Moreover, this is a clash of the old and the new; an unabashed depiction of hauntings and ghosts as very much real but a depiction of science and technology otherwise associated with disproving God; Heaven; Hell and reincarnation through spirit being used to counter said entities.<br/><br/>New York City must be one of the most populated zones in the world, but does that mean there'd be more or fewer ghosts there than somewhere largely vacant, such as that attic in an old, isolated English manor house from centuries ago located somewhere in the countryside. Regardless, the leads therein the film discover a fair few of them merely going about their routines in a manner that is underplayed and quite funny but, one senses, realistic to the cause should a large uncovering of spirits ever unfold. Ivan Reitman's film mixes the audacious with the bubble-gum, a depicting people coming into contact with spiritual entities although sadly never really learning anything nor becoming more enriched as a result of it. While the film is quite good fun and often funny, it comes across as too superficial to be anything wonderfully inventive nor much more than frivolously academic. It's often quite childish, even dull in places. Admittedly, where not every film of its ilk can be as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", where the presence of ghosts in a characters life leads to an enriched bond with a psychologist, Ghostbusters does hit the odd mark.<br/><br/>The film follows four New York City based men, two Caucasian; an African American and a Jew, who set up their own business in a disused fire station that specialises in ghostly phenomena. Initially, the men (still minus the African American) are ill-suited to the practical aspect of their work where the theory is all in the right place. Uncovering a poltergeist in a library archive, they can only run screaming for their lives when it turns uglier than they'd like. Buoyed by their experience, they have enough confidence to set up this business when a university cuts their funding and the enterprise turns into a ghost 'busting' organisation upon realising there's money in making the ghosts go away – a sort of supernatural pest exterminator. Among them is Bill Murray's psychologist Peter Venkman, a man whose womanising ways is evident in the opening and who remains largely sceptical on the whole library phenomena anyway where his partners do not. At the other end of the spectrum is Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, a dry man and the most intelligent of the four who is too deep into his work to notice the affection shown towards him by their eventual receptionist. Somewhere in the middle is the ""funny-as-Murray"" but ""as-good-at-his-job-as-Ramis"" Dan Akroyd, who plays Raymond Stantz. <br/><br/>Narrative is, of course, superfluous in a film like Ghostbusters; its end-of-the-world routine, as Sigorney Weaver's Dana Barrett discovers a gateway into a doom-laden alternate dimension, is as nonsensical as it gets in a film which might otherwise have been quite intelligently theological. The true pleasures lie in the film's would-be tryst involving the ever-humorous Venkman and the delight in the way he shares his scenes with Weaver, although we do not come to observe much closure to any of it – nor indeed do we Spengler's with the receptionist. The film is more interested in cracking on with its primary tract of special effects and unexplained alternative universes which, one assumes, comes complete with their own dynamic structures but the likes of which are not explored here. But it remains difficult to get angry with the film because it has with it a boyish energy; it does the rare thing for an American blockbuster in actually trying to sell to you this U.S.P. innocently and fondly, as if it cares for it so much and wants you to share in this fondness. In the ever declining cinematic world of 'event' movies within which we live, that alone is justification for checking Ghostbusters out."
"illbebackreviews","6","4","9","3 April 2013"," A good and entertaining comedy but I find it disjointed and overrated
","'Ghostbusters' is a movie that for a long time I had intention of watching but never truly felt like watching. Being a huge fan of the website Flickchart.com, I was more than surprised yet my initial response was, ""What the heck, why is it 24th best of all time?"" so I decided that I had to see this movie just to see whether its overrated or not, whether it's good or not, whether I'd enjoy it or not.<br/><br/>The main premise to 'Ghostbusters' is quite simple but the film is surprisingly a bit more than just a basic simplistic story. So, we have our three main characters: Peter, Raymond and Spengler who after losing their jobs believe it is time to open their own business called <br/><br/>'Ghostbusters', a service that is available to catch any ghosts reported by anyone. However, a bunch of crazy events that happen throughout the course of the play really change the plot drastically. First of all, the characters in the film are great. Our main trio are great as is Sigourney Weaver's Dana. The acting in this film is undeniably great with Bill Murray again being fantastic at what he does best- making us laugh! The story is definitely one to enjoy and I'm grateful that the plot really turns on your head in this film. The film is well directed with a rather good mix between humor and seriousness. The writing is great and the dialogue is funny however I just find myself rather bored throughout certain parts of the film. <br/><br/>It is hard to believe why I'd be bored at certain parts of the film when there is great humor, great characters and a story but the pacing feels weird and the plot that turns on its head doesn't become as enjoyable. As the plot turns on its head, I found the comedy to really disappear and that certainly disappointed me. <br/><br/>Going into the movie, I had no real high expectations, nor low ones but rather medium levelled expectations and this film doesn't completely deliver. A film that contains as much comedy as this film did early on, loses me in its last act where the plot truly turns on its head and the comedy begins to disappear. A great first two acts followed by a rather disappointing third act make 'Ghostbusters' a mediocre movie that I find, truly horribly overrated. 24th best film ever, according to Flickchart!?!? Really?"

","Ghostbusters is a classic 1980s film that everyone has at least heard of, especially because of the 2016 remake starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. The original movie stars Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis. It is a comedy movie, the only people that ever think this is a scary movie are small children. The movie is all about these men who form a group and of course they go into the business of ghost busting together. The writing is very comical, it's really not the best comedy in the world, but parts of it are funny. To be honest, I like this movie mainly because of the cast, big Sigourney Weaver fan. The effects were good for the time, now they'd kinda be lacking. The action scenes are done pretty well and I liked the visuals. The movie is one most people will have fun with, it's just not the greatest thing in the world if I'm being 100% honest. I give ghostbusters a 7/10 because it is pretty entertaining, but it is not the best movie in the world."

In this film, they have to win Gozer, a demonic entity that will try to use Dana (Sigourney Weaver), a girl who Venkman tried to conquer, to achieve it's dark aim of destroying the world.<br/><br/>We're facing, probably, one of the most iconic comedies of the eighties. Bill Murray, who could already consider himself an experienced comedy actor, reached an exceptional level, dominating this movie and toasting the audience with deeply ironic and irresistible laughing moments. The result was Murray's launch to stardom, as one of the best comedians of the eighties cinema. Another actor that was highlighted was Rick Moranis, who plays Mr. Tully, one of the funniest characters in this film thanks to Moranis enormous talent. The film has a number of very good special effects, probably the best of his time, a time when special effects knew how to be in a movie without dominating it. The soundtrack is also a very positive aspect of this movie, with the ""Ghostbuster's"" song topping the Billboard Hot 100. This song is still known to the general public presently.<br/><br/>This film should be one of the comedies that more money earned over during the eighties. And it's not difficult to understand why: it's a movie for everyone and appeals to children the same way as the elderly. It's very curious that a film whose many critics said so bad manages to keeps it's popularity today, thirty years after being released."
"Drew48","6","3","6","29 August 2008"," A Tale of Two Logos
","The two logos are the ghastly logo for ""Entertainment Rights"", whatever that is, which looks like Soviet People's Art, and the excellent Ghostbusters logo which doesn't appear on the box but is on the enclosed booklet. As usual, I differ with whoever designed the packaging, since the moaning ghost logo which began and ended the shows, and was used for bumpers (see the special features) was one of the best parts of the show. Ghostbusters was remarkable for about a million reasons. It was a show, as Filmation producer Lou Scheimer notes, in which everything came together. What that really means is that it's a live action show done on the miniscule cartoon budgets that were standard for kids' TV. It was written very fast, as cartoons are. It starred a likable, humorous cast: Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch of F- Troop, who essentially played the same parts as F-Troop and as in their cartoon voice over work. The amazing addition was Bob Burns, who plays the most lifelike gorilla probably ever seen on TV. The show is a ghostbusting take on Gangbusters, with a vaguely '20s feel: Larry dresses the part, Forrest doesn't). As the theme song says, ""I'm Spenser, he's Tracy, I'm Kong. You'd think Kong would be the gorilla; he's not. Tracy is the gorilla. Forest is Kong. There are only three sets: a graveyard, a haunted house hallway, and a room in the creepy house. The guest stars read like a whose who of (then) current television. As with cartoon voiceovers, kids' shows are wildly popular with adult actors who get to let out their kid side. Brilliantly, however, the show never played down to its audience. Kids don't need to ""get it"". They don't need to follow the plot. They relate to the characters and want to be in on the action. This is why it's so tragic that live hosts are gone. They are the natural ones to show cartoons, and form an immediate bond with kids. Ghostbusters brilliantly worked a number of repeating schticks. Every episode Spenser and Tracy would drive their old '20s car to a junk shop to get their assignment, Mission Impossible/ Get Smart style from a different unlikely object, which after playing the tape would self- destruct in five seconds. Tracy would hold it and count down in the repeating gag. Another is that Tracy would don a variety of hats, some relevant to the plot, some not. He never spoke but he grunted in a meaningful way, drew doodles and did charades to get his ideas across, and dragged an assortment of props for visual gags onto the sets. The show's credits say ""Tracy trained by Bob Burns,"" so kids thought he really was a gorilla. Burns is also known for his vast collection of sci-fi memorabilia (see the book Blast Off). One of the best extra features in this set is the interview with Burns, although the interview with Scheimer is also good. One not very great extra is an episode of Filmation's Ghostbusters cartoon, which is unwatchably bad for reasons that many mid- eighties cartoons are bad. Ten years after this 1974-5 Live action show, Ghostbusters, came the 1984 Bill Murray Ghostbusters blockbuster film. I wondered then how the movie could use the same title. The conflict came during the cartoon spin-offs. DIC's The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, spun off from the movie, ran in 1986. The same year, Filmation made a cartoon version of the live action show. DIC's is by far the better cartoon because they had the comic trio from the film (mostly voiced by Arsenio Hall) as cartoon stars. Filmation's show suffered from bland, badly drawn human characters which, for whatever reason, bore no resemblance to Storch or Tucker, nor for that matter, did the gorilla to Tracy. Despite that, the closing titles feature lavish surrealistic backgrounds, testimony to the uneven artistry of mid- '80s cartoons. However, to return to the live action show, in the last episode, the song on the radio is ""Sugar Sugar"", the number one charting song by The Archies, which came from Filmation's 1968 The Archie Show. But here Filmation started with great human characters: the gang from Riverdale. Those doing Cartoons Without Cable will find Ghostbusters a wonderful change from cartoons. Play one episode along with a favorite cartoon like Garfield and Friends to make a great hour of kids' TV. There are only fifteen episodes, but Ink and Paint has done a great job with this budget set, which consists of two double- sided discs in a slip case with credits and copious notes. There's even a computer ROM feature that enables you to read all the scripts. A blast from the past recalling a magic moment when great hearts made great kids' TV."

","Reitman's best, most successful film he has ever made was this catchy comedy which turned out to be 1984's surprise hit thanks to the impeccable timing of its release.<br/><br/>The leading trio play off each other sublimely, with Murray as the prankster and both Aykroyd and Ramis in top form playing two rather socially inept scientists whose joint obsession with New York's ghostly inhabitants leads the ""Ghostbusters"" to fame and fortune. Sigourney Weaver plays the humorous love interest who turns nasty when spectral activity becomes centred around her apartment. Also hilarious is Rick Moranis as the dorky accountant who becomes an unlikely ""Keymaster"" in the closing scenes of the film. Annie Potts plays the over worked secretary, Ernie Hudson the hired fourth Ghostbuster and William Atherton is the thorn in the side from the Environmental Protection Agency.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have written the screenplay which is quite sharp in both the freshness of the idea and the execution of the plot. The jaunty momentum and bright comedy is prevalent throughout. Visually we are treated to some attention grabbing special f/x which dominate the ""Ghostbusters"" encounters with the spooks. Finally there is the trendy soundtrack which features the smash hit single ""Ghostbusters"" from Ray Parker Junior.<br/><br/>Saturday, September 27, 1997 - Video"

It had some things going very very wrong for it. Like the story remains very predictable and there is no thrilling or nail-biting part. But that alone is not enough.

","This ""masterpiece"" is just clogged with many terrible things with it, and a terrible plot too. Let me explain.<br/><br/>One of or probably the only reason this is highly praised is the fact that it gave off a cool franchise or stigma to many people. This right here makes no sense. For a movie so average, any other company could've just said, ""Hey, lets just make a movie about people getting ghosts."" But this was so terrible, I can't even begin where to start.<br/><br/>Music. Soundtracks has been great for overhyped movies at times and it works. When they use the Ghostbusters theme, it's only at the end or the worst times.<br/><br/>The plot. It was just a numb and dull plot hyping up this cool devastation the queen is gonna make. So the whole movie focuses only on that buildup. During the buildup of that, about one person of the Ghostbuster squad was even likeable. The pedophile's sarcastic tone became annoying (and I love sarcasm), the ""leader"" I suppose had no real characteristic I saw, the smart one was actually likeable, and the black dude had no motivation or reason to even join. And they didn't even show his talents. So is he just useless?<br/><br/>So much of the comedy was centered around the pedohile character which made comedy not even a point in this. By the way, the adventures they went on were super boring. Nothing cool was shown, just laser beams out of the guns they never explained.<br/><br/>Then the buildup happens, but no chaos anywhere. Just one little ten to twenty minute battle between the queen and the Huffs Puffs Marshmallow. None of it was cool as everyone says. It's all average with alright special effects at the time. It's really just overrated."

","Three scientists at Columbia University lose their funding and are kicked out of their premises.  A contact with a ghost puts them onto a business idea of operating as `ghost busters' in new York.  They make the equipment and set up shop in an old firestation.  With their first customer comes fame and roaring business.  However one of their customers is reporting something about Gorzer and the group realise that she may be the focus of a bigger supernatural phenomenon.<br/><br/>Everyone who saw this when it came out will have fond memories of it  be it the comedy, the `great' effects or just the cheesy wonderful theme song.  It was a great blockbuster at the time but it hasn't dated that well in some respects.  However overall it is still fun to watch.  The plot is average at best but allows for plenty of comedy and action  which is all you want really isn't it?<br/><br/>The bits that have dated are naturally the effects  the beastly dogs are pretty ropy to say the least but are forgivable.  This is more than made up for by the energy it has and the comedy.  The film is simply fun to watch  it may not be a classic but it is enjoyable and will make you smile.  Most of this is due to Murray (who replaced Belushi who the role was meant for). Murray has all the best lines and has the most fun character.  Aykroyd is a close second but Ramis is much better behind the camera.<br/><br/>Support from Weaver, Moranis, Potts and Atherton are all good and the ghosts are enjoyable if a bit dodgy. Poor Hudson looks as out of place at times as he apparently felt.  He isn't part of the trio and strugged off-screen to fit in, while onscreen his distance is evident with him slightly off to the side on many occasions.<br/><br/>Overall many remember it to be better than it is because we saw it as children.  Revisiting it as an adult may bruise those memories but I was relived to find that it was still very enjoyable to watch despite being a bit more superficial than I noticed back in 84!"

","Somewhat overrated horror/ comedy, about a trio of paranormal investigators who set up shop just before the floodgates of Hell are opened, and Manhattan is overrun with ghosts and goblins and drooling, slobbering, flying green globs of ectoplasm.<br/><br/>The first two thirds are amusing, while the final third is an odd mix of horror, psychobabble, and poorly dated effects work. Perpetually balding Bill Murray has some great one-liners, while Harold Ramis rattles off intellectual-sounding monologues, and Dan Aykroyd just looks happy to be friends with two talented guys who let him go along for the ride. William Atherton has a wonderful turn as the EPA's sleazy suit and tie, pain in the Ghostbusters' collective ass. <br/><br/>Much of the jokes and one-liners went over my head as a child watching this in the 90s, (like their bit walking out of the mortgage office) but I still enjoyed the film; now, the one-liners that I didn't understand then but do now are the funniest parts, and for the most part, the only times in the film I laughed. My mind started to wander several times, I must admit, at a local cinema's double-bill of it, and its sequel, last night.

","I watched Ghostbusters for the first time since it's original release, and it has worn well. The story of supernatural exterminators is clever, the pace is quick, the special effects are fun, and much of the movie is very, very funny.<br/><br/>The main reason the movie is funny is Bill Murray as a smarmy professor who inexplicably wins over the resistant Sigourney Weaver with his oily charm. Murray's performance reminds me of meaner version of 1940s Bob Hope; they both specialize in the ""that looks really dangerous; you go first"" style of humor to great effect.<br/><br/>Aykroyd and Ramis are generally overshadowed by Murray. Outside of Murray the most entertaining performance is Rick Moranis as a creepy accountant.<br/><br/>The special effects are for the most part quite good, with silly ghosts and a tremendous and ridiculous final monster. Some of the other effects are pretty bad, most notably those bear-like creatures. The blue-screen edges are actually visible in places. I watch them and think, how is it possible that critics of the reboot actually claimed the original had better special effects? Are they *blind*? Anyway, very entertaining movie that I found almost as enjoyable as much as the much-defamed reboot. Well worth seeing."

I went through most of the reviews on this page and it must have something to do with the fact I never found Murray a funny guy but I can't think of one joke I particulary liked in this movie.

"gab-14712","9","0","0","29 April 2020"," My Childhood Favorite Still Holds Strong!
","I love Ghostbusters. The movie has always been a major part of life beginning with childhood. I'm very thankful I was introduced to this movie at such a young age. It is no surprise that the film was the biggest hit of 1984 and then some. The theater life was exceptionally long, but that is no big deal for a movie that helped in changing the landscape of feature films. This movie is considered to be one of Hollywood's first blockbusters. It also proved that special effects and comedy will work well together given the right ingredients (unlike Spielberg's disastrous 1941). These are just two of the main highlights that worked out in the film's favor.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Ivan Reitman, the man behind comedic hits like Animal House and Stripes. He did have a say in the screenplay, which was first drafted by Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd has always been fascinated with the paranormal. His family wrote books on ghosts or were mediums. His first script was more horror-based, but Reitman convinced him to lighten things up. He brought Harold Ramis (who worked with Reitman previously on the aforementioned films) on board to refine the jokes and add some much-needed humor. The script wasn't entirely used the way it was intended since Reitman wanted his actors to ad-lib. The studio, Columbia thought the film was toast, but boy were they ever proved wrong. Reitman knew the movie was hit at the first audience test screening when they laughed and felt fear during the opening library scene. That scene, with the older librarian being scared out of her wits, is one of the classic all-timers.<br/><br/>The performances are great (especially the deadpan comedic performance from Bill Murray), but the technical side of things were amazing. The editing is a thing of beauty. The film had a very short production leash, so Reitman and his crew had to edit as they go. In a film which could have gone horribly wrong, there is an even mixture of comedy, drama, action, thrills, and chills. In an age where special effects dominate each film, I was still impressed with the special effects. The ghosts looked realistic enough. The Marshmallow Man was giant and scary. The zombie cab driver. And, oh Slimer! Our favorite ghost! He was apparently modeled after the late John Belushi. Finally, the movie would not have been the same without the music. Everyone knows Ray Parker Jr's famous title song. I love that song, too!<br/><br/>Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists who work at Columbia University. They are fired after their grant ends. They begin a business to hunt down and capture ghosts. Business is bad at first and the public derides them. When Dana Barrett (Signourey Weaver) notices strange behavior by her Central Park apartment, she hires the Ghostbusters to rid her place from evil. Apparently, the place is a gateway to another world. Her oddball neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) also notices these monsters. Now business is great, and they even hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) to their team. The EPA associate, Walter Peck (William Atherton) convinces them they are doing the city harm and gets them thrown in jail. When New York City is placed under siege by ancient Sumerian god Gozer, the mayor may have no choice but to release them from jail.<br/><br/>This film also gave belief to the studios that its okay for television folks to star in movies. The main trio were all SNL stars and this movie made bank. Murray had the most experience with movies and he also delivered the funniest performance. It is a deadpan one and his one-liners are brilliant. My favorite is: ""human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria..."" If you understand the context, you'll understand the humor. Aykroyd and Ramis, while not given as much to do as Murray, do their best to create memorable characters. The chemistry between the three is definitely the highlight. Signourey Weaver is an odd casting choice giving her dramatic past in films like Alien, but she nailed the comedy when inhabited by the Gozer ghost. Rick Moranis totally got his character and I was down every second. I want to go to one of his parties!<br/><br/>Ghostbusters was a major hit for Columbia and a film that was influential towards culture. It gave studios more confidence that comedy-driven special effect films could work after all. You would not have fun, awesome films like Men in Black if Ghostbusters failed. If you studied New York City history, you'll know that the early 1980's was a horrible time for the city given its propensity for violence and fiscal damage. Reitman said this film was his love letter for the city. It gave the industry a much-needed boost that they could film their productions here. Nearly forty years after its debut, the film holds up very well. It's funny, scary, has great special effects, and it proved why everyone loves Bill Murray.<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

I decided to rewatch it with a more earnest attitude and I can affirm that I was impressed and entertained. There were flaws, but I'm going to start this review with the positives.
The most obvious piece of this film is its music. It's bloody catchy as hell. It's one of the most iconic themes in film history and it will never leave your memories whether you've watched and listened to it seriously or not. The logo is also iconic, so I responded with excitement to witness it again now that I'm much older.
The characters are undeniably funny, impressive, intriguing and flawed (which is a good thing). The protagonist, Peter, has a careless approach for personality, which for once isn't annoying on a character. He is generally comedic and quite courageous in the forefront of ghost fighting, despite his imperfections. Ray is stupid, but that's why we love him of course. He is the child of the group, which is why he is funny. Egon is the 'common sense' of the group and has a fierce personality underneath his intellectuals. And Winston had to be the funniest, to me, although I thought his comedic moments could've been better prolonged. I never had any issues with the other side characters, so that says something about the writer's well-picked choices of actors to fit the roles. Though, I thought character developments could have been arranged better.
The story, itself, is a fun composition of entertainment. Four parapsychology professors hunting and defeating ghosts is simply a fun idea, and I enjoyed it without a doubt.
Now, the flaws. Character development could have been done better because even though I enjoyed spending the film trying to seize what I liked about the characters I thought that I would've adored them further if I understood more things about them. Especially Winston, who I thought was hilarious but could've had more time to be the comedic punch to the story.
I also feel like the writers overlooked what plot they were going for. Yeah, there were ghosts and the ghostbusters, but why did Demons and Gods suddenly appear? I guess some people would see demons and Gods as spiritual, but to me, the idea was rather misleading and unsatisfactory in a way. I also feel like some of the ideas were fragile, which confused me from time to time as I tried to wrap my head around what I was being informed of. Why is there a Demon and another world within Dana's fridge? Why does Gozer appear only when the ghosts are freed? Why does Ivor's plan to overthrow humanity only take effect after he's dead? Potentially, I've been missing some ideas, but from where I'm standing, these ideas just don't penetrate well.
Overall, this was an enjoyable, action-packed movie with great and funny characters and a pleasing enough storyline. Again, there were flaws, but I'd definitely watch it a second time in due time."

","Ghostbusters was a massive success and still to this day continues to be widely considered a classic of the comedy genre. It's a very well paced film and the acting by everyone involved is top notch. Unlike the female remake the great thing about this film is how the acting compliments the script and nothing seems forced. Another great addition is the sparing use of CGI which compared to the overindulgence in the remake really stands out. Bill Murray excels in his deadpan and Sigourney Weaver looks ravishing and proves she is a great actress. The direction by Ivan Reitman is crisp."
"paulclaassen","7","0","0","3 July 2018"," Good old-fashioned entertainment at its best.
","The film must have been phenomenal for its time. Even at today's standard, the visual effects are still amazing, so it must have been groundbreaking back in '84. It deservedly was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. In a time well before CGI was so advanced, this was incredibly believably done. From the plot to the acting and the music, this is entertainment deluxe. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are legends! And off course, who will ever forget that giant Marshmallow Man!!?"
"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","27 February 2018"," Ghostbusters is good old fashioned 80's fun.
","It's one of those international hits that's turned into a pop cultural phenomenon. There surely isn't a single soul who hasn't heard of Ghostbusters. Most people who know me will automatically think ""why did you buy this?"" as they know I'm not the biggest fan. However, loving the all-female reboot I just had to own the original and give it another shot. New York City is slowly experiencing more sightings of paranormal entities and ghostly spectres, so who you gonna call? Ghostbusters! (Sorry, couldn't resist). It's a story that's really built on the memorable witty characters. The Ghostbusting team divulge in sarcastic banter that provides some much needed humour which is sustained throughout the runtime. Whilst I didn't particularly laugh at any point, it's difficult not to smile with what's presented on screen. Lead Ghostbuster Bill Murray gives a consistently charismatic performance that brings the team alive. Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd also give fun performances. Sigourney Weaver was unusual casting, prefer her being a badass. Rick Moranis...I just can't. I've never really warmed to him in anything. It's an imaginative premise with plenty of creativity embedded in the futuristic technology. The ghosts themselves were well designed, Slimer and the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man have proven to be unforgettable and are constantly referenced still today. The main antagonist being an ancient Babylonian deity was unfortunately not really fully explored. The primary focus was the Ghostbusters themselves to which the film succeeds. Most of the practical effects have held up well, the visual effects not so much. Particularly the animation for the ""Keymaster"" and ""Gatekeeper"" when moving in beast form. I like Ghostbusters, how could I not...I just don't rate it all that much. It's just good old fashioned 80's popcorn fun that everyone can enjoy. Oh, and you shall be singing that darn theme tune hours later..."
"snorlax3111984","8","0","0","8 April 2017"," Pros and Cons of Ghostbusters
","Pros<br/><br/>1. This movie justly has a reputation for being one of the funniest movies of the 80's. That's mostly for great one-liners, particularly from Venkman, but the movie has a lot of funny visual moments like Venkman and Egon backing away from Ray after his proton pack is turned on or Egon getting a high PKE meter reading on a man in the hotel and touching him to see if he's a ghost.<br/><br/>2. Ghostbusters earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Visual Effects. After nearly 33 years the special effects still look relatively good today.<br/><br/>3. Ray Parker Jr. earned an Oscar nomination for the movie's theme song but the other songs are great as well: Cleaning Up The Town, Magic and Saving The Day are tunes well worth listening to. Leonard Bernstein composed a fine music score. I especially liked Dana's theme. Bernstein would go on to compose the score for Ivan Reitman's next film, Legal Eagles and his Legal Eagles score sounded like leftover Ghostbusters score. <br/><br/>4. Most people claim Venkman as their favorite Ghostbuster and understandably so but my favorite is Winston. He has a level-headed quality that is a nice contrast to the others. He may not have all the one-liners like Venkman but he couldn't ask for a better final line: ""I Love This Town!""<br/><br/>5. Yes, Walter Peck had good reason to suspect the Ghostbusters equipment might be dangerous but the fact remains that he could have saved New York a lot of trouble by keeping the ghost trap on. Peck lost all credibility when he told the mayor that completely fabricated story about Ghostbusters using hallucinogenics to make people think ghosts are real. God is it a joy to see Stay-Puft goop splat all over Peck.<br/><br/>6. Great to see a brief appearance by the future Carl Winslow: Reggie Val Johnson<br/><br/>7. Best Line:<br/><br/>Winston: Ray, when somebody asks if you're a god you say YES!<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1. Venkman tells Janine to stop staring at him with her bug eyes but he was talking to her. If you talk to somebody they are going to be looking at you when you're talking.<br/><br/>2. So what happened to the library ghost? Did the library workers just pretend nothing every happened?<br/><br/>3. Since Dana is a professional cellist, it's a shame we never actually hear her play.<br/><br/>4. What's with Slimer attacking the audience? What did we ever do to him?"
"antagonist117","7","0","0","7 October 2014"," ""Ghostbusters"" is as silly and as flawed as its creators, but it is as iconic as them, too
","""Ghostbusters"" is a Three Stooges short by way of National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. Nearly every Stooges routine saw the bumbling trio dressed in the garb of some profession, exterminators one day, delivery men the next, in order to get them through the client's door and into the room with the fine china, which they would promptly dismantle in slapstick fashion. The Stooges as ""paranormal investigators"" could only have been a matter of time. In ""Ghostbusters"" Bill Murray's Dr. Venkman is the Moe of the operation. To him it's all a scam, a way to meet and impress women. He thinks he's savvier than the others, but we know that the alpha Stooge is still a Stooge. The other two, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, are both straight-faced Larrys, because Curly is a one-of-a-kind. Aykroyd and Ramis are easily cowed but earnest, and could almost pass as intellectuals. Then a third Larry is added, Ernie Hudson, or maybe he's a Shemp. Or maybe the analogy breaks down. In any case, much of ""Ghostbusters""'s humor is as old-fashioned and corny as that of the Stooges. ""We should split up."" ""Good idea, we'll do more damage that way."" This tried-and-true joke is followed by the Ghostbusters' destruction of a ritzy dining room in front of a gaggle of horrified blue-bloods, just like the Stooges used to do.<br/><br/>At the same time, a great deal of ""Ghostbusters""'s humor is rooted in its characters. The script's very dry lines are not brilliantly funny in their own right. The famous ones, like ""Don't cross the streams"" and ""Are you the key-master?"" make little sense out of context. But they become funny and quotable because they issue from the mouths of well-drawn characters like the professorial Ramis, the dweebish Rick Moranis, and the comically-sultry Sigourney Weaver. Coauthors Aykroyd and Ramis exhibit a knack for writing these distinctive voices, and the film is perfectly cast even though Murray and Moranis were originally meant to be John Belushi and John Candy.<br/><br/>Yet two of the most celebrated of this group of 80s entertainers are double-edged swords. Murray's comedic persona and Ramis's work for Lampoon are characterized by condescension as much as self- deprecation, and they have down-punching impulses that color the comedy of ""Ghostbusters."" The Stooges never displayed anything like a ""frat boy"" mentality. Venkman's gender-specific mockery of a female-bodied demon toward the end of the film may be in character, but it feels as if we're expected to laugh with him rather than at him as we've mostly done up to this point. To do that would require us to find slurs against women humorous for their own sake, and only the grossest and most simple-minded opponents of political correctness laugh just because a woman is called a bitch and a minx. The dialogue here is tonally wrong and mars an otherwise glorious climax.<br/><br/>Aykroyd is a different matter. Though he gained fame alongside the infamously misogynistic Belushi, he was perhaps the least smarmy of the early SNL cast. He plays his ""Ghostbusters"" role with an almost touching naivety that is perhaps to be expected in light of his real-life passion for the paranormal. Perhaps it is his influence on the screenplay that accounts for Venkman's cynicism dropping away unremarked after two scenes. And perhaps it is his belief in the otherworldly that informs the casting of a government agent as the chief obstacle to the truth. Such plotting is extraordinarily silly, albeit in a different way from the characters' Stooge-like silliness. But when it works, it is equally charming."
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","11 March 2014"," Need a good movie to watch! Who are you gonna to call? Call, Ghostbusters!
","Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis. The movie is pretty original with its concept. The original script call 'Ghostmashers' had a very different story than the film we got. The script had traveling through time, space and other dimensions to fight large ghosts. It was deemed financially impractical and the movie was rewritten. They had written roles specifically for Belushi, John Candy and Eddie Murphy, but were forced to change the script after Belushi died and the latter, when the other actors couldn't commit to the film. The movie was saved from being scrapped by the charm of Bill Murray, who took John Belushi's original role as parapsychologists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray). Most of Bill Murray's lines are ad-libs, and his performance was great. Along with Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), they set up a ghost-catching business after a series of apparent paranormal activities seem to come alive, when an uptown high-rise apartment building becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient Sumerian god, Gozer. Gozer become an ever bigger threat to the entire world and the only team that can stop it, is the Ghostbusters. The visual effects for this movie is amazing. I love the proton packs and how they work. The stop motion animation is bit odd, but still pretty impressing for the time. My favorite monster is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I like how they were able to pull off the man in the suit attacking a city visual effect. This movie has one of the best movie theme songs ever, written and performed by Ray Parker, Jr. Without him, catchphrases like ""Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!"" and ""I ain't afraid of no ghost"", wouldn't be there. The song was a huge hit. Still, the song does sound like Huey Lewis 1983's 'I want a New Drug'. He sued Ray Parker, Jr. for plagiarism, claiming that Parker copied the melody from his 1983 song, but it was settled out of court. In my opinion, the Ghostbusters song will outlive the drug song with each generation of fans. The acting is very good from all of the Ghostbusters. Even the not so attractive, Sigourney Weaver as the love interest, Dana Barrett was made sexy and charming. Even side characters like Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) and William Atherton as the villainous prick, Walter Peck was fun to watch. William Atherton later states that the role kinda ruin his life, because fans would often treated him badly or start fights with him. As a kid, I always thought the man playing Walter Peck was Kenneth Branagh. Another villain Gozer, was originally to appear in the form of Ivo Shandor, a slender, unremarkable man in a suit, played by Paul Reubens; but the role was played by Yugoslav model Slavitza Jovan. Her role was short, but Gozer used to creep me out with that both sex evil form. What is really odd is how a really old deity, know what a Stay-Puft Mashmallow Man was. What I didn't like about the film is how downplay the role of Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is. Had Eddie Murphy accepted the role of Winston, the character was actually meant to appear in more of the film. When Murphy declined the role, the script was re-written to have him appear about half-way through the film to show that they need help to cope with the demand of catching ghost. He seem to lacking a lot of things. Not much chemistry between him and the others Ghostbusters. People often forget him, and remember the first three. He doesn't help move the plot. He is just there to be there. I would love to see more of him. I like how the films are very, very thoroughly researched in the paranormal. Nothing in the film sounds too Techno Babble far off from real exorcists and psychiatrists dealing with possession. In addition, all of the books Ego and Ray mention actually exist. The film produced a popular Animated Adaptation, The Real Ghostbusters in 1986. Then a sequel in 1989. In 2009, a video game adaptation was released. As of this writing, no third movie. With the death of Harold Ramis in 2014. It's most unlikely. Many sequences were shot but removed from the film, but put into the DVD as extra. They're worth watching like the scene where a policeman tries to ticket the Ectomobile, but the car won't let him or Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play two bums that witness Louis being chased by the terror dog. Bill Murray acts like Carl Spackler from 1980's Caddyshack in this scene, so check it out. An awful lot of swearing and sexual innuendo for a family comedy. Not to mention the fairly obvious sexual symbolism of the key and the gate. Some children might fear the Demonic Possession, and the ghosts. Surprising there is lot of people think the movie is a metaphor to a lot of things like the war between Religious Vs Science because the scientists kill the Oldest known civilization 'God' with nuclear weapons. The reason why some people got angry of this, is because historian often state out that the Hebrew Yahweh AKA God is often model from the Sumerian folklore. Then there are people that think the film is pointing to an Illuminati threat. The character of Walter Peck can seem like liberal government bureaucrat who barges into a small business and his interference causes disaster that some conservatives find funny. Of course, the homo-erotic implications of men fighting with phallic science-stick. It's pretty Freudian. The movie is smart and deep, even pointing out if Ghost have civil rights, but I think these people are over-thinking the film, but I do like their discussions. It's worth talking about, but in my opinion, just enjoy the film and see it as it supposed to be. A really good supernatural comedy. Overall: They came. We saw. The movie kicks ass."

","Although the Movie was based on a script, the actual basic storyline was lifted directly from the novel SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD, by Diane Duane, which was released just the year before Ghostbusters. Also set in downtown New York City in modern times, SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD tells the story of the boy Kit and the girl Nita (changed to Zuul the Gatekeeper & Vinzclortho the Keymaster in Ghostbusters) who open a portal to an evil dimension on the roof of a skyscraper which allows an ancient deity called the Starsnuffer (called Gozer in Ghostbusters) and his minions to enter our world. In the grand finale of the book, the evil deity has taken on the form of a massive living statue which wreaks havoc on the city, which in turn is defeated by the most famous statues in the city who have come to life (depicted in Ghostbusters I & II as the Staypuft Marshmellow Man and the Statue of Liberty)."
"jcbutthead86","10","0","0","9 November 2012"," An Excellent And Hilarious Classic That Brilliantly Mixes Comedy,SCI-FI And Supernatural Thrills.
","Ghostbusters is one of the funniest films of all time that combines a great cast,script and special effects mixing Comedy and the Supernatural to amazing effect that makes this film an all-time classic.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters tells the story of three college professors Peter Venkman(Bill Murray),Ray Stantz(Dan Aykroyd)and Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis)who work in the field of the paranormal and psychology. When the trio is fired from the college campus,Peter,Ray,and Egon decide to set up their own business as Ghostbusters. While the Ghostbusters have their success,they'll soon have to deal with ghosts in an apartment building on central park west and these ghosts won't be easy to capture.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is a classic film because it balances different genres,a great script and unique special effects. I love genre mash-up films and Ghostbusters is one of my favorite mash-up films because like some of the best mash-up films Ghostbusters successfully mixes together very different movie genres to amazing effect throwing in everything but the kitchen sink but never becoming uneven or unfocused achieving it's goal in entertaining viewers with a classic that is hilarious,unforgettable and will be re-watchable for all times and generations. Comedy and the Supernatural blend well together in this film because of the great and memorable interactions of the main characters and the funny situations the characters go through. When the film is funny it remains funny and never slows down and when the film becomes suspenseful and spooky it works as well. When most films that mix together different genres and fail this one succeeds and succeeds with greatness and originality that has is masterful. Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were among the biggest Comedy stars during the 80s and the three actors make the characters Peter,Ray and Egon memorable,likable and iconic. The pursuit of the Ghosts and their interactions with other characters as well as each other is great,you feel like the characters really believe in what they're doing,which is catching ghosts. Peter,Ray and Egon's banter, interactions,lines and various conversations with each other and other characters is hilarious and quotable,combining and mixing great laughs sarcasm,wit,smarts and sometimes deadpan Humor in the scenes. Most of the lines will be in you head after watching the film. Ghostbusters is also one few films to never spawn imitators,copycats or remakes. I guess the reason that never happened is because Ghostbusters is a unique film all it's own that can never be repeated or duplicated. One of the things I also love about Ghostbusters is that the film while it creates it's own world of Fantasy and Science Fiction it's still very much grounded in reality thanks to the characters and showing the city of New York and it's people as they love and embrace the Ghostbusters. The screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is original,funny and genius writing great dialog that's memorable,well-written and smart and has scenes that are well-placed and timed and great. Mixing laughs and special effects isn't an easy task but Reitman,Aykroyd and Ramis balance it out where Comedy and special effects don't override each other. It's Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon meets Poltergeist. The only films that I can think that mix Comedy and special effects well is Ghostbusters 2 and the Back To The Future trilogy. The Action in the film is great and intense and during the Action scenes there is wonderful laughs and fantastic moments that will stick with fans and viewers. The special effects in the film are excellent and still hold up to this very day. It's obvious every cent on the special effects especially towards the end. I won't spoil it for you but the very big special effects shot at the end is one of the funniest and surprising endings in film history that will make your jaw drop and have you roar with laughter and is one of the main reasons Ghostbusters is a classic.<br/><br/>The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Bill Murray is excellent and at his dead-pan best as Peter Venkman,the sarcastic,womanizing doctor who is smart and clever and Murray has some of the funniest lines in the film. Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as Ray Stantz,bringing a funny optimistic,child-like glee to the role. Sigourney Weaver does an amazing and sexy job as Dana Barrett,Venkman's love interest and has a great chemistry with Murray. Harold Ramis does a great job as Egon Spengler a scientist who's the straight man in the Ghostbusters. Rick Moranis is terrific and hilarious as Louis Tully,Dana's next door neighbor. Annie Potts is wonderful as Janine,the secretary of the Ghostbusters. William Atherton is great as Walter Peck,a representative of the Enivormental Protection Agency. Ernie Hudson does a fantastic job as Winston Zeddmore,the newest member of the Ghostbusters. David Margulies also does a fabulous job as Mayor Lenny,the Mayor of New York City.<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman does a great job with the film,bringing a lot energy and imagination to the film. Reitman directs the Comedy well and also brings a sense of dread to the film when things get scary. Amazing direction,Reitman<br/><br/>Elmer Bernstein's score is excellent at times very spooky,creepy and at other times lighthearted and optimistic. What a great score. And the soundtrack has great songs including the great iconic theme song Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. Magic by Mick Smiley,Savin' The Day by Alessi,In The Name Of Love by The Thompson Twins,I Can Wait Forever by Air Supply,Hot Night by Laura Branigan Disco Inferno by The Trammps and Cleanin' up the town by The Bus Boys. A fantastic soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Supernatural Films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Ghostbusters,an hilarious and unforgettable classic from beginning to end that you will watch again and again and is a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"hellraiser7","10","0","0","4 November 2012"," There's something strange in the neighborhood
","I'm a kid from the 80's and this was one of the first films I saw, this is one of my all time favorite films. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon it had an animated series called ""The Real Ghostbusters"" which is one of my favorite animated shows and was the source that lead me to see the film; along with it's underrated sequel series ""Extreme Ghostbusters"". There were also toys, video games, a sequel which I like, comic books there aren't many films now that can really generate this kind of phenomena, especially one just like any great ghost story is timeless.<br/><br/>This film isn't entirely concerned about plot, even though there is one the whole film builds up to that the further it goes. It's really focused on the characters and what happens. I really love how it has the proper balance of special effects and comedy, both are used the right way and the right reasons. I really like this fantasy world the film has created where it feels one foot in reality but also one foot away. The special effects are just great because their practical, they've created some memorable ghosts like the trademark ghost Slimer, But the ones that impressed me the most are Gozer and the demon hounds whom are the main villains the film builds up to and they don't disappoint they made me nervous when I was a kid, Gozer having being a god which means limitless power so yeah that's a tough customer. However I also really loved seeing that otherworldly temple behind them which just looks beautiful and eerily strange, reminiscent of something out of Lovecroftian tales. I really love the weapons of the Ghostbusters those proton packs and traps, seeing how they work made me want to get one. And lets not forget the music which is just great there a plenty of memorable songs like the infamous Ghostbusters theme which is no surprise one of my favorites movie themes, however my favorite song in the film is actually ""Save the Day"", it's just one of those songs that really make you get going.<br/><br/>However it's the characters how they deliver their lines and how they talk to one another that really drives this film. Their funny because they play it straight, their talking and acting like regular people would, and all have unique persona's. We see a barrage of clever jokes, one liners, and quotes that are all delivered at the right timing.<br/><br/>Peter Venkman played brilliantly by one of my favorite actors Bill Murray. What I like is the fact that his character has a really sarcastic, smart alec , slightly slacker mannerism (though he could be smart sometimes if he wants to be). He just has a lot of key moments from the time when he interacts with his girlfriend Dana (Sigurney Weaver) who unfortunately is possessed by one of Gozer's demon dogs Zool was really funny, or even a small moment when he encounters Slimer and reacts a bit with nervousness then in the aftermath he delivers that infamous sarcastic line ""He slimed me."" Raymond Stantz: Dan Ackroyd is at his best in this one, shame like with most comedians he never really retained most of that comedic energy again. His character is well a geek, super smart but has a sort of childlike naivety attached to him. I loved that moment when he interacts with Gozer which believe it or not is my favorite quote from the movie; ""As a representative of New York City, I ask you to cease and desist all supernatural activity, and return to your point of origin or the nearest parallel dimension."" I know that seems to be both the smartest and dumbest thing to say, but then again what the heck else can one say to a ancient evil Samarian God.<br/><br/>Egon Spenglaer: Harold Ramis plays this character with dry wit. He's basically all brain which might make it a little difficult when it comes to fruitful interaction. Like some of those little moments with Secretary Janine Malniz (Annie Potts) who flirts with him from time to time but never really gets him which I though was sweet and funny in a quirky sense (this of course is built more in both animated series).<br/><br/>This film is funny from it's small subtle moments that work in a big way as well as it's big moments that have the equal affect but in a small way (if you catch my drift). One of my favorite moments are Egon's interview with Lousi Tully (Rick Moranis) who is possessed by another demon dog of Gozer's Vince. It's just funny seeing the looks both Janine and Egon display when Vince talks about a couple of Gozer's past forms and what he, she or whatever Gozer was did at the time. Egon and Janine's faces reflect exactly what I'm thinking at that moment ""What in the hell is he talking about."" What Vince says is the truth but just the strangeness of the content and the way his says it is just downright funny.<br/><br/>And of course the big moment when the infamous Stay Puff marshmallow man shows up. I just laughed my heard off, obviously a small homage and satirical parody on those big monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong. Mr. Stay Puff is one of my favorite super sized monsters, he's both cutely funny but also menacing and scary at the same time.<br/><br/>If you guys have any ghosts, you can call and trust these guys.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","So many things came together at the right time to make ""Ghostbusters"" a hit, but in the end, it's just unbelievably quotable. This is one of the reasons it's become something larger than just an effects comedy (that, and a bulletproof Ray Parker, Jr. song). It's the convergence of comically-gifted players, great writing, high production values and a director who knows his stuff that makes this a classic. I love the attention to detail put into the costumes and equipment, and it's always fun to see cosplayers at conventions and on Halloween who have gone to great lengths to make their costumes screen-accurate.<br/><br/>The movie was made with enthusiasm, and it shows with every viewing. It's as durable and time-tested its titular pop song. There's a good reason why people (me) always go on and on about this movie, or drop lines into everyday conversation.

","Three unemployed parapsychology professors set up shop as a unique ghost removal service.<br/><br/>I had never seen Ghostbusters two days ago. It wasn't because I didn't want to, or because it looked too kiddie, but because other movies got in the way. I always told myself I was going to watch it: tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or the following day after that, but I never did.. Finally, yesterday to be exact, I watched it off of Netflix and it was more than I hoped for... Ghostbusters is just genius. There really isn't any more explanation. The lines were hit right, it was a breakthrough in terms of it's special effects and film-making, and it remains a classic. I cannot believe I haven't seen it beforehand. It's completely fun, and unbelievably clever. I'm not going to run through what adds up to make a movie, but only to explain what I liked, and that's all you'll need in order to see it, if you haven't already...<br/><br/>The humor. It's surely not a comedy-driven film, but it surely is funny. Everybody packed in lots of witty one-liners and such, but Bill Murray is the man who does it best. The film is somewhat of a parody of films in general, but packs in a lot more than parodies usually do. If Ghostbusters had no comedy, then Ghostbusters wouldn't be Ghostbusters; plain and simple... <br/><br/>Bill Murray. Yes, him. He basically drives the film itself packing it in with much more than it needs to be. His one-liners were hilarious, and his antics were dry but comedic. If it weren't for him (which him also tying in with the comedy) the film wouldn't be THE film...<br/><br/>FUN! The movie is pure fun, and it was made for the 80's. It was a breakthrough in everything possible, and it seemed to have influenced much of what we have today. It's comedy was straight up hilarious. Bill Murray drives the film with his one-liners and his dry wit. The 'supporting' cast, which lines up behind Bill Murray, also shoots the film with their infectious chemistry and charisma, and makes the film what it is. If you don't like Ghostbusters, you cannot like anything. It's more than just a ""kid"" film, it's all things possible. It remains one of my favorite 80's movies, and I JUST saw it.<br/><br/>8/10."

","It's pretty to cool to watch an older movie that still can keep you interested the entire time. I'm sure most people have seen this movie several times but it came out four years before I was born so it makes sense I hadn't yet seen it.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was funny. It developed very fast and didn't give much of a build up, which isn't necessarily a problem. Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd were amazing. Bill Murray has always been hilarious and it reminded me of an older version of him in Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Sigourney Weaver. She looked very youthful and beautiful in this movie.

","The brainchild of co-screenwriter and co-star Dan Aykroyd, ""Ghost Busters"" was a pivotal movie in the life of this reviewer, helping to turn him into the movie nut that he became. It's one of the most enduring and endearing contributions to the popular culture of the 1980's, complete with tons of witty lines and its catchy hit title song.<br/><br/>The story, for those out there who are newcomers to this classic, deals with three paranormal researchers who find it a blessing in disguise when a university kicks them out. Now they're able to go into business for themselves - the business of trapping and storing all spooks in NYC. We have Bill Murray as ""the mouth"", Peter Venkman, Aykroyd as ""the heart"", Ray Stantz, co-screenwriter Harold Ramis as ""the brain"", Egon Spengler, and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddmore (gotta love these names), whom they need to hire when the three original guys realize they need an extra man.<br/><br/>There are lots of iconic bits and images to continue enjoying - the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the ""terror dogs"", the Ecto-1 vehicle, the opening commotion in the New York Public Library, the final battle with all powerful Gozer, the Ghost Busters' initial gig taking care of pesky green guy Slimer, etc. It was a testament to just how big this movie would break when even in the early going black market T shirts were being sold with sayings from the movie printed on them. The bouncy pop soundtrack is a joy, as is a score by Elmer Bernstein that alternates between horror and humour just as the movie itself does.<br/><br/>And ""Ghost Busters"" indeed stands tall as a big budget Hollywood example of how a movie can be both scary and funny in equal measure. The cast couldn't be better; Sigourney Weaver is radiant as love interest Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis often hysterical as nerdy neighbour Louis Tully, who riffs like crazy in a priceless speech during a party. William Atherton is just right as snooty nemesis (and foil to Venkman) Walter Peck of the E.P.A. Annie Potts is just a hoot as deadpan receptionist Janine. Lots of other familiar faces in supporting roles and bits, too: David Margulies, Steven Tash, Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, Alice Drummond, Jordan Charney, Timothy Carhart, John Rothman, Reginald VelJohnson, and Jean Kasem, with Roger Grimsby, Larry King, Joe Franklin, and Casey Kasem seen or heard as themselves. There's the occasional dodgy special effect, but mostly the effects are fun to watch.<br/><br/>""Ghost Busters"", one of the great NYC movies, keeps holding up well on repeat viewings and never loses its appeal.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Well, watching this back in the day was a hoot. It was kid's life blown up into a big exciting adventure: the laser gadgetry, being chased around by ghosts that only slimed you, cozy life in the old abandoned fire station that felt like a big sleepover in someone's attic, the sense of camaraderie between science geeks that looked like they could be your classmates after 10 years time. The shucks demeanor towards danger. The sloppiness that made it seem like everything was being made up on the way. There was no plan, no program. Responsibility was fun.<br/><br/>It stroke a wonderful balance between playing around and wanting to grow up. It made adult life seem positively exhilarating, like it was Monday and you had to wait all week for that Sunday visit at the funpark.<br/><br/>Watching it again, I'm surprised it holds up so well and as more than a misty-eyed memory. The recipe is simple: all those things referencing experience everyone knows and associates with fun from childhood, plus a huge electric light show about the same.<br/><br/>The showdown happens way up in the air beneath swirling clouds, a showdown with mythological evil. The audience watches transfixed from down below, up at cinematic fireworks. They cheer our geeks on like they were movie stars. And when evil finally manifests, it is straight from the imaginative mind - on reflection, a mind bombarded by TV ads.<br/><br/>It might not seem like much today but it was a show alright and about the pleasure of watching movies.<br/><br/>And lastly the puffy giant monster, a Godzilla for the consumerist 80's. Kids would recognize it as Bertie Bassett, the mascot of a liquorice candy brand, dads as the Michelin Man, moms as Pillsbury's Doughboy. Now Gozer was originally conceived as as a plain guy in a business suit, corporate evil. Instead they took it up a notch: evil that you also know and consume. Clever."

","If you grew up in the eighties you likely have a soft spot for the 1984 film ""Ghost Busters"". The surprising thing is that, more than 25 years later, it still stands up as a successful melding of comedy and special effects.<br/><br/>The story blends science and fantasy in a way that's both believable and entertaining. Meanwhile, keeping the film semi-realistic serves to ground the fantastic events, thus making it easier to suspend belief. The special effects, while far surpassed by today's efforts, nevertheless paint a convincing picture.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, the film excels in that regard. Comedy legends Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis & Moranis all contribute fine performances, often underplaying the humour to excellent effect. Sigourney Weaver adds a welcome distaff element, as does memorable supporting player Annie Potts. Also among the support, Ernie Hudson & William Atherton prove to have been well cast.<br/><br/>The direction by Ivan Reitman is well done, if not particularly outstanding. That being said, he should be commended for coaxing authentic performances of out his actors in an effects-heavy film like this. Speaking of the effects, they were the source of one of the film's two Oscar nominations; the other being Ray Parker Jr.'s classic theme.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Ghost Busters"" is a well-crafted comedy that deserves to be remembered for years to come. The sequel may have been somewhat underwhelming but the original, with its deadpan humour and iconic visuals, is truly deserving of the designation ""classic""."

","Ghost Busters is supposedly one of the greatest comedies ever to hit the big screen. I'll admit although the special effects are old, they still are a marvel to look at from so many years ago. I also enjoyed the actors who played in this movie I feel that they all did really well at their jobs. A lot of them had funny moments. My only complaint is that I did not have enough laughs. I felt that there were parts that were supposed to be funny but seemed liked they were out of place.<br/><br/>Starring as the awesome four in this film are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Murray is good at being a smart mouthed ""doctor"". Aykroyd is good at making himself look like a complete science nerd with the way he talks. Ramis' character, although somewhat awkward is funny to watch too. As for Hudson, I've always enjoyed the way he makes his character look and act. Even Sigourney Weaver from Alien (1979) has some interesting moments.<br/><br/>Together these actors come out on top and make the film very enjoyable. The only problem I didn't seem to understand is the humor in this film. Yeah it was funny for the most part but some moments seemed out of context, or just plain weird. Either it's me because I'm from another generation or it's just that it wasn't that funny. I'm not sure. When I heard people talk about Ghost Busters I expected to have gut busting laughter. I did laugh but not a lot and not out loud. For a movie of this magnitude of fans, you'd think it would be hard to resist, but I didn't cling to me like it did to other viewers. <br/><br/>I liked the music that was played in the background. Composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, it has jokey attitude, which helps this movie with its comedic moments. I liked how the tuba played as the main title came on. It was because of that intro, I got a better understanding of how serious Director Ivan Reitman wanted this film to be.<br/><br/>The special effects are still lovable in this film. Seeing the Ghost Busters' use their equipment, such as the beam guns, brings back fond memories of watching Disney's Black Hole (1979). My favorite moment is when Bill Murray's character has an encounter with a green slime ghost. It's fun to watch and to imagine of how at the time, something like that could have been pulled off. Of course there are parts that are much better than this but I don't want to give them away. Overall I enjoyed the film, even with the setbacks I had when it ended.<br/><br/>Ghost Busters is a funny science fiction comedy with some really unique special effects. Director Ivan Reitman picked a good cast for this film and they work well together to boot."
"estreet-eva","8","0","0","6 December 2011"," Wears surprisingly well.
","Meant as a popcorn comedy feature better than 25 years ago when it debuted, the Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd written tale holds up almost shockingly well despite its age. This partially due to Bill Murray's smarmy, sneering, cynic character which also makes comedies such as ""Stripes"" and ""Groundhog Day"" equally re-watchable. It is also due to how Reitman captures NYC's bad ol' days of crime, grit and lawlessness before Disney conquered Times Square. New York in those days was the most likely spawning group of supernatural evil and adding ghosts to the rats, and roaches seemed like an easy fit. The movie also still works because it was fairly edgy with Murray's Venkman torturing one of his male college students in an attempt to bed a female student (Jennifer Runyon was well worth the academic censure). Later he shows up for a date with Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett apparently with Thorazine in tow which he uses to sedate the possessed cellist he finds (if she wasn't possessed, what was he planning to do with it?) There is talk of the existence of god, a marshmallow man burns to death and the famous line ""yes, this man has no dick"" is uttered. Although awkward when viewed with younger DVD-watchers, the film's spice keeps it fresh even after a quarter century on the shelf. Definitely a very good choice for as a Halloween rental."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","0","2 October 2011"," One of the memorable films from my childhood
","I remember when this movie first came out. I was in year 7 and I really wanted to go and see it. I liked the symbol of the movie and was so fascinated by it that I wanted a t-shirt and everything. While at one stage I considered this to be a pretty boring movie, when I look back at it it still is a classic with some quite memorable scenes.<br/><br/>The reviewers commented that this movie was the first to mix good special effects and comedy successfully, but I really don't think it makes that much. I personally don't think that special effects make a movie, and looking beyond the special effects of this movie I really find that there is very little there. To our standards the special effects were not that crash hot, but then this movie is early 80's meaning that we can't expect too much. However, for a movie starring some relatively big names (Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd etc) the acting does have a lot to be desired. Personally, I thought that the best actor in this film was Rick Moranis, who plays an accountant (though not necessarily socially inept, more very eccentric in his own, special, unique way).<br/><br/>This movie is about three scientists who are kicked out of university and thus start up a business, Ghostbusters, to exterminate any ghosts in the city. Coincidentally there are lots of ghosts appearing because some Babylonian God is returning to Earth. What I noticed about this film though was the concept of science vs faith. We have the spiritual word of the ancient times trying to break back into our world, and the only thing that is able to stop it is science. Long have ghosts been in the realm of the supernatural, meaning that they have been beyond our power to deal with, but now, as with many of the things in our world, science has come along to solve the problem, and that is what is essentially happening in this film, science is taking its place as our new god.<br/><br/>We see this a lot in the movie, especially at the end as the ghostbusters arrive to cheering crowds. There is nothing special about them beyond their power packs and their knowledge of the supernatural, though they make it known that their knowledge gives them power of the ghosts, something that the normal citizens do not have. However it appears that from the beginning they are stumbling around blindly as well, using untested equipment, and bluffing their way through pretending they know something of which others are ignorant.<br/><br/>My opinion swings regarding this movie, at first I thought it was great, later I thought it was boring, and now I would have to put it in the realm of a classic 80's movie. However, the one thing that brings to mind is the computer game that was released around the time of the film. While the film would not stand up to the likes of some truly classic films, the computer game literally took the world by storm. Many games these days come and go within 6 months, however the Ghostbusters simply seemed to have staying power. It was a relatively easy game, straight forward, and challenging enough to always bring to back to it when you were board. These days, while I may remember the film, it is the computer game that always sticks in my mind."

The theme song is known even by non-fans, there was a great sequel, action figures, video games, a cartoon series... everyone in this went on to big things (some were already big). You do not get many horror comedies that appeal to people outside the genre, but this one does (along with the sequel).<br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman knew what he was doing. Although perhaps better known for his comedies, he actually started out working with master of horror David Cronenberg. When he came to ""Ghostbusters"", he had every intention of making it scary. And he succeeded. Perhaps not generally thought of as horror because of its wide appeal, there are some legitimately scary moments. The librarian early on? Quite a shock!<br/><br/>And that is it.

","In the summer of 1984, two horror-comedy films came out, in direct competition with each other- Gremlins and Ghostbusters. Both became blockbusters. I grew up watching and loving both of them, but Gremlins is my favourite. Nevertheless, with Halloween nearly here, I've been reviewing horror-related movies/TV episodes/whatever, and Ghostbusters became a must-see again.<br/><br/>In this movie, three scientists in New York City have found a way to catch and contain pesky ghosts. It's horror-related in that it deals with ghosts, but there's really no horror here. Ghostbusters is first and foremost a comedy. It's not non-stop, laugh out loud humour, but there's some good humour in jokes like book stacking and ""Get her!"", as well as Ray's enthusiasm for a building and car of dubious value. The part where they catch Slimer, their first real job, is perhaps the best part of the movie for humour. Eventually they come to the big job, which makes the movie feel big- stopping the end of the world, with a Mesopotamian god called Gozer coming to New York. The Gozer and Zuul material makes for good myth, but it probably would have been more fun if they had found real ancient gods to use in this movie. Gozer was made up for Ghostbusters. They do tie in Gozer's coming with Biblical legends of the end of the world, particularly with the dead rising. Meanwhile, making Gozer a marshmallow man was inventive.<br/><br/>This movie made me admire Bill Murray. He brings some colour to the movie, with one character comparing him to a game show host. On this re-watch, however, he didn't come across as totally likable. He's not an honest man, and when his ex-boss calls him a ""poor scientist,"" I couldn't help but think that was probably true. Nevertheless, his warning that cats and dogs may one day live together should be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Issues with the movie start with the whole concept- isn't it cruel to imprison ghosts forever? Why does the Environmental Protection Agency always have to be the bad guy? Is environmental protection necessarily sinister? The part where Gozer tries to kill the ghostbusters for not being gods was funny- but why didn't they die? On the whole, though, Gozer is a good villain, and Ghostbusters is a fun, memorable movie.<br/><br/>Happy Halloween."

","After getting kicked out of University three scientists get their own place and create an organization fighting supernatural phenomenon.<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman's 1984 smash does little wrong with a suave portrayal of the supernatural in what must be the most recognized fantasy comedy of the last 30 years.<br/><br/>Almost every living thing (human or none human) could pick up the classic Ray Parker Jr tune without too much trouble recalling the lyrics and quite possibly the dance moves But though this picture is enthralling, sublimely musical and justification of an all too familiar genre, it is Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd who make this picture what it is, which is simply unique at its own accord and stomps all over rival attempts at fantasy comedy.<br/><br/>Fantasy comedies are perhaps one of the hardest genres to tackle as diving into a supernatural world is one thing but making the context of what appears on screen is another. Pixar films tackle these with ease such as Oscar winning Wall-E or other alien hit smash Men in Black. But then they can fail spectacularly like parody Disaster Movie or ordinary glossed with fantasy My Super ex-girlfriend.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters takes the concept of ghosts and puts a marvellously humorous entertaining spin on with some flashing representations of ghosts. The green slime monster is one of the finest touches of this film, though only on screen for minimal time he makes an impact with the sheer grotesque nature and rebellious attitude. The formation likewise is striking and instantly memorable. However what steels the limelight for the film is the rather weird but undeniably inclusion of the film's final monster, a towering icon that brings fear and quiet humour to a devastating and riveting climax Bill Murray brings that wonderful wit to his character Peter Venkman here, using his talented timing and smart deadpan expressions to win over the audience. Aykroyd also brings that zany element to his Doctor as well, and Weaver rounds it off nicely with a temptress that will please any older male viewer. Dana's hard to get nature is wonderfully comic but insanely romantic also.<br/><br/>The plot can occasionally wave with some loopholes in the context of the finale and the fact that the events seem limited in a small space may raise eyebrows. But the humour and sheer brilliance of the encoded fantasy will delight viewers of any age and with comic legends Murray and Aykroyd you can't do much better in a fantasy comedy."

","Some of the most memorable characters in comedy were created by Saturday Night Live legends Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. Ghostbusters was the second time Murray teamed up with SCTV writer Harold Ramis, and combined with Aykroyd, they made a comedy classic that still holds up well today. Kids who grew up in the 80's remember the Ghostbusters mania that swept the nation. My brother had all the toys, and I think we still have the Ghostbusters fire house model in our attic. It is even popular with young kids today.<br/><br/>Murray, Ramis, and Aykroyd play a group of paranormal scientists whose theories and experiments are looked down upon in the Academic world. Murray plays Peter Venkman, the sarcastic member of the trio. Ramis is Egon Spengler, a dead serious yet hilarious scientist. Aykroyd is the closest thing to a straight man but he has an almost childlike enthusiasm for his job that makes him amusing. After they see a ghost for the first time, their University terminates their grant, and they are forced to go into business for themselves. Just when it looks like they are about to go bankrupt, ghost fever grips New York City, and they become huge celebrities. Funny supporting cast members include Rick Moranis of SCTV fame, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson as Winston, the fourth Ghostbuster. Eddie Murphy was originally considered for the role of Winston, but I'm glad he turned it down. 80's Eddie Murphy was hilarious, but it would have been too much to have another comedy giant in the cast, especially when he's introduced so late into the picture.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters had great special effects for its time; I must say even today's computer animation could not do much better. Memorable ghosts include Slimer, who got his own TV show, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. The film's main strength and the cause of its lasting appeal is the cast, however. Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis form a terrific ensemble cast and are some of the most memorable characters in comedy. The deadpan delivery of the jokes amongst the absurdity is hilarious. Just a sample of a great joke: ""Why worry? Each one of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back."" The film has a cynical New Yorker attitude that makes the film even more endearing, and funny when you consider that half the film was made in California. In one of my favorite scenes, Rick Moranis is attacked by a demon, and all the witnesses just go back to eating their food when it's over. There are too many good one-liners and jokes to mention, and the writers take great pride in turning ""slime"" into a verb! Ghostbusters spawned one sequel, several cartoon series, and video games (a new Ghostbusters game is coming out soon), but none of them has been or will be as memorable as the first movie."

Ghostbusters was a conglomeration of static and repeated sets and scenery, schticks, slapstick, and ultimate ghost-ridding conclusions.

","Before the movie, before Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray went beyond Saturday Night, there was the live-action Saturday Morning Series called The Ghost Busters. Originally from Filmation's live-action library, The Ghost Busters starred famous F-Troop team Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch as Jake Kong and Eddie Spencer, and Tracy their gorilla. Unlike most of Filmation's live series, The Ghost Busters focused a bit more on humour than just being action with comedy relief. Basically, loosely using the 'Mission Impossible' schtick (heavily used in Saturday Morning spy shows) to obtain their assignments. Jake, Eddie and Tracy would deal with the likes of demented spirits, wacky vampires and other spectre and ghouls from haunting the mortal world. Humour was used a lot in the show, sometimes through classic visual stunts or puns. Case in point, when dealing with a vampire, Jake finds out one thing they fear is a wooden 'stake', whereas Tracy pulls out a wooden 'steak.' And when Eddie attempts to disclaim Tracy's attempt, he ends up getting a splinter from the 'steak.' However, because it was Saturday Morning TV, The Ghost Busters normally vanquished rogue spirits with a Polaroid-esquire device called the Dematerializer. As the name suggested, when fired at a ghost, the screen would appear with a blue screen effect and the ghost would 'dematerialize' out from the mortal world. Though I believe it only had one season in 1975, the series was often ran in syndication on Sunday mornings as well. Ironically, though the name was used for the film, there was no real connection between it and the series. Despite well-box office reviews, many still felt the Akroyd and Murray film did not capture the same fun as the original series. So in 1986, Filmation revived the series in animated form: Filmation's Ghostbusters. Here, however, the offspring of the original Ghost Busters and Tracy dealt with a nemesis called Prime Evil (think Terminator merged with a specter) and his ghoulish legion of ghosts. Whereas in the original series, the Ghost Busters simply obtained assignments from the mysterious Agent Zero. What really made Ghost Busters appealing for it's time, as with most Filmation Live Action, was it did have great storytelling, and really made the limited special effects work. Also for F-Troop fans, the comedy stilings of Tucker and Storch made the show enjoyable, and it was a wonder Filmation didn't consent with Hanna-Barbera for a spot on the Scooby-Doo Movies (since they aired about the same year). I'd definitely recommend this product for not only fans of the classic series, but for those who loved Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, as well as a new generation of viewers."

","I recently posted on one of the boards here my top 5 comedies ever and GHOSTBUSTERS made the list. And this was not some off-the-top-of-my-head choice b/c I couldn't think of anything else. It was solid! I hadn't seen the film in a while, but it remained fresh in my memory as being utterly funny and special. Being an 80s movie, it's got that general 80s vibe going (for it, IMHO). But yet it doesn't feel or seem nearly as dated as a lot of 80s movies, I think mainly b/c of how amazing the special effects are and how plain funny it is. I think the special effects are the key: they make GHOSTBUSTERS seem otherworldly, like you are watching a parallel universe version of New York City, but still New York. It's just different from the typical 80s movie, not just in terms of plot, but also in terms of look, tone, and feel.<br/><br/>GHOSTBUSTERS is just plain funny. At the heart of all the humor is one Mr. Bill Murray. The man is a comic genius! He's so smarmy, sardonic, and cocksure that he exudes hilarity. These so-called comic actors nowadays have barely a speck of the comic delivery and timing that Murray possesses. It's really kind of sad b/c Murray should have been getting Oscar nods for stuff like GHOSTBUSTERS, not LOST IN TRANSLATION. It's a shame that a great comic actor has to resort being in dramatic hogwash in order to get recognized by the bozos at the Academy Awards! <br/><br/>Murray has sterling support in the form of Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, and Ernie Hudson. Actually, Ackroyd and Ramis wrote the screenplay for GHOSTBUSTERS and have spun a confident yarn. It's amazing that they can believably deliver these lines with straight faces! ""Gozer""! ""the Keymaster""! ""Zhoul!"" The director Ivan Reitman has done a superlative job. The climactic ending is one of the best ever put to screen. Many comedies, heck movies in general, tend to fall apart in the 3rd act, but not GHOSTBUSTERS. The conclusion is just as satisfying as the first part of the film.<br/><br/>One of the funniest, most confident films that you will ever see in any genre! GHOSTBUSTERS!"

Which it was created by Dan Arkroyd (The Blues Brothers, Coneheads, Dragnet), who had originally written different script and the premise took place in a future instead of present day. Which Arkroyd re-written the script with Harold Ramis (Analyze This, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) to fleshing out the characters more.

"vip_ebriega","9","0","0","17 May 2008"," Classic 80's comedy.
","My Take: Hilarious comedy carried by a hilarious ensemble cast, gimmicky effects, and big laughs. <br/><br/>A classic for bringing both special effects and comedy together successfully, GHOSTBUSTERS actually still holds up today. It's still a funny and elaborate fantasy with some fun special effects (which may not be as good in today's standards, but still enjoyable) and some very humorous performances by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as the three leads. It's not as great as it might have been, but what do I know, this one is still very good.<br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman keeps things as lively as possible. The early special effects work on creatures and spirits (including the infamous Marshmallow Man) are fun to look at. They're not as good as today's, and these may be even considered low-tech, but they have something some of today's special effects have, and that's imagination. It took some imagination to create strange wonders as these, and they're worth looking at.<br/><br/>Other than special effects, the real appeal of GHOSTBUSTERS comes from the actors and the rest of the crew. Lead actors, as well as supporting characters like the ones played by Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson, are very well played. The script is finely rewarding with funny one-liners to great jokes. It's also flavored with parodies (THE EXORCIST mainly) and some in-jokes. GHOSTBUSTERS proves that, even with the distractions of special effects, a comedy can still be funny at the same time.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."

","Ah, Ghostbusters, a movie that took your imagination to it's limits. From sucking up ghosts with proton packs, to a giant walking marshmallow mascot going on a rampage though New York, Ghostbusters is considered to be a childhood favourite by many. The movie was such a success back in the 80's. Much fallowed the films release such as a sequel, a cartoon series, a line of video games and action figures. Everything about Ghostbusters is fun to watch weather it be watching a ghost get grabbed by the proton streams and being sucked into a ghost trap with amazing special effects, or it be hearing the siren from the ecto-1 as it speeds passed, not to mention the awesome theme song. The gadgets that the Ghostbusters are equipped with are also very cool my favourite being the ghost vacuum that is on the roof of the ecto-1. The Ghostbusters face off against Gozer and her minions and must stop them from destroying the city Having all that said, Ghostbusters is a movie that people look back on and remember the feeling they got after watching it for the first time as kids, and that feeling is a feeling no one will ever forget."

","I have loved this film for as long as I can remember and it is an absolute joy to watch. It is humorous, action-packed, and thrilling. The movie itself has some of the funniest actors alive in it and they all perform well. And the movie is based around a concept which can interest millions. It is no wonder this film is a cult classic.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Ivan Reitman, the same genius behind films like Stripes and Meatballs. The film is written by both Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis, who both star in it. Ghostbusters is about a group of scientists who form a profession about hunting, tracking, and trapping ghosts! Exactly what the title insists! The story is terrific! Full of so many laughs, I get a kick out of the movie every time I watch it again and again. Some things are absolutely absurd but they are funny and that is the entire point.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch among the three main Ghostbusters. Bill Murray, one of the funniest men alive, delivers one of his funniest performances. His serious, stylish, and absurdly-uptight attitude in this movie is funny as heck. Dan Akroyd is funny as well! Harold Ramis is hilarious! He is so serious with his job. He treats everything he does with such precise attention and importance. Like when the girl asks him what hobbies he has. Just the way he gives his response is hilarious. His character is great. These three actors have such good attitudes that their performances in this film came out top notch. Aside from the three ghostbusters, Rick Moranis gives a funny performance as well. His character is ridiculously funny as a dorky and stupid little guy! The comedy of these 4 actors make this film as good as it is! <br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are very good! Everything from the blast packs to the ghosts to the stage set-ups. I love the Ghostbuster car! It is great! And the theme song is amazing! I get dance fever whenever I start to hear it!<br/><br/>Bill Murray said, ""We came, we saw, we kicked it's ass!"" That is exactly what Ghostbusters did to movie-goers everywhere. Everyone loves this movie and there is no question why. If you have yet to see this movie, stop reading and go rent it NOW! No disappointments. I guarantee it."

","A comedy with such a kooky premise already has pretty high odds of turning out well. Even someone as workaday as Stephen Sommers might toil to totally screw this up, but when entrusted to individuals with the pedigree of Reitman, Ramis, Ackroyd and Murray, you're more or less certain this is going to be special, and you'd be right.<br/><br/>Just the idea of (initially) three experimental parapsychologists bearing the responsibility of protecting ordinary citizens from ghastly spirits is funny. In the words of Dr. Peter Venkman: ""Back off man, we're scientists!"" ... Wouldn't really fill you with much faith, would it? Until, that is, you see them in action...<br/><br/>Everything in this movie fits together perfectly. The chemistry between the team is unrepeatable, the script is both smart and funny and the special effects hold up well even in this computerised age. All fun-loving people between the ages of 7 and 80 should be required to watch this. It's a model for how to execute a big-budget comedy, and since it's release, disappointingly there's only been a few clever souls in the industry who've actually sat down and taken notice."

","Three misfit parapsychology professors are booted out of their cushy jobs at New York City's Columbia University. Despite their relative lack of funding, they start an enterprise called Ghostbusters, a spectral investigation and removal service. One of the men has a plan to catch and contain supernatural entities, though it has never been properly tested. Undeterred, they obtain a former fire station as a base and begin advertising on local television. Ghostbusters (1984) is possibly the funniest film ever. That's quite the statement to make but with good cause. This film holds up probably more than any other comedy. There are those movies that you see that are hysterical the first few times you see them? This one just keeps on coming. I remember when I was a kid, I wore our copy of Ghostbusters out. At the time, I thought it was a horror movie (I wasn't the brightest bulb) so I watched it constantly (Being that I am a horror buff) never realizing what it truly was. I hadn't yet caught on to a lot of the humor. About eight years later, I noticed that I hadn't seen the film for forever and a day. I popped it in and oh my God...I just about died with laughter."

","There is a reason why ""Ghostbusters,"" the supernatural comedy hit from 1984 that was directed by Ivan Reitman, is a classic today: ""Ghostbusters"" is a film that easily worked its way into cinema and pop culture, spawning a 1989 sequel, a spin-off animated series, merchandise, songs (by Ray Parker, Jr.), and Slimer!!! It has a top-notch cast, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as three parapsychologists who go into business eliminating poltergeists in New York City.<br/><br/>That plot outline sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? Well, OK, it is. ""Ghostbusters"" has one of those ""novelty plots"" (trademark), where a seemingly simple, maybe even random idea snowballs and becomes something truly unique altogether. That is what ""Ghostbusters"" is, and that is what its plot has. I still don't think Reitman, Aykroyd, and Ramis had too many brainstorming sessions where they just sat in a room and tossed around random ideas for three hours.<br/><br/>No. In ""Ghostbusters,"" three unemployed parapsychologists, Dr. Peter Venkman (Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Ramis), are thrown out of the university because their studies into the paranormal have failed to yield any positive results. So they get the idea to put their heads together and go into the ghost-busting business. Of course, things are slow at first and people have difficulty taking their ads seriously (save for the opening sequence where a librarian has a creepy encounter with the specter haunting the library).<br/><br/>They then get a break when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) discovers that a monstrous dog-thing has taken up residence in her refrigerator. (If you think that's bad, just watch out for those eggs that start frying themselves on the kitchen counter.) Oddly enough, none of her neighbors have complained to the super of any supernatural activity in the building, not even her loser neighbor Louis Tulley (Rick Moranis), who I think, obviously, secretly has a crush on her.<br/><br/>So the boys go about investigating Dana's claim, while Venkman initiates some poorly timed moves on her. More calls of ghostly encounters continue, and soon the general public has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters believe them. Cool. Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are eventually joined by a fourth, an Everyman named Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), who proves to probably be the emotional and spiritual anchor the other three need as they find themselves going up against an otherworldly threat that is far bigger than anything any of them ever expected.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" is just as imaginative as it is funny and timeless. The cast members know their roles and fill them out with equal pizazz, including William Atherton as slimy EPA agent Walter Peck and Annie Potts as cynical secretary Janine Melnitz. The real spectacle of course, are the inventive special effects. Of course, it's pretty easy to computer generate ghosts and goblins and film them interacting with live actors. Back in 1984, the filmmakers still had to use lighting and other camera trickery to make such things possible. (So what are you going to do?)<br/><br/>And lastly, who can forget Mr. Stay Puft's classic rampage down through lower Manhattan?<br/><br/>10/10"

","Ghostbusters was one of my favorite movies that I watched over and over as a child. Ghostbusters is a funny, science fiction movie. It is difficult to find a film more funny throughout the whole movie industry. In the finale the giant marshmallow man comes alive. This is a scene no one can forget, especially with Dan Aykroyd, known as Dr. Raymond Stantz on the screen. Another scary scene was when Gozer appears in Dana Barrett's(Sigourney Weaver)refrigerator. Bill Murray, known as Dr. Peter Venkman, is great in this scene, as in every scene he is in. He has a dry, ironic sense of humor. He does not have to use words to express himself as a comedian. This movie has an impressive cast, and excellent special effects. I enjoyed this movie when I was a child, and to this day I watch this movie on VHS; and laugh again and again like I had just seen it, even though I know about every line by heart.<br/><br/>This movie has something for everyone. One was when Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) was recalling the Book of Revelation or another time when Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) tells about the possessed apartment coming into being. Also, when the grid was shut off was a very frightening moment. All the Ghostbusters are unforgettable and humorous in their own way. They work very well with one another, which is what makes it the best of movies.<br/><br/>Manhattan is the heart of the subject due to the Gothic architectural grandeur of the city; it makes for the perfect setting. This movie's special effects look as great today as it did in 1984. It is more imaginative than most movies today. The shifting back and forth from comedy to the imaginative and ghostbuster thriller make it one of the best films ever in the hearts of many. It is impossible not to laugh,no matter how many times people see this movie. The audience can see the movie over and over again without tiring because of the comedy mixed with suspense. Rent or buy it soon, as it has truly held up as a classic and one of the biggest blockbuster movies ever made in the 80s!"
"Jonny_Numb","9","0","0","1 September 2006"," ""Ghostbusters"" revisited
","I can hardly believe I submitted a comment on the IMDb that not only gave ""Ghostbusters"" a paltry '6' rating, but also had the audacity to claim that the humor hadn't aged well. Since the dawn of my obsession with film, friends of a more casual viewership have always claimed that I take the medium far too seriously. And while I do think an intellectual embrace inspires thoughtful critique, I am not beyond getting giddy over a film just because I can, reasoning be damned.<br/><br/>Case in point: ""Ghostbusters."" Back in 1986, I started my school career as an extroverted kindergartener with a love for Saturday-morning (and weekday-afternoon) cartoons. Out of all I'd watch, ""The Real Ghostbusters"" was the most entertaining; I was endlessly fascinated by the premise of 4 guys running around New York (plus other parts of the world and even outer space) with their 'positron rifles,' blasting deformed comic apparitions. In hindsight, this mixture of comic hijinks and supernatural mayhem is probably what piqued my long-standing love affair with horror films.<br/><br/>I didn't actually view the film version of ""Ghosbusters"" until I was a well-ingrained fan of the TV show, to the point where I had to adjust to the difference in appearance of the live-action characters (as opposed the other way around). Despite this, I warmed up to the film instantly--I laughed my butt off and was amazed by Richard Edlund's brilliant FX (which look f*cking incredible to this day). Bill Murray's portrayal of the coolly sarcastic Peter Venkman is one of my all-time favorite performances (and cemented Murray as my favorite comic actor); the efforts of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson also contribute to an unmatched cooperative of quirky humor that works better than one might imagine.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Ghostbusters"" is so utterly ridiculous that it's something of a miracle it works as well as it does. The script, by Aykroyd and Ramis (back when they knew 'funny'), involves our heroes sweeping the ghost population of NYC while dodging EPA toady Walter Peck (""Die Hard""'s William Atherton, in a hilariously straight performance); in the meantime, Venkman woos musician Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment becomes a portal for ghoulish baddie Gozer to enter through. Over the course of the movie, we'll cross paths with people who transform into hell-hounds, a giant marshmallow man, and a ghoul that would give David Bowie a run for his androgynous money.<br/><br/>Through all its absurdity, ""Ghostbusters"" works well because of the characterizations--while everyone has a distinctive personality quirk that is somewhat exaggerated, they are fleshed out to the extent of being believable and worth rooting for. Not once does the film lapse into farce at the expense of character, which makes the humor even bolder; this also helps make the Armageddon scenario that arises in the third act the stuff of Vonnegutian genius (in the face of imminent global catastrophe, humor keeps the human spirit aloft). Due credit should go to director Ivan Reitman, who manages a seamless interplay between the comedic and the horrific without allowing one to awkwardly dominate.<br/><br/>Personally, ""Ghostbusters"" is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to my childhood, a film that makes me grin as excitedly now as when I was 8...perhaps because nothing in it looks particularly dated (the effects actually look BETTER than anything that's come since), and the humor is still as fresh as it was upon my first viewing. While I could probably write a dissertation on ""Ghostbusters""' impact on cinema and popular culture, I think I'll conclude by saying this is an entertainment everyone should be exposed to at least once. If you don't like it...well, that's your loss."

","I think that ghostbusters is the best film ever. Alongside number 2 they create history. The characters are played beautifully and give so much emphasis on how brilliant these films really are! I love everything about it- the script, jokes, characters, actors, uniforms, equipment- absolutely everything. How can anyone disagree? The plots are fiendishly clever and artistically shot, the script is amazing with plenty of jokes in it, the actors become the Ghostbusters and portray them in a way that in most films doesn't seem possible. But Ghostbusters made it happen. Anything is possible. Every step of the way was woven with the comic wit and brilliance of Dan, Bill, Harold, Ernie, Rick and all of the other actors who each give their all and play their wonderful parts to the very top rate. There is a certain energy that surrounds both of these films that state is a definite must watch. One for all seasons. Something for everyone. Well, just as long as you remember ""Who you gonna call?"" These guys definitely ""Aint afraid of no ghost"" ""Back off man, i'm a scientist..."" Classic.

","I loved this film. Its just magical and it works better than its slapstick template. One of the best comedies of the 80's which had a huge promotional campaign of a poster with the traffic no entry sign with a ghost on it. With no accompanying explanation this 'by its repetition it aroused curiosity and irritation in the public to demand what this advertising was for, so achieving the advertisers intention"" Â– Rachel Gordon, Stephen Armourae,. Ghostbusters Groundbreaking comedy of the 80's in many ways since it took Abbot and Costello's slapstick films using horror characters and presented to a new audience with 3 decades of Hollywood change in style and technology. Hollywood realised that their business surged in the summer months from a teenage market. The 2 popular genres were crazy comedies and scary films with CGI. The answer was to mix the 2. Ghostbuster's stands out from other comedies by delivering satire on contemporary society and parodies TV advertising and dating rituals. The problem with the film is that Ernie Hudson as the black member was never treated as an equal member of the team in the script. Life has come to imitate art: the British actor and writer Stephen Armourae is training as a scientist like the Spengler character and is more like Murray than he would admit. And he's a parapsychology researcher like all of them. Its strength is the ensemble performances centred on Murray and Ackroyd who showed they were at the best in a team. Despite being brought in From Saturday Night Live where they were solo comic performers."

It couldn't have resulted in anything better, it was just perfect, for the time.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna talk about the story, there's enough reviews and knowledge over this big hit. Instead, I want to talk about intertextuality.<br/><br/>The movie was made in 1984, same year of some movies I've watched, such as Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Starman, Amadeus, Karate Kid, The Garden of Eden, Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, Dune... And so many others I wish I had seem... It was a hard competition for prizes, I guess that's the reason why it didn't get so many awards.<br/><br/>Hell, not even former Monty Python's award winning from 12 monkeys Terry Gilliam could win something with his movie, mostly because of poor production (not his fault, at all).<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie has so many deep inner meanings, every time I watch it again it gets me surprised with something I haven't seem before. And I have seem a lot.<br/><br/>Later works from Harold Ramis are my favorite. Every one of them. I think my favorite would be Bedazzled (2000) and, please, don't overlook this amazing movie. It was first written by Peter Cook and shot in movie on 1967 by the same Peter, yes the same Peter who inspired Monty Python and probably most of Terry Gilliam's works.<br/><br/>But I can't get enough of all of Harold R. like Analyze this and that, he only gets better and better in time, maybe going too far and then heading back to earth, hehe. To me, he resembles a lot Calvin & Hobbes (a.k.a Harold) for some reason... I just miss few of his works, like Cadyshack and maybe Stripes.<br/><br/>He also makes appearances like in Orange County or As Good As It Gets. Always playing a really good and smart person, just like in Ghostbusters, but always different sides of himself.<br/><br/>And now he is doing a new work with the also amazing, although weird, Owen Wilson. I think he was best seem with Jackie Chan in Shangai Noon.<br/><br/>Anyway, this first Ghostbuster is amazing, a great story and at least 5 star merit.

It was funny and, at the time, a little frightening (I remember the Terror Dogs scaring the crap out of me). It is probably one of the most fun films I've seen. The entire movie almost has a cartoon-ish feel to it.<br/><br/>The movie is the brainchild of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and stars some of the greatest comic actors of the decade. Aside from starring Aykroyd and Ramis, the film also boasts Bill Murray and Rick Moranis. The group has the perfect chemistry for the team and play off each other beautifully. Sigourney Weaver plays Murray's love interest and the victim of an ancient Sumerian god's attempted resurrection.<br/><br/>The special effects are definitely a bit dated. Looking back on the stop-motion animated Terror Dogs now doesn't seem to have the same frightening effects. This doesn't hurt the movie one bit. I still love seeing Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man terrorizing New York City.<br/><br/>This is definitely one movie that ages well and is just as fun to watch now as it was then.

It was a huge hit with a product range, a sequel, and a cartoon series -- not to mention the catchy theme song: 'I ain't afraid of no ghosts.' Ghostbusters is a fun film. The story centers around a group of men who start a business 'busting' ghosts. It's all very fantasy and super-hero themed with the ghost busters saving the city from the dooms of the spook-world, but it does have an element of comedy.

","Alright we're talking cultural Phenomenon here...Who Ya Gonna Call? The song, the action figures, the cartoons...this started it all. Does all that make it good?? No. But it was. It was brilliant and funny, and scary, and action packed and made for adults. The eighties was a key time when film makers realized that adults actually wanted comedy for them. John Candy, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, these guys did their best comedy work during this time. Ghostbusters was and still is the most brilliant creation of Dan Akroyd and one of the most entertaining films as well.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters although it seems to have become a childhood type thing was not made for children. Some of the ghost scenes and more scary scenes are easy for adults but could be quite disturbing to children. Plus the numerous sexual situations. The cast of this film couldn't be any more perfect which is funny considering how much the cast changed from who Akroyd wanted and who they got. Bill Murray in one of his best comedic roles becomes almost over used in his portrayal as Dr. Peter Venkman. Murray has to be one of the only comedic actors who can run that borderline between being funny and cute, to being annoying and overused (ie: Will Ferrell) His character runs that line but has some of the best and most memorable scenes. Akroyd's Ray Stanz is excitable and eager and holds the team together along with Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler. Ramis seems to just fit right in which is strange because he doesn't really fit the profile for the rest of the team. Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, Murray's love interest and the female lead of the film does a great job as well. Her and Murray have some great scenes and she gets to go from Upper class reserved woman to possessed over sexed demon.<br/><br/>Ernie Hudson...well Hudson is a great actor but he is underused and strangely pointless for the cast. There was never a need for a fourth ghost buster and he gets rather left out most of the time. Although he does get to deliver the infamous closing line of the film ""I love this town!"" Ivan Reitman who is an amazing director when it comes to making films that people love and making them just fun to watch does a great job of keeping everything interesting and keeping the story flowing. His idea of showing us how they got started was brilliant. I don't think a remake of this film could ever exist because you could never get the overall chemistry that came out of this cast which is one of the things that made it great along with their abilities to deliver their lines. The film doesn't just have one featured story but instead we see how they get started, their first ghost capture and all the ghosts in the middle along with the amazing hit theme song. If you haven't seen this original eighties classic...well I'm surprised but even if you have watch it again and again because it's one that'll live forever as one of the most entertaining films in history. 9/10"

","In my opinion, the eighties has never been a great decade when it comes to movies (music, hairstyles and fashion weren't any better, but I'm not going to discuss that on this website). There are only a couple of movies, made at that time, that I still consider worth watching and ""Ghost Busters"" is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>When three weird scientists / professors lose their grant and their jobs at the university, where they studied the occult and paranormal occurrences, they have to find a new way of making money. They decide to go into business as a ghost extermination company called 'Ghostbusters'. At first people react sceptical and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tries to shut them down, but soon enough business is booming. Especially when an ancient god named Gozer is threatening to take over the city, no-one doubts about their capabilities anymore. But this gigantic enemy is stronger than they have ever met before and they can't be sure that they will be able to handle him...<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this movie was created in 1984, the ghosts still look very good. They would look a lot better if done with today's techniques of course, but keep in mind that they didn't have the same possibilities in the early eighties, and than you'll see what a formidable performance this was. And not only the special effects are more than OK. So is the entire story and the acting. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are excellent as the three 'mad' scientists, but the others, like for instance Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts, were nice to watch as well. The main problem that I had with this movie, if you can call it that, was that it was too short. They build the entire movie up to a very good climax and then all a sudden, everything is finished. I sure wanted to keep watching a bit longer.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that deserves to be called a classic. It may perhaps look a bit dated by today's standards, but it still offers plenty of fun. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10."

","After watching The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou earlier this week, it made me long for the days when filmmakers knew what made their actors great and how to utilize their talents properly. Ghostbusters is not only a fine film, but perhaps the best showcase ever made for Bill Murray's genius.<br/><br/>Who knows how good John Belushi (whom the part of Dr. Peter Venkman was originally written for) would have been in this film. I'd certainly trade Murray's performance for Belushi's life if it were possible. But since that won't happen all we can do is sit back and enjoy Murray's excellent performance. Here are some of the highlights.<br/><br/>The guys are interviewing a frightened old librarian who has just seen a ghost. The woman is absolutely petrified as she is trying to describe what she has seen, as well as answer some questions about herself. Murray at one point in the interview asks the old woman if she is currently menstruating. Her supervisor understandably objects, seeing no logical connection. Murray simply tells him, ""Back off, man. I'm a scientist."" We as the audience aren't quite sure why he asked the question. We can only sit back and chuckle at him putting an already terrified woman on the spot.<br/><br/>The scene in which Murray accompanies Sigourney Weaver back to her apartment to check out her initial disturbance is vintage Murray. You get the sense that whether or not his character believes in ghosts is irrelevant. He certainly isn't frightened of them, but he has to at least try to act concerned so this woman might possibly take him seriously as a scientist. He makes a bold point to be the first of them to enter the apartment. He then starts fingering the two highest keys on her piano. ""They hate this. I like to torture them,"" he explains. After some macho posturing, he takes out an obscure device that looks like a combination of a blood pressure cuff and a car battery. He begins squeezing the device, resulting in a swooshing sound. There is a great sense that not only are we the audience baffled as to what the device is for, but Murray himself likely does not know. ""Excuse me, but what is that thing you're doing?"" Weaver asks. ""It's technical. One of our little toys,"" he tries to explain. Later on, they venture into her kitchen where she had some trouble with her groceries earlier. Murray walks over to the counter where there are fried eggs splattered all over it. ""Dana... are these the eggs?"" he asks, trying to sound like he truly thinks they might NOT be the eggs she described to them earlier. It is a testament to her professionalism that Ms. Weaver or anyone else for that matter could get through this scene without dying of laughter.<br/><br/>The film is also filled with one-liners, great special effects, and some creepy monsters. This is one of the better comedies to come out of the 1980s. And I think we have Bill Murray to thank for most of it.<br/><br/>10 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

Rick Moranis steals his scenes as the dweeby accountant neighbor of Weaver's,and Ernie Hudson joins on near the end as a no-nonsense guy who believes in the Ghostbusters' mission,in spite of his better instincts. <br/><br/>Rounding out the cast are Annie Potts(pre-Designing Women)as the dryly unenthused secretary and William Atherton as the weasly EPA rep and ostensible villain here(an 80s era dig). Director Ivan Reitman,while somewhat of an inconsistent filmmaker(""Stripes"",""Twins"",""DAve"" and ""Junior""),is very deft and clever in balancing effects and eye-candy with comedy,keeping the film both light AND powerful. <br/><br/>I realize that films that have been around as long as ""Ghostbusters""(which will turn twenty-one this June,if you're counting) rarely get to see the insides of movie theaters anymore,but if by some chance you're at a movie festival or college campus that is showing this on the large screen,I highly recommend you go catch it!"

Not just any animated series, but one of the best and most enjoyable of the 80's. <br/><br/>An ancient and powerful evil (Gozer) has laid dormant for many thousands of years and is now ready to re-enter the world through a mystic gateway situated atop a New York apartment building. The only people stupid enough and brave enough to stop this entity are the ghost-busters! Each armed with a proton pack and a clean pair of shorts they do battle with spooky librarians, giant marshmallows and floating bogie's in a classic film that never will become outdated."

","""Ghostbusters"" is just one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life. Although I can't think of a person who hasn't already. Lot's of people grew up with this movie and lot's of people will remain to, cause it's a movie that just never will be outdated, the entertainment value is just too high for that to happen.<br/><br/>I think the power of ""Ghostbusters"" are the main characters and the actors that portray them. Bill Murray is hilarious as always and Dan Aykroyd shows why he was one of the greatest comedians of the 80's. William Atherton was wonderful as 'villain' and Rick Moranis does what he can do best; play the nerdy loser. The cast is just simply perfect and I haven't even mentioned Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts or Ernie Hudson yet.<br/><br/>The music is also spot on perfect. No, I'm not just talking about the Ray Parker Jr. theme song but mainly about the Elmer Bernstein soundtrack which in my opinion is underrated.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly just fun to watch and is highly entertaining and is filled with some wonderful and memorable moments. The early special effects look acceptable but by todays standards they look pretty fake at times.<br/><br/>Lot's of people always praise the ending, not I however. I don't really like the ending, never did really. Sure the huge marshmallow man is just fantastic and highly original but the whole Gozer thing is just a bit underused maybe. I have the feeling that the movie's ending could have been done way more spectacular. For some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Yet ""Ghostbusters"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and is one of those movie's I have fond childhood memories of. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Ghost Busters is a very original film. Where else will you see a group of odd balls who use packs on their backs with beams to catch ghosts all over New York. Where else will you see a green ghost that slimes people. The only place where you can find any of those things is Ghost Busters.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a horror movie for any of you who watch it for that purpose, but it does have plenty of hilarious humor, action, and it is a very cool movie.<br/><br/>This has a great cast of comedians that includes Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd. Sigourney Weaver is in this during her earlier years.<br/><br/>Anybody can enjoy this movie. I saw this when I was about 6 years old and I have loved it ever since. The kids will like it for the action and the ghosts, everyone else who watches it will probably appreciate the humor in it. This isn't real scary, but I knew a 4 year old who watched this and he was pretty scared by it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is a bit dated. Many of the ghost effects that were amazing in 1984 are considered fake for today's standards. This was made before CGI first came around, so it is pretty good considering that.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, watch it any time. It is a great movie and I'm sure you'll like it too."

","It's been a long time, Ghostbusters. You and me go way back, though, don't we? 1985 was it? I watched you while I lay upon the floor. I still remember hiding under the blanket when the Marshmallow Man beat hell out of NYC. It was those demon dogs that really did me in, though. When they came at Sigourney through the chair? So scary. You're not so scary now. Now you're funny, just like you were then. Where do these stairs go? They go up. So funny. Rick Moranis? Hysterical, him with his mineral water. And Venkman's still the best - always was, always will be. Egon and Ray, don't take it personally, you just can't compare. Really, it's like asking Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis to be funnier than Bill Murray. It'd never happen. So it's been almost 20 years since we met...amazing. Sis got you for me when I was 8 - bought you used at a video store near her college. I played the hell out of you, but you're still mine. A little worse for wear, but I can still watch you.<br/><br/>Watched you last week, in fact, with the nephews. They'd never seen you - a little to young to remember how big you were once. My friends and I, though, we remember you well. We all have you in our collection. My nephews though, they loved you. Eleven and nine, a little older than I was at our introduction, but they enjoyed you the same. Why? Because you're funny and funny doesn't get old. I laughed at you when I was five and I'll laugh at you when I'm sixty-five. Ghostbusters, you're great. I hope I never forget you."

","You know why this film is so popular? It's not the subject matter... it's not the acting... not the humor, nor the music, the effects... what makes it so popular even after all these years is that it's a great slice of the 80's. The music, the clothing, the dialog, the script, the effects... everything is so definite 80's that the film is almost entirely irresistible. The plot is quite original and has a pretty good pace, as well. It's interesting to see these characters develop, even though they are kind of thin... and that each of them is basically the same type of role the respective actors usually portray. The acting is pretty standard. The characters are neither particularly well-written or well-developed. The humor is pretty good, but not really anything special. Not the best of 80's films... but good. The special effects vary, but mostly they're typically 80's... some of them are quite good, though. The dialog is good... some of it is very well-written... and most of it is nicely delivered as well. The film is about three scientists who are certain of the existence of ghosts, and as all of their hopes(or, rather, fears) are confirmed, they decide to make a team of ghost-fighters(or ghost-busters). The rest of the film deals with their fighting the ghosts in an entertaining, humorous and exciting manner. The film is rarely dull, never drags and is an instant classic due to the very 80's qualities of it. It's an entertaining and exciting ride through the 80's, and a film that won't be forgotten any time soon. I recommend it to fans of Ivan Reitman and the actors, and of course anyone who enjoys an 80's film. It's worth watching simply for that 80's charm. 8/10"

The acting is AWESOME!!! Bill Murray is Side Splitting Hilarious he is also a terrific comedian and actor i LOVE this guy a lot he is the best. Dan Aykroyd is very good here and was quite funny at times and he was perfect for this role i liked him lots.Harold Ramis is fine here as Raymond although he was the least interesting of the lot he was still an interesting character i just wish they gave him more to do. Sigourney Weaver is HOT! here and her acting is fine i always thought this woman was a very good actress here is no different. Harold Ramis does what he does best here play the role he is so good at the geeky but likable hilarious weirdo.Annie Potts does good as the secretary and is a pretty good actress. William Atherton is not that great of an actor in my opinion he is always unlikable always over does it here is no different. Ernie Hudson does what he has to do VERY well i liked him.

Ghost Busters is a funny comedy about three guys named Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are scientists at Columbia University, college located in New York City. When their grant expires, the trio gets fired and start up their own business of ghost exterminators called Ghost Busters! Their first customer was Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who is scared out of her apartment on the 22nd floor of a high rise apartment building on Central Park West. It seems that Dana's neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is also being affected by the strange happenings in the apartment building. Later, The Ghost Buster become wildly popular and later they have Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) joined the team because he was looking for a job and he was hired! Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Walter Peck kind of reminds me of Commander Farrell (from Swat Kats) and J. Jonah Jameson (from Spider-Man) because they also think just because the hero they have now isn't protecting the city the way they want them to they want them in jail! Also in this movie we see Slimer and that Giant Pillsbury Dough Boy. Saturday Night Live comedians Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd bring really funny jokes in this movie as well as some of their other movies!

","**SPOILER WARNING!**<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is by far one of the best 80s films. Eventhough I was not yet born, the year it came out made all the differnce in the world...1984!<br/><br/>I have looked in to the year 1984 and quite frankly Ghostbusters non-surprisingly became the must-see flick of summer '84. I can see why, because the film's humor and sense of direction holds up well today. Just take a handful of people from Saturday Night Live, Second City, Caddyshack, Meatballs, Stripes, Animal House, Blues Brothers, Tootsie, Trading Places, National Lampoon's Vacation and add elements from films like Abbot and Costello, King Kong, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, Trilogy of Terror, The Exorcist, and those Pillsbury Dough Boy ads along with a huge dash of Comedy and you've got yourself a hell of a great movie!<br/><br/>The film features a group of odd-ball scientists who are fired from their jobs. As they spend time in the gutter, they establish a system of paranormal investigaions and eliminations calling themselves ""Ghost Busters"". They're first assignment is to investigate a pesky poltergeist living in a woman named Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) fridge. Along the way, they trap their first ghost (Slimer) at a hotel and resume their ghost-catching spree, until the spirit in Dana's apartment captivates her body and eventually Rick Moranis's body, causing the city of New York to break out all hell. The ghostbusters are left to deal with this pesky ghost and near the end of the film, takes the form of a giant marshmallow man. Another problem the ghostbusters are facing are federal charges by a tree-hugging, beaurocratic snitch named Walter Peck, who is the third-district attorney of the EPA (environmental Protection Agency).<br/><br/>The timing of the humor in this movie is so perfect. Bill Murray delivers that same sense of unique, lazy-ass humor we all love. Dan Aykroyd has that same dry, odd-ball humor, like Rick Moranis. And Harold Ramis delivers that bookish and INCREDIBLY DRY, dead pan sense of humor, along with Annie Potts. If you want to check out a nice, feel-good 80s comedy, who ya gonna call?<br/><br/>GHOSTBUSTERS!<br/><br/>10/10 stars -- BRILLIANT!"

"Elswet","8","0","0","31 December 2003"," He slimed me!
","At the top of my list of favorite comedic actors, right next to Gene Wilder and Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. These three comprise over 1/2 of my entire comedy collection.<br/><br/>This movie was beautiful. It was funny, not clever, but it was not intended to be an intellectual film. This is pure comedy with a little sci-fi and a bit more spirituality thrown into the mix, making for a great comedic effort. I was, and am, happy that their references to the Hebrew God were few. Far too often in films of this type, the dialog is riddled with too many references to religion. Here, they failed to do that, and made for a much better film, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd is another of my favorites, and his performance in this production is one of the reasons why. I love his ability to portray a serious straight-man to the comedic efforts of the films in which he stars. He stands there, straight-faced, and allows the laughs to rebound off his lines, his facial expressions, and himself. He is a quality actor, and he demonstrated that quality in this work.<br/><br/>The script was creative, the dialog was funny and endearing, and the performances were professional, top row comedy. I will refrain from detailing the story line here, as most everyone else has done that already, and I do hate to be redundant.<br/><br/>So rent it, watch it, then buy it.<br/><br/>It's definitely one for the collection.<br/><br/>It rates a 7.6/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

What this film benefits from most is physical comedy, the old rule that something is funnier shown rather than said can be proved simply by watching this film.  When Egon comes across the guest watching him in the hotel corridor while looking for 'slimer' and he gives the guest a little 'prod' before he carries on to check he is real still makes me fall off the sofa laughing twenty years on.

In one event with a close encounter with a ghost, Dr. Spangler comes up with the theory of capturing and containing a ghost.  Before you know it, the Ghostbusters were in business.  With their cool jump suits, fast car, and ghost capturing proton packs there was no job to big for the trio of scientist.

","""Ghostbusters"" is one of the best films to come from former members of ""Saturday Night Live"" and Canadian sketch comedy groups. The movie deals with three eccentric ex-college professors(Murray, Akroyd, and Ramis) who, after being fired from the College, become paranormal exterminators. After some sucess, they end up facing their biggest challenge yet when one of their clients-and Murray's love interest-ends up being the focal point of the reincarnation of an ancient God. The film's main star is Bill Murray, who actually ab-libbed a large number of his lines, but Akroyd are hilarious as well. The film also has great production design which elevates this over an average ""gimmick"" comedy. Some of the special effects, such as the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and Slimer, still look good today.

"DaveHasNoTimeForAnyOfThisBull","Null","0","0","18 September 2003"," My Thoughts On Ghostbusters
","This was the first video I ever received.  Bill Murray said in 1989 he'd only want to make one Ghostbusters movie every 5 years so we'd be up to Production on number 5 by now.  Thanks Bill!  Ivan Reitman said he didn't think it was a good movie when he made it.  He said he thought ""Junior"" was a better movie How many times do directors say that about a film that becomes a big hit.  Eddie Murphy was originally cast as Winston and later in ""Multiplicity"".  The joke there is it's twice he's rejected working with Harold Ramis.  He chose to do ""The Golden Child"" in 1984 instead. Interestingly, his friend Arsenio Hall did the voice of Winston for a few years on the cartoon show.<br/><br/>It's a great funny movie that I've probably seen 50 times in my life and memorized all the one-line jokes of.  The supernatural mumbo jumbo that Egon shoots out there is as funny as any joke by Peter Venkman.  Ernie Hudson gets to play Winston as such an outsider to the other three that it made him an instant crowd favorite.  I wish they'd make another but Bill Murray doesn't want to because he's afraid of being typecast.  Memo to Bill Murray: Your last big movie was in 1993.  Stop playing golf with your brothers on Comedy Central and make another one, pronto!"

","I've memorized large portions of Ghostbusters dialogue from watching it so much. I love this movie and have pretty much had it on play for the last 15 years. Why do I love it so much? Well, first of all there hasn't been many good pairings like the Ghostbusters. Now Ernie Hudson was never really part of the group in this movie, in the second one he was more integrated into the fold. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis are a brilliant comedic pairing. The chemistry between these 3 characters is warm and funny. The special effects are good for the time and contribute to the film rather than make up the majority of it like so many films today. Bill Murray especially laces his dialogue with wisecracks and this is one of his best roles. This movie is a classic and I think they should be making a third. Bottom Line: Ghostbusters inspires a cult like few movies. This kind of success is deserved only by the best movies with wide ranging appeal. Ghostbusters is one of these films."

With a good cast and crew, this film is on a winner before you've even seen the first scene and with some great special effects, this movie is pleasing to the eye.

","Ghostbusters is a trivial film in both structure and style.  It certainly isn't well edited due to many gaps in the timeline, but there are several redeeming qualities to it.  For starters, the casting is terrific.  While the scripted characters themselves are paper-thin, the writers (Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd) fill them with enough interesting dialogue to make things more memorable.  Ramis in particular is ingenius as Spengler. Unfortunately, his ability and character were wasted in the sequel.<br/><br/>The film presents an interesting mix.  There is the prototypical horror hook of such films as The Exorcist and The Haunting, but it combines it with the 80s notion of ""technology can solve or do anything"", evident with WarGames and Blade Runner.  Of course, Ghostbusters isn't anywhere near the level of Blade Runner, and it's all for laughs.  Nonetheless, the comedy element strikes deeper than garbage like Dumb & Dumber.  While Ghostbusters doesn't have a purpose, it certainly is trying to find it.  Interesting in a decade that shunned intelligent thinking.<br/><br/>On the side note, I feel this movie was robbed at the Oscars both for Visual Effects and Song.  Ray Parker, Jr. isn't the 80s' greatest, but the song certainly contributed to the success of the movie.  Also, the sound editors deserve their fair share of credit in creating the interesting noises of both the ghosts and the unique ""firepower"" the team wields against them.<br/><br/>Overall, a film that has aged, but not as bad as other ones from this decade.  Essential viewing for children of this decade and comedy buffs, but more introspective reviewers who like Woody Allen should avoid it.  3 out of 5 stars."

","A team of four paranormal investigators try to save New York from evil. There are three reasons why this is a good movie; Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and Dan Aykroyd. Each one brings a funny character into the mix. The only ghost buster that does not quite pull his weight or add much is Ernie Hudson. I realize the he is the non-believer that is supposed to ground the group, but he's not a strong enough character to play off the other three. He does have a few good lines, though.<br/><br/>The most emphasis, as usual, rests on Bill Murray. He was the mouthy slacker in some of the best casted comedies of the eighties (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, and to lesser effect Scrooged) He is fun to watch being supported by Harold ""I collect spores, molds, and fungus.""

","This is one of my favorite comedies of the 80's.  This movie revolves around three paranormal researchers studying ghosts played brilliantly by Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.  They end up getting kicked off the campus where they worked and decide to open a business that gets rid of ghosts.  They basically get no calls at first except for a lady who saw a vision in her refrigerator (Signorey Weaver).  The guys soon though receive their first call and go and fight a ghost in a hotel.  This sparks a rash of callers and the Ghost Busters are in business.  This movie is great as it has good comedy and a great cast that also includes Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson (who becomes a Ghost Buster after awhile).

"Silverzero","Null","0","0","21 March 2003"," Visually dazzling and sporadically hilarious sci-fi comedy.
","`Ghostbusters' was released back in 1984 and now, nearing 20 years on, it is still as entertaining and witty as it was when it was first released. Yes, the early computer effects do look dated compared to today's standards, but the visual effects and puppetry are good for their own uniquely likeable style. <br/><br/>This is backed up by the films cast who are all in top form. Bill Murray is brilliantly witty as Peter Venkman. The film's co-producer, Harold Ramis is also very good as the cynical and somewhat nerdy Ghostbuster, Egon Spengler. Dan Akroyd is well suited to his role as the rather unfortunate Ghostbuster of the bunch, Ray Stanz. Ernie Hudson doesn't receive quite as much screen-time or as much conviction as the other three, but handles his role as Winston Zedmore very well. Sigourney Weaver makes a great love interest and sterling support. <br/><br/>The script couldn't be better either and perfectly balances modest comedy with big budget sci-fi. This has proved to be a hard mixture to get right in the past but works really well here. The distinctly 80's soundtrack is highly appropriate and surprisingly memorable. The film has its fair share of memorable scenes (who can forget the opening scene) and brilliantly witty dialogue (we came, we saw, we kicked a*s). The somewhat shoddy effects on the dog like creature, Zool, are well compensated for by the light show at the end and the famous `Stay-puff marshmallow man' scene.<br/><br/>
Overall, `Ghostbusters' is a movie well deserving of its current status as a classic and is just as good (if not better) than the tear jerking `cinematic gems' of melodramatic drivel that has been released in the past. 8.2/10."

But this film is far above most digital extravaganzas because it realizes that effects that look neat are better eye-candy than effects that are expensive.  I would rather see the giant marshmallow man or the killer dogs than all of the asteroids, slow-motion bullets or spaceships that Hollywood can throw at its patrons.<br/><br/>The plot is basically simple: three scientists set up shop in New York as paranormal exterminators and contend with various spooks.

"alainenglish","Null","0","0","5 August 2002"," A bona fide Eighties classic
","A wonderfully good movie, brilliantly reminiscent of the era in which it was made, ""Ghostbusters"" is a bona fide Eighties classic.  Whilst it never quite succeeds as a comedy (it is only mildly funny at best) it possesses enough monstrous spooks and ghouls to scare and thrill, combined with some memorable characterisations and a really hip soundtrack.<br/><br/>The plot centres in on three parapsychologists who study and investigate the supernatural at a New York University.  The trio consists of wisecracking womanizer Peter Venkman(Bill Murray), overexcitable engineer Raymond Stantz(Dan Ayckroyd), and the studious intellectual Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis).<br/><br/>The trio are thrown off campus for their apparently wasteful research, and then decide to start a business investigating and eliminating the paranormal: ""Ghostbusters"".  Armed with proton packs and ghost traps, they battle the ghoulish and the demonic, setting the scene for a climatic show-down at the top of a haunted up-town apartment building.<br/><br/>
There is some superb characterisation for a comedy film.  The three strong leads are ably supported by (among many others) Sigourney Weaver, who plays Venkman's reluctant love interest,  Annie Potts as their no-nonsense secretary, Ernie Hudson as a down-to-earth black man who becomes the fourth Ghostbuster, Rick Moranis as Weaver's nerdy neighbour and David Margulies as the bemused Mayor.  Whilst none of these characters are explored in any depth, they provide a colourful balance of personalities that is the core of the picture.<br/><br/>The colourful and delightfully messy special-effects perfectly suit the picture and one feels they wouldn't be quite so effective if the film was made today with CGI.  They are complement with some excellent set-design ranging from the Ghostbusters' dilapidated fire-station headquarters, to the eerie and foreboding high-rise.<br/><br/>The music of the movie is excellent as well.  Bernie Brillstein's soundtrack ranges from the casually jazzy, to the scarily operatic, with some of good use of disco music in some scenes.  It perfectly complements the picture. And few would deny Ray Parker Jr's theme tune is an infectiously catchy hit.<br/><br/>The film was followed by an equally impressive sequel in 1989.  As it stands on its own, ""Ghostbusters"" is one of the definitive American movies of the 1980s.  A exciting, and enjoyable fantasy picture."

","(SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)<br/><br/>Ghostbusters was the best movie of 1984 bar none. It had a great cast, a great director and it was full of 80's humour.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters were scientists who went around trapping ghosts (for some reason New York had suffered an influx of hauntings)and they did it in style. The movie was funny throughout.<br/><br/>Bill Murray played the sarcastic Peter Venkman who was sort of the leader of the team. He didn't take his work seriously and he was more interested in getting passionate with Dana Barrett played by Sigourney Weaver. The best scenes in this film were the ones where Venkman clashed with the bureaucratic Walter Peck (played by William Atherton) who was from the Environmental Protection Agency. Peck believed the Ghostbusters were a menace to the environment and Venkman really laid into him verbally.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd played Ray Stantz who was certainly more serious in his work than Venkman. Stantz was probably more of a leader than Venkman.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis played Egon Spengler who was the most scientific out of the lot-he was the one responsible for providing analysis during dangerous situations even when the team didn't need it.<br/><br/>Ernie Hudson played Winston Zeddmore who wasn't a scientist. He had joined the Ghostbusters and been taken aback by the sights he had saw.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were great too such as Annie Potts who played Janine Melnitz and the ever dependable Rick Moranis.<br/><br/>The scenes are truly great. There was the beginning scene in the library where the ghostbusters (before they actually became the ghostbusters)tried to catch a ghost with their bare hands. Then we saw them struck off from the university where they worked. There was the scene where they trapped a disgusting green ghost in a hotel. And who can forget the end scene where a giant marshmellow man nearly destroys the Ghostbusters? Amazing.<br/><br/>I also loved the Ghostbusters car which was called Ecto-1.

But soon, all of New York City is engulfed in spooks and Dana, along with her eccentric neighbor Louis (Rick Moranis), become the focus of summoning Gozer, a vicious evil that could easily destroy the world. With a new recruit, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), the Ghostbusters set out to save the world.<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent comedy, thanks to a great script by co-stars Aykroyd and Ramis. They setup the characters wonderfully, so that each adds something unique to the wacky group. Murray and Moranis are given the best material of their careers and Aykroyd, Ramis and Annie Potts have a collection of zingers. The story is made believable, in spite of the obstacles, and the visual gags plus the sharp dialogue make for an unforgettable comedy classic.<br/><br/>The visual effects are also very good. They help deliver a couple of nice scares in the movie like when Dana gets captured by the Terror Dog or when, as Zuul, a minion of Gozer, she telepathically destroys her own apartment. Richard Edlund and company has done a fine job.<br/><br/>All these things, along with the great title theme, make for a film that lived up to and exceeded the hype. Everything about this movie clicks; nothing seems to be out of balance. I really loved this movie and I think that everyone else would too. Go out and pick up a copy of Ghostbusters today."

The movie basically kicks ass with a great special edition DVD.  Oh yeah and they did turn the word slime into a verb.  GB2 was good, not great, but a worthy followup.

","This is my favourite film. I'm not deluded, indeed I realise that Ghostbusters is not  the best film ever made, and is far from perfect. Yet just as fans of Star Wars seem to worship it as a manifestation of childish fantasy, so too is Ghostbusters for me. As a child I was entranced by the eccentric characters, mixture of supernatural events and bizarre technology, coupled with charming effects. As I grew older I understood the jokes, and realised the Stay Puft Marshmallow man was supposed to be funny and surreal, not scary as when I first saw it. This film made me want to go to university and hopefully meet a bunch of slacker scientists with bizarre ideas. Ghostbusters really does make you feel good, from the music, to Murray's quips. It's just a shame that Ghostbusters II sealed the fate of this franchise."

Just to mention a few negatives on this film the casting of Rick Moranis hurts because he simply doesn't connect with the other characters nice chemistry. Sigourney Weaver's bed scene of rising through the air and voice dialogue of a talking demon is Exorcist parody and a rip-off, please this wasn't intended for a film like Ghostbusters.

The cast...well, need I say more? Everyone was purely perfect in their roles. I also love the timeless look of the movie.  Watching it now you will have no problem believing that these events could be occuring at this second because the clothing, dialogue, etc. are not dated, as is the fate of many ""classics"". The special effects seem outdated now, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. Because even in a movie where special efects are abound....the special effects do not propel the story. Because of the amazingly structured script, they could have used sock puppets instead of animated ghosts and get the same effect.  Even the sequel...though not quite as compact, is a delightful addition to the Ghostbusters family.  There is news about Ghostbusters 3. While I will greet it with open arms, I can't help to think it shouldn't be made.  Because there hasn't been one for so long...even if its utter poppycock, I'll love it just for the effort.  However, after so long it could never hope to light a candle what came before. I bought the DVD to Ghostbusters and it literally took me 2 days of viewing to weed through all the material.  UNBELIEVEABLE.  I loved every tidbit on it and even learned a few things that *gasp*  I didn't know before.

","Honestly, if you have not seen ""Ghostbusters"", and did not like it, then you as dead as those ghosts in the movie, if not more dead.  What's not to like? It's a hilarious comedy, one that still gets me cracking up today after having seen if hundreds of times.  Everyone in my family quotes lines from it, and it's great fun.  The ingenious comedy cast really makes the film soar, from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, to Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis. It was also nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a role other than Ripley from the ""Alien"" movies.  And the special effects, my God, the effects are absolutely incredible, regardless of what anybody says!  Some of them you can tell how they did them, but they still look good, while others simply amaze me!  This and all the other combined talents of comedy make ""Ghostbusters"" a delightful special effects comedy!<br/><br/>  I grew up with ""Ghostbusters"".  My friends and I obsessed about it, and played ""Ghostbusters"" with toy proton-packs and traps.  I watched ""The Real Ghostbusters"" every day, and it remains my favorite cartoon.  I remember getting ""Ghostbusters"" as a Christmas gift when I was about 5 years old. That copy has since faded out, but I still watched it, almost every day when my friends came over.  I only wish I could've seen it in theaters(I might have seen it there, but I was too young to remember). <br/><br/>
Last weekend, I purchased the ""Collector's"" DVD, and I must say, for ""Ghostbusters"" fans, and for those who just want to have a good time, it is a must!  It has loads of extras, a video commentary as opposed to an audio commentary, and deleted scenes, including a particularly weird scene in which Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play street bums instead of Ray Stanz and Pete Venkman.  As for the movie itself, the transfer is excellent!  The special effects never looked better(well, maybe in the theaters it looked best)!<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" remains a phenomenon of special effects and incredible hilarity!  Unfortunately, the re-uniting of the ghostbusters in ""Ghostbusters 2"" didn't quite have the same magic of the first film, but I still liked it.  If you haven't seen ""Ghostbusters"", or simply didn't like it because it was ""mediocre and dated"" as some reviewers at the IMDB have said, I can't help but feel sorry for you.

","An enjoyable SciFi-Comedy with a awesome job of comic timing by Bill Murray as Peter Venkman.  He plays his role with an irony that hasn't been seen since the days of Groucho Marx.  In fact, Ghostbusters(1984) is reminescent of the early films of the Marx Brothers.  Sigourney Weaver also gives a good performance as Dana, the woman who turns into a possessed demon.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is not as good as Stripes(1981), but is still an entertaining motion picture to watch.  This is one of the few movies that capture the style and flavor of H.P. Lovecraft with it's doorways to other diminisons, architecture, and set designs.  An interesting fact about Ghostbusters(1984) is it was a project originally meant for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, and I believe that if Belushi didn't die that Bill Murray would have been in this feature film.  If there's anyone Bill Murray should thank for appearing in great comedies like this then it should be Chevy Chase for stepping down from Saturday Night Live."

They create a film that will not only be loved by the generation of it's time, but will also be enjoyed by the many generations to come. Ghostbusters is one of these films.<br/><br/>As our story opens, the boys are investigating a possible ghost sighting at a library, and it is here that they come up with the idea of actually capturing and holding a ghost indefinitely. Thinking how lucrative the rights alone could be, they decide to go into business as professional paranormal exterminators.  They aren't taken very seriously at first and have trouble finding clients.  Until one day, a nice young woman wanders into their office and tells them about strange goings on in her apartment. As they investigate her case further, it is soon realized that she isn't being plagued by a small time spook.  The ghosts in her apartment building have bigger plans, and are in fact trying to bring something or someone into our world using this building as the door.  And as it turns out, only the Ghostbusters can save us.<br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman has done a tremendous job in his direction of this movie.  Instead of relying heavily on special effects, he lets his characters tell the story.  Yes, there are a lot of effects in the film, including the introduction of one of the biggest visitors to ever come to New York City.  Fans of the film know exactly who I am talking about, and the ""character"" leaves several indelible impressions upon the city.  But alas, I am getting away from the terrific human cast that is also in the picture.  Bill Murray gives one of his best performances as Dr. Peter Venkman, a smooth-talking ""game show host"" of a scientist who is always using his scientific credentials as a guise to meet women.  Note the scene in which he is doing an electric shock ""experiment"" on a pretty coed and her nervous male friend.  It's hilarious.  And also, Rick Moranis as Sigourney Weaver's nerdy neighbor Louis, who delights in playing Parchesi at his parties and always manages to lock himself out of his house time and time again.<br/><br/>Blessed with a great script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, Ghostbusters is a truly great comedy, filled with quirky characters, great visual effects, and a good sounding soundtrack.  Who honestly hasn't shouted ""Ghostbusters!"" when you hear the phrase ""Who ya gonna call?"".

Bearing this in mind, I'd have to say that Ghostbusters delivers well on this level. The film moves at a good pace, and isn't dull or lagging. The comedy is great, but unlike some other films, there are a few moments of genuine intensity that contribute to the frission in this film. In short, it doesn't overdo it when it comes to humor. The climax of the film exemplifies this; the marshmallow man was a scream when incongruously paired with the demonic threat of Gozer. It is concluded when the otherwordly threat is dispensed with; there is no last tie-ups. It ends when it should, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The FX are good, I suppose, though it's a disappointment more creatures weren't showcased.

","I've seen a lot of films from the eighties about the eighties, and this one is, for me, a clear winner. It never drops off, which is the only reason it beats Ferris Bueller's Day Off. While both are fast-paced comedies, there is a satirical wit and a strong self-critical overtone to both that is often overlooked.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters sums up so much of the get-rich-quick mentality which prevailed back then, and it puts us in the picture by making reference to all the little things which made the eighties the eighties. And it does it all in an even, witty way, that is funny to this day.<br/><br/>The eighties songs featured are not the popular ones, except perhaps Ray's ripoff of Huey Lewis And The News (he's probably still paying for that one), but they are classic tunes nonetheless. The score is brilliant, and I must admit I always watch the credits right through just to have an encore of it- and the pop tunes.<br/><br/>The effects are good enough, and the backstories offered on the DVD release give an entertaining insight into this and other aspects of the film's creation. In my view, the story behind Ghostbusters is the key to its proper appreciation, because I don't think there has ever been a more talented group of people involved in writing, directing, acting and creating a comedy movie. To hear them speak and comment on a movie they are so proud of, even to this day, is an experience I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in the genre."

","I remember seeing ""Ghostbusters"" in the theaters back in 1984, and I've occasionally watched it over the years on video.  It was getting the DVD version that made me realize without a doubt, that this is one of the most clever movies of the '80's.<br/><br/>For a comedy/horror film, this really succeeds.  The most standout feature of the movie are the actors.  Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd play so well off of each other, and the fun supporting cast only strengthens them.  The special effects are really good, resulting in something that's not quite scary or creepy, but definitely in the ""weird"" category.<br/><br/>The movie is lighthearted, fun, never takes itself too seriously, but never dips into the ""cheesy"" factor.  The one-liners are some of the funniest and most memorable put into a film.<br/><br/>""Ghostbusters"" excels as a ""fun"" movie.  From the still-catchy theme song, wild inventions, and a crew of ghost-hunters that are intent in saving New York, yet seem like they're not always exactly sure what they're doing (a far cry from the standard action hero), add up for a classic '80's movie. Definitely, a film to watch, and the DVD version is a ""must-have""."
"saraarts","10","0","0","9 August 1999"," Saras everywhere agree...this is a funny one!
","The first time I saw Ghostbusters was a comic revelation.  With wit, sophistication, and absolute knowledge of the culture, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis delivered laughs on every imaginable level, beautifully framed by expert performances by Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, and Rick Moranis.<br/><br/>While there is no time like the first time, it's good to come back to this film from time to time.  Murray and Weaver are true artists, continually pushing the boundaries of their talents, and these are characters you don't want to miss if you are a fan of either.  Also, I miss Dan Aykroyd being this funny.  If all you've ever seen of his work is Blues Brothers 2000 or Soul Man on TV, you need to watch Ghostbusters to understand why people of my generation (baby boom) still love and respect him.<br/><br/>The art direction and production design in this movie are also notable.  The sets, costumes, and special effects are wild and strangely honest at the same time, subtle or obvious exactly where they should be.  No matter how crazy things get, credibility is always suspended, just like in a good magic show."
"Ed-E-2","8","0","0","25 July 1999"," Bustin' (still) makes me feel good
","Ghostbusters was fabulous when I saw it aged 12 and 15 years on it's even better.  As a kid caught up in the (well deserved) hype, I had little interest in the dialogue and subtle spontaneous comic asides.  I was wrapped in the effects, which , stop motion aside, actually still stand up pretty well today.  <br/><br/>However, coming back to the movie on DVD after all these years I can now see the film 'whole' as it were, and it's only now do I realise just how good it is.  The special FX aren't really whats important here.  The story is highly original, has a lovely pace, and strikes a clever balance between comedy and terror.  There are some spooky moments in this film, but they never push it too far, and they are always followed by a laugh.  The film is nicely scripted but the delivery also has a nice spontaneous feel to it, perhaps not surprising considering we've got three good comedy actors and writers centre stage.<br/><br/>In fact all players in the film are fantastic, the three leads look like they've spent their whole life together, Sigourney becomes a bit of a hell-raiser, and Rick Moranis barely pauses for breath during his hilarious verbal diarrhoea as uber-nerd Louis.  Also, let us not forget another truly odious character from William Atherton, as the over-zealous officer from the EPA.  In a way, it's a shame Winston (Ernie Hudson) couldn't have been given a bit more to do or a few extra gags - but then maybe that would have been too much, and his character works well representing all us 'normal' people.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is so much fun, and so brilliantly crafted it actually makes me despair for the kids of the 90's as they've had so little to compare to this.  Only Men In Black and the Pixar releases have come close.  Come on Hollywood - start making some original fun films again! <br/><br/>
Oh, and special mention must go to the wonderfully spooky music by Elmer Bernstein, which is often overlooked (overheard?) due to the famous Ray Parker Jr. theme tune.<br/><br/>In summary:<br/><br/>great for kids + great for grown ups = superb for grown up kids."

The cast in Ghostbusters is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, there was so much great comic talent.  The story is original, and the chosen destructor at the films end was the best so called villain I have ever seen.

","This movie has been my favorite since I was young. I have recently bought the 15th Anniversary Edition of Ghostbusters, which I might add makes me angry in several ways. 1) I don't like how the camera moves around the screen, when one person is cut out. 2)Where is the added scenes? I bought the video to see the added scenes, and there none. I have the original movie, and I bought the 15th Anniversary to see new scenes, and there were none, it was the same. When I was young, my friends and I dressed up with our toy Proton Packs and watched the movie while acting it out. We knew the lines off by heart, and I still know them. I have never seen New York. I have planned twice to go there, but they have canceled each time. I have always dreamed of going there since I first saw Ghostbusters. But it can wait because no matter how many times I have seen Ghostbusters, it never gets boring. I love this movie because of New York, I love how Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the story, it was amazing! Now, I always wondered why Ivan Reitman never made Ghostbusters 3. There was some talk of it, but I think it was only a rumor. As for Ghostbusters 2, part 1 was WAY better.<br/><br/>Thank you for letting me get this out of me."

Dan Akyroyd gives his best performance before he melted away into obscurity, and Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis are great yet under rated for their roles.  Rick Moranis and a Giant Marshmallow man steal the show.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious by going to the extremes and throwing out all realism, yet filling the jokes with witty and sharpe dialogue.  It reminds me a lot of the middle years of hte Simpsons.<br/><br/>Yet what makes this movie so great is its impact.  It single handedly created a sub-genre, sci-fi comedy.

","Ghostbusters introduced a new way of making comedy films that few films since have properly duplicated; the art of mixing special effects with humor.  Even the horrible special effects work, simply because the film uses them so effectively.<br/><br/>Bill Murray was the best choice for Peter Venkman, a person whose easy to dislike, but impossible to hate.  Bill made Peter work, and made the romance between Peter and Dana Barrett believable.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd, who also co wrote the film, also made Ray Stantz work excellently, a man no one could hate, no matter how stupid he acted.  I loved his speeches, which made the circumstances he was in funny and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver also made Dana Barrett a fun character who made her place in the movie by being sensible, not deliberately funny.  The non-sense of Zuul, which she also played perfectly, also turned out to be great fun.<br/><br/>Harold Ramis, Dan's co-writer, gave Egon Spengler a great part as well. It was entertaining to see him serve as the straight man while everyone else were making so many jokes, yet still remain one of the funniest characters in the film.<br/><br/>Annie Potts receptionist/secretary also made the film fun; her perfect New York accent and her attitude made the part fun to watch.<br/><br/>Rick Moranis also made his role fun to watch; I have to respect an intelligent man who can play a moronic character so well, and Rick's character did great in the role.<br/><br/>And to ignore the great parts William Ackerman and Ernie Hudson gave to the film would be a great act of injustice; Ackerman was easy to hate, and willing to play the fool, to an extent, while Ernie did a wonderful job as the fourth Ghostbuster, giving some of his best lines in the film during the battle against Gozer.<br/><br/>I wish more films would take the example from Ghostbusters; the use of personality and good acting is far more important in a film than special effects, but special effects, when used properly, make a film excellent."

A british dude said that he didn't remember any of them, when you are not paying any attention you don't understand them. Because there are so many quotes you can't remember them like ""Where are we? We are in the teens. When we go twenty tell me to throw up!"", and this is only a simple one! ""If someone asks you if you are a god say yes!"" or ""Do you believe in God? Never met him!"". So you see... A very great script, with loads of quote, a awesome Billy Murray who gives a great perfomance, ofcourse no-one must forget Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.<br/><br/>
The direction is just fine and the effects(although they don't play such a big part) are fine, although you can understand their age... I though the cartoon made the film, i was always saying that the cartoon was nothing in-compare to the films, until yesterday i hadn't realize that i had made a big mistake! The main theme is passable and the other songs are good enough. As i said the script is the best thing in this movie! <br/><br/>

"Mr. Pulse","9","0","0","10 June 2001"," A life-defining movie
","There are two movies I have seen more than any other, literally dozens and dozens, perhaps even a hundred times.  One is Spaceballs, the other is Ghostbusters.  As a child, I would watch them over and over, reciting line for line.  It's probably responsible for some of my mental problems (And obsessions with memorization), but the movie still stands up today as one of my favorites to watch.<br/><br/>It seems silly to tell you the plot, not knowing what Ghostbusters is about is like being unfamiliar with the story of creation with Adam and Eve.  At least amongst my generation it stands as a rite of passage practically; when my friends learned that another friend had never seen it, he was practically shunned.  The omission was called a good deal of things, my favorite adjective was ""outrageous!""<br/><br/>Anyway, Ghostbusters is of course, the tale of three parapsychologists, Doctors Peter Venkman, Ray Stanz, and Egon Spengler (Great character names, I can never forget them) who are kicked out of their professorships at Columbia University, and decide to go into business for themselves as a sort of exterminator service for people with ghost problems.  The film is mix of comedy, action, and scares, that somehow manages to hit just the right notes on all three, you scream and laugh at the same time.  It's a mix that few have been able to achieve since (The recent Evolution by Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman has limited success in this same area).<br/><br/>Everything about this movie clicks.  The cast, led by Bill Murray, seem so perfect in their roles.  Harold Ramis, for all his success elsewhere, shall always be Egon (Love the line when facing the Marshmellow Man, ""Sorry Venkman.  I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought."")  The song by Ray Parker Jr. is of course famous, but Elmer Bernstein's excellent score has sadly been overlooked.  The effects, fairly cutting edge for the time, (mostly) hold up well, those that don't only make the ghostbusting scenes all the more humorous.<br/><br/>Really, if you haven't seen this movie, you should be arrested.  It's on television more than Die Hard.  Watch it!"

","I'm familiar with a Saturday Morning live-action show called ""Ghost Busters"" that starred Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch and a man in a gorilla suit as an ape called Kong, but that was puerile, gimmicky and ridiculous compared to this straight-faced comedy about freelance parapsychologists who open their own ghost exterminating business. Insulting to real ghosts inasmuch as they refer to every sort of intangible goblin or monster as a ""ghost"", the film also makes fun and pokes ridicule to real ghost hunters as nothing but a pack of money-hungry, double-talking, over-sexed pseudo-intellectuals with a collection of illogical and unpractical Flash Gordon-equipment. There is a pretty decent movie here as Bill Murray proves to be an enjoyable and likeable cut-up with a genius-level I.Q., Dan Aykroyd as the boyishly innocent believer in ghosts ( a character not unlike myself) and Harold Ramis as the straight man to the idiocy and the only one with a foot grounded in reality. Rick Moranis is as usual the rather nerdishly inept comic relief, Ernie Hudson the man with the muscle and Superman-grin and Sigourney Weaver who isn't attractive enough to be the type of looker that she is supposed to be. Tossed in for Bill Murray to pursue unsuccessfully, she is less sexual than a car accident, but is a good enough actress to give credence to her role. Annie Potts also provides a wonderfully funny talent as their frustrated, harried and demurely sexy secretary ready to kill them just so she can catch her breath. Slavitza Jovan of the unpronouncable name (later of the House on Haunted Hill remake infamy) is also on hand as some sort of forgotten immortal here to revert the world back to pagan times. It's a great comedy with action overtones, but the ghost formula is straight out of the pen of a Hollywood hack."

Akyroid and Ramis are also perfect in their roles (and this is coming from someone who doesn't really appreciate Akyroid's ""comedy"").  <br/><br/>This is one of the director's best films; the pacing is perfect, with action and comedy in a revolving door...

Slimer was worthy of an academy award, I personally think he was robbed.  The film combines both comedy and suspense to create a fun movie adventure.  For fans of Bill Murray or Dan Ackroyd's type of comedy, this is a must see.  For fans of Sigourney Weaver, it is a must see simply to see her in a feminine role that is rare for her action career.

","I was 13 years old when my older sister took me to the theater to see ""Ghostbusters"" back in June 1984. I had just gotten out of school for summer vacation and we went an saw a movie that had us laughing our heads off. This movie has lost a little of its comic edge a decade-and-a-half later, but today its still a very funny special effects comedy. The Ghostbusters about a trio of paranormal scientists who go into business catching ghosts when they discover supernatural phenomenon plaguing New York City. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are hilarious as the Ghostbusters, who spend lots of time flushing out spirits while making wise-cracks in between. Sigourney Weaver also stars in her first comedy as the Ghostbusters' first client, a musician who one day finds nasty spirits in her apartment and in the process falls in love with nutty Murray. Rick Moranis has some delightful comic moments as Weaver's nerdy neighbor, and Annie Potts (from TV's ""Designing Women"") is good too as the Ghostbusters' receptionist. Everybody is terrific in ""Ghostbusters"" with the exception of William Atherton as the villain who doesn't like the trio he refers to as ""snowball artists"". But the best performance comes from Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman. This is one of his best film roles of his career. He's naturally funny every time he's on screen. One other major asset in ""Ghostbusters"" are the special visual effects by Richard Edlund, the maestro who worked on the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the first two ""Poltergeist"" films, and the first Indiana Jones movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The effects in this movie help to make it not only funny but exciting too. This film should have won the Oscar for visual effects because there were far more special effects shots here then there was in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the movie that beat out ""Ghostbusters"" for the visual effects Oscar for 1984. Also, I love the title song by Ray Parker Jr. (which also was Oscar nominated). The song was a smash hit on the radio during the summer of 1984 just as the movie was a smash hit in theaters. ""Ghostbusters"" helped to make the summer of 1984 memorable. If you can remember back then, this was the summer ""Ghostbusters"", ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", ""Gremlins"", and ""The Karate Kid"" dominated the box office. It also was the summer the PG-13 rating was created (thanks to the violence in ""Temple of Doom"" and ""Gremlins"", PG rated movies). And it also was the summer the Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles and the U.S. Team dominated big time. The summer vacation of 1984 for me was absolutely one of my favorite summers of my life when I was a kid, and ""Ghostbusters"" was a big part of it. Even though I didn't laugh quite as hard at it after seeing it again recently, it's still a very funny movie. <br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

","Having watched it in 2018 (for the first time), 34 years after it originally released, I guess it is safe to say that this movie hasn't aged well. A disappointing watch when considering the fact that I expected to be entertained by it. I don't blame the VFX of this movie because it might have been appropriate for its time but my main issue is how the film turns out to be, especially towards the end. I hardly laughed or was amused by the comedy in this movie. Funny enough when you consider the fact that a lot of people seem to love it for its ""quotable dialogues"". The premise of the film does seem interesting but there is an absence of a feeling of genuine threat or conflict inspite of the climax where the world is supposedly going to end. Another thing that bugged me was the treatment of the female lead, i.e, the character of dana barrett (played by sigourney weaver). The character was objectified to a degree that didn't seem necessary as far as the story is concerned. The performances of the lead cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver and Harold Ramis were decent though."

","Ghost Busters is one of those movies which when you were ten years old seemed like the greatest thing you'd ever seen and when you are thirty years old you wonder what all the fuss was about. It's certainly not by any means a bad movie but in retrospect it's not by any means a great movie either. It's a charming, but only intermittently funny, comedy with some jazzy (at least for 1984) special effects thrown in to liven up the proceedings.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is a rather simple one. New York City has a problem with ghosts and three scientists form a ghost-catching company. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play the three original ghost busters with Ernie Hudson joining up later. Murray is undoubtedly the star. His character of Peter Venkman gets most of the best lines and as you would expect Murray delivers them brilliantly. Aykroyd and Ramis are fine in their roles but they'll never outshine Murray who is terrific whether delivering some sly, understated humor or being completely over the top and totally off the wall. Annie Potts as the Ghost Busters' receptionist, Sigourney Weaver as Venkman's potential love interest and Rick Moranis as Weaver's exceptionally nerdy neighbor round out the principal cast. Moranis in particular has some choice comic moments and his character of Louis probably trails only Murray's Venkman in the laughs department.<br/><br/>With its solid cast and plenty of subtle, witty dialogue the movie has a lot going for it. And there are some rather exciting, and sometimes amusing confrontations between the ghosts and the Ghost Busters. The movie certainly has its moments but there are too many instances where the film just kind of sits there and the story struggles to move forward. But there is ultimately a great payoff in the end with an undeniably brilliant final scene. If you expect an all-time comedy classic you may well be disappointed but if your expectations are a touch more realistic you will find that Ghost Busters is a reasonably enjoyable film and that's not so bad."

","Ghostbusters (1984): Dir: Ivan Reitman / Cast: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis: Original and freakish comedy about facing fear. When extra-terrestrial activity threaten mankind then the guys with the proton packs are called into action to vanquish the problem. Directed by Ivan Reitman who previously had success with Bill Murray in the mediocre comedy Meatballs as well as the army comedy Stripes. Murray is ripe with sarcasm, which conceals his sense of wonder when a woman's body slowly elevates in front of him. Dan Ackroyd seems to be the technician, while Harold Ramis is the analyst. Sigourney Weaver appears as a customer whose refrigerator is the gate way to another dimension. This leads to Murray's constant flirtations until she is transformed into a demonic dog. Rick Moranis plays Weaver's neighbor whom she pursues in her deformed image. His dimwit nature has him constantly locking himself out of his apartment. Eventually he is being pursued by a demonic dog. Clever and detailed screenplay with exquisite special effects highlighted with ghostly figures including Slimer the green hungry ghost, and the giant Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man that terrorizes the city. Tremendous fun filled balance of humour and special effects that serves as an example of our curiosity of the unknown. Score: 10 / 10"
"Stompgal_87","7","1","2","24 May 2014"," ""Don't cross the streams.""
","I once saw the part of this film where the Ghostbusters hit the headlines while Ray Parker Jr's theme song is played but what made me want to watch this film in full the most was the ""Don't cross the streams"" part of the dialogue being used as the sound clip for the 11 Second Club's March 2014 competition, so I decided to rent the DVD. On my first full viewing, I was so tired that I fell asleep for part of it, thus making it harder for me to follow the story, so I paused it and came back to it later. I initially gave this film a 6/10 but after having found the film easier to follow second time around due to being more awake, I upgraded my rating to a 7 because most of the film is engaging with a few minor flaws.<br/><br/>First off, I found the acting from Rick Moranis overdone for his character Louis Tully. Secondly, the pacing was uneven with the part between the headline-hitting sequence and the climax with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man being the slowest despite some effective scenes such as Louis and Dana becoming possessed (the view of Central Park as they embrace is beautiful as is the accompanying orchestral piece) and several ghosts taking over New York. Thirdly, the animation on the horned demons was jerky and a bit slow.<br/><br/>Moving onto the positives, the theme song, despite being played three times throughout the film, is catchy and memorable while Elmer Bernstein's musical score is at its best when it is chilling and powerful. The animation on the ghosts, especially Slimer, was better than that on the horned demons and the Marshmallow Man was generally well done and the scanimation used for the proton streams to capture the ghosts was adequate. Moranis's overacting aside, the acting from the rest of the cast was subtly done, especially from Bill Murray and the late Harold Ramis. Annie Potts (who later went on to voice Bo Peep in the first two 'Toy Story' films) as the Ghostbusters receptionist Janine and Sigourney Weaver as Dana were surprising additions to the cast. A lot of the dialogue is memorable, especially the ""Don't cross the streams"" part and while the Ghostbusters base is run-down, the hotel dining room when the Ghostbusters catch Slimer is elaborate and the scenery of Central Park is stunning. I also liked the ghostly drone-sounding siren on the Ghostbusters' car, the haunting beginning at the library and the well-paced ending where Slimer surprisingly flies towards the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Ghostbusters' is a mostly entertaining horror film with its music, dialogue and the majority of special effects being its best features."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","23 November 2012"," Comedy legend
","One of the best comedy films in existence, and for several good reasons. Ghostbusters is one of those rare films that manages to stand head and shoulders above its peers for its originality, sharp wit, masterful storytelling and a cast of humorous oddballs.<br/><br/>But what really sets this movie apart is the fact that it doesn't rely on pop culture references or inappropriate jokes, aimed to make the toddlers in the audience giggle. Rather it relies on sarcasm, visual creativity and the same brand of randomness that made the Monty Python group so successful. In essence, it's a timeless film, which humour stems from the human brilliance and not the lowest common denominator. It's a comedy film that even the most high brow film snobs can enjoy, as it doesn't treat its audience like idiots. There are several jokes that you can miss entirely and only get later when you have time to mull over the dialogue, which in my opinion is an extremely good thing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's a very quotable film. The dialogue is at times razor sharp and some of the verbal gymnastics between the main characters still make me blink my eyes in surprise. The cast is also very talented, and no less could have been accepted for this script, but luckily they managed to get the big boys and girls to play these characters. The chemistry between Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver is especially memorable.<br/><br/>If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the special effects haven't aged all that well. Some of them are still surprisingly good, like the ghost trapping beams, which should not be crossed, but some, like the guardian ""dogs"" of Zuul look really fake. It doesn't ruin the film, in some cases it even adds to the film's charm, but it's still an eyesore in certain scenes. And the ending has a certain amount of ""love it or hate it"" quality to it. I lean more towards hate it, but only slightly.<br/><br/>All in all this a classic. A comedy film that managed to create its own universe, its own cosmos and mythology. It did that with ambitious story, clever writing and a great cast of characters. It worked back then and it still does. Find it, see it, love it. Force other people to watch it."
"krazyguy100","10","1","2","30 June 2012"," Ghosts take over New York, and only Bill Murray and Co. can stop them.
","It's a bit difficult to review this film in a conventional way. Normally, I'd be disappointed with a movie that has as many tonal inconsistencies as this does, and also has such a convoluted plot. These are valid concerns, and are enough to make a lot of movies just plain suck. But in the summer of 1984, convention was thrown out the window and an unsurpassed American classic was born. Ghostbusters is enormously entertaining and one of the funniest movies ever, containing some of film's most iconic moments of all time. With vintage special effects, great characters, and large doses of Bill Murray, Ghostbusters is a movie that everyone can, and probably will, deeply enjoy.<br/><br/>The film opens in a mood typical of a horror movie, with an innocent, elderly librarian being terrorized by some sort of ghost. Then suddenly, some great 80s music kicks in and in the next scene, we are introduced to the least scary or serious thing ever: Bill Murray. This man makes Ghostbusters his own, and completely steals the show. His dry, sarcastic humor is so perfect and unique, and he can conjure up laughs with just a look. Nothing fazes him, everything amuses him, and nothing is allowed to be taken too seriously in his presence. Without him, this movie would be vastly different, and probably quite a bit less fun. Interestingly, he has great chemistry with Sigourney Weaver, and it's a joy to watch their characters interact. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis complement each other (and contrast with Murray) magnificently, playing socially awkward geeks with hilarious results. Ernie Hudson, portraying the last-minute fourth ghost buster, also gets in a few great lines. William Atherton from Die Hard also appears late in the game, playing just as great an antagonist as in said film. Adding more to the spectacle is the inclusion of Rick Moranis, playing one of his best characters ever. Add it all together and you get a brilliant comedy that is completely outrageous, yet at times quietly subtle in its humor. It's also one of the few of its kind that actually gets better with age and repeated viewings.<br/><br/>However, there's still the matter of the utterly inane story to consider. By the climax, any remaining semblance of plot is basically thrown out the window. But the film's rather ridiculous premise actually serves to better the film. Some of the movie's most strikingly memorable moments come from the silliest concepts, such as ""crossing the streams,"" the Slimer ghost, or the colossal Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (all of which still look fantastic, even by today's CGI standards). And it's examples like these that tell us how much fun the filmmakers were having with the whole concept from the get-go. All the ridiculous backstory with Zuul, Gozer the Gozerian, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster doesn't mean much; it's all about being entertaining, and Ghostbusters does this perfectly.<br/><br/>With such a strange foundation for a film- that is, being big- budget, special effects-laden horror-comedy- there were countless things that could have gone wrong. Against all odds, Ghostbusters gets everything absolutely right. It's blast for people of all ages, and an absolute laughter riot. It has an immensely talented cast backing the superb Bill Murray, just doing what he does best, and a plethora of noteworthy scenes and one-liners. It's a must-own, and it deserves 10 out of 10 stars."
"daffy-d","8","1","2","12 April 2012"," The Ghostbusters' Guide to Small Business
","In this recession hit cesspool that we wade through today, times are hard for the small businessperson. We often hark back to the glory days in the mid eighties when the the self-employed were kings among men, mass unemployment provided cheap labour and the national minimum wage was only the stuff of a communist's dream. This was the age of the yuppie, the brickish mobile phone, the tape-loading home computer and, of course, the Ghostbusters: men who knew all too well what small business implementation meant.<br/><br/>The founders of the Ghostbusters (Drs Spengler, Stantz and Venkman) were firmly ensconced in the academic gravy train before being made redundant due to the perceived lack of moral and financial viability of their research. With no funding and only their ideas, as well as some purloined laboratory equipment, these three, instead of going cap-in-hand to the unemployment office, used their bold initiative and set up their own small business: Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>At first they only had an idea that they genuinely believed in: a paranormal reconnaissance and disposal service. With little or no market research, they collectively decided to risk Dr Stantz's home, taking out a triple mortgage secured against the property in order to procure some fixed assets. A high risk strategy that they staked against their service being exclusive to their chosen market.<br/><br/>Their first task was to search and snare business premises, wisely choosing one of the less salubrious areas of Manhattan for a property search. This resulted in their finding a ramshackle former fire station with a high level of interior and exterior maintenance requirements. Both criteria ensured initial start up costs were kept to a minimum while being able to stay within their target audience in the heart of New York City and the Tri-state Area.<br/><br/>Now with a work space, the three pioneers soon divided the labour: Dr Spengler became head of research and development, ensuring their tools of the trade were operational as soon as possible; Dr Stantz procured more fixed assets, including a reasonably priced used vehicle, undertaking the maintenance work himself to slash costs; Dr Venkman became the human face of the organisation, encouraging his partners with humour and constructive criticism. A receptionist/secretary was hired in the form of Janine Melnitz, who with her New Yorker savvy and no nonsense attitude, was a great find in an already saturated job market. A strong branding exercise in the form of a striking logo and accompanying song was soon incorporated into the business, which awaited its first customers.<br/><br/>After an initial slow period, as expected in any new business, the work soon trickled in, starting with just one customer, Ms Dana Barrett, with a seemingly small complaint, one which our intrepid entrepreneurs could easily handle. From then, possibly by word of mouth in the spirit world (or syndicated television advertising) their turnover increased exponentially. For the initial contracts with large corporations, including luxury hotels, they were able to charge higher fees being the only ghostbusting service within that area. Having a sliding scale of prices also meant that the ordinary customer was not priced out of the market, gaining them popularity with the bottom end of the demographic.<br/><br/>Additional labour was soon acquired in hiring Winston Zeddmore, with a strong work ethic based on monetary reward, and a brutal honesty in admitting that if the paycheck were right, he would believe in anything. Winston fitted in well with the other founders in providing a neutral sounding board and an additional common sense attitude in tandem with Dr Venkman.<br/><br/>Even with four operatives, three being executive board members, the unpredictability of working with the paranormal took its toll. The Environmental Protection Agency intervened causing an administrative as well as cataclysmic headache for the Ghostbusters and the city in general. After arrest, interrogation and incarceration, the exclusivity of the Ghostbusters' business shone through and after a no nonsense meeting with the mayor, they were free to tackle the crisis at hand.<br/><br/>And so the Ghostbusters saw themselves go from disgraced academics to small business entrepreneurs to city saviours. With the right combination of ideas, talent and a previously untapped market, you too could become as successful. Just remember to never cross the streams of business and interpersonal relationships unless there is no other choice.<br/><br/>*** In my next essay ""Ghostbusters II: What went wrong?"" I will outline the errors in the Ghostbusters' taxing and liability insurance strategies and how ultimately they managed to regain a foothold in a recession-riddled and cynical market."
"nickmesafilms","10","1","2","8 December 2011"," Ghostbusters (1984) - It's Slimer! It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man! Who You Gonna Call? GHOSTBUSTERS!
","""Ghostbusters"" is one of the most classic movies of the 1980s, and it's also one of the best comedies of all time. But it's mostly one of my favorite movies of all time. After losing their jobs at the Columbia University, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, star as scientists who team up to become a group of natural ghost hunters named the Ghostbusters. They later research demonic spirits haunting a woman's apartment. Sigourney Weaver portrays the victim of a haunted spirit in her apartment named Dana, who has a geeky neighbor named Louis Tully, portrayed hilariously by Rick Moranis, delivering the best performance in the movie, who awkwardly tries to hit on Dana. With some unique and cheesy visual effects that are actually awesome, a cast of characters that deliver light-hearted laughs, a script with some classic humor, and an impressive directing job by Ivan Reitman, ""Ghostbusters"" really works as a classic ghost comedy. The movie contains a list of some of the best actors in the typical 80s comedy including Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Weaver, Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Ernie Hudson. I actually laughed a lot with this movie, and I think it deserves to be laughed with. Every moment is memorable and classic like my two favorite scenes: the Slimer situation at the hotel, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man situation at the end. From beginning to the end credits, I'm still entertained by a movie that delivers light-hearted laughs, a golden cast, and some neat visual effects. This just proves that ""Ghostbusters"" improves more than it did back then. Oh, and let's not forget the awesome theme song that won't leave your head for the rest of the day. ""Ghostbusters"", in my review, ""an entertaining treat of spooky comedy""."
"The-Last-Prydonian","9","1","2","3 November 2011"," Should be the benchmark to any contemporary big budget film-maker
","It's symptomatic of many a big budget, box office blockbuster that the film itself, it's plot (if there is one)and character end up playing second fiddle to the awesome and costly special effects. It seems that many top Hollywood film-makers seem content to show of their flashy special visuals rather than competently entertain it's audience and tell a solid, coherent story. It's as if they're practically throwing their over-sized bank balance at us and saying ""Look how much money I've got!"". Perhaps then that it's feasible that contemporary big shot movie producers should be forced to be sat down sometime and watch ""Ghostbusters"". A movie that to my mind and many others rates as one of the most iconic pictures of the 1980's. Rivalling such other blockbuster's of the era as ""Back to the Future"" and ""Gremlins"" for it's sheer iconography. Although for my money it pits each movie to the post for it's original, adroit, self knowing screenplay which was the brainchild of comic actor/writers Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis. Two men who respectively cut their teeth working on comedy sketch shows ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV"" <br/><br/>A sublime celebration of the Horror Comedies of the 1940's and 50's which included ""Hold that Ghost"" and ""The Ghost Breakers"". The film's basic but innovative premise revolved around three parapsychologists who are drummed out of the University which finances their studies due to their outlandish theories. Now officially unemployed and their reputations being seemingly left in tatters they never the less endeavour to go in to business for their own. As due to recent scientific findings after a fortuitous if not hair-raising encounter with a ghostly apparition leads to the conclusion that it's possible to trap and contain a ghost indefinitely. This leading them to take the cue to go in to business for themselves as supernatural ""pest controllers"" and calling themselves ""Ghostbusters"". <br/><br/>The concept was one so offbeat that it might have very well fallen flat on it's face in the hands of lesser accomplished, comedic minds. But in the capable hands of both Ackroyd and Ramis it proved arguably to be the most lucrative and proud achievement of their individual careers. It's success led it to spawn a (admittedly inferior) sequel, an animated kids TV series and a slew of merchandise with a more recent video game having proving to be a financial hit on the gaming market. <br/><br/>It's also proved to be a fittingly effective vehicle for the sardonic, comic talents of one Bill Murray who was cast in the now legendary and popular role of Peter Venkman. One that was earmarked for the late John Belushi who would have seemed the obvious choice given that he was riding on the coattails of his success with friend and co-star Ackroyd in the cult musical comedy ""The Blues Brothers"". Tragically however it was not to be and in a bitter-sweet twist of fate it proved to be master-stroke that Murray would be cast. For it's nigh impossible to picture anyone else as the infinitely sarcastic, fast talking Venkman. Inhabiting the role as if he were born to it Murray's Venkman is the spokesman for the audience on screen. Vocally and cynically commenting not only only on his two colleagues outlandish theories but on the extraordinary events that occur throughout the film. And with a hilariously memorable array of ingenious set pieces that include an early encounter with a Library Ghost, their first job tackling ""Slimer"" in a a prestigious Hotel, Rick Moranis's Louis Tully being pursued by a rampaging demonic Terror Dog through New York City. It all culminates in a legendary show stopping finale where the ""Busters"" face against an ancient Sumerian Demi-God called Gozer on top of a New York City apartment building. And if that weren't enough Ackrord and Ramis succeed in pulling out one more eye-popping surprise out of their imaginative bag of tricks! And while the then formidable(for it's time) special effects, which incidentally though dated still hold up reasonably well. They are that rarity in that they don't overshadow the movie's sharp and masterful screenplay. If anything it reinforces and enables the audience to buy in to the insane, nonsensical spectacle on display. Affectionately and deftly aiming slight digs at the far fetched ludicrousness that abounds the film. A scene in a elevator part way through the picture winningly highlights this . When discussing with his colleagues how they haven't had a sufficient successful test of their Ghostbusting equipment, Bill Murrays infinitely cynical Venkman dryly remarks ""Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back"". <br/><br/>The inclusion of the often obligatory love interest is present as is it routinely is with many other blockbusters and takes the form of Sigourney Weaver who portrays Dana Barrett, the protagonists first client. A character I'm pleased to say doesn't feel as if she's been shoehorned in and plays an integral key role in the overall plot. And Weaver being the capable actress that she is, is effortlessly charming with a down to earth, candid manner that proves her to be an excellent foil to Murray's brash Venkman. <br/><br/>Ernie Hudson, the unsung hero of the movie and although relatively minor in screen-time and presence and given little to do still makes some impact, especially in a beautifully penned and acted moment with Ackroyd regarding the Bible and It's references to ""Judgement Day"". Throw in a amusing turn from Rick Moranis as Dana's neighbouring irritant Louis Tully as well as Acyroyd's child like enthusiasm as Ray Stanz and Ramis's portrayal of the aloof, verbally monotone, awkward brains of the team, Egon Spengler and you have one of the most smart, classy and clever comedy blockbusters of the past twenty-five years! A film that should be the benchmark for any aspiring big budget film-maker with even bigger ideas!"
"oneguyrambling","7","1","2","6 November 2010"," A defining film of the 80s - but hasn't aged that well.
","Ghostbusters is widely acknowledged as one of the defining movies of the 1980s. Everyone seems to remember it fondly and you still hear ""Don't cross the streams"" and ""I am the Keymaster"" randomly quoted from time to time.<br/><br/>Now I'm not here to burst any bubbles, I have nothing but positive thoughts whenever the movie is mentioned, but watching the 25th Anniversary edition recently I began to second guess its standing.<br/><br/>Immediately after watching the film again the other night I thought that it is not realistic to call Ghostbusters one of the ""all time"" classics. Sure it is a good movie, charming and at times amusing, but it is not in the same league as other 80s flicks.<br/><br/>Then a funny thing happened, two days passed and I allowed my memory to elevate Ghostbusters back up the pecking order then I re-read my notes. Therefore I think Ghostbusters is perhaps a better concept than film, and I'm not knocking those that love this film and stand up for it, I just don't see it in the same light as say ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even ""Stripes"", let alone ""Die Hard"" or ""Aliens"".<br/><br/>Perhaps it was more your circumstances, I'm positive that movies I saw in my teens and early 20s are remembered more favourably simply because they were great times period in my life (not that now is so horrible), and I am now more analytical (unfortunately) and unforgiving when I am watching a film for the first time.<br/><br/>Anyway Ghostbusters. Not a bad film in any respect, just not as good as some think.<br/><br/>The film of course is about three guys who for no known reason start a paranormal investigation company after having their research grant summarily dragged. The three are Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis), Egon is the nerdy genius, Ray the ideas man and driving force behind the business and Peter just tags along for something to do and to get girls.<br/><br/>As always Bill Murray is also the main reason to watch the film, and he provides most of the laughs throughout, including some that result from seemingly ad-libbed remarks after another character speaks.<br/><br/>Their first mission is successful yet destructive, and luckily they find they have entered into a growth market, as paranormal activity increases in New York dramatically shortly after they commence operations. Due to the escalation in demand they hire a new ""Buster"" Winston, who doesn't do much in the film but obviously balanced out the poster.<br/><br/>Their first client is Sigourney Weaver as Dana, who has a demonic possession in her fridge, (don't we all?), she happens to live in an apartment building that is a conduit for all that is evil in New York, and she wondered why the rent was so cheap? She is taken and possessed, as is her neighbour Lewis (Rick Moranis), and they begin a hunt for each other referring to themselves as the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster respectively.<br/><br/>As there must be conflict in any movie the Environmental Protection Agency shuts down Ghostbusters operations and in doing so inadvertently release all their captured ghosties, increasing the very need for their existence, which doesn't help as they are in jail.<br/><br/>This leads to the reason why I think the film is remembered in such a good light, once the boys are in jail and the ghosts cut loose New York cries out for their assistance, so the finale is not simply four guys in overalls running around with weird backpacks, but that plus a crowd of vocally supportive New Yorkers egging them on.<br/><br/>At times it is almost like a sporting contest how the crowd interaction actually seems to elevate the importance of the Ghostbuster's actions, and it definitely gives the latter scenes a bit more buzz.<br/><br/>Ultimately Ghostbusters is a fun film, though lightweight harmless and largely disposable. I would consider it a good rental every few years so that you might throw it in and shut your brain off for 90 minutes, but I can't see why people obsess over it.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. We all know the plot now, and 90% of the laughs of the laughs are from Bill Murray, but that could be said about all his films.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","Since there was nothing on TV (except for a few movies), I decided to watch Ghostbusters on TV to give it a shot, and it was awesome. Another 80's classic (Along with Back to the Future and a few other films).<br/><br/>It stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, etc.<br/><br/>Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis) are three scientists at Columbia University in New York City. When their grant expires, the guys are fired and they go into business as a ghost extermination company called ""Ghostbusters"". Their first customer is orchestra cello player Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who was scared out of her apartment on the 22nd floor of a high rise apartment building on Central Park West. It seems that Dana's neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is also being affected by the strange happenings in the apartment building. Armed with proton guns, the Ghostbusters become wildly popular, and they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), who is looking for a job with good pay. Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Peck is forced to believe the Ghostbusters when New York City is put under siege by an ancient Sumerian God named Gozer the Gozerian, who is channeled through the apartment building that Dana and Louis live in, and the mayor has no choice but to let the Ghostbusters out of jail to face Gozer.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters is a fantastic, feel-good movie with lots of laughs and spectacular fun throughout the film. but there's going to the third movie to the series, but will it help the movie industry make a comeback? I don't know.<br/><br/>If you liked Back to the Future, then you will like this one.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters gets 10 stars."
"imagiking","7","1","2","2 March 2010"," Ghostbusters: Less Good Than it Should Be
","Hardly needing any sort of introduction, Ghostbusters is a classic film which is celebrated as one of the best known and most loved comedies in film history.<br/><br/>For those exceptional few of you who aren't aware, it's about a team of three college psychology professors who, when they're thrown out of their jobs, establish a business hunting down and capturing ghosts together. A strange ancient legend comes to bear and the laughs roll off amidst the action.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see the lasting appeal of this film, the many quirky lines coming primarily from the ever wonderful Bill Murray. There's plenty of jostling and joking between the Ghostbusters, the Murray/Aykroyd dynamic being particularly effective. Although the jokes are effective, and the laughs are certainly many, there's something lacking in the film and I found myself somewhat disappointed in the face of this imposing legacy. It's not that it's a bad film, certainly not, there aren't even a huge number of flaws. The humour works well, and there are little to no jokes which fail entirely. That said, it feels less good than it should be. Perhaps, my time rather after Ghostbusters', it's just that bit too dated to be particular appealing to my comedy tastes. The problem lies primarily in the nature of the laughs; none entirely memorable or strong. Not once was I struggling for breath, more chuckling lightly at the funny but never hilarious dialogue. Additionally, Murray's upfront affection always seemed very strange to me, though this impacts little on the film.<br/><br/>Though graced with clever writing, rapid-fire dialogue, and fine acting, Ghostbusters simply seems lacking, and the majority of the jokes are more smileworthy than laughworthy. Perfectly good for a chuckle though."

","Ghostbusters is easily on of the best films from the 80s. It is a sci-fi action comedy that can match Back to Future for popularity. It was a film that was Bill Murphy's first commercial success and it had a successful sequel and spin-off cartoon series.<br/><br/>Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are scientists working at a New York University who study paranormal activity. They loose their position, being seen as a menace to the university who focus on popularity rubbish and not real science. The three decide to continue their research themselves, and to help fund it they form their own business, a ghost extermination services, the Ghostbusters. After they first successful capture they become instant celebrities and their business booms. One resident of New York, Dian Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), suffers a particularly bad ghost infestation, with an ancient demi-god tormenting her. She hires the Ghostbusters, who discover that all the ghostly activities were linked and including in the city.<br/><br/>So what makes Ghostbusters work? Lots of things, a script with a good story, jokes and gags, with Ivan Reitman skill with action and special effects. The effects were spectacular for its time. It was easily Ivan Reitman's best film. What really works for this film is the cast. Bill Murray offers an excellent deadpan performance, having great timing with his jokes, showing why he is one of best comedic actor from America. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also excellent comedic performers, having a different approach to Murphy. I enjoyed Annie Potts as the gruff, tough native New Yorker. Sigourney Weaver also rarely stars in a bad film. She beings in an originality person's perspective to the film. It would have been easy for this film to fall into slapstick territory; but luckily the writers and director avoid this trap, using more clever vebral gags and sharp wit, making the film a funny experience.<br/><br/>This is a rare example that big budget comedy can work. It's a must see."
"moviesleuth2","10","1","2","16 January 2010"," A classic
","Granted, this isn't a film with pretentious drama or self-importance. And it's a film with belly laughs instead of subconscious amusement. But it is a classic in the same way that ""Casablanca"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are. It is one of Hollwood's most successful comedies, and for good reason: it's a very funny and spooky movie.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple: After getting fired from their university, three scientists, Drs. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves catching ghosts. They soon get more than they bargained for when a demi-god tries to move in and destroy the world.<br/><br/>Murray. Akroyd. Ramis. Two are SNL alumni and all are regarded as some of the great comic geniuses of our time. Murray has been leaning more towards drama these days (and Wes Anderson's piles of crap), Akroyd's career has come to a bit of a stand still and generally relegated to cameos, and Ramis has taken to directing films. All three are gifted comedians, and this is a representation of their best work. Murray is terrific as the sarcastic and egotistic jerk, Akroyd is hilarious as the energetic nerd, and Ramis is just as good as the anti-social nerd. Also in the cast are Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, the skeptical musician who becomes their first client, and the target of Venkman's charms, Rick Moranis, Dana's nerdy neighbor who is so nerdy that he puts Stantz and Spengler to shame, and Ernie Hudson is great as the new recruit. And of course William Atherton is on hand to be the nosy asshole (which he does with great ability).<br/><br/>Ivan Reitman was the go-to guy of comedies throughout the 80's and mid-90s. His style is professional, but solid, and he knows how to make a movie funny. ""Ghostbusters"" is easily his best film. It's funny, but also spooky. There are a few chilling moments in the film, particularly towards the end.<br/><br/>There isn't anyone alive who won't have a great time watching ""Ghostbusters."""

","The 1980s was a decade known for its variety of unique entertainment, especially in film. As a child, I was raised on these movies, but none stand out more than that of Ghostbusters (1984). While not the most sophisticated piece of cinema to come out of that decade, it still stands as one of the most iconic. From the jumpsuits to the sigma, Ghostbusters made a permanent mark on popular entertainment. What makes the movie a classic comedy are not the iconic costumes and props, but the interactions between the Ghostbusters themselves.<br/><br/>Each character has their own mold, which they fit into. Starting off, Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) portrays a typical scientist; dry, humorless and an avid collector of spores, molds and fungus. Although also highly intelligent, Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd) plays the dimwit of the group with a major lack in common sense or just sense in general. This is blatantly apparent during the scene which he purchases a junker car that needs a plethora of tune-ups and replacements, but only cost them $4800. Peter Venkmen, played by Bill Murray, is a sarcastic quick-wit who plays off both Egon's seriousness and Ray's stupidity. Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) completes the Ghostbuster team by being the new guy with zero experience in paranormal investigation, yet still manages to fit in due to the remainder of the team's lack of professionalism.<br/><br/>Despite their unprofessional methods, the Ghostbusters still make good business and Venkmen is even able to get a date with customer Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). Things go awry though when Barrett is possessed by the evil demons haunting her apartment and from here, the movie takes off into a hilarious yet apocalyptic direction. This in itself is another reason why Ghostbusters is such a good comedy.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, when I hear terms such as ""Armageddon"" or ""Judgment Day,"" hilarity usually does not ensue. However, these elements are very prevalent yet the movie still garners countless laughs. This occurs for two reasons. The first being the brilliant script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd who, as mentioned before, star in the film. The second can be accredited to Bill Murray's trademark smug, sarcastic persona. One moment which comes to mind when Murray portrays this ideally is when he shares quips with the demon possessed Barrett. Murray's acting and mannerisms supply the comedic lifeblood to the script like no other actor could.<br/><br/>As stated above, Ghostbusters is not the most serious of films, but during some parts it can be a little too corny. This is most apparent during the scene where the frightening demons are finally seen on screen in clay animation, also known as ""claymation"". I realize the film came out before movies featured giant spectacular effects; however I think by 1984 other options existed. Another minor gripe I have with the film is the acting done by Weaver during her demon possessed state. I really do not know how someone is supposed to act in such a state, but the entire scene where Dana, while being demon possessed, was talking to Ray felt a bit awkward. Her heavy panting came off as more of a person suffering from an asthma attack than a hellacious demon. However, do not let these two minor complaints stop you from enjoying this classic comedy.<br/><br/>Looking at the film with a realistic point of view, Ghostbusters is a movie about four men trying to prevent Judgment Day from occurring due to two people's demonic possessions. In actuality, the movie is based around four guys who enjoy their job and make light of even the grimmest of situations. For those who disagree with this; I have only one statement: ""Stay Puft Marshmallow Man."""

","Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon (Harold Ramis) are college drop-outs who invest in a special and unusual kind of business which is paranormalist exterminators called ""Ghostbusters"". Where they use proton-blasters and traps to catch ghosts, they find success of capturing spirits and demons alike including hiring a new recruit named Winston (Ernie Hudson). A lovely musician named Dana (Sigourney Weaver) lives in a apartment building that had a history of demonic rituals and is haunted, now an evil spirit unleashes ghouls and ghosts into the city for now the Ghostbusters must save humanity.<br/><br/>Co-starring Rick Moranis and William Atheron, this motion picture is a brilliant mix of horror, fantasy and comedy all spiced up in one true crowd-pleaser of a movie. It has became one of the most successful, beloved and greatest movies ever made! it still holds up to this today and appeals to all ages. Director Ivan Reitman with producers and stars Ackroyd and Ramis has created one of the most original and funniest movies around! it has an H.P. Lovecraft-esquire feel to it and the film is loaded with great special effects that hold up to this day. The acting is also terrific as well including some of the funny moments, i loved this since i was 3 in 1985 when my mom got me the movie on video and i became a fan since. I ate the cereal, watched the cartoon, had the toys and even saw the sequel in theaters in 1989.<br/><br/>This movie gave us an unforgettable song which happens to be the title song by Ray Parker Jr. that is still popular even among Halloween parties. It's one of the most incredible and most memorable movies of all time that should be seen to believed."

","Les hommes, this is one of the best films you will ever see. I once talked to some Swedish girls who said they hated it, but they must've been eating too much lutefisk. This is a pinnacle in movie-making.<br/><br/>For one thing, it has the absolute best ever pacing of almost anything I've ever seen ever in my whole life. There is not a slow moment. The whole dang movie feels like 30 seconds in length. I swear, it's freakin' sorcery! If you see someone watching it, I guarantee that you will blink and realize you've been there for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I first saw this when it premiered on network television in the US (I was like 2 or 3) and then went on to become an official member of the Ghostbusters cult. Today as a grown, ""mature"", individual, I own all 140 episodes of the cartoon series on DVD and I don't even have a DVD player! <br/><br/>Amazing casting, amazing writing, amazing music, amazing amazing amazing.

"moviebuff94","10","1","2","2 November 2007"," Ghostbusters, is it worth your time?
","Ghostbusters has shaped a substantial amount of our media culture today, then again so has many movies you wouldn't want too see, the question is: Ghostbusters is it worth your time?<br/><br/>The answer to that question in my opinion is YES! This movie was well made considering all the incorporated genres such as: adventure, comedy, horror, action ,and sci-fi. This movie has a fairly quick tempo, as well as abundant laughs, and action/peril. This movie will entertain for ages to come, I don't know a person who doesn't know the theme song! When I first saw this movie I was infatuated, but I only saw 30 mins of it on TV. Recently I bought the special edition movie on DVD and the spark was reignited! I would recommend this for all viewers who can sit thought an eighties movie. In my opinion this movie is right up there with Back to the Future, Gremlins, and many other comedy/adventure classics! Good story, special effects, humor, acting, Ghostbusters in an overall great movie!"
"charchuk","9","1","2","23 April 2007"," Sort of a guilty pleasure
","One of my childhood favourites. It doesn't hold up that well, but it still makes me laugh and the song is iconic. Bill Murray is as funny as he's ever been; I wonder if the rumour about him improvising most of his lines is true, because his one-liners are the highlight of this film. A terrific supporting comedy cast surrounds him, but this is really Murray's film. The FX look kinda cheezy today, but they were superb way back when. The ending is, again, cheezy, but the giant marshmallow man is pure genius. Gotta love that car, too (Ghostmobile?). It's dated, even if it's only twenty years old, but it's a classic '80s comedy and sort of a guilty pleasure for me."
"DickyFox","10","1","2","9 June 2006"," the greatest movie ever made
","Ghostbusters is hands down the greatest movie ever made. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular. There is just so much to say about it. For one, the entire cast is set in the roles they were born to play. Honestly. Bill Murray is at his comedic best. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as a bright, independent woman and is given the added fun of being possessed for a good portion of the movie. Rick Moranis was destined to play the Uber-nerd Louis, Dan Aykroyd perfectly cast himself as a lovable, semi-naive back-up comedic effect guy to Bill Murray, and so on and so forth (I only get 1000 words). Aside from this is the fact that there is truly something magical about the whole premise. A group of guys, not super men, but just some guys, get together and decide to combat the supernatural problems of the world (well, New York). There has always been a certain aspect of this that made me feel better; the realm of moviedom, after having countless horror movie fiends and people running from said fiends, now had heroes to fight back. Everyone knows you can't do anything to fight a ghost. Until the Ghostbusters came along. What is especially fun is that with this certainly ridiculous sounding plot, the movie is executed in a completely mundane manner. If someone heard the story idea, they may think of some awful action movie or an Airplane-type absurd comedy. Instead, the whole film is done in a ho-hum type manner, with normal (enough) believable people having to save the world from certain doom. Yikes. Then, of course, we get into the fact that it really is just about the funniest comedy ever. You really can't completely appreciate everything if you watch it with someone who laughs too loud, like a drama kid or a line-reapter guy (hopefully you know the people I reference). You would just miss too much. It isn't a movie that necessarily will have a person rolling on the floor laughing at everything, but there are countless moments where, if you have the kind of sense of humor the world needs more of (and I don't mean that in some political sense or anything so don't read into me that deep), you would chuckle and think to yourself ""that's funny."" But again, you don't have too much time to think that, because something else funny is about to happen. Subtly. I once read someone's review on this very website that said that Ghostbusters was one of those movies that you think is good the first time you see it because you're in a theater and it all seems really big and whatnot, but isn't really that great when you go back and watch it again. This person must walk backwards or something, because that's completely opposite from the truth. And yes, I say ""the truth"" rather than ""my opinion"" because I looked it up and it is the truth."
"worthythorn24","8","1","2","13 October 2005"," Timeless classic!
","Oh boy! What can I say about Ghostbusters that hasn't already been written? This is one of the most successful films of all time and also spawned a very successful sequel, cartoon series, and catapulted Bill Murray into super stardom. Let's not forget the catchy theme song as well. We all know what the plot is about, with the Ghostbusters (Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston) trying to prevent the end of the world. The movie is filled with excellent performances by the cast and, for its time, outstanding visual effects. As a matter of fact, this is one of the most impressive casts ever, featuring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and William Atherton (and a cool cameo from Reginald VelJohnson from TV's Family Matters playing a cop, of course).<br/><br/>I recently bought the box set of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 on DVD and there is some very interesting information within. Originally, the Ghostbusters movie was going to star John Belushi as Peter and he and Ray were going to be ""intergalactic ghost busters"" traveling through space and catching ghosts. Although this is an interesting premise, I don't think it would have delivered quite the way the final version did. Maybe that would work if they made a third film in the series?<br/><br/>I'm giving Ghostbusters an 8/10. It was very innovative back in 1984 and features some great special effects, most of which still hold up today in the age of CGI. Definitely worth owning on DVD!"
"croatiansensation29","8","1","2","22 January 2005"," A classic film not to be missed!
","""Ghostbusters"" was a huge hit when it was released back in 1984 (geez, has it been that long already) which started a phenomenon. I still remember the song being played constantly on radio stations, while the video was a huge hit on the video stations. To this day, it still holds up with current movies being released.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stanz (Dan Akroyd) and Dr. Spengler (Harold Ramis), who start up a ""ghost busting"" business when they are dismissed from their positions from the University in New York. Little do they know, that their business is going to explode, as an ancient god Gozer, prepares to enter the world to bring upon the end of the world.<br/><br/>With great special effects, great comedy bits (mostly provided by Bill Murray), and a fantastic cast and story, ""Ghostbusters"" is a film for comedy and action buffs. Although the special effects do look kind of dated today (especially in the scene where the demon dog is chasing Louis through Central Park), they are still incredible and bring the characters to life. This was before computer technology became a huge part of cinema.<br/><br/>If you have never seen this film, go out and take a look, I guarantee that you will love it. For those others that have already seen it years ago, take another look, it is still a classic that stands up today."
"GBusters86","10","1","2","5 June 2003"," Best.Movie.Ever!
","Whats there to say about Ghostbusters; well for one, it's the greatest movie ever.  Every aspect of the movie is just amazing.  The performances of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are top notch.  Not to mention, Rick Moranis's role of Louis Tully is probably one of the best supporting roles ive seen in a movie.  Aside from the acting, the special effects were ahead of their time, its amazing how they came up with all of that without the use of computers.  Also, after seeing the movie tons of times, ive realized how many quotable lines there are.  So in conclussion, the movie is hilarious, the acting is great, the special effects are awsome, and there are enough witty comments you can quote to last you till the third movie comes out.(We can only hope)"
"DramaDude","8","1","2","11 September 2002"," For its time...this movie is WAY ahead!
","Ivan Reitman...who hasn't made a movie to date that has come close to topping this movie...does a masterful job in special effects (i mean come on, people...1984!!) as well as picking up a hilarious cast to make this movie quite enjoyable for anyone of any age.  The only movies around this time that could hold a candle to the effects of Ghostbusters would be Star Wars (Lucas) and the Indiana Jones trilogy (Spielberg).  As for the sequal...not quite as good as the original...but admirable in itself."
"rlcsljo","7","1","2","2 April 2001"," Does not hold up well over time (a second viewing)
","When this movie came out, ""Saturday Night Live"" was arguably at its peak, Star Wars mania was at its crest, and special effects wizards almost took their place with directors as the most important talent in making a movie. <br/><br/>
This film had it all--two SNL stars wise cracking their way through a science fiction/ horror film with some original special effects.  However, like eating rock candy, the second piece does not satisfy after you realize there is no substance to what is there--only a sugar rush.<br/><br/>Amazingly, when ""panned and scanned"" for Television/video the TV actors do not even hold their own.<br/><br/>This movie might hold up better when HDTV comes along (yeah, right)!"
"summers-53291","5","2","7","28 October 2015"," Great film!
","Where some films tend to only work a few times, Ghostbusters is consistent. Although, I've found movies such as CLUE, Dr. Strangelove or Airplane to be funnier at different times in my life, this one still makes me laugh even after seeing it hundreds of times. From the opening scares to the ending credits, it will almost surely reel you in. I've laughed harder at some moments in other films but it's rare that I find one that's funnier throughout. Even those films lose their edge after you see them a few times...this one just doesn't. If you haven't seen it, do so. You will almost certainly be glad you did. If you have seen it and didn't like it, try watching it again in a few years. It's almost sure to grow on you eventually. I dare anyone to sit through this movie and not laugh once, no matter how many times they've seen it. If you don't laugh, you're either trying really hard to hold back, have a very odd sense of humor or are dead! It's just that funny. Although I don't rate films, I would easily rate this one a five out of five, placed among the classics. Believe it or not, I think that it belongs alongside Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia. It also spawned an entertaining sequel in 1989. Enjoy!"
"The Fuzz","Null","2","8","16 July 1999"," The Difference an Audience Can Make...
","I saw this film on its first weekend in the UK, in Dec 1984.  Of course, it had already been a huge hit in the US, and the waves of enthusiasm had been lapping at our shore for months;  then there was that splendid theme tune which had been sat in the Top Twenty throughout late summer and the autumn, so by the time the pic finally arrived there was a tremendous amount of expectation.<br/><br/>That Saturday night there were hundreds of filmgoers in the centre of Cardiff, but all to see the one film (I can still remember the deafening silence that greeted the cinema manager's enquiry, shouted down the length of that great queue, ""Is there ANYONE for 'Bachelor Party'?"").  Lord knows how many were turned away, but those that made it in cheered as one when the lights dimmed.  Moments later, we were cheering again, whooping our appreciation of the library ghost's horrifying transformation, and then we were singing - well, shouting really -  along to the theme song, and this mood of festive celebration (it was Christmas, after all) was maintained throughout the next two hours, and it was one in which I joined as enthusiastically as anybody, despite a bladder which had been demanding urgent attention since even before the trailers had finished (and despite the slight disappointment of that giant doughman, which meant nothing to us in the UK), and long before the film's conclusion, I realised that I hadn't had so much fun on a cinema visit before, and nor have I had since.<br/><br/>And when it had ended, and we had filed back out into the winter night (some of us via the gents), with each of our group almost taking turns to ask the rest if they had enjoyed the movie as much as he had, we began the ritual of recalling favorite moments from the film. But something odd happened. ""Remember that bit when...when..."" When what? Hmm. Try again.  ""How about when he said...when he said...""  Said what?  Did what? Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Long before we'd reached home, we'd realised that the only highlights the film had were moments of spectacle, that there hadn't been any really good jokes, or plot twists, or weird little moments of invention; less than 30 minutes after leaving the cinema on that high, we'd realised that the movie had been thoroughly mediocre.<br/><br/>A paradox, surely: how could we have enjoyed it so if it was a poor film? Simple: the audience made it fun; we'd acted like our own warm-up act.  We were there to enjoy ourselves and enjoy ourselves we did, all the film did was provide us with a few cues so we could keep the vibe up.  I said it is the most fun I've ever had at the cinema, and so it is: it's the same sort of fun I've had on a fairground ride when there's a load of people all screaming in mock terror - wouldn't be as good if you were alone, and so it is with 'Ghostbusters'; I've seen it since on TV, and it passes the time if you've absolutely nothing else to do, otherwise...<br/><br/>Oh, and I saw the sequel in a cinema, but one that was nine-tenths empty. It didn't stand a chance."
"shanitajohn","2","2","9","10 October 2019"," Grossly overrated
","I have no idea why this movie is a cult classic. Nostalgia? Bill Murray's character is disturbing and unsympathetic, nothing made me laugh, and the plot felt like it lost its way, despite not being all that complex. I don't know, I missed the memo on this one."
"TCurtis9192","1","1","3","22 March 2020"," GHOSTBUSTERS
","For a long time now cinema has been haunted by legions of ""GHOSTBUSTERS"" (1984, Reitman) fans, most of which lambast the sequel and do nothing but spit at the mere mention of the reboot. They love their tiresome, irritating, incoherent ""GHOSTBUSTERS"" devoutly andunconditionally, and I think that's sad.<br/><br/>For starters this is a boring film. The effects are wonderful but this film offers nothing else.<br/><br/>Bill Murray ruins this film with his sleazy, rapey schtick and his one-liners and slouching posture make him sound and look like a half-witted doper... At no point in this film does Murray seem to care about the film and he sucks.<br/><br/>The plot is driven by the following: private enterprise- good; slave-driven employees- should be grateful; public sector workers- idiots and snides; ghosts- need to be locked up; being abusive, pushy, creepy and loud- very attractive... And so on. These things are not funny and to think they are is juvenile.<br/><br/>Are you scared of not being cool? Is that why you ""love"" this film? A lot of this film comes off as propaganda for right-wing bigotry. Is that cool? It isn't cool. Those guys have been laughing all the way to the bank thanks to sheep thinking they're cool and it disgusts me. It's not about ghosts being busted! It's an attack on the ""left"", an insult to both genders, a promotion of destruction over productivity and a celebration of laziness and luck.<br/><br/>
Basically the only way a new GHOSTBUSTERS film would have any chance at winning the fans over is if it were made by ladbible because this film may as well have been put together by drunken fratboys. Still if they won't move on they deserve to fossilize with this dinosaur.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is rubbish, script is awful, don't bother just for the effects because there aren't enough of them."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","3","3 July 2011"," Classic Comedy That Gets Better With Time
","Ghostbusters (1984) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Classic comedy about three parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis) who set up a business where they trap ghosts. Soon New York City is overrun with various ghouls and goblins as Judgement Day might be coming and it's up to the group to try and stop it. GHOSTBUSTERS was made as a summer blockbuster but it went way beyond your typical blockbuster style and ended up becoming one of the greatest comedies ever made. It could be argued that the cast and director were never better in their careers and that all of them were at the top of their game while making this picture. I think a great deal of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which mixes in the special effects with some very sly dialogue that really makes you believe everything you're seeing. The paranormal aspects of the story are so well done that you can easily accept what's going on and this here takes care of the adventure side of the story. The screenplay really goes all out when it comes to the comedy as we get one non-stop laugh after another because the dialogue always has our characters winking at the viewer and especially the character played by Murray. While all of the performances are great it's clearly Murray's show as he works wonders with the womanizer who has a smart reply to anything going on. Seeing Murray work the dialogue the way he does and the way he brings humor to his part is something truly remarkable to watch because he makes it seem so easy. Both Aykroyd and Ramis are also at the top of their game and the trio really do work extremely well together and in the end they could be called one of the most memorable comedies teams in the history of cinema. Even the smaller roles are played to perfection with Sigourney Weaver as one of the clients, Rick Moranis as her nerdy neighbor, Annie Potts as the wise-cracking receptionist and Ernie Hudson as the fourth worker. THe special effects hold up extremely well today even when you compare them to the recent CGI trend. Just take a look at Slimer to see how perfect the visual effects are but it's also important that these creatures are so memorable as they also add an additional bit of life to the film. Slimer is in the movie just a matter of minutes and yet he too became rather legendary in his own right. GHOSTBUSTERS is about as flawless as a comedy can get as we get pretty much everything you'd want in a picture like this. There have been many films to come along since but none of them have contained the amount of magic, charm and just all out fun as what you get."
"may_ustb","6","1","3","13 February 2011"," reminiscent of the 1980s
","It was from today's newspaper that I first heard of Ghostbusters, where it was defined as a classic.<br/><br/>Luckily enough, our lib gets one copy with Available status, so I took the chance to give it a watch. From its cover I saw it was made in 1984, and features two big stars of that time: Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>To say what impressed me most, I would definitely name the erotic performance of Sigourney in this film, as my mindset always associated her with her roles in the Aliens series, where she starred as an iron-fist captain Ellen Ripley and fought with those violent unpredictable dangerous creatures on-and-off and was deemed as a a symbol of feminism rising in a new age.<br/><br/>Back to Ghostbusters, I should say there's classic flavor in it, say the hippie music, the exaggerated comic scenes, and of course, the cars and clothes people were wearing at that time. Even all the faces inside gave audience a feeling of nostalgia and classic. I liked the opening scene featuring a screaming librarian and completely went nut when the three heroes went down from their fastfood fete to an emergency calling through a golden pool.<br/><br/>This is not a thriller, but a downright comedy, with three psycho doctors and one black-skin Jesus believer running here and there in the NYC to exterminate all kinds of ghosts released from a refrigerator at the kitchen of Dana, the heroine. When it is time to meet the boss and the team was asked to choose in which form Gozer, the commander of all ghosts, shall destroy the city, one of the ghostbusters, Ray, thought of Mr. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I cannot help laughing and meanwhile adore the director's imagination and creativity.<br/><br/>Even though there's barely substance Ghostbusters, I will give credit to the time it was made. It is highly likely that it is the movie that inspired so many ghost-themed science fictions afterwords. Yet, I wouldn't watch it again unless I am reminiscent of films in the 1980s."
"MovieAddict2016","9","1","3","5 September 2002"," Very original comedy
","Ghostbusters when released in 1984 was a smash hit with audiences around the world, and to this day we all still chant that ever famous theme song.<br/><br/>  The plot is set in New York City, where supernatural beings have been appearing to people, so a few down on their luck pedestrians make a run for the money by making a fake ghostbusting company-the Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>   Bill Murray, Dan Akyroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver all make the perfect comedy team. Bill Murray uses his classic SNL wise-cracking style, Dan Akyroyd plays a character who is a bit shy and nothing like Bill. He abides by the rules society sets and never speaks his real thoughts on subjects. Rick Moranis is the perfect next door nerd type, always hitting on Sigourney Weaver, who pushes him aside softly.<br/><br/>
 The directing style of Harold Ramis helps this film too, with some great shots of the city, and excellent cinematography. There is one hilarious scene at the end where Akyroyd thinks up a worst nightmare and it comes true, unleashing the Stay Puffed man upon New York City. What may now be considered bad graphics, back in 1984 the effects they used on the Stay Puffed marshmallow man were state of the art and mesmerizing. It is a very funny scene, and seeing a diabolical Stay Puffed man unleashed upon New York is worth the price of the film alone.<br/><br/>  The screenplay is very interesting, and very original. Harold Ramis always finds very original films to direct, and he hit a home run with Ghostbusters.<br/><br/> If you have never seen Ghostbusters, go rent it. If you have, see it again. It's an excellent family film that now may be forgotten largely by most people, but for the people who remember it, the film will never die, and we will keep on chanting that famous theme song.<br/><br/>4/5 stars-<br/><br/>JOHN ULMER"

","In 1984 Ivan Reitman directed the movie ""Ghostbusters"". This movie has been a cornerstone for anyone who recalls the eighties. With a very good cast and even a catchy jingle. The movie is enjoyable for the entire family. ""Ghostbusters"" starts in the New York City Library with a librarian working in the basement. She is confronted by catalog cards flying around and then a bright ghostly apparition. Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), and Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) are paranormal professors at a university that get called in by the library. Egon questions the librarian about what happened to her and the men move to the basement. Books are stacked up in the halls, slime is on the card catalog drawers, and shelves are falling over. Finally they come across the ghost reading a book. The ghost in turn scares the men and they run out. The university decides to discontinue their grant and fire all three of them. With the help of Egon's technology of actually catching a ghost, and with a little help from Ray's mortgage, Ghostbusters is created.<br/><br/>Just as Ghostbusters fame is rising, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men for help. Her apartment refrigerator is occupied by two beasts that yell out Zuul. Peter investigates Dana's apartment. After some looking he finds nothing. He does get a date with her thanks to his smooth talking. The day of the date the beasts in Dana's refrigerator come and possess her as the Gate Keeper. Luis Tully (Rick Moranis) her next door neighbor is possessed by the other beast the Key Master.<br/><br/>The Key Master comes into the hands of the Ghostbusters just as the EPA tries to shut them down. A disaster happens and releases the ghosts all over New York. With the Ghostbusters in jail, the Key Master finds the Gate Keeper and awakes Gozer. The city is in turmoil and the mayor decides to let the men go. Upon arrival at Dana's apartment, it is apparent that Gozer has come. They make it to the roof where a battle of proton packs and spirits leaves the Ghostbusters in a stale mate.<br/><br/>Gozer sends a destructor to destroy the men. This is a huge marshmallow man. Egon decides to break the rules and cross the streams in order to get rid of Gozer and the marshmallow man. As they say their goodbyes, each man starts the stream. The roof is completely destroyed but the men survive. They saved the world and rescued Dana from the beasts.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorites and I can watch it again and again. The movie is part of the criterion collection which chooses important and contemporary movies that have changed film. This year with the 25th anniversary, Harold Ramis announced that a third Ghostbusters is in the making. Ghostbusters is one of the comedies that stand out in the eighties. It's fun for everyone in the family."

","""Ghostbusters"" is a 100-minute movie from over 30 years ago and considered a classic by many today. I am not sure if I would go that far, but it was certainly a good watch for the most part. The director is Oscar nominee Ivan Reitman, whose son Jason has followed in his footsteps by now, and the film we got here is certainly the older Reitman's most famous work, especially as the man in charge. The script comes from Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who also play 2 of the major characters. However, those were one of the weaknesses of the film. Maybe it was because Murray was so great, had the best material and stole every scene he was in, but Aykroyd and Ramis looked truly pale compared to him and this film may have been even better with other actors in these roles.<br/><br/>Still, I think they did a good job on the writing. Ghost movies are fairly common, but in terms of people in charge of hunting these ghosts, there really isn't that much to pick from and this is certainly the ultimate movie. Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis do a lot with the little they are given, but the standout is clearly Murray in his big breakthrough performance (his introduction with the questioning scene involving the guy and girl was already pure gold) and he has been delivering constantly great material in the last 3 decades, especially in terms of comedy, frequently with a dramatic note to it. However, even with the premise of the world about to end, ""Ghostbusters"" is 99% comedy. Nobody dies, the possessed characters turn back to normal, the shooting sequences involve cool futuristic gadgets and the monsters are at least as creative as scary. And of course, there is funny one-liners from start to finish, also a couple unfunny ones, but not too many. The ending is solid, but not the film's biggest strength. I wonder if we will ever get another ""Ghost Busters"" film. With Ramis' death it may not look too likely, but who knows. Until then, I recommend watching this old film here. Thumbs up, especially for the first hour."

"jboothmillard","8","1","5","17 June 2005"," Ghost Busters
","This is a very admirable comedy for all the family from director Ivan Reitman (Twins, Evolution), and written by stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. Basically misfit parapsychology professors Dr. Peter Venkman (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are booted out of New York City's Columbia University, and even lacking funding start a supernatural entity investigation and removal company called ""Ghostbusters"". It is when their first ghost is successfully captured that the company is truly taken seriously by the people of New York as more ghosts are popping up everywhere, and they also recruit new member Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson). Their biggest ghost though comes from the apartment building of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her neighbour Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) when they are both possessed by creatures that could potentially cause some kind of apocalypse. The Ghostbusters are seen as the only hope for the city, after having their ghost vault emptied, and getting released from jail, and the bizarre finale sees them going against a giant marshmallow man. Also starring Toy Story's Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, William Atherton as Walter Peck, David Margulies as Mayor, Jordan Charney as Dean Yager, Michael Ensign as Hotel Manager, Slavitza Jovan as Gozer and Awakening's Alice Drummond as Librarian. With great moments of slapstick, some witty dialogue, a good cast, and chock-a-block with supernatural special effects, this film was so successful it spawned cartoon TV series and a not as good sequel followed four years later, fantastic fun. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and Best Song for Ray Parker Jr.'s ""Ghostbusters"" (it won the BAFTA and was nominated the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"

"groovyuniverse","5","0","1","7 April 2020"," Nostalgia is a helluva drug
","Ghostbusters was one of my favourite movies as a kid in the early nineties. It had jokes, scares, great special effects, four nerdy cool guys shooting lasers, a scantily clad babe...what else can a young boy wish for?<br/><br/>Fast forward to twenty-five years later, with me viewing the movie for a second time. An uncomfortable truth wriggles it's way in my head as I watch: that some nostalgia doesn't stand the test of time. I notice my stubbornness to critique the movie but contemporary reality quickly illuminates how dated the movie is. Sure, it's still a big budget spectacle and some of the effects are still cool, but effects being dated can be forgiven. What ruined the overall experience is mainly how sexist and adult the movie is. I wonder how Bill Murray, obtrusively sleazebagging his way thoughout the movie, nowadays would reflect on his role here. What I used to look up to as child disturbs me now. The movie sets the sexist tone early, particularly with a bad joke that correlates menstruation with mental derangement. I watched with dumbfounded amazement. It might be pure speculation but I also got the impression that lots of cocaine where being used while making this movie. There's an exubarant vacancy to it all. A celebration of American culture that is loud, and too often cynical and hollow.<br/><br/>While watching I started to view the movie as a cultural time capsule that through it's charicatures exposes some of the more appalling aspects of American culture in the early eighties. Women are mainly being played as puppets and black people are at best 4th option sidekicks and are most often seen as background figures doing low level jobs. Maybe as a kid this black sidekick showed me that black people can actually contribute to saving the world. Or hang with the cool white guys. So, in defense of nostalgia, maybe there is a spin to thiis. Do I devaluate the movie too much using my contemporary lens? My younger mind was better suited to appreciate it as pure entertainment. My older self is better suited to view it as a ideological object of study. If I balance these two out I would rate it a 5, with my younger self giving it a 9, and my older self giving it a 2. The ghosts of this movie have been busted."

","I mean, it's alright. The original trio have a good amount of chemistry together (Ramis the nerd, Murray the deadpan cool guy, Aykroyd the straight man) but on his own Murray's schtick gets misogynist and tiresome real quick. Plot-wise, their rise to success feels too sudden and honestly, it's way more enjoyable early on when they're down-on-their-luck underdogs. The wild apocalyptic elements contrast nicely with the crew's dry, down-to-earth vibes but highlight some terrible visual effects.

All of the supporting cast is good as well making the most of what they are working with.
Visual Humour is the well done here with the final big bad being awsome.<br/><br/>So what's not so good?<br/><br/>The humour is hit and miss although it does hit more often than miss there where long pauses where you wait for the funny and well, it just isnt. After Stripes I'm afraid Ghostbusters was a little too bland & safe with many of its jokes in the theatre being predictable and just not working (no one laughed).<br/><br/>I mentioned the visual comedy was well done but was all wasted as all of it was revealed by the films trailer, so no where as impactfull as it could have been. Sadly Hollywood just doesnt know how to cut a trailer anymore.<br/><br/>A horror comedy should be scary as well, the opening scene in the library delivered but thats it, the rest even for the 1980's was a bit of a yawn. The effects where well passable for 1984 but now? oh dear!<br/><br/>Finally just as something began happening the film kind of ended as there isnt that much of a story.<br/><br/>Despite all the issues I enjoyed it more than I was bored but maybe it was all the hype at the time that spoiled it all (and the trailer showing too much as usual)<br/><br/>This is a good film but thats all."

"thejcowboy22","5","0","3","11 July 2019"," The Ghostbusters appeared on the couch of The Joe Franklin Show , WOW, they made the big time!
","During the 80's I owned and operated an Ice Cream store in Queens, New York. The hours were long and I would usually arrive home around midnight where I would watch TV to all hours of the morning. I found myself watching the same shows almost every evening for decades. One show I watched religiously was the Joe Franklin Show on WOR TV. Joe was shown locally in the New York City market. Moreover Joe Franklin was the longest running late night talk show in American history, some 47 years. Joe was coined the ""King Of Nostalgia"" or ""The Wizard Of Was"". Joe would flash old movie posters and have forgotten film stars pop in from time to time reminiscing about the old days. Joe had a wide range of guests from world renown artists Salvadore Dali and the Beatles John Lennon. From local celebrities to the famous names in Hollywood, i.e. Sinatra and Bing Crosby. President John Kennedy sat on the famed couch back in the early 60's. Enough about Joe and on to Ghostbusters, I first learned about this phenomenon by also listening to the nationally broadcast all night Larry King show out of Washington, D.C. along the Mutual Radio Network. Between Franklin and King I had a thing for nocturnal media. Larry King also personally promoted this ghostly, comedy, action film mainly because he had a cameo in the film. The publicity department At Sony/Columbia Pictures did a phenomenal job promoting this film especially with children. The popular Ray Parker theme song with the famous catch phrase ""Who you gonna call?"" hit the air waves of the radio medium. Ghostbusters is unique in the fact that special effects and comedy are a slippery slope to combine . Special effect require precise timing. As for comedy it's usually spontaneous. In this film the two styles meld well together. I noticed the fine tuned editing in the Capra style making the movie less choppy. Having a nice flow.. Our story begins with three Columbia professors Bill Murray as Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Ray Stantz, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egon Spengler who delve into the paranormal with experiments of a different nature. Venkman asking his female subject is she menstruating? Well the time has come as our scientist's government funding runs out and they are banished from the University. Out on the street pounding the pavement realizing that there is negative energy in the way of Ghosts and the unexplained, People complain about haunting s from their premises. The three realize there is a need for ghost busting. People will pay at any cost to eradicate these paranormal beings from their property or the ghosts in and around New York. The Three go into business and call themselves the Ghostbusters. The three purchase an old firehouse and hire a receptionist (Annie Potts). Annie does a fair job with her New York accent. The three promote their business on TV and are summoned to a Hotel ballroom . They travel in a makeshift ambulance and enter the lobby in jumpsuit uniforms with back packs and laser guns ready to take down a green goblin. They catch the creature and suck him into a box and store him away in there nuclear chamber at the firehouse. The E.P.A. finds out about it and tries to shut them down. Meanwhile on another front; Venkman has eyes for musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who live in a detailed elaborate 20 story apartment with gargoyles on the roof located on Central Park West. Dana calls Venkman to inspect her re-fridge as she claims it haunted watching eggs fry in the case. Dana would eventually be possessed by a ghost. Nerdy and meek Neighbor accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) is throwing party as a tax write-off. One of the stone structures comes to life and ends up chasing Tully out of the apartment and into Tavern On the Green. Evidently there apartment building is a conduit to the next world. Tully eventually becomes possessed as the Ghostbusters are log jammed by the avaricious E.P.A. investigator William Peck (Walter Atherton) who earlier lets out all the Ectoplasm and Ghosts.at their firehouse headquarter having no regard for their service, calling it a hoax. The ghosts and goblins terrorize New York including a hot dog stand. The mayor of New York concedes giving the Ghostbusters permission to resume and restore order in this Ghost ridden city. The screenplay is chock full of funny lines provided by the genius of Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd. Bill Murray has his share of punchlines, (mostly ad-libs) to round out the dialogue. Honorable mention for our fourth member of the Ghostbusters, Winston played by Ernie Hudson who tells the mayor, ""I've only been with this company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I've joined these men, I've seen s--t that will turn you white!"" In my opinion I wouldn't consider this movie scary at all.. Bring your kiddies along for the ride. If your all alone pick up the phone or stay up and watch re-runs of the Joe Franklin Show at the conclusion of this movie."

Bill Murray was funny, but often mean-spirited in his humor (typical of the SNL alumni in the 1980's, but cheap and I don't like it). As for the rest, I find it all very silly. Rick Moranis, DanAkroyd, silly, silly. Ernie Hudson gave what was probably the best acting performance in this film (as the 6th lead... this guy was lucky to find a sandwich left for him at Craft Services). Anyway, this review proves that I am (at least attempting to be) unbiased in my critique of these films on IMDB. I really don't like this movie. I liked it as a child, and I resent it now as an adult. But, I can't argue that it was a big hit, that I DID like it (once upon a time), and that it contains some iconic moments in film.<br/><br/>So, I feel my 6 rating is more than fair.

","Does anyone else find it strange that Dr. Peter Venkman, while on his first date with Dana, just happened to have on his person 300cc's of Thorazine? Dr. Venkman first arrives at Dana Barrett's apartment to find she has been imbued with the spirit of Gozer and now is calling herself the ""Gate Keeper"" and is awaiting the arrival of the ""Key Master"". There is a scene that shows her animal tendencies (floating above the bed, panting rapidly, deep and growling voice). Then the scene cuts away and returns to a phone call between Peter and Egon. Peter Venkman states that he injects her with the dosage during a phone call with Egon.<br/><br/>So we have to assume, since Dr. Peter Venkman did not show up with a briefcase, medical bag, or any other piece of science kit or gear, that he showed up to Dana Barrett's apartment with a syringe filled with 300cc's of Thorazine in the breast pocket of his blazer.<br/><br/>I could see a surgeon walking around with a set of scalpels or clamps in case he or she is called upon to perform an emergency appendectomy on the street or other minor surgeries in life or death situations, but Dr. Peter Venkman is a psychologist/parapsychologist. Walking around with a set of syringes filled with sedatives is just plain creepy."
"Kevin-94","Null","0","3","18 November 2007"," Not so crazy about it
","To be honest, I wasn't crazy about this movie. Bill Murray's character comes off like a liar and a manipulator with little interest in science or anything else except scoring with Sigourney Weaver. The film seems to want to position him as the underdog, but in scenes in which others criticize him, I found myself nodding my head and thinking ""You're right, he is a loser."" Murray's annoying qualities could be forgiven if he was a sympathetic character who grows into a better person, like Dustin Hoffmans' character in the far superior ""Tootsie"" (A film that Ghostbusters eclipsed as the highest grossing comedy.) But he remains a jerk throughout. The kiss he shares with Sigourney at the end seems like a tacked on happy ending that is entirely unearned. Murray seems disinterested in what is happening in the film, cracking lame jokes but hardly ever involved in the action in any meaningful way. He's the least capable ghostbuster, and the others have to explain things to him. I know this was popular but I'll never understand why."
"San Franciscan","Null","0","1","31 July 2004"," I just don't know... how do I put this?...
","This feels awkward... how do I explain this?<br/><br/>Let me see if I can explain my reaction to this movie the best I can.<br/><br/>This movie came out when I was in my early teens. I first saw the commercial for it on television, and my obnoxious older brother was there pointing out every detail in the commercial and cackling wildly over it. I thought it looked intriguing and wanted to see it, but I couldn't figure out why my brother was going berzerk splitting a side over the commercial (he ROARED the moment they showed the now-famous Ghostbusters logo and shrilled, ""Isn't that logo HILARIOUS???"" I liked the logo, but I didn't think it funny).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie came out at a time when I was expected to buy all my own stuff since I had a paper route. And that particular time period I was busy raising up money for a new stereo. So as a result, I was disappointed when the movie left town before I had gotten to see it. And I had sighed, ""WOW, for a huge hit movie, THAT was sure gone fast.""<br/><br/>For the next year or two, I was forced to endure everybody else's comments about how hilarious and wonderful this movie was. But whenever I asked what had happened in it, they never answered me. All I got was, ""You've just GOT to see it, words don't do it justice, it's HILARIOUS and it's SO COOL!""<br/><br/>Well, during that time I had learned a few of the basics, such as the uniforms and the gadget packs their wore, but that was about it since nobody answered my questions. Fortunately, the movie was being brought back for a brief run in movie theatres before they released it to home video (back then, movies didn't get automatically released on to video a few months after theatrical release the way they are today--you had to wait a few years and then MAYBE if you were lucky it would be). I got all anxious to see it, raised a bit of money once I had gotten finished paying for everything else I had needed to take care of that month--and it was gone from the theatres again! Another groan of frustration from me. I thought, ""Why can't the local movie house at LEAST keep it here for a MONTH or so???""<br/><br/>But then, FINALLY--around early 1987, I think--GHOSTBUSTERS was finally released to home video among a huge flurry of hype. And a friend of mine had managed to rent it one night while I was sleeping over at his house. So I finally managed to see GHOSTBUSTERS for the very first time--<br/><br/>
--and I went ""Huh?""<br/><br/>I just sat there with the most puzzled feeling and going, ""This is it??""<br/><br/>I just don't know how to describe it. By the time I had finally gotten to see it, I was all prepared for that really ""cool"", ""hilarious"" movie everyone was telling me about... and I didn't get one. Instead, I sat through it bored and bewildered. I don't know, somehow I had just expected it to be... very, different. I don't know how, just different, not like the movie I ended up seeing.<br/><br/>I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this movie. I truly did. God knows I tried. I bought the soundtrack and everything afterward, trying to get myself to be as nuts about this movie as everybody else I knew was. But I just couldn't get into it at all.<br/><br/>A few months later my older brother rented GHOSTBUSTERS and my whole family sat and watched. I, along with my parents, just sat there confused. But my older brother, on the other hand... well, to give you an idea, during the one scene when you briefly see a Ghostbuster hopping along on one foot with his eyes closed, my brother was just rolling all over the floor and squealing with delight. ""Isn't that just THE most HILARIOUS thing you ever SAW?????"" he shrieked. The rest of us just sat there trying to figure out what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>It wasn't until years later that I think I finally managed to figure out my huge disappointment with this film. I was not familiar with Hollywood names save for one or two, and I had always just taken movies at face value. It wasn't until much later that I had begun to be familiar with that one particular Ghostbuster who had been doing the foot-hopping that my brother was crowing about, an actor named Bill Murray. This was the first movie is he I had ever seen.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, but around 1992 or so after seeing many more of his output, I have come to the conclusion that I simply do not care for Bill Murray. I have never found him funny, on the contrary he bores me to pieces. In the future, I would end up just not enjoying a single, solitary motion picture of his--Bill Murray is apparently just not my type of performer. Only the spectacular LOST IN TRANSLATION ended up winning a huge place in my heart, not because I thought him funny but because I thought his character was genuinely touching and sublimely acted--and that was twenty years after the fact.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that, later on, I found the first season of the cartoon based on this film (THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, so named as to distinguish it from another ""Ghostbusters""-entitled cartoon released at the same time by Filmation) much more involving and entertaining than the actual movie itself.<br/><br/>These days, I can watch it on occasion, but I just watch it on a whim whenever it happens to be on. I haven't actually gone out and rented it myself to this day. My personal feelings are that I probably needed to see it as soon as it was released along with everyone else as opposed to after the rest of the world and putting up with all the hype--I think in my case my expectations ended up being raised so high that I ended up suffering ""Phantom Menace"" syndrome for this title. That's a shame, too, as I thought this should be a movie I would automatically love. I have the feeling not getting to see it fresh simply killed it for me and I just didn't get it because I didn't get to experience it along with everyone else properly. I still sigh in disappointment whenever I watch it, as even now when I see it on I try so hard to like it... <br/><br/>I really, really, REALLY want to like this movie as much as everyone else does, but so far I have yet to get above ""just okay"". Maybe someday I'll finally love it as much as everyone else seems to, though."

Usually I only write reviews in order to pour scorn on the sad brainless authors, directors and actors, but in this case I make an exception. Quite simply, Ghostbusters is the best movie ever made. It is funny and entertaining. The music score is off the chart, the acting brilliant, the visual effects (for 1984) brilliant (even more so considering that at the time the most common notion of 'digital' was the wristwatch) and the outcome amazing. I'd say most people have seen this movie, but if you haven't i absolutely URGE you to watch this. Quite simply breathtaking. Murray is at his best here, he is my favourite actor and it's mainly because of his role in this film. Danny Aykroyd also super, Ramis also...EVERYONE!

This movie is side-splittingly funny every single time. Bill Murray just seems to play the part so naturally, the script is genuinely funny and original, containing wit, sarcasm and hilarity. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play their parts like they were born to play them and transferring every character from their script onto the screen with its own individuality, giving each actor a chance to shine. There are so many bonuses to this movie that you just don't find in others. Besides the three ghostbusters providing all the laughs, there's Rick Moranis in still his best role ever, Sigourney Weaver in her first comedy, but playing the character straight, sincerely, and sexy. There's Ernie Hudson, providing the film with even more reality, with his black new-yorker's point of view. Then, besides all that, you've got some impressive special effects, some great ghosts, a cool eighties soundtrack, and perfectly fitting, ghostly, musical score. And don't forget Annie Potts or the student who keeps getting electrocuted! This movie has so many memorable lines.
