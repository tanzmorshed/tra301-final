","Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the ""never do this, kids"" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!"

","The hooligan culture is and never was a class thing, people from all walks of life participated, from local council flat drug users to people with well paid office and professional jobs to ex-army types on a very nice pension. This film shows that in true fashion.<br/><br/>Whilst I never took part in any of that crap I have met, seen and known many who have in my time, most are fairly normal people away from all that, in fact I knew one guy for over a year before I found out that after standing on the terraces with the rest of us on a Saturday afternoon he used to go and get pissed, filled up with E's and go on a rampage with his other mates in other nearby towns looking for Cardiff City supporters.<br/><br/>This film is a fairly accurate reflection on the type and mix of people who became hooligans in the first place, especially poignant is the guy who got away from it all, made something half decent of himself and puts it down to simply growing up. Most of the people I have seen in the past are like that, the ones who aren't tend to be those who were put away before they got to that maturing stage, and I'm not talking about end of puberty maturing I'm talking about the day you wake up and think to yourself is this really going to be the rest of my life kind of maturing.<br/><br/>Full marks to all involved for not taking the easy way out and producing a sack full of morally correct/incorrect bullcrap and instead giving a realistic insight into a very scary world.<br/><br/>Yes the film does not really flow or have a connected plot line, but then it isn't meant to, it is meant to be a film about real life, real life does not have a set up stage, middle bit and happy conclusion. In fact this film could probably loop around for another few years of Tommy's life before he either ends up in jail or shakes himself out into the happy ending scenario that I'm sure many were expecting all along.<br/><br/>The film is at times brutal, unsubtle and the language is extremely tasteless, however these are all thing you would have seen in that reality and it is to the credit of the makers and actors that this did not bog the film down at all. Every scene had a purpose no matter how obscure it may have seen at the first watching.<br/><br/>At every scene from about 10 minutes in I felt emotionally involved in a way that not many films manage to do to me, I actually had empathy for these people if not sympathy, I could se how they could get pleasure from the things that they do even if they turn my own stomach to think of anyone I really care about being involved in them.<br/><br/>Even today in what is a golden age of film making (and don't let any stuck up critic tell you it is not) very few films really make you feel connected to the characters in this way, films like Trainspotting, Twin Town, Human Traffic and now Football Factory are a very unusual thing and seem to be specific to the British film industry right at the moment. Maybe it's just I am personally more able to relate to them having grown up around such cultures, I don't know, I just know that I am glad I bought this film and would recommend anyone watch it if only for a better understanding of the culture at that time, something I am proud to say we have made huge strides to eradicate in this country."

","Hoologanism in football has been an controversial over past decade or so especially with it is concerned with English fans. This film has presented this dilemma quite well and in style as most British films do these days. Danny Dyer is brilliant, the last film i saw him in was Human Traffic. There is some terrific dialogue in this film... definitely one of the better football films to be released. I never knew Dyer voiced in some GTA games, how interesting. This film takes on no real plot (except for Chelsea's fixture list) which didn't really bother because it reflects a culture not a 'storyline'. British films never cease to amaze me, the acting is brilliant and script are always so clever and hilarious.<br/><br/>Although the film was good, it scared the hell out of me at times... the reality of it. Watching and thinking that this really does happen every weekend, I guess that is the intention of Nick Love. As a football fan and someone who has never experienced the full wrath of football hooliganism, i throroughly enjoyed and recommend it to anyone who is wondering whether to watch it or not."

","The Football Factory is movie about football (soccer) fans. Since they seem to be more interested in fighting than in actually watching the games this is certainly no sports film so don't let the title fool you. It's also based upon a novel that I haven't even heard of, but that could perhaps be because I'm in Sweden.<br/><br/>The Football Factory is a very episodic movie. Mostly it works, but sometimes I felt like I wanted to spend more time with main character Tommy Johnson or that they should at least had focused on fewer characters. Sometimes I felt that a scene was working really well, but the story quickly focused on other things. As I said, more often than not the episodic feel works fine, but not all the time.<br/><br/>As in almost all English movies the acting's great. From minor characters to main characters... they feel real. I especially think the voice over sounds very authentic: it's Tommy speaking, not actor Danny Dryer reading.<br/><br/>I think this is a good movie, it's rather violent and upsetting at times, but also funny and entertaining."
"Theo Robertson","8","19","25","11 November 2007"," Nick Love's First And Perhaps Last Great Film
","An auteur is regarded as a director who has a running theme throughout their resume . For example Robert Aldrich is considered a "" sadistic "" director and whileis films may be tame compared to the video nasty era the likes of TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID do still come across as compellingly blood thirsty and violent . The films of Martin Scorsese usually involve protagonists being caught in an existentialist quicksand where the more they try and find their goal in life the more they sink into a problem of their own making . Let's not get too caught up in the auteur theory however because much of it is simply down to movie studios assigning scripts to well suited directors "" Hey Marty , we've got a script here featuring a deranged loner wanting to join the mob . Bob and Leonardo have already signed on the dotted line . You interested ? "" . Nevertheless it's obvious that Nick Love in the years ahead will be honoured in this fashion if only because his films feature blackly comical stories of working class British males fed up with the state of the nation <br/><br/>In terms of style and execution THE FOOTBALL FACTORY isn't a million miles away from the likes of TRAINSPOTTING and TWO SMOKING BARALLS . It's very quirky , rather episodic , fairly violent and oh so bloody entertaining . You could say it contains all the flaws of recent British movies like an overuse of the words "" FAHKIN' "" and "" KANT "" but we are talking about the notorious Chelsea headhunters football hooligans and there are admittedly some unlikely coincidences involved such as two of the headhunters burgling a house that belongs to... but unlike Love's later OUTLAW you never feel at how contrived these plot twists are which probably says much of the film's entertainment factor . It could also be that the original source was strong in the first place since I get the feeling that Love totally fails as a screenwriter of original material , certainly the problem with OUTLAW was an underdeveloped script with very underwritten characters who lacked a recognisable motive . Here it's obvious but never overstated that the motivation of becoming a hooligan is to belong to something . And unlike in OUTLAW when something funny happens in THE FOOTBALL FACTORY you genuinely do laugh instead of scratching your head wondering if in fact it's supposed to be funny <br/><br/>I have to confess that I've seen the feature films of Love back to front . I saw OUTLAW when it opened in the cinema in March , I saw THE BUSINESS a couple of months after that and saw THE FOOTBALL FACTORY for the first time last week . If Nick Love had released his films in that order then I would have said that here is a film maker who is really hitting his stride as his films just get better and better . Unfortunately what this means in reality is that Love is on a downhill curve and that nothing has come close to matching THE FOOTBALL FACTORY . One can only hope that the big screen remake of THE SWEENEY , a TV show well remembered for its mixture of black comedy and violence , will see a return to form for an underrated auteur"
"hitchcockthelegend","7","5","5","29 January 2010"," Do what? Av it.
","I read a review of The Football Factory that said the characters are so ""orrible"" and ""hateful"" it was impossible to like them at all! You have to think that that particular reviewer knows nothing about the subject matter of the film he was writing about. Does he think that hoards of footie hooligans, who delight in knocking seven bells of tar out of each other, want to be liked?<br/><br/>The Football Factory is directed by Nick Love and based on the book of the same name written by John King. It stars Danny Dyer {who else really?}, Frank Harper, Neil Maskell and Tamer Hassan {Hassan fans should note he's rarely in it tho}. The story is about what was termed The English Disease, a disease where like minded adults from various walks of life, religiously took to fighting like minded adults, in the name of what football team they happened to support. There's been a ream of books written on the subject, from those involved and by those who haven't a clue outside of reading their Sunday Times articles back in the day. There's also been one or two films about the subject, from pretty ace efforts like Phillip Davis' ID, to middling tellings such as Elijah Wood starrer Green Street. It's a subject that people seem hell bent on dissecting and attempting to get to the bottom of.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, Love's movie is something of a triumph in that it tries the hardest to understand its topic. To those on the outside of football hooliganism, it looks like a bunch of blokes mindlessly inflicting harm on each other whilst simultaneously damaging the good name of the national sport. But Love, with help from King's source, explores ego led tribalism, male bonding, male conformity and dissatisfaction of life in general. Throw in the punches and a ream of genuine laughs and you got a film that is easy to like if you belong to a certain demographic. Here is the problem if you are not a geezer, a tribal footie fan or a mindless thug, The Football Factory holds no appeal to the casual observer, which is a shame, because as stated previously, it's trying hard to reason and understand. There's for instance a cracking plot-strand involving two old fella's, Tommy's {Dyer} granddad Bill {Dudley Sutton} & Albert {John Junkin}. Both lifelong pals who have grown tired of what ""their"" Britain has become, thus they are in the process of emigrating to Australia. This dovetails smartly with the unfolding story of football violence perpetrated by the kids of the day. Generational differences? Perhaps, maybe?<br/><br/>The cast are strong, either fitting the mean profile perfectly {Harper/Hassan} or delivering the needed cocky swagger line {Dyer}, Love has assembled, what is for the material at hand, the perfect cast. OK we probably could have done with Vinnie Jones or Ross Kemp in there somewhere, but it's a low budget movie you know!. The fight scenes are grim and look authentic and the soundtrack rocks the large one too. So is it glamorising a touchy subject? Well yes it is, if you are a football hooligan yourself that is. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it has good intentions in there, even if not all of them are fully realised. To which it leaves us with an impacting, intriguing and uneasily enjoyable movie. 7.5/10"
"MarcMV12","Null","48","71","17 October 2004"," Is it Worth Watching? Course it is, love it!!
","A Fantastic Movie from start to finish, with brilliant acting, script, dialogue, poignancy and laughs. Danny Dyer proves that there is more to young British Actors that Jude ""Pretty Boy"" Law and Orlando ""acts with his eyes"" Bloom with a stirring performance as Tommy Johnston. The social critique is as prominent in the film as the football hooliganism, and the bathos that runs throughout is definitely a strong point. The Film is similar to Trainspotting in its feel and story-telling style, and the soundtrack expertly tries to give you the buzz the guys are feeling as they are marching towards a ruck. Scenes to look out for are the Junior Football Match, the 3rd Round Draw, and Rod Meeting his girlfriend's parents. Ultimately the film asks more questions about the society that breeds the need for arranged violence than the actual link to football, and ultimately leaves you on a high note after many lows during the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone, not just football fans, but anyone who wishes to see a film out heterosexual male relationships, and the state of the British Male mindset in the year 2004.<br/><br/>Love It!!"
"Phrankster163","8","25","35","30 January 2006"," This is reality, folks
","Football violence is a horrible thing. Period. What ""The football factory"" shows us is a bit of reasoning behind why, seemingly normal go out and beat the crap out of each other because of a game with 22 guys and a ball. The truth is, it has nothing to do with the game. How the team actually does really doesn't matter, as long as you get to play your rivals because it's about togetherness and escaping the dreariness of everyday life. In a sick a twisted way of course, but it's the only way for these guys. The movie itself goes by at a million miles an hour and gives us characters that seem both believable and real, and a really touching story of a friendship that has lasted through the ages. The main character Tommy is a really interesting one: He knows he's on the path to destruction and through visions of his own demise, he realizes that it's all going to hell and that he (along with the other hang-arounds) are along for the ride. It's a movie that is definitely worth an hour and a half of your time and you Americans should praise yourself lucky that at least you got one thing right: You know how to behave at sporting events (hell, at NFL games they have barbecues out in the parking lot where fans of the opposing teams eat and hang out together. Just imagine that at a Tottenham-Chelsea or Roma-Lazio game!)"

","Football Factory does not shamelessly glorify violence like many have said. Violence is obviously a focal part of the movie, but i feel the violence of this movie is shown in a negative light. Through out the movie football hooligans of Chelsea FC are followed in a number of different situations. The turf of other football firms, and the local pubs are where many of the scenes are shot, but despite following the violence of football hooligans, this film is a lot deeper than that. It is about trying to feel a part of something. It is about confused individuals that are looking for something to believe in, and throughout the movie there are internal struggles where the characters battle within their own minds as to what's more important; growing up, or football hooliganism. The violence in this movie isn't gratuitous. It is necessary and factual, and is needed to show the internal struggles of the movies' many confused individuals. Not a bad film, although it is a little rough around the edges."
"jpt27","Null","16","24","16 October 2004"," Underinspiring but still interesting.
","MY VERDICT: **/*****<br/><br/>The logic resulting in the production of this film is not hard to follow. The scathing social satire and searingly counter-cultural Trainspotting was a brilliant British film. The flash-talking, fast-plotted, gun-wielding, hard-brawling Lock Stock was a good British film. So why not combine aspects of both? Predictably, the result is a mess, but flashes of good film-making keep the viewer interested for the 1 hour and 20 minutes or so of football 'n' fights.<br/><br/>The opening sequence closely follows the Trainspotting format. A narrator, later we discover called Tommy, delivers his criticism on how we live our lives and how he has found excitement and meaning by flying right off the rails. The soundtrack moves from one Brit hit to the next as we are introduced to his gang in some snappy montages. Again, the Trainspotting skool of film-making isn't so much an influence as a screenplay, storyboard and script.<br/><br/>Soon, we get to know the gang, and learn that the love of their lives is violence, especially (but not exclusively) surrounding their football team, Chelsea, and particularly focused against their arch-rivals Millwall. I was preparing myself for some gruesome violence as geezers started drinking pints and looking for a fight. And then, the film ... just ... chickens out. A film which is supposedly about football violence should, um, contain some football violence maybe, but Football Factory becomes a film version of one of its thugs - all bluster and intimidation, and no bite. Supposedly hard-hitting action sequences have soap opera-like qualities. Never do we seem to see a fist connect in anger, or teeth shatter, or bones crack. Just some bad pantomime blood and incompetent camera-work. This inadequacy seriously undermines the film's impact - it fails to pump up the audience to the next big fight, and thus has no discernible pace. Just scenes, shots and cuts.<br/><br/>Instead, the focus of the film falls (rather disastrously) on the uninteresting, homogenous characters. With a sigh, I realized this wasn't going to get any better, and began to take mental notes of names, story lines etc so I could at least follow the plot. Tommy and Rod are the central duo, the thugs with brains, imagination, and perhaps the insight that will lift them out of this life. Bill is meant to be the ultra-nasty psycho - Robert Carlyle in Trainspotting was clearly what they were trying to emulate - but some unconvincing acting gives him all the terror of a particularly in-your-face door to door salesman. Zebedee is there for exposition on the cocaine-fuelled lifestyle that all youths supposedly lead (is this true? I was a teenager for years, and I never remember being offered cocaine.) There's also an organised violence ringleader, although I don't have to worry about his name because he brings absolutely nothing to the plot at all.<br/><br/>In brief, the plot follows the gang on the buildup to a particularly bruising clash - Millwall versus Chelsea, and particularly how Tommy begins to get cold feet about his thuggery and starts considering his options. This isn't helped by some heavy-handedly (almost bludgeoningly) symbolic dream sequences. I quite liked the film-making device of giving no warning or visual clues to as what was a dream and what wasn't. It's not put to an ultimate good use though, much like the rest of the handful or so of original ideas in the film. I like the dope-smoking old men though.<br/><br/>So is this worth viewing or not? Certainly, it's got more to chew on than another awful CGI-overkill-marathon like Van Helsing or Catwoman. But don't expect it to truly open your eyes to another world, or indeed, still be with you a month later."

","If you want brilliant social commentary or an insight into the psyche of men addicted to adrenalin, look elsewhere. If, however, you want to have a laugh with your mates (presumably, this film attracts about as many female viewers as your average Jenna Jameson flick) and have a taste for ""immoral"" pastimes, this is quite an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The producers behind The Football Factory are Rockstar Games. Yes, the Rockstar Games who gave the world the PS2 game Grand Theft Auto. This should give you a hint of what the film is about. Just like leading actor Danny Dyer's previous film Human Traffic, Football Factory sets out to exploit a subculture. Both films rely heavily on in-jokes for the initiated about what they do on the weekend, be they clubbers gobbling down ecstasy like candy and dancing, or football lads snorting cocaine and fighting. <br/><br/>And, destructive as drug abuse and violence may be, there is no denying that when you're right in the middle of it, it can be fun as hell. If you have ever ran down a city street with a hundred man strong mob chasing the opposition you will understand what I mean, and you will probably love The Football Factory.<br/><br/>This being in essence an exploitation film, I can't help but feeling that the recurring nightmares of Dyer's character and the pathetic ending have been added by somebody to take the edge of the exploitation aspect. That part of the film is really poorly and unconvincingly done, in contrast to the ""immoral"" parts that focus on the joy of drinking, snorting and fighting  they are for most part fun and spot-on."
"nellyd23","Null","18","35","16 May 2004"," nick love's adaptation of the Football Factory
","Forget the hype, Nick Love's adaptation of the Football Factory is a grave disappointment. As is usual with these projects, bits have been added on and/or poached from other novels in the series, presumably to add some narrative coherence to the story. This tactic dilutes the power of the novel, which put simply, is the disaffection of the English male. The film does not tackle the issue of why these men fight, in the book its crystal clear. The film is lightweight, eyecandy for those who enjoy celluloid violence and cartoon characterisations. An injustice to a thoughtful and thought provoking novel on what it means to be English and male.<br/><br/>On the plus side Danny Dyer is excellent as Tommy Johnson. The opening scene 'Tottenham away' is very well done but then the film runs out of ideas. Too much is introduced too quickly - the rivalry between Harris and Billy, the old men, Zebedee, Tommy's new enemies, the impending trip to Milwall - all of this is introduced to take us on a standard movie journey. But its all a great big cliché.<br/><br/>The greatest thing from the book - the hooligans anger at society, his behavior and language - have been watered down to make Tommy seem like a nice guy. But Tommy shouldn't be a nice guy, Tommy lives for the weekend, the chance to get p***ed, stoned, laid and the greatest rush of all, the adrenaline that comes from fighting. Thats the heart of the book, but as usual the film maker conspires to cheat us with clichés. Read the book, avoid the film."
"samandyjohn","10","2","2","30 December 2013"," Genre Defining Classic
","For me , Love's emergence as an auteur represents a watershed moment for early twenty-first century British cinema. After the storms of Leigh and Loach have mellowed in recent years, the public awaited , day by day, hour by hour, anxious for a new cinematic messiah to ease their collective cultural consciousness, and to provide adequate imagery for the post thatcher years. <br/><br/>I believe the dyer/love collaboration will eventually bear fruit similar to the cross continental greatness of de niro and scorsese, and this visceral, intellectually and emotionally engaging picture will convince others of the revolution of minds love is clearly pursuing."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In what were still the early noughties, Nick Love sparked what was to be a string of football violence related movies of the decade with this high energy, hard hitting exploration of male culture and the lure of the crowd, and in turn provided star making turns for both himself and lead actor Danny Dyer.<br/><br/>From the opening credits, The Football Factory hammers your senses and drags you in for the ride with it's high tempo soundtrack interspersed with the various headlines of the scourge of football hooliganism, a style it will keep up through-out the rest of the film. The film is aiming for your face and brilliantly uses a heavy beat soundtrack to drag it along through-out. It gained more attention for it's controversy because of it's violence and mind blowing amount of bad language than for any stand out performances, in much the same way Alan Clarke's TV drama The Firm did two decades before it.<br/><br/>Like Trainspotting, there is no 'plot' as such, it more just follows hooligan Tommy (Dyer) about with his gang as he begins to suffer nightmares and question his means of releasing his pent up energy, whilst a big clash with Millwall looms on the horizon. But this doesn't detract from it's startling, raw intensity and intense delving into the minds of men looking for armies to join. Dyer cemented himself as the Ray Winstone of his generation with his 'cockney geezer' persona, with his own cult film on the same level Winstone gained his notoriety for his role in Scum. Special note must also be made to Frank Harper as Billy Bright, an ageing hooligan who can't grow up or accept he will never be top dog, Roland Manookian as drug addled low life Zeberdee and Dudley Sutton as Old Man Farrell, the closest to a sane, law abiding head among all these repressed hot heads.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is filled with mostly undesirable characters who are the kind most of us would want to keep a million miles away from in real life. But only the most faint hearted of us would find their violence too much and only the most weak minded would want to imitate it. As a nosedive into this world and as a study of why they do it, TFF is the best film of it's sort all decade, with the energy, intensity and killer soundtrack to make it accessible to a modern audience. It's only a shame I couldn't appreciate it on as many levels as it deserved the first time I saw it. *****"
"johnnyboyz","10","2","2","27 March 2009"," Stunning look at questioning one's identity and role within a football firm, further still within contemporary Britain.
","At its very centre, the question The Football Factory revolves around is 'was it worth it?' It is a question its protagonist Tommy Johnson, played by Danny Dyer, sees written in shop windows and on the sides of buses as his life increasingly spirals out of control whilst his conscience takes over and forces him to confront what it is he's actually doing in life. It is a question that Johnson asks himself near the very end but replies to his own voice with ""Of course it was!"", before he witnesses an act of violence so horrifying that it eclipses anything previously shown in the film. This would've left the film on an ambiguous note as to whether Johnson will now reconsider his prior reply or whether he'll even survive the next ten seconds of his life following this incorrect confirmation that it was indeed 'worth it'. The only thing that taints this final thought is the 'what happened next' caption/image that spoils what is, essentially, a fantastic film.<br/><br/>The film was Nick Love's second, second only to Goodbye Charlie Bright which was a bit of a mess. Here, Love takes on substance and he takes on a relevant issue that is linked to today's British culture; that being football hooliganism. The topic may not be as common now or indeed in 2004 when it was made as it was a couple of decades ago, but it exists and The Football Factory acts as a sly reminder it does just as it is a stylish study-come-demonisation of said topic. The film does this through a variety of scenes but takes time to look at the bond between hooligans as this out of control journey takes place amidst a sea of grotty and grimy locations in and around England.<br/><br/>The film follows Tommy and a couple of other characters in Chelsea football club's 'firm'. But teams are immaterial here as we look at Billy Bright (Harper); Rod (Maskell) and a younger member of the firm whom it would seem has quite large aspirations in terms of climbing the ladder within the group named Zeberdee (Manookian). Around all this lies the film's anchor; the film's one sane head who becomes a more humble and a more mature individual when he suffers a tragedy himself linked to his best friend of about fifty years. His name is Bill Farrell (Sutton) and he's Tommy's grandfather. One of the more memorable scenes is the introduction of Bright himself, which draws away from both comedy and drama and just becomes plain frightening when the light hearted tone in a pub is replaced by pure menace once he challenges a younger and smaller firm member. The character and his aggressive, confrontational mindset is set up perfectly for the rest of the film. Another scene that compliments the shifting in tone is when Johnson is cornered in some public toilets to do with who he is.<br/><br/>The demonisation of being a football hooligan begins with a typical establishment of a night out. Tommy and Rod are looking for women and a drink and eventually they find both in a couple of loose girls with whom they venture back the one of their homes with. The following scenes offer light relief or comedy when it appears both males fell asleep but very quickly it turns into danger when Tommy wakes up with a knife to his throat and a fuming brother of one of the girls snarling at him. He escapes and, in his own words, ""that's when all the trouble started"". What began as a routine and potentially silly 'pick up and easy lay' scenario quickly turns into light comedy and then life threatening before you realise the demonisation of the scenario has been completed when Tommy turns up to work disillusioned, still shaken and slightly frightened. The whole thing suddenly does not look as glamorous.<br/><br/>Twinned with this is Johnson's gradual decline into honesty about what he's doing thanks to nightmares and visions, something that branches out into a realm of the uncanny in this refreshing and multi-genre approach that has already been established will zip in and out of comedy, drama and horror. The key scene in moving the film into the third act occurs at a flower stand when someone who has escaped 'the life' tells Johnson to do the same thing with Bright himself being identified as a figure you don't want to end up as; as a figure of such hatred and violence and dedication to these two things that being with him will only incur further punishment.<br/><br/>What's interesting about both character's demise into this mindset is how each one deals with the questioning of their own dedication. When Johnson asks himself if it's worth it, he begins to move away and questions his involvement. When Bright's dedication is questioned by the higher-ups after some eavesdropping, Bright chooses the wrong option and ups the stakes by bringing in firearms following the knocking of his ego. Such a scene demonstrates the correct and incorrect choices when this way of life pushes you into a corner and forces you to make a decision based on what involvement you truly, truly want in a hooligan firm. The Football Factory is stylish but doesn't glamorise; it is gritty and involving but you never really have 'fun' watching it. What you do feel, however, is thoroughly intrigued by the plight of this lone individual as he falls by the way-side and questions his own masculine identity amidst a sea of egos and violence."

The characters were likable and funny (i don't mean to say beating people up makes a likable character i meant that they're good mates that value friendships, camaraderie, enjoy a laugh and a beer etc etc i guess i can relate to that), the story was well paced and enjoyable, the soundtrack was great, and the fighting scenes weren't too graphically violent or prolonged which suited me just fine. I don't know what else to say rather than that i was entertained and satisfied by this story (im a fan of movies which tell you what happens to all the characters at the end). A Little similar to trainspotting and lock stock, both of which i think are superb films. So if you like those be sure to check this out.<br/><br/>Definitely glad i picked it up seen it a few times and is a DVD to re-watch every now and again, very nice movie."

","This is, in all probability, the most irritating film of all time. The reasons for this sorry state of affairs are threefold. Firstly there is no actual football action in the entire film. The film would have been slightly bearable if they interspersed the ""gritty realism"" (yeah right) with clips from classic football matches, alas, this isn't the case. Instead we get a bunch of idiots whose message seems to be that if you're not a football hooligan you don't have a life - make of that what you will. Secondly the cast is made up almost entirely of cockneys - scally cockneys at that (Zeberdee's death couldn't come soon enough). Worse, the films release seemed to inspire people to copy them to the nth degree - why? Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the film glorifies football hooliganism as a good thing, and I'm sorry but it just isn't. In conclusion my hatred of this film is matched only by my disappointment at not being allowed to give a film no stars, which is what this film, undoubtedly, deserves."
"bob the moo","Null","13","27","10 October 2004"," Convincingly real but mostly misses the interesting 'tribal' aspect that it could have explored  but claims of 'glamorisation' are really missing the point
","Tommy Johnson is just a normal bloke, working during the week for f*ck-all money, drinking his nights away looking to get laid and living for the weekend. At the weekend he comes alive with his involvement with his Chelsea firm. Kicking off against whoever, Tommy enjoys the sense of belonging and having that rush that the violence brings  but his life is headed for a change. Waking up in a girl's bed brings him into contact with her Millwall brother  only a cricket bat to the head gets him away safe. However when Chelsea draws Millwall away in the FA Cup it sets the stage for a great clash, but with guys after him and his dreams increasingly scary and unhinged, Tommy suspects the worst.<br/><br/>When this film came out it was naturally met with the media coverage that comes with any film about this very English phenomenon and I decided to just avoid the hype and the hand-wringing and catch up with the film when I could approach it with a clear air. With its silent and unfussy release on DVD I decided I might as well give it a try. The film kicks off with Tommy's firm in a typically violent clash in which we learn of the appeal of the rush and the buzz as well as getting a feel for the characters. At this point I was happy enough because I was grateful that the film acknowledged the appeal of the hooliganism and to try and just pretend it has none would have been stupid. However no right minded person, even one that sees the appeal, could claim that it justifies it and I then looked for it to be more than just this. Although the film sort of starts to wander into the idea of the need for a tribe or a sense of belonging it generally just concentrates on the narrative rather than opening up the ideas.<br/><br/>This is a problem because then all we have is a film that is some sort of drama around the world of football violence rather than a film that explores the lives involved. This is a shame because it could have been interesting but instead it just ends up wallowing in violence with only a vague subtext going on. This is not to say it glamorises it, only that it presents it as it is but fails to really critically analyse it. In this way it will still be as confusing and repulsive to the majority as it is when it is on the news, but to those involved in the real firms this will be seen as a great fun film  and that is a real shame.<br/><br/>The cast are mostly just concerned with delivering swearing 'geezer' clichés and the film gives them no real opportunity to have greater depth than that.<br/><br/>Dyer is a good lead who does occasionally bring out a bit of stuff with expressions and body language but mostly he fits the mould. Harper is just tough but his one scene of self-doubt shows he had more in him if he had been allowed to go further. The rest of the support cast just simply fall into cliché and lazy geezer accents with burberry for all!<br/><br/>Overall this film was a disappointment in the way that it missed the deeper issues on the whole and just ended up being an depiction of violence without a great deal of depth to it. Worth seeing for a realistic depiction of football hooliganism but it doesn't do anything else beyond that. It may not glamorise or promote the life but it doesn't have the depth to criticise or analyse it in the way it really should have done."

","Nick Love's study of obsession of football and hooliganism in the English lower social classes is extremely gritty, realistic and awesome. The characters are very interesting, the screenplay is brilliant, everything about it is just realistic and very well done. It doesn't try to play nice, it doesn't take sides, just shows what goes on. I like the style of film-making, similar to that of Layer Cake and sort of Ritchie's Snatch. I liked this film a lot, one of my instant favorites, and Danny Dyers performance was very good. I liked the real cinematography which made it feel very realistic, similar to that of Justin Lin in Better Luck Tomorrow. 10/10"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","4","6","8 October 2004"," This Film should have been called ""Gangs of London""
","The Football Factory, more like Gangs of Chelsea. I honestly thought I was going to get a typical British film out of Football Factory and I did, but I got more than I thought I would. I don't know much of Nick Love and the same goes for Danny Dyer and after this, I can't wait to see more of them as they brought this film to life in a complete original fashion, for British movies definitely. <br/><br/>We follow Tommy, Rod, Zeberdee, Harris and Billy Bright through their weekdays work and their weekends of football and fighting, this is their life and they would never change it for anyone, not even their families.<br/><br/>They support Chelsea but don't live for the game, only the battles afterwards. What Nick Love brings to the table is a not a film about football hooligans but about choices in life. Throughout Tommy is having nightmares about being beaten by a dozen hooligans and being left for dead for a boy with a white bandage covering his face to turn up and haunt Tommy even more. He believes the drugs he takes are the only reason for these mad dreams instead of them being a wake up call to change his ways before its to late but soon after he gets a gut feeling that its more than that. This is what Love brings to the movie, a dark deep look into the world that these kind of people live in. This is the kind of movie which makes you scared to go into a London pub or any that hails a football team in case you get your head kicked in or if you do, keep your head down. It's very scary to how much a movie can do things like that to you because this is how I felt after watching this movie which is why I love The football factory cause its great when a film like this can do that to you. Some cliché Guy Ritchie moments seem to appear a lot in the film but with it being based in London what am I to expect but Danny Dyer is something else as far as new fresh British talent goes. He fit's the part as Tommy perfectly and gives a more real performance than anything I have seen since Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting and this should be the film that sends Danny Dyer on his way. Everyone else was also on fine performance as was Dudley Sutton as Bill, the aging old veteran coming to terms with his age but living each day to the full. <br/><br/>The music plays out great in every scene like something out of Goodfellas and with acting and fantastic direction from Nick Love there is no way you are going to dislike this film because it tells the harsh truth about what football hooligans are really like and what they stand for. You can compare this to I.D and not wanting to take anything away from I.D as it was a great film with great acting, football Factory has the edge on it and plays out beautifully. If you love British films football Factory is for you. If you like gang films football Factory is for you. If you like dark films then football Factory is your film. Overall Football Factory is an outstanding achievement that should put Britain back on the map for making great films."

","The ""Football Factory"" is a low budget, low brow independent British movie that sunk without trace at the cinema and has now reinvented itself as a heavily promoted straight-to-video/DVD release.<br/><br/>It is not difficult to see why.<br/><br/>I was puzzled first of all by anyone wanting to make a contemporary film about a tired social issue that is about as relevant to life in 21st Century Britain today as flared trousers, spangles and the Bay City Rollers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, British film makers in the past have produced a clutch of outstanding movies dealing with the self same subject matter such as ""ID"" and ""The Firm"", so I was prepared to give the ""Football Factory"" the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>I wish now that I hadn't bothered.<br/><br/>One of the most irritating aspects of this movie is it's total lack of originality. The ""Football Factory"", perhaps in a desperate bid to garner some sort of ""cult credibility"" with it's audience, shamelessly plagiarises innovations from virtually every successful British film of the last decade: ""Gangster No1"", ""Trainspotting"", Lock Stock"" etc etc. The comparisons, unfortunately, end there.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a large group of foul mouthed, baseball cap wearing, lame brained little Englanders engaging in acts of pointless violence, steer clear of this celluloid calamity and go visit any UK town centre at the weekend instead. The acting will probably be a bit more believable too!"
"richard6","3","11","23","7 February 2006"," The story is boring,the acting is rubbish and the plot is all over the place.
","I decided to rent this film out on DVD and by the end of viewing wished I hadn't bothered. The story is boring,the acting is rubbish and the story is disjointed. The lead character is a lad in his late twenties called Tommy who through narration tells us his points of view on life and how he lives it. Life, which include fighting football hooligans, drinking alcohol with his mates and getting laid. The odd thing is you never actually see him hit anybody and he never has sex throughout the movie. This juvenile attitude continues on and through to the main basis of the film which is a scrap between Chelsea and Milwall fans. Other subjects added into the plot are lots of drug taking(even by pensioners)robbing of peoples homes and confusing a psychic predictions of the future. All of this with sentences that start and end with the words f**k and c**t. I was bewildered by the bits where Tommy and his hooligan friends are on their way to a football match in Liverpool. They first stop on a road in the middle of nowhere, presumable Liverpool, scream and shout at some locals, then their back on the motorway and stopping at a service station?? How big is this Liverpool. And why after being arrested at a service station up north somewhere they are tried at a court in London?? The filmmakers have embarrassingly ripped off scenes from other movies including Goodfellas, American history X and Ttrainspotting. The main psycho hard man of the film is just a fat slob who after throwing a couple of punchers would probable have a heart attack,Tommys best mate Rod is simple and dull,the rest of the characters bring nothing to the story of how and why they are their.I found this movie just a load of juvenile nonsense from start to finish ,If your looking for really scenes of bruising football violence with a plot you wont find it in The football factory."
"rchrdshelt","6","9","18","8 November 2004"," Not sure what to make of this
","Being a big football fan of West Brom, I heard about this film and borrowed it today. I knew it was about football violence and its certainly featured in all its gruesome detail in this. However, it ended rather disappointingly. There was an interesting subplot but in the end several plot holes were left and the main question in the film at the end and the main characters feelings about what he does are completely forgotten. I was also diappointed by the end of this film overall. It basically promotes football violence and when the characters are beaten up you don't feel for them as they do it all the time to hundreds of other men. I'm sure football hooligans themselves will love this, but I ain't one and there must be more swear words in this film than any i've ever seen in my life. The characters don't talk any sense whatsoever. There probably didn't even need to be a script for this film as the actors could just improvise all their swear words for every scene as they didn't have much else to say. At the end of the day these men live for nothing. They're just a bunch of thugs who go round beating people up and thats it. Nothing else. Some life. So I must say although this film was well made in some respects there is no sentiment whatsoever and I actually felt as though it was a waste of time in the end. I give it a 6/10 and thats being very generous because it probably deserves much lower."
"octoberth1975","1","11","24","19 January 2007"," Tedious, predictable piece of film-making.
","The Football Factory, is poorly written, poorly acted and crammed full of lazy, half-hearted political statements that try to give weight to what is really just another glamourisation of violent idiots. How strange that a study of people who use football as the catalyst for fervent, tribal head-kicking features absolutely no football! It's a low-budget mish-mash of every other mockney hardman film, directed by someone with delusions of being Martin Scorsese - see freeze-frame/voice-over, manic editing or, worst of all, the scene in the pub between Billy and Zeberdee, which is basically a carbon copy of Joe Pesci's 'How am I funny?' scene in Goodfellas, except with all the real tension removed. There are no characters that provoke any sympathy, unless you're the type of brainless Neanderthal who idolises football hooligans. If you are, then crack open a few cans, put your true-crime book down and enjoy the film; probably fastforwading some of the boring 'talking' bits. If you expect more from a film than a bunch of Guy Ritchie extras slurring gangsterisms and punching each other, look elsewhere. I suggest The Firm, starring Gary Oldman, which tackles the same subject but is a superior film in every way."
"findesigns","4","9","19","6 October 2004"," yes it is what you think
","I was wondering why there weren't many comments on this even though it's on the front page of a few popular internet DVD shops, so I rented it out a few nights ago. Now I know why the lack of interest:<br/><br/>This film is not about football and I wasn't expecting a football film. Basically this is a proper ""lads"" film, and like most films that fit into that category it is pretty bad. Sure some of the characters are interesting, and the acting from most of the cast is very good, but the overall feeling is that this film is trying to be a bit of a joyride for guys who have similar interests to those portrayed in the film. So, there's lots of violence, lots of shots of people stamping on each other etc, and a good deal of attention is paid to the pre-fight bonding sessions that the characters go through (including lots of drug taking and shouting). Well done for presenting it realistically, but to me its just not interesting. <br/><br/>There are a couple of very unsubtle attempts to make the viewer think this film might be going somewhere interesting, when the main character seems to begin to question the dodgy way he's choosing to live, once at the start of the film and once mid way through. Then, nothing! we see a few more fights, the characters don't develop and nothing is learnt. There's a good scene where the scariest of the group acts insulted to frighten one of the smaller guys, but even this is ripped straight from Joe Pesci's brilliant scene in Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't hoping for all the characters to see the error of their ways or anything, but I wanted to learn something or see something original. <br/><br/>The style was Snatch meets Human Traffic... so kind of fast and snappy, but not very original, and not at all interesting, at least to me. That said, due to the quality acting and totally realistic storyline, if you're a football hooligan or are in general into street violence this may be well worth a look."

"blindleeplink","2","8","17","25 June 2006"," Boring, pointless, violent, pathetic
","For someone who enjoys football, this film was a supreme letdown. I knew what the content would involve when I sat down to watch it, but I also suspected to see some footage of FOOTBALL...otherwise known as the beautiful game, so naturally photogenic that I distrust any director that gives up such an indulgent opportunity to commit it to celluloid. If the director had presented a football match in the same stylish, celebrated way that he revelled in the violence, then there may have been just a ray of hope for this film. But what I was offered, I'm afraid, was 30 seconds of a juniors match somewhere in the background of a punch up. That is not enough.<br/><br/>This film is one made for total wannabes; those not brave or ruthless enough to involve themselves in such a vile culture, but those that think that to do so is big and clever and that their allegiance to such a film will gain them acceptance in similar social circles, when really they would be torn apart. As far as the film goes, to see grown men acting with such spiteful petulance is sad, and for those who have never thrown a punch in their lives to spout recommendations for such films on the basis of some misconceived style is equally as childlike and desperately pathetic. Furthermore, for those who immerse themselves in violence on a regular basis...well, this is just a film that creates a shallow, diluted justification that their lifestyle is one to be respected.<br/><br/>The plot is ultimately empty; a few spiteful, transparently obvious and tired practical jokes juxtaposed with strong violence and excessive swearing...it seems that he who swears the most deserves respect the most. A lot of talking is involved, but its relevance and ultimately any type of resolution is nonexistent. Instead of the tired-Trainspotting narrative of social rebirth, this is just the tiring narrative of directionless vacancy.<br/><br/>The film has certain realistic points that I feel need to be pointed out. For one, a full scale riot can be broken up by half a dozen policemen with truncheons. Those hard-by-numbers pack of mongrel dogs, upon the arrival of a few newspaper-wielding coppers, will suddenly turn tail and run behind the sofa; I witnessed this myself when, unlike most who will probably sing this film's praises, I was actually caught up in a full scale football riot.<br/><br/>This is not football, this is the social compunction to crave acceptance; it's not about who you are, it's about who you know, or who you think you know, that here dictates your importance within society. This is becoming all too common these days, where prison time and links to organised criminals are badges to be worn with pride, not subjects of shame. The vital point that is completely missed is that those you think are important and crave to be are nothing without their group of lesser followers, that outside your band of self-congratulatory dependants you are all nothing...no one cares about you or your cause.<br/><br/>A wasted opportunity for a serious social comment; this is for kids."
"e_r_m_ferguson","2","10","23","25 May 2004"," Lovable Cockney Wideboys beat kick lumps out of each other?
","Football Factory shamelessly glorifies violence, and presents its protagonists as some sort of lovable cockney wideboys. If this is what you are looking for from a film then there are many much more watchable and funnier examples. It makes vague pretensions towards characterisation and hints at a moral dilemma within our main character's conscience.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the pretensions towards some sort of plot and perhaps even a moral in the film feel dubiously tacked on in order to counter accusations of glorifying violence. The fact is that the film is quite funny if you go into it expecting (literally) absolutely nothing in terms of a plot, or characterisation. However if you are easily offended, looking for some sort of substance from a film, or on a first date, i would steer well clear."

","I'm not such a big fan of British movies. There have been a few good movies like Lock stock and two smoking barrels, Snatch and some of the James Bond movies. I didn't expect it too be good, but it was very entertaining. It deals with a never before seen in a movie topic, Football Hooligans. There also has been another release the following year Green Street Hooligans, which was a Great Film. Football Factory does entertain and is packed with Violence and Humour. The problem with this movie is it promotes Hooliganism in some ways. They made it look like its fun to be a hooligan and its fun to beat up people. Yeah, its fun to watch it on DVD, I enjoy watching violence, but a movie should point out a message. Green Street Holigans worked, because the ending had a message. Football Factory narrates to us Is it Worth It? and at the end, the answer is Of Course it Was. It's funny, but can be a bad influence on some people. The acting was decent. Danny Dyer delivers a good performance. Frank Harper tries to act like Joe Pesci in Casino/Goodfellas and does a good job of it. This movie is a good time pass"
"Bill_Bones","Null","4","7","22 August 2006"," Yet another Brit flick that is like watching a first draft script
","You can't make a good film from a bad script as is the case here. The script is just underdeveloped, come the end of the film you just don't get that ""satisfaction"" feeling that you're supposed to, that you need to. Why? Because the themes are badly explored, plot trails go nowhere and, most of all, we can't really get a hook into any of these characters. Even with hard-nosed content like this we should still be able to care about someone. Here the opposite it is true and in the film's final moments we even find ourselves cheering a character we've only briefly glimpsed.<br/><br/>A good example is the Bill character overhearing a plot by the other head guys to keep him out for being unreliable. This dramatic moment of undoing for the character should signal later events but nothing comes of it. There are lots of these unpaid moments which amounts to poor scripting.<br/><br/>The British representation is very true to life. It looks so much like the Britain we all know yet never rises above it enough to become a proper movie. Obviously the budget is less than an episode of EastEnders and the fact it looks to be shot on video doesn't help. You can't really have dream moments in a film like this, it's just not ""magical"" enough. The grandad subplot is also completely at odds with the rest of the film's unrepentant hooligan theme leaving really messy results.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film is too pedestrian, lacking comedy or sparkle. The narration is of the most intrusive and expository type. The ""action"" scenes weren't a patch on Gangs of New York. The unrepentant themes are jarred badly by the closing moments and there is no real exploration of why these normal people need to do this.<br/><br/>If the Football Factory had been funnier and less afraid of the tragedy it might have been a great film. As is you're just left with one of those messy, mismatched genre films that is evidence of the British Film Industry's consistent mistake of filming too raw and unsatisfying a script."

This is a juvenile, simplistic film, sloppily directed. Whilst the majority of the acting must be commended (Manookian in particular works brilliantly with<br/><br/>little to no material), the rest of this flick stood impotent and misjudged for its entirety. <br/><br/>A big shame really, because Nick Love's debut ""Goodbye Charlie Bright""<br/><br/>showed such immense promise. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, there is only one word to judge this film by; lazy.

Football violence nowadays is usually restricted to stick throwing and girl slapping amongst 'men'. The film trys to paint hooligans as having a great laddish lifestyle, fast cars, fast fists and fast girls. The hooligans i've known in my time don't fit this bill, so i suggest the film is more based around drunken fools who get into scraps rather than hooligans.<br/><br/>The film never convinced me it was going anywhere. It reminded me of any anti-social behaviour based film, but happened to be loosely associated with football. The characters were weak and poorly acted. The storyline was as weak as the tea at Swansea City and the ending was up there with Guesthouse Paradiso fighting for the award of ""rubbish ending of all time"".<br/><br/>If you want to see football violence then go back to the years when it was really around (Nowadays it's just drunken girl slapping) so try watching ID.

","To be honest, movies like The Football Factory aren't usually ones I enjoy. But this one really surprised me. The Football Factory is a study of the English obsession with football violence and hooliganism, but there's so much more here. It's documentary-like presentation gives the film more charm than if it was presented as just a generic movie.<br/><br/>Although I do have to say that Danny Dyer seems to play the same character in every movie he's in (Doghouse, Severance and Mean Machine are just a few examples) you can't fault him for it because he does it well and believably. His character, Tommy Johnson, is a typical British football fan who just, as he puts it, ""loves to f*cking fight"".<br/><br/>Dyer also narrates the movie, giving it that documentary vibe, making you think you're actually watching a retelling of events that have actually happened. Dyer's narration also gives his character a little more depth and does a good job of effectively separating him from the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The Football Factory is essentially played out as a serious approach to the issue of football hooliganism, but there's something more there. The sub-plot of Tommy's granddad and his war-time friend moving abroad together with Tommy's recurring dreams that play out like sort of Final Destination-esquire premonitions give the story that little bit more depth.<br/><br/>The Football Factory is a hugely entertaining and funny movie that isn't exclusively for only football fans.

"MartynGryphon","7","2","3","17 May 2007"," The Beautiful Game? Do me a lemon!
","I'm ashamed to say that I found The Football Factory to be perversely enjoyable, despite the fact that it depicts England's worst ever contribution to world culture - Football hooliganism.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of Chelsea fans who for some strange and as yet unexplained reason, take sadistic glee by going around and beating seven bells of s*** out of rival football supporters just for jollies. Personally I like to watch the football, munch a steak pie (or two) at half time, neck a few (or more) beers and then sod off home.<br/><br/>Football hooliganism was the cancer of Britain's inner cities throughout the 1980's, and was solely responsible for the total expulsion of ALL English football clubs from European competition for a number of seasons. In fact, I froth with rabid anger even today when I think of Coventry City's historic FA cup win in 1987, which would of allowed us, (and for the FIRST time may I add), to participate in the following season's 'Cup Winner's Cup' tournament, HAD WE NOT BEEN BANNED FROM IT! As the 80's gave way to the 90's, hooliganism started to decline and English teams were allowed back onto the European stage. However, the new millennium has seen a new dawn in football related violence and sadly, the cancer we all thought was in remission is back, and it is this re-emergence, that The Football Factory uncompromisingly addresses.<br/><br/>Sadly, there are too many British film directors today, who are happy to churn out movies that contain a severe pornography of violence, drug abuse and potty mouthed profanity. The Football Factory has all three in very large and very obscene portions. It's violence is unparallelled, it contains more white powder than a talc factory and MUST hold the record for the amount of C word's used in a fictional motion picture, and I'm not referring to the word CHELSEA if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Director Nick Love rekindles his love affair with urban London, ala 'Goodbye Charlie Bright' and entices a fantastic and believable performance out of Danny Dyer, because those of us who actually come from British Inner Cities will ALL know, or have known, a Tommy Johnson at one time or another. However, the accolade for best performance is reserved for Frank Harper as the psychotic Billy Bright. I thought Harper was absolutely fantastic as Michael Caine's tough bodyguard Stoney in 'Shiner', but his performance as Billy Bright makes Stoney look like a ladies hairdresser in comparison, to the point that if I saw Billy Bright walking down the street I would literally s*** myself.<br/><br/>Is it one for the family?, definitely not. Does it glorify Football violence?, maybe. Is it a great movie?, abso-bloody-lutely.<br/><br/>However, One day I would love to see one of these gritty urban movies made somewhere other than London, as I am now convinced that most British filmmakers think that there is nothing north of Watford Gap.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","The earlier comments about this work greatly vary. You either love it or loathe it, and some of the criticisms are understandable and are probably fair. Few films qualify as being really original. Yes this one has at least one scene that shamelessly copies Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas' but then you could say the same about 'Lockstock and Two Smoking Barrels' copying 'Casino'. I watched TFF (courtesy of Film Four) on 16.08.06. It didn't require the brains of a rocket scientist to immediately see that it was about football hooliganism. Having been given a book called 'Tottenham Massive' for my Birthday by my wife - she genuinely didn't realise it had nothing to do with the glory, glory days of my beloved Spurs, I was aiming to switch off TFF thinking it would be more of the same. Something made me continue watching and I was not disappointed. There IS a moral to this film although it is really deferred until the twist right at the end. Dyer's recurring nightmare in the face of the looming confrontation between the Chelsea and Millwall crews is a legitimate example of dramatic license, although the implication that one only becomes psychic on a cocktail of lager and cocaine could be dangerously misleading! The cocaine and alcohol abuse is suitably unglamourous. Having had a premonition that he will himself get a really serious kicking, Dyer does indeed wake up in hospital where he immediately enquires about Zeberdee's welfare. Welcoming the good news that Zeberdee came through, Dyer feels that his none too certain defiance of superstition has been vindicated and gloats in his lack of remorse and regret. Then his instincts turn out to have been right all along, and the viewer is left with a very real sense of just deserts particularly for Harper but also for Dyer who will be devastated by Zeberdee's death. We are left with a very strong sense of the whole pathetic futility of their way of life. The film also depicts in a very effective way the pecking order of bullies, and how the weak when picked on, go on to pick on others who are even weaker. We are reminded that very few bullies would never have been bullied themselves. There are some very realistic performances. The two main thugs played by Harper and Denham are frighteningly credible: the greater respect afforded to Denham because of his better sense of strategy alarming, but not bogus. The inclusion of the two elderly heroes of WWII who fought Hitler to defeat racism provides a powerful balance to the intolerable attitudes demonstrated by the main protagonists and by Jamie Foreman's cab driver. Dudley Sutton's virtuous and tactical attempts to inject a bit of moral backbone into his errant grandson also provide welcome and touching relief. Foreman's objectionable lines are just a little too like the satirical utterances of the Private Eye taxi driver to allow his character to be really believable, but he delivers them with his usual panache. The film moves at a great pace, a desirable quality that not all British film makers really appreciate as much as their American counterparts."
"jadavix","6","1","1","19 May 2016"," Watchable enough, with distracting dream sequences and an overload of noisy presentation
","""The Football Factory"" is a passable, entertaining movie about football thugs. It does not absurdly glamourise this moronic pass-time like ""Green Street Hooligans"", which expected us to be taken in by the culture of violence as its miscast hero was. It does, however, wallow in the muck a bit much, and it doesn't provide much of a reason for its hero's involvement in this horrible business.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the punchy style, with its quick, in your face editing, blaring soundtrack of recognizable bands, pugnacious voice-over, title cards, blink and you miss them flashback sequences, all combine to keep you at a distance from the protagonist. This is the style you expect from a British movie about the working classes, but by 2004 it was looking a little tired. It jazzes up the material, and is that really necessary? Do the creators love the violent lifestyle, or condemn it? They clearly do not wish to merely depict it, there's too much staging for that.<br/><br/>Danny Dyer is also miscast. He is introduced at the beginning of the movie as a typical young hoodlum. He doesn't look, or even really act, like one. There is some nonsense about him having recurring dreams that don't really add anything to the movie, or the character. After all the noise, swearing, violence and mayhem, they don't make enough of an impact to really justify their presence.<br/><br/>The movie is still watchable, it's just really not anything great."

What the hell do you expect. I didn't go watch boys to men than come out of the cinema moaning that it was full of blacks, hoes, crack heads, and drive by shootings, that would be stupid. <br/><br/>Anyway this is a realistic hooligan flick about a group of Chelsea hooligans (the headhunters)and their exploits around the country following their football club. They than finally get the dream cup draw half way through the season against Millwall.I doubt many people need to know what Millwall are famous for.The film is about the build up to this game.<br/><br/>I found it funny and entertaining to watch with a few beers with my mates its not really a film to watch with your missus or the family.

","There are films with wit, charm, sophistication, plot and premier quality acting which inspire and entertain.<br/><br/>This is not one of those films and should have been burned in celluloid form before getting anywhere near the public domain.<br/><br/>Football Factory is basically about football hooliganism, and the yobs which make up the hooligan element of such clubs as West Ham, Millwall, and, focused on in this one, Chelsea. We follow a traveling gang who essentially drink a lot, and arrange a 'barney' with opposing fans whenever they get a chance.<br/><br/>A bunch of of non-descript actors play the roles here with excruciating blandness and overwhelming stereotyping that from the off it is both hard to hear what they're muttering, and hard to want to continue watching such is the complete and utter dislikeability of every one of them. I accept that we're probably not supposed to sympathies or even empathise with these fellows, such are their natures, but not even *one* protagonist exists and we feel completely distanced from everything.<br/><br/>The plot is that a cup draw between the arch-rivals Millwall and Chelsea has been made, and a meet between the hooligans is planned. However, so much peripheral nonsense and uninteresting drivel is played out in between that frankly by the time they all meet the viewer really couldn't give a monkey's.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are gritty enough, but all it does it repulse you - there is no attempt to convey it in a societal manner, or to explain *why* they do this and what motivates them - it's just 'we beat each other up because we like it'. <br/><br/>As said before there is little characterisation, and the stereotyping is utterly miserable: the racist cabbie, the degenerate hooligan friends, the psychotic ringleader, the quiet overall leader, the wise but gruff old men, the young scumbags, and all the various yobs on 'the other sides'.<br/><br/>I'm trying to fathom what else there is to this and I'm dry already.<br/><br/>Frankly to watch this film is to view an embarrassment to the British film industry which is capable of much, much better fare than this."
"neil_ward","7","3","6","29 March 2005"," Blows the cobwebs away
","Adapted from John King's novel, The Football Factory is a vibrant synthesis of Snatch, Trainspotting and that episode of Grange Hill where the boys organised a fight with another school. The story concentrates on three members of the infamous Chelsea Headhunter's 'firm', who use their team's matches as an excuse to brawl with rival pseudo-supporters; narrator and stereotypical twenty-something lad Tommy, dimwitted hardman Billy and repugnant rat-boy Zebedee (so-called because he likes 'white powder').<br/><br/>Although Tommy enjoys the adrenaline-rush of fighting, he is plagued by visions of a serious beating and starts to question whether the lifestyle is 'worth it'. Along with friend Rod, he has inadvertently upset several Millwall fans, just when the FC Cup has pitched their two teams, and thus firms, against each other.<br/><br/>All the staples of British cinema are evident; the insightful voice-over, pumping Britpop soundtrack and defiance of social-conformity (jobs and girlfriends are for losers, etc). Token comedy interludes are provided by two drug-addicted pensioners and a hilariously blinkered, Hoxton-like portrayal of Liverpool (apparently just a deserted wasteland, consisting of five scallies and a burned-out car).<br/><br/>The hooligans are portrayed as surprisingly intelligent, misunderstood people, embodying the brave, noble spirit of St. George and disillusioned by a dystopia society that doesn't understand them; which may be somewhat difficult to accept if you've ever spent a train-journey desperately trying to avoid eye-contact with drunken 'casuals'. Otherwise the film is gleeful exploitation and extends two-fingers to any expected moral allegories.<br/><br/>Director Nick Love's stylish cinematography and the young cast's accurate, energetic performances are sufficient to transcend the dated subject-matter. The Football Factory is an undemanding 90-minutes that blows the cobwebs away."

","Whoa! After having watched it last evening, quite breathless most of the time, I can easily feel the aftertaste in my head and surely hope that it's gonna stay there for a while. Yes, I loved it! It grips you from the first second during the titles, they are disturbing, chaotic and aggressive...like most of the film. The atmosphere during it has a sense of something creeping behind your back all of the time. Especially as we know from the first minute what will happen to the main character and can see how it unfolds little by little. The violence which is quite brutal does well to keep you 100% focused as it is so shockingly real, mostly due to the film-making itself (actors, cinematography, sound and music).<br/><br/>I myself from Iceland not deep in the hooligan culture interpreted this film however more as a semi-true story than a fiction, as I have seen the incredible documentary about the news-reporter who went into the inner circle of the Chelsea-headhunters. So the film was extra shocking due to this, I could not go...it's simply a movie. It felt real.<br/><br/>p.s. also recommend I.D. for those interested in the hooligan genre.

This film like Trainspotting has narration but in Trainspotting the narration is funny and interesting while in Football Factory the narration is boring and rubbish. The script is predictable lots of F words and C words which in some films would make it funny but in this very dull.

"beardsleythesaint","3","4","11","16 January 2006"," 'What a load of Rubbish!'
","When I initially heard about the planned movie version of 'The Football Factory' I was looking forward to seeing the story up on screen having read the excellent book by John King. I seem to remember in its early stages the film had Sean Bean and Dougray Scott attached, but due to the film having financial difficulties they departed the project. Luckily them it seems because this film was total crap! Where do I start? For one the actual story and characterisation has been changed considerably, one of the main reasons I liked the book so much was because you got under Tom's skin (the lead character), you felt his disaffection for his drab, dreary existence of 9-5 work and the mandatory booze sessions at the weekend. The rush and adrenaline from being in a football firm gave him the adrenaline and excitement he craved so badly. Men feeling marginalised in society winning back their masculinity and identity in an extreme way. The film has taken the very basically skeleton of the story but nothing else, I didn't really recognise any characters from the book, instead there was just a lot of bad acting and several story strands that were just utter toss and totally irrelevant - what the hell was the story on his grandad about!? The production values seem cheap and the fight scenes are nothing worth mentioning! What made the book better than a run of the mill football hooligan story was that it made you like/understand the character of Tom, the film doesn't do that at all and I don't even think it bothers trying. I thought Green Street was a much better film and that was middle of the road! Avoid!"

"bowmanblue","7","0","0","8 April 2019"," The British version of 'Fight Club?'
","'Fight Club' came along and showed us a lifestyle that 'bored American men' could - somewhat - identify with and a - possible - solution to the 'problem' of how to deal with their natural masculine instincts in a world where battering people to a bl00dy pulp is frowned upon (funny that!). Now, 'The Football Factory' may be metaphorical as well as literal miles away from 'Fight Club,' but there are some similarities (believe it or not!) and, no, I'm not saying that Brad Pitt is anything like our own Danny Dyer!<br/><br/>Danny Dyer plays 'Tommy Johnson,' on the surface just another cheeky young cockney who loves what most young men do (regardless of whether they're cockney or not), i.e. drinking, women and, or course, football. Now, that doesn't sound too 'out there' apart from the fact that rather than just cheering his team on over a pint in the local boozer, Tommy enjoys smashing the hell out of opposing teams' fans along with his own little gang/army. And he even sees this as some sort of recreational activity/hobby that he looks forward to at the weekend.<br/><br/>The parallels I see between 'The Football Factory' and 'Fight Club' are basically that the story revolves around a group of men who just don't seem to be able to fit into society and 'push back' against what most of us perceive as 'the norm' via extreme (and very violent!) methods.<br/><br/>It would be easy to say that Tommy Johnson is not a nice guy. Anyone who indulges is violence as fun can't be a relatable hero, right? Well... sort of. He's actually quite a nice, charming guy. If you sat next to him on the bus he certainly wouldn't club you over the head and steal your phone. His use of violence is only channeled against those who also see violence as something to pass the time on a Saturday afternoon after the football's over. Therefore, although we may not identify with him and his 'vices' at least we can follow his journey.<br/><br/>The 'story' (notice the quote marks?) is loose to say the least. Most typical Hollywood films have a definite beginning, middle and end, plus the central protagonist has grown on his journey. Here, 'The Football Factory' is almost more like a documentary where we simply drop in during Tommy's life and follow his exploits for a certain amount of time, before saying our goodbyes and leaving him no real better or worse off than when we started.<br/><br/>It's certainly not going to be a film for everyone. I can imagine many not really wanting to spend an hour and a half watching a gang of thugs beat another gang of equally unlikable thugs to a pulp. But, it is strangely addictive. Like a carcrash I found myself unable to look away. I'd hardly claim it's a masterpiece, but, from various news reports and documentaries I've watched over the years on the subject matter, it does provide a dramatic little snippet into the lives of people who do this."

","I've watch the ""Green Street Hooligan's"" several months ago and thought it was a good movie but this film is like a rush of blood to the head. ""The Football Factory"" is the ultimate head blowing, jaw clenching, white knuckle ride of a film. This film has all the elements to make up a night of exciting viewing, from though provoking characters, witty dialogue to energized music to watch boys batter each other.<br/><br/>To begin theirs Tommy, fast approaching 30 and not a clue what to do with his sad little life, only thing he¹s clinging onto is the next big meet and Billy Bright the foul mouthed, bad tempered geezer who lost the ability to engage his brain a long time ago, he¹s only comfortable using his fists. Rod who does a stellar performance in a restaurant, acts as a perfect side kick to Tommy, Bill Farrell the perfect gentleman from a bygone era and Harris the mean-faced leader who could have Vinnie Jones for breakfast, plays the distant yet commanding leader.<br/><br/>But I like the young kid who plays Zebberdee, a scaly living like vermin in the depths of South London, this is all credit to the acting as it must be difficult to play someone who is so detrimental to society and has very little redeeming features. Credit must be given to all the actors as they all deliver stellar performances in what must be the most unglamorous locations. There isn't one performance I would say was weak as they all hold the audiences attention and gage us into what they are doing and saying. I found the violence and fashion to be very realistic.

","I'm usually pretty critical when people come over to me and say some movie is great. Usually they turn out to be great disappointments because of my crooked taste in movies. My friends ranked this movie really high and that made me even more doubtful. But I was wrong. This was THE movie for me. <br/><br/>Ever since I bought Football factory on DVD and watched it over and over again I keep asking my self what it is that makes me wanna see it all over again. I've tried to analyze my obsession with this movie but just can't come to a conclusion. There is something about this movie, that I've never seen before. It's the feeling you get when you watch it, and trust me when I say that I'm not a psycho who admires drugs, alcohol and violence. It's something much deeper. Nick Love showed the whole world what it means to be a fan. The type of sport you like, or the success of your team doesn't matter when it comes to pure cheering. It's about belonging somewhere and standing on your buddies side on good- and bad times. Instead of ""me"" it now is ""we"". If you are not a fan of a sport team, like me, you wont see the same in this movie as I do. But watching this movie reminds me of all those times with my mates on some home- or away game. Every time you got yourself into trouble there was always someone standing on your side even if it was you who did wrong. Having your buddies on your side makes you feel so strong, like you could take over the world if you'd want to. This movie shows the other side of being a fan, that side no one talks about aloud, but still everyone is thinking about it. It's just so much more than singing some crappy songs and getting really drunk. It's simply said about belonging somewhere. To believe in something. To have something to stand for. When you loose you loose together and when you win you win together and man that feeling is great. The best thing about this movie is absolutely the characters, who it's so easy to relate to. they are just normal people who do normal stuff on the weeks. This movie continually makes me miss my mates, and I guess that is the poison in this movie that I'm addicted to. <br/><br/>The fighting is all just bonus, who wouldn't love some action? Even in this case you have to remember, that the fighting and everything including it is not the heart of this movie. It's not about the violence, that is just something you had to add there. Football hooliganism is surely a huge theme in this movie, Love shows that it's just a way of life. And if you can close your eyes to the violence you will find this movie superb. With all the confusion in the main characters head and mind makes this movie also a noteworthy drama. Then again, the acting in this movie is so beautiful to watch. It's so real and natural and the talented actors really showed what they are getting payed for. The dialogs are smart, easy to quote, sounds good and not too exaggerated. The language used is ruff and ugly, but real and the same used on the streets. No matter how weird it will sound saying this loud, I have to say it. Nick Love made art of fighting. Football factory is definitely one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and it would surely be a sin to vote this movie anything else than excellent."

Frank Harper who plays Billy Bright is fantastic - he always appears to be on the cusp of explosive violence, and it can be quite terrifying to watch. Love is adept at creating real tension; the build-up to each ruck between 'firms' is thrilling. It's not Hitchcock but it doesn't pretend to be, although there are some really interesting shots. It's top drawer entertainment and better most of the garbage that fills your DVD store.

But, unlike a lot of films I've seen recently, I wasn't sitting there praying for my own death whilst watching it.<br/><br/>First the good things : lots of swearing, Spurs fans getting beaten up, and right at the start they all walk past the house in which I used to live.<br/><br/>Bad things : the ""plot"" is thinner than Cyril Sneer's address book, the so-called fight scenes are basically laughable, there's not much in the way of acting (and what there is is pretty freaking sheite) and some of the scenes are real hardcore Turkish slipper moments. I'm still cringeing at the whole Goodfellas bit. JEBUS.<br/><br/>The film is vacuous, pointless film - but one that you can just about sit through if you have to.<br/><br/>Having said that, I think I laughed once (can't remember at what exactly mind), and any film that refers to Millwall supporters as ""pikeys"" deserves some sort of credit.<br/><br/>So I reckon a 3/10 then."

","In my own opinion from what i saw it should Really be a 10, i know hooligans i have friends who are football hooligans and basically this film depicts the truth of what it is really like, I know a lot of people who have reviewed this film are American and i don't want to insult your opinions and reviews, but there is not one British person i know that would say Green Street (british Title) is a better film than the football factory. between the two football factory has real British actors original come from working class backgrounds where football hooliganism comes from where has Green street yes it was a good film but has many actors going about doing British things but as usual exaggerate on everything like when the firm of the GSE walks no hooligan or fan walks with that much waddle without something wrong with their leg. anyway the football factory,what i loved was prior to that time i was very interested in football i used to go to all my teams games the years before and have such a great time and the first act i saw which made me believe was a game between my team Chesterfield (proud of where i'm from) and Manchester City (the other team in Manchester other than United for you Americans) i was about 10 at the time and me and my dad were sat in the family stand every kid has pride no matter what your background and there was man city fans there and i couldn't believe it next min Kick Off and man city fans had been arrested been brought round the ground past us F'ing and blinding "" F**k you, You Spireite C*nts"" etc they would shout banter but with there own pride when the came ended there firm which i think is Another one called the ICF (inter city firm) had come out early to wait for ours the CBS (chesterfield B**tard Squad) coming out of the Kop end of the Ground ironically all the stands come out of this end so with me only being little my dad was like surrounding me while running cos we were going to the club shop Bottles and Bricks were flying about people were bloody but at this stage the shouting had already been down we could hear it leaving the ground and walking out by the time we were out it was the fight.<br/><br/>Football Factory makes me remember that day but with a smile and as i am nearly 18 now i wish i was this age then i'd have joined in for my own pride. My Father was from a rough area of Chesterfield originally a place called Birdholme and that makes my roots from there to live up to my working class family to what they would have done to be with most of the people from my dads area some he may have known years ago. I feel you cannot truly appreciate this film unless you are British or European I'm sure you don't really have this sort of thing in the states where in a contact sport your all padded up head to toe. I know of one or two people who for one hate violence can't stand especially football violence but when they saw these films Green street and Football factory you'd think as i am talking about girls they would say Green streets better its more story less about the violence more plot but half of it isn't to do with what its supposed to be about but getting to the point all these girls say football factory is better by fair it gives you the true atmosphere the reality of what it's like to be not just a football hooligan but a football fan, and to be fair most hooligans that are in their 30's and forties that still do it, don't even go to games like Green street announces because they are banned and just organise the fights and use their time as a worthy cause."

","--- i had the pleasure of seeing this film the same week I saw 'Once We Were Warriors'--- which nearly topped the day I saw 'Deliverance' and 'Straw Dogs'--- fortunately this film is the only one without a rape scene among the ones mentioned. Brutal and thuggish ---reminicent of 'Basketball Diaries'--- this movie has nothing to do with football. The only time you see football being played is when it is in the background of a verbal leading to fist fight. This movie confirms my belief that the U.K. is still far from the gun violence of the U.S. I outright laughed when one of the characters brought a starter pistol to a giant mob fight--- what a wuss. The indefatigable nature of many of the characters impressed me--- non-stop trouble making. The film worked pretty well capturing the action--- fairly straightforward and narrative. There is also a great scene of one of the main character's grandfather smoking a fatty---- end."

","Honestly, I'm saddened by this film. I'm not even sure what genre it could fit under. The characters are too transparent for it to be a drama, the fight scenes are terribly done and too far between to be an action, there's absolutely no humor, and there wasn't even a smidgen of actual football, save a couple of cameos by a ball. When there were brawls, it didn't phase me at all if someone got hurt. I didn't identify or even like any of the characters as they were portrayed and the film didn't spend any time developing even the main character. By the end, I was completely tired of seeing people do lines of cocaine. It got old after the fourteenth time, five minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>If you want a good firm film, go watch Green Street Hooligans. It has things such as ""character development"" and ""adrenaline pumping fight scenes"", not to mention less shots of characters snorting coke.<br/><br/>I want my two hours ba-... you're kidding, this was only an hour and a half?"

","Bloody good fun, if you ask me. It's lovely to see Chelsea boys kicking the crap out of the rest of the football fans. The Millwall fight was done brilliantly and very believable. The main actor (Dyer) is a really cool guy, who fits perfectly well into this scene. Basically, a great movie for all the Chelsea fans. Hope it does well on video, and if you are interested in other football movies then you have to check English films ""I.D."", ""Firm"" (with Oldman) and Italian ""Ultra"". Those films also tell the story of football hooliganism. It's a pity there are not enough films on this subject, cos you can make a great big budget action movie about football hooligans, but nobody seems to have the guts to do it.<br/><br/>By the way, this movie is becoming very popular in Russia with the rise in popularity of the Chelsea FC."

","Before he joined EastEnders, I knew the sweary cockney actor for films like Human Traffic and Severance, and of course his many straight-to-DVD releases, EastEnders has given him the opportunity to get away from his usual hard man character, when it comes to his film career, this is the film most people know him for, directed by Nick Lowe (The Business, The Sweeney). Basically Tommy Johnson (Danny Dyer) is a member of a Chelsea hooligan firm, his friends and fellow hooligans are his best friend Rod King (Neil Maskell), hot- tempered Billy Bright (Frank Harper), and young and impulsive members Zeberdee (Roland Manookian) and Raf (Calum MacNab). Tommy's pensioner and veteran grandfather Bill Farrell (EastEnders' Dudley Sutton) is disappointed as Tommy spends his days drinking, using drugs, womanising and fighting, Bill plans to move to Australia with his best friend Albert (John Junkin). Tommy has an epiphany about his lifestyle during a fight with the Tottenham hooligan firm, Tommy, Billy and Rod are arrested for assaulting two Stoke City fans, Chelsea firm leader Harris (Tony Denham) is furious by these actions, especially by Billy's aggressive outbursts. Other things going on include Rod beginning a relationship with court clerk Tamara (Sophie Linfield), she pressures him to skip his weekend meets, and Billy's house being accidentally robbed by Zeberdee and his friend Raff, Billy himself deals with increased loneliness overhearing his irrelevance to Harris, and Bill's friend Albert dies the night before they are due to leave for Australia. Tommy is caught and held hostage by the brother of a girl he picked up at a club, Shian (Michele Hallak), Rod saves him, hitting the man on the head with a cricket bat, the brother turns out also be the brother of the rival Millwall firm's leader, Fred (Tamer Hassan), who is hunting Tommy down. Throughout the various characters encounter a racist taxi driver (EastEnders' Jamie Foreman), this is a subplot recurring. All the fighting culminates in a battle between the Chelsea and Millwall firms, with Tommy severely beaten up, ending up in hospital with Bill who has suffered a heart attack. In the end Tommy remains with the firm, Bill moves to Australia, Billy Bright is imprisoned for seven years, Zeberdee is killed by a drug dealer, this was a dream that Tommy kept being tormented by. Also starring EastEnders' Kara Tointon as Tameka. Dyer as the leading star and narrator certainly serves his purpose as a low-life football hooligan, the other actors do their parts fine as well, there is no real storyline as such, it is really a view into the life of a thug who like to beat people up and loves football, it does not hold back with the violence, so it neither condoning or condemning it, I could not follow everything going on, but overall I found it an average British sports crime drama. Worth watching!"
"jmbellin","8","1","2","3 February 2008"," Pulsating, Violent, Riveting, Darkly Funny
","Many will want to know how this compares to Green Street Hooligans. The two stories are handled quite differently. The Football Factory has almost a black comic feel to it. GSH is really the story of one young man's descent into a violent environment and is an emotional drama. TFF has more of the rhythm of a machine gun, with a, great, very high energy music soundtrack keeping it pulsate along the way.<br/><br/>Perhaps not as emotionally deeply felt as GSH, TFF keeps you in the thoughts and feelings of those in the gang. It makes it much harder to feel empathy for its characters (as each of them are all aware and enjoy the catharticism of the violent lifestyle), yet incredibly you do. The fact that it also is also very funny in an intended ironic way (much in the way that the protagonist in Sunset Boulevard narrates the story already having already been murdered), this film has that same knowing irony that also keeps the film bubbling.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ride in this one."

","As I'm a Nick Love fan some might think that I'm a little bias when it comes to his films, but Football Factory was in my opinion independently one of my favourite British films. Yes OK it has violence, and strong language but that's everyday life!! This movie is all about showing what actually does go on in society today, and proves that not everything is perfect like some people like to think....If anything this film shows what we need to face, violence happens and it's not glorifying this just highlighting it...All the characters are people you see on the streets and meet in your local. Nick Love made every aspect of this film work from the fantastic fight scenes to the individual struggles these men go through alone. I was on edge from the opening scene to the credits at the end, exactly as a film should make you feel. Danny Dyer proved to be perfect for this role, and along with the rest of the cast made it all the more enjoyable."

","This film is absolutely hilarious. And violent. And profane. And loaded with drugs, thieving and general anti-social behavior. If you don't like any of those then steer well clear of this film. Having said that this film is also important. It highlights the amount of hooliganism on the streets of England today. And what it leads to. Its not a majorly flashy film - i think the flashiest camera angles are through cctv points of view, and it didn't have the highest budget. But it is brilliant. Danny Dyer does a great job of showing us his characters position and what he does about it. frank Harper is just a complete lunatic. The rest of the cast are top notch and do the film and storyline justice. And seeing this is adapted from a book by John King it stays true pretty well, and I've read the book so id know.

","Nick Love has to be one of the shoddiest directors working in Britain today. All of his films have a depressing, fatalistic air to them, lacking in decent characters and character intrigue. All of them feel slightly false, in that there's something hollow about them. When you see somebody acting in a Nick Love film, you always feel that they're acting rather than believing in the character.<br/><br/>This is my fourth Love film, following on from THE BUSINESS (poor), OUTLAW (hugely disappointing) and THE SWEENEY (acceptable at best). It's the simplistic story of a football hooligan and the friends and rivals in his life. The film boasts an early, career-making turn from Cockney geezer Danny Dyer, who's frankly annoying in this one, playing alongside the likes of Dudley Sutton and Tamer Hassan.<br/><br/>Love's own script is the worst thing about this. Unsurprisingly he has an air for thuggish-sounding dialogue but the dialogue is just random expletive-filled insults throughout. It's hardly Tarantino, more like a load of juvenile nonsense from somebody with a clear lack of talent. THE FOOTBALL FACTORY is the kind of film that makes you despair for state of the British film industry."

"seaweigh","3","1","3","25 June 2008"," Disappointing
","I stumbled upon the television series: The Real Football Factories. I quickly became a fan of the show and Danny Dyer's personality and narrative skills. Upon researching who Danny Dyer was, I was excited to discover that a Football Factory film had been made and he was the star. Living in America, I knew nothing about the film or its director Nick Love. The synopsis of the movie immediately reminded me of the concept behind Green Street Hooligans, a film I thoroughly enjoyed. Therefore when I finally sat down to watch The Football Factory, I did so with a level of expectation that had already been set by Green Street. Unfortunately, The Football Factory fell well short.<br/><br/>The story is totally undeveloped and lacks any kind of complexity. Throughout the entire movie the character's only means of interacting with each other are by drinking, using drugs, or fighting. After a while this simply becomes annoying... as do the characters. The only exception to this is the grandfather but one has to wonder why he was even included in the movie. He had absolutely no influence on the story and could have been written out all together with no consequence.<br/><br/>The only positive comments I have about this movie are that Frank Harper, Tamer Hassan, and Danny Dyer turn in quality performances. However, this alone is not enough to save the film. By the end of the movie I didn't care who lived and who died. This is a problem since at some point during a film your average movie goer generally finds themselves identifying with someone on the screen or their cause. While watching The Football Factory, I simply felt like I was stuck in a room with a bunch of obnoxious drunks who deserved to have the sh*t kicked out of them.<br/><br/>Skip this one."

","This film dealt with a lot of hard hitting, real and gritty issues. It particularly struck a chord with me since I live so close by to where all this goes on. However I wanted it to focus more on how this type of behaviour isn't right and isn't worth it. There was an element of glorification to it that left me feeling unhopeful to this way of life ever being able to change. Britain is an amazing country to live in, but i wish this aspect of it could be different because it doesn't reflect the majority and is so negative. This film is insightful in that sense as it helps you to understand in more depth why and how the hooliganism occurs. But overall the portrayal of this very real culture frankly leaves me feeling disturbed and concerned!"

The problem with hooligan films in the past is that middle/upper class actors have tried to act like thugs but haven't been very convincing, so it was nice to see this bunch looking quite good and acting well on the whole. Snappy pace and just enough interest to keep you going to the end. Has a slight documentary style, and I can see some foreign audiences struggling with the accents and slang. Not for the faint hearted due to the violence and copious amounts of swearing and numerous drug taking scenes. The end fight scene was a bit disappointing.

","I've been a fan of John King's Football Factory trilogy for many years, following the exploits of Tommy, mark et al and wondered how they'd translate the episodic nature of the lives in a year of the many characters. I was pleased with the result. What could have been a sprawling, lost attempt to translate the book, has turned out a focussed interpretation of the essence of Football Factory. Set over a few weeks in the run up to Milwall v Chelsea in the FA Cup, we look at the lives of the central characters, the drinking, the drugs and casual violence with a relatively sympathetic view of the lives of a number what are currently termed 'chavs' in south west London. Fantastically paced with a storming soundtrack, this film is well worth checking out. My only minor criticism is the disassociation of these characters with football itself, which rather implies that anyone who enjoys the violence isn't a 'real' football fan, which i think unlikely, but hey, don't let that stop you."

","This film was just what the football follower/hooligan has been waiting for. Forget ID, which seemed staged, this is the real thing. Danny Dyer was born to play the part of one of the Chelsea foot soldiers, wrestling with his conscience/paranoia throughout the film and Frank Harper is nasty and believable as the psychotic 'general' of the firm. As in Lock Stock, he doesn't seem like an actor, he is genuinely menacing again here, especially one scene where he winds up one of the youngsters in the group (Coke addict, Zeberdee) before telling him he is pulling his chain just b4 Zeb s***s his pants. The story of the hooligan is told in an occasional voiceover by Dyer which really adds to the atmosphere and the story of the modern day hooligan and is intertwined with the tale of two old war veterans planning their retirement to Australia and the battles they went through in the war to fight for Britain. The story builds towards an FA Cup meeting between Chelsea and Millwall and culminates in an almighty ruck on a plot of disused land in 'Bandit Country'. Many scenes worth a mention and without spoiling it for you, here they are in one word, cricket bat, Magistrates nut, Taxi bore, wheelchair con, bmw bash. Watch the film and work them out, all in all, a football classic although no football is shown throughout the film, such is the way of the hoolie.

Danny Dyer shows he is the cream of British talent playing yet another diverse role while an appearance from Frank Harper adds the needed 'grit' to the film.<br/><br/>Now as a football fan (an English one at that) I have grown up through the 80's and 90's when all the trouble was at its height. As a kid I also went to hundreds of football matched and witnessed the violence first hand. What football factory sets out to show is that these 'firms' don't set out to randomly beat up people in the street, they attend pre-arranged fights between like minded people who might even work together the rest of the time. These are people that love a row, it's not about football, that's just what brings them together and gives them an identity. This film shows the real side of things, not the one portrayed by a clueless media.<br/><br/>Even if you don't like football you must watch this film, its manages to portray things in a way only British film can, it doesn't glamorise anything it just tells it as it is."

Unlike many films of this genre The Football Factory has believable characters that many of us can relate to. This is scary when considering the content of the film.

You won't see fans just watching the football match... No, you'll see only aggression, blood, drugs and fights. On the other hand, there were some funny scenes in the movie.

The movie is told through the eyes of Tommy Johnson, a sound geezer who loves to beat people up on a Saturday, but throughout he is trying to find meanings and answers to his actions which take him on more journeys in the movie. Yes, this movie does tend to glamorise hooliganism, with no holds to its violence and in no way does it try to demoralise it other than showing you the damage conflicted to others, but it is what may even be referred to as a 'cult' classic, Nick Love has dared to go where no other directors have gone before and produced a masterpiece balancing the best of the authentic fights to the deeper more passionate story lines.

","I don't speak any other languages. I should, but I don't. My parents are oriental, I took French when I was in school but like the proverbial Teflon pan, nothing sticks. Of course since I speak English I find it fascinating that there are so many dialects of English. In a way that's why I'm interested in these kinds of movies. Through rapid fire Brit-slang and thick accents I can pickup a handful of words that gives just enough context to understand the meaning. Sometimes not.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see that this movie was produced by Rockstar Games, the nice people who brought us such wholesome Playstation2 games as Grand Theft Auto, Manhunt and State of Emergency. No doubt they had some influence in the level of violence, profanity and vulgarity. Kudos to Rockstar! But strangely enough this game really reminds me of the Getaway, a non-R* game. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Clearly, not being from the UK I'm clueless about this whole street-brawling, drug induced, drunken football culture. So this was an interesting window into the lives of people who live to deal and feel pain. In a way I swell with pity for them and if I ever said that to one of them I would also be swelling from multiple blunt force traumas.<br/><br/>As a film I have to say that it's disjoint in the vain of ""Lock, Stock"" but without a cohesive storyline. The gist of it is about a group of football ""hooligans"" (that just doesn't sound right for a North American to say), preparing for a gang fight with another group of football ""hooligans"". Our main character, Tom, has dream premonitions which trouble him greatly but not enough to change any of this responses or behaviors. Again, pity for these people.<br/><br/>Production quality is substandard. Although clear, the picture shows little of post production and reminds me of an episode of Degrasi. Action sequences are the typical jittery jumping around, undoubtedly used to mask actual violence or injury or just to be cool. The slow motion and upbeat techno music segments are pointless and add little considering the picture quality. And generally the music seems like it's pulled from a video game. In fact in a couple of sequences I hear some tunes from GTA3. Finally, the movie is produced by a game company, is it really necessary to mention ""Playstation 2"" 10 times and SHOW a scene of a guy playing GTA? I think not.<br/><br/>All in all, the subject matter and location would lend itself to a decent film. However, the non-cohesive storyline, poor post-production, and pitiful people we see make this slightly painful to watch. But then again, maybe that's the point."

","Tommy Johnson is a Londoner in his late twenties, whose only attribute is that he likes fighting. Well, OK, he also likes alcohol and sex, but then who doesn't? The Football Factory follows Tommy's adventures with a hooligan firm that supports the Chelsea football club. Most of the time Tommy and his friends (or, as the vaguely sexual term used by these people goes, ""mates"") are high and drunk or either high, drunk and getting their @sses kicked by the fans of rival football teams. <br/><br/>I watched this film and ""Withnail & I"" within a few days of each other.

","Haven't read the book but read many similar on same topic so... Thought a few incidents a bit contrived like the Stoke hooligans just happening to show up at the rest stop. Too much focus on the so-called ""second in command"" of the Chelsea firm.<br/><br/>Even so I thought it got inside the head of the lead guy on why hooliganism grips him but, yeah, could have focused more on the adrenaline rush of violence these guys get off on. Don't really get why granddads were there as the whole WWII vet analogy is just not relevant really. <br/><br/>The fact none of these guys would last two seconds on the mean streets of any inner US ghetto makes what they do seem laughable. I mean, if Millwall and Chelsea supporters want to have a ruck outside of police eyes, why not arrange it any day of the week? Why wait to be drawn in an FA Cup tie and then the police show up and they are all 'fraidy cats, all of a sudden? I don't get it. But that's an aside. <br/><br/>It's worth watching just to hear the dialog alone and how they operate on match day which is fairly accurate (cell phones, spotters, CS gas, attacking pubs, etc.)."

","In my opinion, it's a shame what the director made with that excellent book. Of course it's a hard task to fulfill expectations making an adaption of a book, however, the movie created here is just awful. The overall message of the novel is simply ignored... what is left are some names of the characters and the titles of the sequences. The movie is superficial and gives only half-as*ed hints at deeper meanings presented in the book... If you have read the book already, DO NOT watch this movie... if you want to see a superficial, flat and wannabe-cool movie then go ahead... It's a abuse of otherwise good devices, on the level of film-making, as well literal meanings."
"Termin8","6","0","1","21 March 2007"," Questionable message aside an enjoyable film
","The football factory is not a great film. It is however like most of Nick Loves films really enjoyable in a guilty pleasure kind of way. In its themes off male enjoyment of violence it recalls fight club and the fight sequences carry the same punch in the same impact as the infamous ""angel-face"" sequence in fight club. The film making style owes more to Guy Ritchie however. The films message is questionable , though it makes some points against holiganism it comes to no conclusion. Some may argue it glorifies its characters actions , however none could argue it doesn't glorify its characters. This leaves a bitter taste in the viewers mouth. However aside from that it is great . It features a typically great performance from Dannie ""the next Ray Winstone"" Dyer, an excellent soundtrack (a Nick Love trademark) with great use of yob anthem ""going underground"" as well as more contemporary tracks and surprises like Mogwais atmospheric ""hunted by a freak"". Its funny, violent and undeniably entertaining."
"loza-1","8","0","1","27 February 2007"," It Almost Gets to the Essence of Soccer Hooliganism
","There are one or two things that this film does not get right. The ""firm"" of Chelsea receive the news that they have drawn Millwall in the cup. For those who do not know much about English soccer, let me tell you that Millwall fans have had a reputation for violent conduct since as far back as I can remember (the mid 1960s), and Chelsea fans have been known to get into a brawl or two on occasions! Here is a minor point. We have the Chelsea fans liberally using rhyming slang, (from London's East End), whereas Chelsea's supporters are predominantly from North London, where I have never ever heard rhyming slang used in my eighteen years living there.<br/><br/>The other thing I found wrong with this film is that there were no scenes at the matches. (This may have been caused by budget constraints.) And no one seems to talk much about football: they only talk about taking on Millwall's firm. This reinforces the popular misconception that football hooligans care nothing about football, and that they are not real fans. They ARE real fans. They DO care about their team and about football.<br/><br/>Those minor faults aside, I found that the motivation for hooliganism - that it is fun and there is an adrenaline rush - was absolutely correct.<br/><br/>Dudley Sutton was great as always, and the star of the show was Frank Harper. (Yes, there really are hooligans his age.) I found the practical jokes funny All in all I would recommend this film and have given it a high mark.<br/><br/>If you are wondering what a ""sigh"" is, as in Frank Harper saying to other characters, ""You SIGH!"", I am reliably informed that it is short for ""Simple Simon."""

","Football factory was an amazing look into the minds and actions of thugs. It was something that had to be perfect, and of course was. The ending was amazing, with that guy being Zee, and shows exactly how the dream kind of worked out to be right, and also told us exactly what the whole dealer beating was leading up to. This was good, as it also shows the way that people live in this area of the class system. It was not just about football hooliganism, it looked at the way the class system has failed lots of people. It also showed a classic insight into how certain people are attracted to this way of life. Football factory should be compulsory viewing in my opinion."

","i saw this movie last night and as a football fan it was a revelation to me to see the pathological side of supporting a team become self destructing and yet so fulfilling. That was the whole idea of the movie - we get to see how the life of a young Brit is destroyed by his deviant fanaticism for his beloved Chelsea until he is close to embrace death and yet his is not capable to make the wise choice of leaving all that behind. And that is because the urban jungle he struggles in has nothing else to offer.<br/><br/>i think the movie is well made and although it doesn't live up to predecessors like lock stock, snatch or mean machine, it is still very enjoyable, especially for those who understand what football really means in Europe and how easy it is to pass the thin line between fanaticism and hooliganism in a stadium."

","At long last a decent film about one of the most misunderstood sub cultures of recent times...the football hooligan.<br/><br/>The film follows four Chelsea headhunters as they endeavour to maintain their status as the number one firm in England (they were not ever number 1 by they way) the ultimate climax to the film is a meeting with Millwall which i have to admit is executed with stark realism - the sense of anticipation, the bouncing around, the shouting which all carries on for a few minutes before anyone is actually game enough to get stuck in first. There is all the usuall moral and anti-social questions in amongst a fairly simplistic narrative that follows a slightly awkward direction at times. I also got confused as to where some elements of the sub-plot was actually going.<br/><br/>All in all it's a treat for all you old school out there that now have mortgages and kids and look back on these times with myth and fondness.

However, rather than shuffling off down this dull, rocky road, the film treats us to a well thought out and tightly plotted story, featuring believable characters, all of which possessing a tendency to turn into complete maniacs whenever football is thrown into the equation. The fight sequences are brutal, blood soaked and expertly shot, whilst the intelligent character development and insight offered into each of them contributes further substance to the overall viewing experience.

","A rush of blood to the head? Coldplay didn¹t know what they were singing about, Chris Martin should watch The Football Factory for the ultimate in head blowing, jaw clenching, white knuckle ride of a film.  This film has all the elements to make up a night of riveting viewing, from though provoking characters, witty dialogue to energized music to watch boys batter each other.<br/><br/>To begin there¹s Tommy, fast approaching 30 and not a clue what to do with his sad little life, only thing he¹s clinging onto is the next big meet and Billy Bright the foul mouthed, bad tempered geezer who lost the ability to engage his brain a long time ago, he¹s only comfortable using his fists. Rod who does a stellar performance in a restaurant, acts as a perfect side kick to Tommy, Bill Farrell the perfect gentleman from a bygone era and Harris the mean-faced leader who could have Vinnie Jones for breakfast, plays the distant yet commanding leader.<br/><br/>But I like the young kid who plays Zebberdee, a scaly living like vermin in the depths of South London, this is all credit to the acting as it must be difficult to play someone who is so detrimental to society and has very little redeeming features. Credit must be given to all the actors as they all deliver stellar performances in what must be the most unglamorous locations. There isn¹t one performance I would say was weak as they all hold the audiences attention and gage us into what they are doing and saying. the violence and fashion is very realistic.<br/><br/>
To sum up, the hooligans are like scabs of society, a group of people we all want to forget about when we¹re tucked into our little Semis but know they exist living uncomfortably alongside us. the film was more than just football, its about loyalty, a sense of belonging a family in this dysfunctional place we live in. this film speaks to all of us dissatisfied youths living in la la land fast approaching 30 or even 40, looking for a parallel life where we are richer, better looking and have the intellect of Hawkins.  Football Factory deserves to be a massive hit, not just for the excellent acting, or the brilliant dialogue or the thumping soundtrack but because the film is of our time revealing the layers, which make up Blair¹s Britain where friendships are everything."
