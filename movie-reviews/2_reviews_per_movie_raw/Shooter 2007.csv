"Surecure","8","303","413","13 March 2007"," Recipe for a fantastic, intelligent action film
","If you were to take the best parts of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series (Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger, Sum of All Fears) and mixed in the best parts of the only good Rambo film (First Blood) you would end up with something akin to Shooter. Shooter is a smart, engaging and all out enjoyable action flick that never pulls its punches and always surprises you when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Mark Whalberg plays the role of Bob Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who quit the army following a disastrous mission where his best friend and spotter is killed when they are left behind. Three years later he is hired by a Colonel (played with gusto by Danny Glover) to figure out how a suspected assassin is going to attempt to kill the President from over a mile away, a shot that few could make. Swagger figures out how it is going to be done and is asked to supervise locating the sniper on site. But on the day of the supposed assassination, Swagger is set up with the assassination attempt that kills a visiting diplomat. Swagger is then left on the hunt while trying to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>Shooter twists and turns with an elaborate conspiracy that is very convincing, though of course the writers wimp out and take the cheap road of drawing international oil into the plot (can't writers think of an original plot device?). However, this is hardly a drawback since the rest of the film is solid as a rock. The film really puts you into the shoes of a sniper and gives an impressive overview of the mindset that it takes to be as accurate as someone of the character of Swagger.<br/><br/>The only real distractions in the film would be Elias Koteas, whose psycho performance is heavy-handed and does not fit the film, and Kate Mara who has little to do throughout the film but appear upset or in distress. The film could have done without either characters or their respective actors. As well, some of the character relations seem forced at time, particularly in the relationship between Michael Peña's character of Nick Memphis and his FBI confidante Lourdes, played by Rhona Mitra. Their almost effortless camaraderie comes off as less than convincing.<br/><br/>Overall, Shooter certainly delivers as an entertaining thrill-ride that is certainly not dumbed down in the least. If you want an intelligent action film with lots of impressive gun play and several elaborate, thrilling action sequences to boot, Shooter is right up your alley and will not disappoint. 7.6 out of 10"
"chris-976-332846","10","49","61","21 June 2011"," Surprisingly Good!
","I watched this film, expecting to be let down. However it really did tick most of the boxes for me. I found it engaging and entertaining all the way through, for me a film where you want to watch through to the end because you WANT to watch, not out of a masochistic urge to ""find out what happens"". Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. Although there are a few ""no chance"" moments in the film as there always are with these type of films, the majority of it was for me within the realms of possibility. The soundtrack was also excellent and melded well with the action on screen. Both myself and my Fiancée enjoyed this film greatly. I can't really think of any negatives for this film and can only recommend it."
"StevenAWebb","8","109","148","13 March 2007"," Engaging, worth seeing.
","I had the opportunity to catch an advance screening of this film the other day. Similarities to other projects aside, I was impressed by the use of some of the newer military technology involved. The film was both engaging and entertaining, and Mark Wahlberg did a very good job of portraying the character in all of his idiosyncrasies. It was good to see Danny Glover again as I have not had the opportunity to see him in any films of late. His character was not exactly multidimensional but I would assume that it was what the writing called for, and certainly different from the one he portrays in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, not much comedy here. Now if I could only get a hold of the script... Needless to say, my wife and I enjoyed the movie very much and would definitely recommend to go and see it."
"hitchikingalaxy","10","72","100","14 May 2008"," Very good at illustrating the systemic aspects of Imperialism
","I was quite skeptical at watching the film, and didn't even get around to watching it until just last night(5/13/08), well over a year after it came out. What I saw was a pretty good political analysis as to what the major cover ups are and the cause of this Imperialist oil war.<br/><br/>Yes, they do sprinkle a big ole plop of conspiracy theory, notably burying the snipers who did JFK in the desert. The line, ""I still have the shovel"" was quite amusing. Yes, the protagonist is a superman with the penchant for arriving in the nick of time and the ability to kill everyone. Chuck Norris isn't as bad as this guy.<br/><br/>What I found to be impressive though was that the movie placed the blame on a consortium of haves. It did not narrowly define exactly who the enemy is, so much as allow for a broader condemnation of capitalism and imperialism. The FBI agent sympathetic to the hero even goes so far as to wear a Che t-shirt.<br/><br/>So, when the aptly named Swagger tells Sarah Fenn, his buddies ex-wife, that the reason he took on the mission was because he fell for patriotism, we are given a quick condemnation of the flag waving jingoism that the US is trying to use to recruit young people for their imperialist wars. The WMD's are brought up, and are quite resonant in the context of a system without morality and only haves and have-nots.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the film."
"thecrow22","10","291","435","24 March 2007"," Amazing
","I came into this film with loads of skepticism, but I came out feeling completely the opposite. Shooter takes you into the life of retired Marine Scout Sniper Bob Lee Swagger, who retired after a mission went completely wrong. He is called back to give information as to how someone would be able to kill the president from over a mile away. He ends up being framed for the attempted murder of the president, and the murder of an archbishop of Ethopia, and must prove his innocence, at any cost.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg does a perfect job of portraying a detached veteran who has no respect for the government, and really brings the character to you. He is backed up by an outstanding Michael Pena and Danny Glover who add to the film like no one else could. The only real complaint is that Kate Mara's character, the widowed wife of Swagger's best friend seems to only play two emotions, distressed, or hysterical, and it does get annoying, though she plays the part well. Elias Kosteas did a good job playing Jack Payne, a borderline psychotic government agent, though at times his part seems over the top. <br/><br/>All in all this film blew me away and I couldn't have loved it more. Anyone who is into action movies of any kind definitely needs to see this movie."
"jpanyard","8","225","337","23 March 2007"," Wahlberg may be next Bruce Willis
","Mark Wahlberg might be the Bruce Willis of the new generation. His taciturn Bobby Swagger is perfect. The action is basically nonstop and very gritty. Bobby is a sniper who has retired to the mountains after being screwed by the government in an event which finds his sidekick dead. After being set up, he is stone cold killer. Think Jason Bourne as someone who remembers his past is really p.o.'d about it. The acting is good all around, with Glover and Beatty as bad guys you love to hate. Underlying all this a morality tale about what this country and its government have become. Many situations, of course, stretch the imagination , but watching a sense of honor prevail, no matter how briefly, is worth the price of admission. No Oscar nominations here, but a big bundle of money for the producers will be no surprise."
"ThatMonkey","8","203","311","23 March 2007"," Still Invincible
","I was surprised in many ways by shooter. #1, I was surprised by the release. I follow movies and I didn't hear about this title until early this year. #2, I was amazed by Marks ability to sell me on his acting skills. #3, By the fact that the most established actors in this title, Ned and Danny may have given career killing performances. I think Tony Todd and Stephen Root would have been solid choices, but my guess is the two poor performances were bought for name recognition.<br/><br/>To me this had Eastwood written all over it. At times I thought I was watching Line of Fire at others Unforgiven, but in the end it was just really good entertainment, much like The Bourne movies.<br/><br/>I think it's worth the watch and the story although not new was presented in a fresh manner. This one will go in my collection when available. I'm sure it will have a host of deleted scenes and alternate endings.<br/><br/>Solid film!"
"DICK STEEL","8","104","161","5 April 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Shooter
","Never mess with someone who can drop you with his gun from miles away. Snipers somehow has this aura of mystique and sexiness associated with the motto of ""one shot, one kill"", as exhibited in movies like Enemy at the Gates, or memorable war characters such as in Saving Private Ryan. In Shooter, this gets demystified for a while, hitting home that not only should one be gifted with the pulling of the trigger from incredible distance, a sniper is also a master mathematician, having to compute the trajectory of the round with factors of humidity, wind direction, angle etc just to hit the target.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg stars as Bob Lee Swagger, whom director Antoine Fuqua makes him literally walk with a swagger in all the silhouetted slow motion shots. A battle hardened veteran with ghosts from the past (don't they all), he gets tempted back to assist the authorities in order to feed his patriotic adrenaline, only to find himself screwed and framed for a treasonous crime he did not commit. It's cat and mouse as prey becomes hunter, and tries to exact justice and at the same time, to try and prove his innocence. Expect the usual guns, explosions, and plenty of blood and gore.<br/><br/>Shooter plays off like an urban Rambo meeting The Fugitive, only this time Dr Richard Kimble has biceps the size of melons and fights back with deadly accuracy from his rifle. He runs from the authorities, firmly put as the scheming villains involved in shady deals and the existence of a covert group of greed ala X-Files, one of whom is played by Danny Glover, in a rare turn of alignment to the dark side. No self-respecting beefcake wannabe can do without some DIY operation scene to keep alive, or some montage in gathering and making new weapons (pipe bombs, napalm anyone?), and half the time I was wondering about Mark Wahlberg being the quintessential new generation action hero.<br/><br/>Gone are the days when Hollywood action movie were ruled by the Stallone-Schwarzenegger- VanDamme trio, and surprisingly there are no permanent beefcakes who can readily step into and fill the void. Wahlberg has been slowly inching his way in my opinion, though Marky Mark's filmography of The Italian Job, the Planet of the Apes remake, The Perfect Storm and the more recent Four Brothers, do suggest that more should be done to cement this status, hence Shooter. I can't wait for his Brazilian Job to hit the screens, though that one plays more like an Ocean's Eleven rather than the individual one-man-saves-the-world action hero type. The Departed was a vulgar bit role, so that doesn't count.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to directing action movies, or movies with the hero caught up against unfair odds. From Training Day to Tears of the Sun, you can see earlier influences creep their way into Shooter, making it a little familiar territory visited. There are many sweeping shots used to try and epic-ize the movie, and set action sequences take priority, reducing character development to the token time available between scenes, and sometimes at the expense of plausibility.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was fun to watch, as Michael Pena (World Trade Center, Crash) almost stole the show with his rookie FBI character being caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and almost against his training, wishes and protocol, forms and becomes an important ally for Wahlberg's Swagger. The woman folk however get relegated to backseat roles, as per the usual Fuqua movies with Eva Mendes, Keira Knightley and Monica Belluci. Don't expect Kate Mara or Rhona Mitra to do much. As for the rest, they are your token cardboard characters, there to chew the scene.<br/><br/>Shooter is an action fan's fodder, and it is nothing more than a guilt trip watching a cowboy of a hero mopping up the town's scum, exactly in the way we like to see justice served - without remorse, exacting, and served extremely cold. A satisfying actioner with the usual thrills and spills."
"johnslegers","8","30","42","17 September 2009"," Entertaining action film with controversial viewpoints
","Although not accurate all the way, this film is one of the more realistic action thrillers I've seen. It's one of the few films where the main character actually spends a lot of time taking care of just two gun shot wounds (without vital organs being hit), one of the few films that puts governmental corruption in a more or less correct perspective, one of the few films where the lone hero needs a sidekick to help him with the planning, etc. On top of that, the film is entertaining from beginning to end and character motives are believable.<br/><br/>But then again.... this film is not for everyone. Left wing supporters are likely to be offended by its pro-gun message. American right wing supporters are likely to be offended by the strong anti-US government viewpoints clearly expressed in this film. Pro-constitution anti-federal government paleoconservatives and right wingers outside of the US without an in depth knowledge of sniper rifles are probably the only ones to enjoy this film to the fullest. And boy oh boy, how little are they in number... which probably explains why this film did not become the blockbuster hit it could have been."

","finally, a movie in theaters WORTH seeing!!!! i just saw ""Shooter"" and i was thoroughly entertained. the plot kept me intrigued from beginning to end. mark wahlberg is fantastic... he's like a modern day McGuyver, but better looking and more sarcastic. his character is cunning and smart. wahlberg excels in playing characters who are determined to make an impact. i'm not a huge fan of action movies, but this movie was so packed with plot that i just kept moving along with it. i bet most of the naysayers of the film are going to be people who believe every word their government tells them. yes, this film depicts government officials in a bad light, but what or who doesn't? i'm sure in reality it's much worse. don't let political beliefs interfer with seeing this film... it's a good time no matter what side you are on. the screenplay was well-written, excluding ONE, minute one-liner about anna nicole smith marrying for love which was obviously written before her death. (plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it's intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you'll be impressed with wahlberg's character... go see for yourself!!"

","It has always been one of the great mistakes of militaries around the world, to recruit the best young men and train them to kill ruthlessly. Some become so proficient at their task, as to glean the admiration of ambitious and callous individuals who will then use these human weapons for any purpose necessary. For the film student, this scenario is not new, but has become a repeatable staple for movie directors whenever they need intrigue, drama and action. The list of films who's name resembles, "" Marksman, Sniper, Assassin, Killer, Agent, Mercenary, Machanic, Sanction or just plain Liquidator."" is as long as your arm. The only difference here is the title has been shorten to ""Shooter."" In this story our hero, Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is an Ex-Iraq era Marine sniper, now retired and reputed to be the very best at his art is once again recruited to serve his country. A very sincere military Officer, Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) convinces him to help protect the President of the United States. Convinced, Swagger details the 'where and how' to the Colonel and his men, only to discover, they are not what they appear and the Marine finds himself the target. On the run, he must now evade a nationwide manhunt, clear his name and find the truth behind the deception. Along the way, he discovers an ally in a rookie F.B.I. agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Peña) who also becomes a wanted fugitive. Based on the novel by Steven Hunter the fast action film includes notable Ned Beatty and Elias Koteas as Jack Payne.

"snow0r","7","16","23","3 November 2007"," Honour. Duty. Betrayal. Cliché.
","Shooter opens with Swagger (Wahlberg) in the middle of a failing black-op in Ethiopia. His spotter is killed, and he's left for dead by the agency that sent him in, leaving him to somehow escape the situation on his own. Cut to 3 years later, and Marky Mark is set up in a ranch in the snowy mountains in a remote location, sporting an awful haircut, and owning perhaps the best dog in the world. His reclusive existence is interrupted by Colonel Johnson (Glover), who arrives with a mysterious offer that he just can't refuse...<br/><br/>It sounds a bit...obvious, doesn't it? For a man who's been betrayed by his government once before, Wahlberg falls for Glover's dubious plan a little too easily. And it doesn't even seem like he's trying to conceal the duplicitous nature of the operation. Glover plays his role like Nosferatu in a suit; I half expected him to bite into Wahlberg's neck, although he obviously couldn't find the time in between his evil-caricature gestures and husky whispering. Taking the bait, Swagger sets himself up for quite a fall, and, luckily for us, quite an enjoyable film. Cue the government conspiracy and the one-man-killing-machine's mission to reveal the truth...<br/><br/>During his quest to clear his name, Wahlberg finds allies in the form of rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis (well played by Michael Pena) and his former spotters' girlfriend Sarah, played by Kate Mara, and these two partnerships affect the film in quite different ways. When Swagger is teamed up with Memphis, Shooter plays out like an action-heavy buddy movie, but when Swagger's placed in the care of Sarah and the movie's romantic dramatic sub-plot is gestured at, it slows down awkwardly. We know Marky Mark has to recover from his bullet-wounds somewhere, but perhaps it could have been the recovery that was suggested instead of the awkward forbidden romance scenes that this pairing generates. The rest of the supporting cast are generally good, although a special mention should go to Elias Koteas for his role as Glover's oversexed supervillain henchman, who provides a great deal of sex-fiend-caricature entertainment. That being said, Wahlberg's presence is missed and the film appears to jar awkwardly and slow down without him. Without his moral outrage and willingness to shoot his way through his problems, the movie loses its momentum. While it handles similar issues to the Bourne franchise (government hunter becomes hunted) and attempts to make the same sort of contemporary political statements, Shooter doesn't quite have the same sort of grittiness. Instead, its polished look, complete with lush landscapes and Fuqua's sun-soaked direction, seems to nod continuously in the direction of Michael Bay. However, that's not a bad thing. The movie is very set-piece oriented, and Swagger's gung-ho approach keeps things moving forward at a relatively exciting pace. <br/><br/>The only problem is that it never really seems like Swagger's in any real danger, despite the fact that he's being chased by pretty much every law enforcement agency in America (social comment, perhaps?). This makes the film quite predictable, its sequences and dialogue clichéd, and its conclusion pretty much an obvious inevitability, but if you just sit back and accept it for what it is, you'll find Shooter an enjoyable, action-packed movie that's worth a look."
"Buddy-51","6","55","95","1 April 2007"," well-worn storyline with some refreshing elements
","Though little more than a strung-together collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clichés, ""Shooter"" provides a veritable feast for conspiracy-theory paranoiacs and a decent enough time at the movies for the rest of us.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, an embittered ex-marine gunnery sergeant who's been living a hermitlike existence ever since he and his sharpshooter buddy were left to perish on an Ethiopian hillside by the American forces that had sent them on the mission in the first place. After three years holed up in the wilderness of Wyoming with no one but his devoted pooch to keep him company, Swagger is coaxed out of retirement by the FBI to help foil a planned assassination of the President of the United States. When Swagger discovers at the last minute that he is actually being set up as the fall guy for the killing, he barely escapes with his life and spends the rest of the movie dodging the authorities while attempting to clear his name and bring the true culprits to justice.<br/><br/>Wahlberg, all brooding stoicism and macho-man swagger (pardon the pun), continues his run of tough guy roles in this film, though one wishes he would return to the more nuanced, multi-layered portrayals he managed to put forth in movies like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Three Kings."" As the woman who befriends Swagger, the attractive and talented Kate Mara has considerably more screen time in this film than she did in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but far less worthy material to work with. The most compelling performance is by Michael Pena as the low-level FBI agent who believes Swagger is innocent of the crime and who winds up joining forces with Swagger to uncover the conspiracy. The Average Joe demeanor that Pena brings to the character provides a proper counterbalance to Wahlberg's strutting self-confidence and superhuman athleticism. Danny Glover seems to be phoning in much of his performance here as the leader of the covert FBI cabal, and Ned Beatty does his best as a stereotypically smarmy senator who's up to his ears in venality and corruption.<br/><br/>The plot often doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it is easy for a layperson to get lost in all the arcane machinations that come flying fast and loose off the screen. Still, the screenplay does a nice job fitting the pieces of its puzzle together, merging the two story lines that run along parallel tracks for the first half into a unified whole at about the midway point. The action scenes are strikingly well done, even though they often sacrifice verisimilitude and plausibility for mass explosions and preposterously lopsided gun battles.<br/><br/>The movie makes a lot of grand speeches at the end about governmental corruption and what it truly means to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, but ""Shooter"" is designed to be a generic thriller not a big-think social drama. And, on those terms only, the movie succeeds more often than it fails."
"the-movie-guy","10","36","65","23 March 2007"," Shooter puts you in the shoes of a sniper
","(My Synopsis) Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a former Marine scout sniper who had the ability to hit a target from a mile away, leaves the Corps after a mission goes terribly wrong. Swagger has become a cynical American Marine who believes that he was betrayed by his country. What Swagger didn't know was that he was on a secret mission working for a black-ops government organization with their own agenda about what America really needs. Swagger is contacted by retired Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells him that his country needs his special knowledge and expert skills as a sniper to stop an assassination attempt on the President. Swagger doesn't want to work for these guys,but his patriotism for his country makes him do it. Unfortunately, for Swagger this is the same black-ops group that left him for dead before. And as usual, they set him up and double-cross him again. Now the whole country thinks he was the one who tried to kill the President. To prove his innocence, Swagger must find these people and learn the truth and take out his own revenge. <br/><br/>(My Comment) The film actually puts you in the shoes of a sniper under fire and shows how good he has to be not only as a marksman, but also in the face of danger. The movie doesn't pull any punches when he kills his targets from his long range position. The whole film is exciting and will keep you wondering what is going to happen next. There are several twists and turns on the conspiracy that seem plausible. However, I don't think the writers should have used oil as the old stand by as the reason for the mission. The movie was meant to entertain the audience, and it accomplished its mission. The two hours went by so fast, you will not even notice. There are some things that are hard to believe, but it is only a movie. Enjoy the thrilling action packed sequences and the beautiful scenery. The special effects are spectacular and awesome.

"chrisklecker","4","53","101","16 July 2007"," Directionless, without substance, story and soul
","Shooter is the essence of a soulless movie bent on nothing more than pushing the horrific profession of a ""sniper"" onto the audience to illustrate just how incredible an assassin they make. You have an interesting plot line from the start, ""two snipers caught in a domestic and international war with no rules"", however the movie soon turns into a biased anti-government knockoff that is bent on showing conspiracies and crooked politicians.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, a ex-sniper special forces operative who just lost his friend/partner during a mission in Ethiopia. He retreats to the mountains and is approached by Danny Glover (Col. Issac Johnson) to tell them how a sniper could hit the President so they could stop a potential sniper they think is about to assassinate the president. Bob agrees, gets double-crossed, finds Pena (FBI agent Nick Memphis) tells him he's innocent and runs off ala John Rambo to seek revenge on those who wronged him.<br/><br/>The first five minutes are actually not bad, but then the movie goes downhill fast and when Michael Pena makes his first appearance. One must question what the director is thinking as Pena kicks the dirt in a rather poor attempt to be a ""rookie, no-brains"" FBI agent who later turns out to be an easily trained army commando.<br/><br/>The bottom line is Shooter was marred from the start. No real direction with the plot, no clear message, and a complete mis-use of some big name actors that have already proved they were excellent actors before starring in this sorry excuse for a movie. What is more interesting is what some new-comers to movies would think of these actors if Shooter was the first movie they saw, never realizing that's Ned Beatty from Deliverance, that's Danny Glover with one hell of a portfolio, and Mark Walhberg from The Departed and The Perfect Storm and last but definitely not least Michael Pena from Training Day. All of these actors have more talent than Shooter can provide and it's pathetic having to watch them squirm through the shallow plot line and cheesy dialog. I actually cringed when Ned Beatty shouts to Mark, ""I'm a US Senator"".<br/><br/>Shooter fails in more ways than one. The only thing it doesn't fail at is being somewhat of a no-brainer popcorn entertainment which is even debatable for me. In my humble opinion if you want a sniper movie with more intelligence, better dialog and solid plot, watch Sniper with Tom Berenger and Billy Zane."
"cptn-beeble","1","81","169","25 March 2007"," Pathetic... Simply Pathetic
","*BEWARE OF SPOILERS* _ _ I had the misfortune to see this with my brother, and had to fight the overwhelming urge to just cut and run like the commanders did on Bob Lee in the beginning of this film... or like Mark's sense apparently did when he took the role. From horrible scripting to absurd situations and a gaggle of gratuitous explosions, this film tanked from the beginning. I was misled to think that this was a film setting of the book ""The Shooter"" but in fact, it wasn't, it so very much was not. The first thing I laughed at (that wasn't part of the AMAZING wit built into the script) was this amazingly pointless scene of at least 30 seconds of watching Marky Mark put on sunglasses and stroll away in slow motion from an equally pointless interchange with Danny Glover. Apparently Antoine Fuqua has a little fetish for the way Mr Wahlberg walks... Also, what is up with Danny Glovers mouth, it sounded like he had braces or throat cancer, or both, all he could manage was this whispering, cotton-mouthed mumbling, weird! But from there we get things like that the bad-guy fat-ass cop that is the first guy to run after and catch up to Gunny(jeeez!!), a veteran scout sniper , followed by scenes involving no less than 15 black helicopters swarming over Philadelphia, 2 obnoxious 'field medic' type scenes, a really super car chase, random nipple shots from one of the two 'babes', more bullets, techno-babble, and squibs than I can count, an evil Russian in a wheelchair, and then some more scenes with helicopters... the list goes on and on. All this culminates in about three different endings and a final scene with all the bad guys drinking cocktails and laughing evilly at the sheer magnitude of their malevolence... The story was shallow and aimless, the script was pitiful, the acting was sub-par (except Pena, kudos on not being as crappy) And worst of all, it took itself seriously. The only thing this movie was missing was Joe Don Baker, but, hey, at least we had Ned Beatty. As Nick Memphis so accurately put it 'This is Ridiculous!'"
"Andresen","5","20","36","25 March 2007"," Stuff Gits Blowed Up Real Good
","Shooter is a movie where Stuff Gits Blowed Up Real Good. If you're in the mood for a b-grade action flick where stuff gits blowed up and the cartoon character bad guys git their heads blowed off, this one is passable. You could find a better mindless action flick, but this one will do in a pinch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Shooter is filled with clumsy, ham-handed attempts to be politically relevant. The film takes the bold political stance that it's wrong to kill an entire village filled with men women and children for personal gain. It goes way out on a limb and says that one should never assassinate the Archbishop of Etheopia. But the absolute worst crime imaginable is to kill a man's dog. Heads will roll. Literally.<br/><br/>The Evil Shadow Government Conspiracy is, of course, Republican. Really Republican. So Republican that they have portraits of every single Republican president in history proudly displayed on the walls of Evil Shadow Government Conspiracy Headquarters. Everywhere you look, George HW Bush or Ronald Reagan or Herbert Hoover or Teddy Roosevelt is watching your every move. Even William Howard Taft glares contemptuously from On High. Of course the Mister Big Evil Puppetmaster gives lip service to the notion that the Evil Shadow Government Conspiracy is neither Republican nor Democrat, but come on. William Howard Freaking Taft? Who's kidding whom? <br/><br/>In this movie, Marky Mark is accused of a crime he didn't commit. To exonerate himself, he commits hundreds of other crimes which ought to be worth a few thousand years in jail, but which instead earn him a wink wink nudge nudge from the Attorney General of the United States. After all, they did kill his dog.<br/><br/>Marky Mark plots a Presidential Assassination. He steals trucks. He assaults law enforcement officials. He causes dozens of automobile accidents. He resists arrest. He blows stuff up. He practices medicine without a license. He points a loaded high-powered weapon at the Attorney General of the United States. He destroys a government helicopter. He manufactures and detonates high explosive weapons. He accesses top secret government files. He destroys several expensive houses. He kills dozens of hapless dupes of the Evil Shadow Government Conspriacy. Even though he himself was once a hapless dupe of the Evil Shadow Government Conspiracy, and for all he knows the people he killed are hardworking joes with girlfriends in medical school and lovable furry dogs at home. All of this is BEFORE he murders a sitting US Senator, the Senator's chief of staff and several key assistants.<br/><br/>Marky Mark's accomplices are no better. An FBI guy goes AWOL and blows up more than his share of stuff and kills a fair number of bodyguards. The girlfriend pumps three bullets into the chest of an unarmed man. Literally. His arm was three feet away from the rest of his body. Why the FBI guy and Miss Thang aren't in orange jumpsuits by the end of the film is beyond me.<br/><br/>And how these people get a personal audience with the Attorney General is incomprehensible. If you were accused of being, say, the Unabomber, could you arrange a pow-wow with the USAG? Oh, and by the way, bring the weapon you confiscated from the assassination scene.<br/><br/>The kicker? All of Marky Mark's illegal activity is justified because the Evil Shadow Government Conspiracy acted UNCONSTITUTIONALLY, even though the Attorney General of The United States can't think of a single crime with which to charge anyone.

","I knew nothing of this film in advance other than it starred Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised how good it started out and set in Philadelphia, too!!! Although the action was violent and graphic, it had an energy and flow that was mesmerizing. This was going to be a good night. This film would be special and as good as the Bourne movies. The characters were developed well, Wahlberg's unique style and quirkiness was coming through, perhaps the next Bruce Willis. I cared about these characters. The quality of the filming was top notch, the angles excellent, often the film was vivid. The story was humming along, an assassination conspiracy slowly developing and unraveling. Then just beyond the half way point the movie crashed. BANG. The plot line made little sense, a tiresome anti-American film. Ho Hum. Over acting and over reaching by Ned Beatty and Danny Glover. Beatty a cartoon character, and Glover so over the top and implausible in any position of authority my head started to throb. What did they do? They ruined a film with such promise and destroyed it with a half baked story line that just appeared to take shots at the government. Where was the press? Want country are we in? The FBI is the Keystone Kops? Death to any intrigue. All believability gone.......a night ruined. A shame too, and almost criminal, because it had such a strong start, such a solid feel to it. To be reduced to the keystone cops with evil men so shallow no one could take them seriously. Oh, there may indeed be evil men in our government, but Glover's character would not have lasted one week. I love Ned Beatty, I hate his performance. If he wants to do a caricature of a powerful clandestine operative, then do a sequel to Hopscotch and make it a comedy. And the final scene was so dreadful, so implausible, that is was the perfect ending to this miserable failure of a film."

","When you have crafted films in the same vein there is simply no reason to allow huge gaffs to appear. The Bourne series so far has the 'violent hero struggling to survive in a web of intrigue and deception' covered without the glaring mistakes that make The Shooter an embarrassment to watch. Gunshot wounds and torture wounds that disappear; an inability to remember a simple license plate number without resorting to a mobile phone camera, a self-healing process utterly devoid of any medical basis whatsoever and-laughably- apparently the requirement to include the Coriolis effect in a sniper's calculations. ""Sure I'll sign up for anything without even needing to see ID or do some background checks"". I appreciate the editor probably had their work cut out for them dealing with this rubbish but the continuity was shockingly bad. And as for the ending? Utter garbage. Marky running around in a ridiculous white chicken suit was the highlight. If the director added a couple of ""L""s to his surname it would make more sense.<br/><br/>So many glowing reviews for this dire bilge are a good answer to why they keep churning out such rubbish. Watch Bourne instead. 2 points for the poor editor making the best of a bad job."

","If you read Stephen Hunter's absorbing conspiracy thriller ""Point of Impact,"" you may have issues with the cinematic adaptation from ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua and ""The Devil's Advocate"" scenarist Jonathan Lemkin who also penned the story for ""Lethal Weapon 4."" Fuqua and Lemkin left a lot out of the movie that made Hunter's novel both compelling and suspenseful. Primarily, the time that the film took place has been altered drastically from Vietnam where our hero was a sniper to a hush hush massacre in Africa where hundreds of innocent women and children were slaughtered without a qualm for oil and money. ""Shooter"" is the title that Paramount Pictures replaced Hunter's ""Point of Impact,"" and Mark Wahlberg plays the steely-eyed protagonist, former Marine Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger, who is duped into working with a patriotic organization assigned to protect the president. Actually, what these devious dastards, led by a smarmy Danny Glover, are setting up is a frame to fit the unsuspecting Swagger. An African archbishop is assassinated in public view while receiving a medal from POTUS, and Bob Lee—who came along to watch the ceremony—makes a miraculous escape. FBI Agent Nicholas Memphis collides with him, and Bob Lee not only disarms him adroitly but also steals his official Bureau cruiser to make his getaway. Eventually, these two will team up, but the dastards who tried to kill Bob Lee start to tie off any loose ends, and they kill the uniformed policeman who shot Bob Lee during the assassination in Baltimore. Although it isn't as faithful as it could have been to Hunter's impressive novel with its plethora of history, ""Shooter"" still qualifies as a polished, well-made, actioneer. Fuqua knows how to orchestrate these films, and he has proved that he knows what he's doing with ""The Replacement Killers,"" ""The Equalizer,"" and ""The Magnificent Seven."" Fuqua's audio commentary on the DVD is exemplary, and you will learn a lot about nothing only the movie but also some of the things that happened during the production. Since he doesn't mention Stephen Hunter's name once during his commentary, Fuqua must not have been familiar with it. Ned Beatty of ""Deliverance"" fame makes a first-rate villain."
"ccthemovieman-1","5","30","63","30 June 2007"," The Good & Bad Of 'Shooter'
","THE GOOD - What a great start! The first half hour of this is outstanding and the first hour very good. It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the ""Bourne"" movies (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"") you should like this and that was the case with me.....for the first hour. Mark Walhber's ""Bob Lee Swagger"" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. Yes, he's macho, intelligent, a thoughtful, patriotic guy, etc.. The scenes where he is eluding everyone in Philadelphia in what would be an impossible dragnet lack a little credibility but they sure are fun to watch.<br/><br/>The first half included an interesting study on what it takes to be a good ""sniper."" It also had good photography and I especially liked the overhead shots of Philadelphia. The chase scenes were fun to watch, too. Near the end, the white sniper camouflage outfit Walhberg was wearing in Montana was really cool.<br/><br/>THE BAD - Who wrote this script? Oliver Stone? Michael Moore? The DNC? I couldn't believe all the politics - all the Liberal conspiracies and the anti-Bush Administration comments - in the last hour of this movie. First, this extreme paranoid view that everyone in the government is corrupt is vastly overworked by Hollywood and this movie is the topper where they aren't even subtle about these crackpot theories. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Filmmakers make literally millions of dollars in this country and do nothing but bash the government. It's really worked to death in this film, more than the Bourne stories. To what extremes film writers go, just check out Elias Koteas' portrayal of government agent in here, and you get my drift. No guy in that position would act like that. <br/><br/>The Oliver Stone-like politics come into play big-time when Swagger meets this old guy in Tennessee who espouses every Liberal conspiracy theory that Stone likes to dish out. They still are trying to pass on all the conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination. That, and a not-so-subtle dig at WMDs, President Bush's comments why we are in Iraq, the Secretary of Defense supposedly being a liar and other negative opinions connected with the Iraq War, just keep coming after that. It's unrelenting. <br/><br/>They turn a decent action thriller into one big Left Wing propaganda piece. They didn't do that in the Bourne movies, but they sure spew out their political venom in here.<br/><br/>That's bad enough but the Rambo-mentality was an insult to all viewers, regardless of political persuasion. There had to be at least 50 trained army guys storming a house with our hero in it, along with his FBI friend, and all 50 guys are killed and the two ""good guys"" don't even get a scratch?! Then, a helicopter arrives with more guys shooting at them, and Swagger kills all of them, too! This is embarrassingly moronic.<br/><br/>OVERALL - After a great first hour, this movie dumbed down so badly in the second half that it just left me shaking my head in disbelief! How a film can be so entertaining and somewhat intelligent and go down the dumper so fast and be so stupid in the second half is staggering. It winds up being a ""coulda, shoulda"" movie in which we just lament how good this should have been, but wasn't"

","I thought the movie was amazing! This is a action packed movie with a little bit of romance. There were so many head shots in it. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat! Also, Mark Wahlberg was hotter than ever in this movie. He had to work out even more than what he usually does. The role as Bob Lee Swagger did require a lot of physical stunts. He is really becoming a better actor now that he is doing movies that he really enjoys. Mark plays a very tough marine in this movie but I don't think that is his personality in real life. I defiantly recommend this movie to anyone that likes guns or Mark Wahlberg."

The problem with Hollywood is that the can't release them self from the formula. The formula is of course what people want. This movie is a TYPICAL example of that. It's so full of clichés that I don't know where to begin. In the beginning of the movie you will see a scene when the main character is living alone in the wild(Rambo in Canada?). The Hollywood directors really want you to get this so they dresses him i redneck clothes drinking beer(with his dog) and a lot of mountains. And when the girl with the breasts start acting nurse later on I realize(in despair) that I already seen half of the movie and I cant turn back. They could not even let the bad guys be killed by someone else than the main character. These days I rather check out HBO or the Asian movies to get amused. This really sucks.

I realize if they stayed true to the book the movie would be so long it'd be unwatchable, but this was ridiculous. Even people who liked the movie wonder why certain plot points happened.<br/><br/>It's as if they tried to cram too much of the various plots in the book into the movie to satisfy the ""Point of Impact"" fans, but had to change it around and edit the hell out of it to satisfy the average action movie fan. They ended up failing on both fronts.<br/><br/>Except for Ned Beatty, all the primary characters were totally mis-cast.

"andydreamseeker","7","11","21","7 April 2007"," Movie Review: Shooter
","""Yesterday was about honor. Today is about justice."" The movie tagline accurately justifies what the film Shooter is about. Mark Wahlberg stars as the marksman or elite marine scout sniper who was betrayed on a ""peace-keeping"" mission. Later after surviving the betrayal he was called upon by his country again, this time to stop a presidential assassination. For honor he accepted the mission but history repeated. Framed and on the run as presidential assassin, this time he want justice.<br/><br/>Shooter the movie is based on the novel, Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is the main character for the story. His expertise and dedication to the craft of shooting became his poison. He is the best and the best is often sort after but not always look after. There are treacherous people around us with evil agendas. Things are not always what it seem. It is just when you thought you had everything figured out that you start falling, a little wisdom spoken by the film.<br/><br/>Fortunately for Bob Lee Swagger, an honorable man with a distinctive ability earned him allies in the form of rookie federal agent, Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) and the widow of his former scout sniper partner, Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara). Through their help he seeks to restore his honor, balance the beam of justice and uncover the bigger conspiracy that surrounds him.<br/><br/>Honestly this film really began very well. Bob Lee Swagger displayed his mettle of an elite sniper. The gun fighting action raised the adrenaline and expectation of the film. The film director is Antoine Fuqua of Training Day (2001) after all. There was conspiracy, car chases and hard-hitting actions. What is most impressive is Bob Lee Swagger's ability of survival and unsurpassed marksmanship. The very system that trained him to survive now wants him dead. How much more exciting can it get?<br/><br/>Perhaps there were too many targets to aim for with just a single sniper. No doubt Mark Wahlberg played his role very well as the expressionless, cool and intimidating marine sniper but the film in general was missing a lot of targets and thus lost much intensity and grip. As much as the degree of expertise Bob Lee Swagger demonstrated, there was little to engage the audience into the inner world of his, and what this main character of the movie is really about. That focus or the lack of it was not present.<br/><br/>The greater scale of the story of having a conspiracy seems to have taken an ill effect. It was not sure what was to figure. Was it the shooter or the conspiracy?<br/><br/>In the end Bob Lee Swagger became the invincible, much like Rambo, but less charm, only the brawns and immense shooting ability to kill. That in his own hands became his justice.<br/><br/>Which guy doesn't like guns and which gal doesn't like a hotshot? Impressive shooting but the target might not go down. Not by a long shot."

"jaredmobarak","6","14","29","9 April 2007"," I'm gonna see it throughShooter
","Director Antoine Fuqua has a style and filmography that I have enjoyed in the past. With Training Day and King Arthur, he delivered some action packed movies that had both story and popcorn pyrotechnics. I will say that after seeing the trailer for his new film Shooter, I was a bit underwhelmed, but until I went to one of his works and was not entertained, I would at least give it a shot. I'm glad I did as Shooter ended up being a well told, nicely paced actioner that knew what it wanted to do at all times and lived up to its goals. We are never led into a situation that may twist in a way that will bring us out of the reality of what is happening; our hero has been framed and he will do anything necessary to find justice. Fuqua tells us who the good guys and who the bad guys are at all times. There is never an opportunity for the audience to second guess someone's motives because the filmmaker is willing to appreciate our intelligence and spin a linear tale of revenge, trying to set things right against a corrupt government.<br/><br/>A big part of the film's success lies in the performance by Mark Wahlberg. I have never been a real fan of his acting prowess, but I must give him credit for getting better each time he is in front of the camera. In my opinion, he was horrible early on in his career in movies like Fear. Sure he had a great turn in Boogie Nights, but I hold that true because he was basically playing himselfa young man new to the entertainment industry, trying to understand his role in it all. Only when he came out with possibly the best role in the phenomenal movie I Heart Huckabees did I finally say to myself, ""this guy may be able to do the job after all."" Wahlberg is wonderful as Bob Lee Swagger on his journey to find out who is behind the conspiracy that led to his being framed in a Presidential assassination plot. The role may not be very demanding as far as range goes, but that is OK, because he does all he is asked and is believable as the ex-army sniper. All the weaponry jargon that spews from his mouth may sound like gibberish, but he sells it that he knows what he's talking about.<br/><br/>The supporting cast help prop up the film as well, allowing for some nice sequences. Michael Peña is great as the FBI agent who sees that something isn't right and becomes willing to help uncover what truly happened the night of the shooting. Ned Beatty has a nice turn as a corrupt Senator, and although I kept waiting for him to mumble ""yes sir, Mr. Luthor,"" he did a nice job. Also, mention must be made for the fantastic Elias Koteas. When he is given a role that he can really run with he takes it over and is electric. He plays the villain perfectly and between the slimeball moves and the hilarious scene at the end, (I love that he takes his belt off in the background while on the ground trying to make a tourniquetmost actors would probably just squirm there after what happens, but even when not the focal point he tries to bring the role out), you got to love the guy.<br/><br/>Besides the competent acting and some nice camera-work, (when Wahlberg enters what he knows is a trap, the camera composes each view of him in a way to show a vast space behind, making you think that someone will be turning up to take him out; the framing makes the suspense rise even higher), there are some problems. Sure the story is a convenient one, smart enough to get where it wants to go, taking the usual liberties action- flicks of this kind take, but it is effective and straight-forward. I don't mind this shortcoming because it is better than trying to be more than you are, ruining any credibility you might have had. What I do mind is bad acting. Upon viewing the trailer I thought I would be pulling my hair out listening to Kate Mara's fake hick accent, however, she wasn't that bad. The atrocity actually came from Danny Glover. Whether it was his decision or the director's, I don't know, but his mouthpiece-causing lisp was terrible. At first I was wondering if he got that old he was wearing dentures and they were falling out, but when looking closer you can see a clear mouthpiece on his bottom row of teeth causing a bad speech pattern. I cringed each time he opened his mouth.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though, Fuqua delivers the action and his actors do the job at pulling it all off. Shooter is by no means a masterpiece, but who actually goes to these types of movies expecting one? If you have two hours to spare and want to be entertained with a minimal amount of brainwork to pull you through, I can think of many worse things to do instead of checking out Wahlberg's one-man fight against the tyranny of influential people in high places."

","I, like every other sensible person, count Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact as one of the world's best books. And I was enthusiastic about ""Shooter"" starring Mark Wahlberg. I've seen it. And despite my positive attitude, it isn't worth much. Though I can tell you why it has good reviews.<br/><br/>The good news is that Wahlberg does a good job of playing a straight-up Rambo action hero. There is no hint of backwoods or ""country"" in the character, and the words ""the nailer"" are never spoken. He talks like a midwestern Harvard MBA. Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn is just beautiful and definitely Kentucky. It is a standard action flick with head shots, fights and explosions. If that's all it was, it might be worth it just to see Kate Mara in that thin t-shirt.<br/><br/>However... it is a strong and obvious POLITICAL ""message"" movie. The enemy is the US government. The ""hero"" wears a ""Che"" T-shirt and the bad guys have offices adorned with portraits of Republican presidents (HW Bush, Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Ronald Reagan). The Abu Ghraib reference and ""sitting Secretary of Defense lying"" speech are typical of the movie. This movie implies a 9-11 government conspiracy and accuses our soldiers of killing women and children (for an oil pipeline,naturally). The big battle (with homemade bombs)is not with the South Americad drug cartel of the ""Panther Batallion"", but with US soldiers who recently committed a massacre. The old gunsmith talks about how he was lied to about artificial sweeteners and WMD's in Iraq. The US is the source of world tragedies. Swagqer is led down the wrong path by ""patriotism"". He has never been to Vietnam, as that would imply heroic Americans might have been there. Sam Vincent the country lawyer is not there. Nick Memphis is just another FBI guy.<br/><br/>The reason it is getting good reviews--other than it is an adequate action movie--is because of the leftist message adored by the media. It's an action movie for whacky libs, conspiracists and Bush-haters. I'm sure others will see this move. I'll be surprised if they don't report that it is more like ""Michael Moore does Point of Impact(A George Soros production)"" than the book and character we all admire."

"mysteriesfan","6","12","25","20 April 2007"," Interesting set-up, technical skill, weak lead, unable to sustain itself
","This movie is imaginative and touches on some interesting ideas. The film creates a picture of how much power and trust a government can have when there is a terrorist threat and what might happen if a well-connected, corrupt organization exploited them to frame an innocent person for a crime it commits. The brave, serious-minded, determined hero faces the impossible situation of having not only the criminals but the entire weight of law enforcement and the public against him. With some grit and technical skill, the movie shows interesting, smart, tough, resourceful ways in which he might try to survive and strike back, despite the staggering odds.<br/><br/>At the same time, the very imaginativeness of the movie made it hard to take seriously. This is why I was not bothered by the political cheap-shots others saw in the film. Consider the context. This is an action movie that fails to develop any serious themes, and if it is even trying to, it fumbles them so incompetently it discredits itself. And it is a shame if the film betrayed the book, but I was not offended because I did not even know there was a book.<br/><br/>But, purely on the level of entertainment value, stacking the odds so high against the hero, which creates the interesting set-up, also makes it very hard to explain how such a thing could have happened and how the hero could overcome it. It also raises expectations that the movie cannot or does not deliver on for how it will all be resolved. So the movie presents an interesting, well-executed set-up but lacks the depth or development to the characters and story to pull it off in the end.<br/><br/>The criminal organization -- superficially represented by a few colorful, stock characters -- is horribly ill-defined, as is any government role in it. The sometimes sinister-seeming actions or dialogue of FBI higher-ups and the frequent placement of the criminal masterminds in what look like government settings create the misleading impression that the villains are actually part of the FBI or another agency. If the movie is trying to imply that the criminals and the government are one and the same, then that is nothing more than a cheap gimmick because no attempt is made to credibly explain how they could be working together (a lone, grandiosely corrupt U.S. Senator from a relatively uninfluential wilderness state and an ex-Colonel are the only links?). The more details that are given, the more implausible the story becomes. The increasingly ineffective way the criminals behave during the movie takes a toll on the credibility of them having planned so masterful an initial crime.<br/><br/>As a result of unexplained motivations and unlikely events, an FBI agent ends up teaming with the hero. But the agent is played as a confusing, unlikeable drudge, right from his very first annoying moments on screen. At times, he acts like an eagle-eye, encyclopedic-brain professional, at others like a dunce. Which is it? How does the hero possibly have the time to whip him into shape as a reliable, lean, mean fighting machine?<br/><br/>The hero's ability to find out information and obtain resources while on the run are unbelievable. How, for example, does he know just when to show up in a boat with a high-powered rifle to foil an elaborate attempt to stage the suicide of the FBI agent (who has been investigating on his own and been abducted and beaten senseless by thugs)? The villains are careless in figuring out late the identity of the hero's other, first accomplice. The movie tries to explain this, and it could be excused as making the point that even the most technologically savvy, well-planned operations can still fall victim to simple human error. But less excusable is the failure of the hero (whose mind otherwise seems to work like a steel trap) to realize that his accomplice (who simply returns home after helping him) is in great danger. So at the expense of the hero's character, and of victimizing the accomplice, the movie has the hero do something stupid simply because they need it as a plot gimmick. Despite some attention to detail, the three supposedly climactic end scenes, including a stunt with a rifle to show his innocence in front of no less than the U.S. Attorney General himself, the destruction of critical, hard-won evidence for no good reason, and a crude, unimaginative final shootout scene, are a mess -- choppy, slow-paced, unexplained, implausible, contrived, and falling far short of a meaningful, dramatic resolution.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes actors such as Danny Glover, Ned Beatty, and Michael Sandor, who at least bring some zest to undeveloped material. But Mark Wahlberg is weak as the lead. His portrayal is flat and inarticulate, never more so than with the supposedly pivotal line, ""They killed my dog."" His line about working for but hating the government is supposed to be meaningful but comes across as mere smart-aleck cynicism. He acts grim and close-mouthed but not passionately intense. He is serious but not charismatic. He lacks the confident authority, command, and seasoning that Steven Seagal brought to the Under Siege films. The actor playing Wahlberg's FBI partner seems as unimpressive and out-of-his-depth as his character.<br/><br/>So, while the movie has some interesting and entertaining elements, the characters and story skate by too much on the surface and come to too clumsy a conclusion to be satisfying."

","Shooter is the story of an expert military sniper named Bob Lee Swagger who becomes a recluse after his partner is killed in battle. Some government officials track him down and tell him that an assassin is planning to shoot the President from a mile away. They want Swagger to use his expertise to tell them where the assassin might be shooting from. Swagger agrees, but when he is framed with the shooting himself, he sets out on a journey to find out who set him up and why. There's nothing particularly bad about this movie per se, it just doesn't stand out among the countless other films like it.<br/><br/>The movie is written rather well and the plot isn't too bad. In fact, this is probably one of the most realistic films about a sniper that's out there. I actually learned in this movie just how much comes into play when you're planning to pick someone off, and it's not as easy as other movies make it seem at all. For instance, even the spin of the Earth itself comes into play when you're firing a sniper rifle. Scenes like that were done well. My main problem was the rest of the movie, though filled with some decent gun fights, fist fights, and explosions, is just so bland. It's the same action movie I've seen dozens of times. A guy gets framed and starts a one man war in order to prove his innocence. I can't think of any other way to describe this movie other than meh, or perhaps blah. It's just one of those movies that's just there. It's not advertised a whole lot, it isn't a failure at the box office but it isn't much of a success either.<br/><br/>The acting was okay. Mark Whalberg gave the only good performance. After Saw, and now this, I am quickly losing all confidence in Danny Glover. Everyone else in the movie is just alright. No outstanding performances.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie wasn't terrible, but I'm not going to watch it again.<br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie is absolutely dreadful! More proof that monkeys can't write scripts, and pop video directors can't direct - not exactly a recipe for good or engaging entertainment. Once were the days when Hollywood could produce cynical, intelligent thrillers. I'm thinking of great paranoia films like Three Days of the Condor and the Parallax View. Both were directed and written, not to mention acted, by people who had talent - something conspicuously absent in this film. Sadly, this is another example of cinema that only becomes thought provoking when you reflect on the kind of people that watch and enjoy seeing such stuff.

","'Shooter' starts fairly well, and then takes a precipitous downward spiral that never recovers. ""Point of Impact"" is an excellent action novel that is the first of a series of Robert Lee Swagger novels. A Viet Nam sniper who barely survived his war demons, he lives alone in Arkansas with his dog. He is consulted on an assassination attempt, when implicated in that assassination attempt, he hunts for the killers to clear his name. This is where it deviates from the book and descends into a comic book Bruce Willis type action film that loses all credibility. The terrific end of the novel is missing in this movie. To the detriment of the screen writer, he butchered the novel--he did not improve on the novel at all. My girl friend enjoyed the movie; I found the movie very unsatisfying, so much, I have to give it a failing grade, 'F.' Even Mark's beard looked pretty awful. Read the novel; do not see this movie, it was awful."

","Shooter(2007) <br/><br/>Review:I have always wondered about Wahlberg. Can he be a leading man? Who knows. This is his next attempt.<br/><br/>Shooter is not what many have given it. This was said to be an action, action, and action movie. This is not. This is more of a drama with some action in the middle of it all. Wahlberg has gotten better at acting, but this is underwhelming to say the least.<br/><br/>The plot is rather weak. They spend to much time talking about the evil of the bad guys and lose focus on the action and drags along....a lot. There are some exquisite sniper action sequences here and there and are satisfying. The action is here, but not as much as you may think.<br/><br/>This movie became frustrating as hell as I continued to wonder when will this pick up? That's what were dealing with. This reminds me of another Wahlberg flick, ""The Corrupter"", that had promise, but little action and to much drama that can choke a horse. The difference is that ""Shooter"" has a little more action. The action sequences are well done, but are so few and far between.<br/><br/>There are far too many obvious plot holes here and a predictable ending. I was not too fond of the anti-American stuff either. Just hideous.<br/><br/>At least one thing is for sure is that the locations and scenery are eye candy. From many beautiful locations across America are breathtaking...not to mention the babe Kate Mara is nice.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Terrible. I would not even recommend saving this for a rental.

Also, a very large waste of talent on most of the cast. Especially Elias Koteas. Where have the days gone when an action movie didn't pontificate on some weak political philosophy.

Of course, if it's the first shoot 'em up action -flick (with political undertones and an assassination plot with a fall guy) you've ever seen you might like this.

Had the movie played more according to the script, you would have a much deeper character emotionally, and the role would have required someone older and more taciturn.<br/><br/>The film overly simplifies the motivations and the reasons behind the actions of the various characters, the female lead was thrown in simply to put a female into the film, and the screenplay often bogs itself down into simplistic anti or pro American jingoism's.<br/><br/>I notice Stephen Hunter was not given screenplay credit for this film, which only raises him as a writer in my eyes.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's an okay matinée movie to see at reduced prices.

","There's lots to enjoy about this movie, unfortunately they didn't film any of it. All of the suspense has been removed in favor of shot after shot of...shots. The director clearly took the title of this unrealized film to heart and removed anything that didn't come from the barrel of a gun. Which is a shame, because as far as political-assassination thrillers go, the set-up here isn't bad. It's clever fare, and while it doesn't break any new ground in the genre, it should have delivered exactly what the moviegoer wanted; taut plot line, suspension of disbelief, resolution. Unfortunately the screenwriter, actors, and director got in the way. The characters are hollow; Wahlberg's Bob Lee Swagger lives up to his name, but if they wanted a fully descriptive moniker, they should have named him Scowln' Swagger. That's all he does. There's no time left to see him seethe over the government's initial betrayal, nor time to watch his equilibrium drop after he's betrayed again and again. It's all water off a duck's back. He get's burned, he shoots things. No emotion, nor internal reflection, just bullets. This may fit the character, but it doesn't take him anywhere. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional. Ned Betty is a caricature of a Senator spouting one hackneyed big-money catchphrase after another; Danny Glover has back story we never see and consequently never care about; and Kate Mara's in the movie, but she's hardly used at all. Most of these actor's do a fine job playing the characters written for them. Their lines are are throwaway-trite, angry, boring one liners propping up feeble dialog that never reveals a thing. Worse, it's all been heard before, in thrillers that had half as much material to work with from the outset. Of course, this is an action movie. We paid for blood. We are rewarded. The action sequences are good, the cinematography is crisp, good guys shoot bad guys, all traits reminiscent of The Italian Job remake. Obviously Mark Wahlberg has a niche in the genre. But the movie here lacks any semblance of taking itself seriously, of following one action to its next logical consequence. The most ridiculous things happen prompting dozens of question marks, then they simply go away as if they never existed. What you get is people who shoot and stuff that gets shot. But in an era where real military men and women are involved in our news and our lives on a very close level, this movie feels soulless. We could care about Swagger and what happens to him, and become all the more interested in the movie for it. Or we could just blow some more stuff up. I wanted to like this movie, I wanted to root for Swagger, I wanted to hate the villains...but it never develops, it never comes alive. In the end, it's a tale of a movie that could have been."

","Bob Swagger (no, really) is a top sniper for the US military. However when he is abandoned behind enemy lines during a black op, his spotter is killed and his faith in his commanders is gone. Three years later, Swagger is living in the hills with only his cynicism and a dog for company. Three men from the Government roll up one day, saying that they need Swagger's expertise to help work out where a long range threat to the president's life could possibly come from  something intel says is going to happen in the next few weeks. Swagger obliges, identifying the one likely spot and, before you can say ""oldest trick in the book"", shots are fired, a visiting Ethiopian dignitary is dead and Swagger is shot by a cop who had been assigned to his unit. Swagger escapes with injuries but, with his face all over the television, can he clear his name and bring down the real perpetrators?<br/><br/>This came and went in the cinema in the UK, doing the business that was expected of it but nothing more  drawing the audience one would expect for this sort of thing but nothing more. The reviews were middle of the road and there wasn't anything about it that inspired me to get out and see this. On a recent flight this was one of the choices and, looking for something that wouldn't require much thought, I plumped for it. What I found was pretty much what I expected in a that could be compared to an unsung hero on a championship team  it doesn't have anything unique about it, but it does the basics well and produces a roundly pleasing film that delivers just what you expect from it.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect of course and nobody should expect it to be. The narrative arch is obvious before you even press play; too much time is spent with the additional character of the partner's girlfriend and it does tend to wear its cynicism obviously on its sleeve rather than weaving it into characters and plot. Plus, ignoring specific issues, it is a thriller that does not aspire to be more than a good thriller. As such it works, it moves forward well with an edge of ""military cool"" that Hollywood generally gives the sniper character. It plays this very well, mostly making the plot move forward with a smooth flow to it. Wahlberg is a good choice for this type of thing as he is a good presence and makes for an accessible action hero. OK, maybe his character is sprayed onto his skin rather than something convincing and real, but who would have thanked him here for producing something deep? The support cast is heavy with familiar faces and names such as Glover, Koteas (or was it Meloni? I'll bet their mothers don't even know anymore), Mitra, Beatty and others. They all do OK without doing anything special as the material mostly requires ""sinister figures"" from them. Peña is an OK sidekick for Swagger but I'm not sure I entirely bought his part in the film.<br/><br/>Overall then, a perfectly fine action thriller that is all the more enjoyable for not really having many aspirations beyond that. Some bits could have been edited tighter to make it flow quicker at times and some of the superficial attempts at modern cynicism could have been lost but otherwise it makes for the type of movie that will be perfect as a DVD in with beer for the large target audience."

The whole plot was almost parallel to the movie 'Most Wanted' and several others. The action sequences were fair, but were intertwined with scenes of poor dialog and 'cheap humor'. By this i mean making references to people like Anna Nicole Smith and other references that seemed completely out of place within the context of the film. There is also a recurring theme of anti-americanism felt from this film. Many times during the movie, there are quotes pertaining to the 'incompetence' of our government. Shooter tries to portray anyone involved with the government as a heartless, half-minded, cruel individual. The acting by mark Whalberg and the rest of the cast was again, mediocre at best.

All is not as it seems though, and soon our killer is on the run, accused of being a killer. Only he can hunt down and kill-from-a-distance-by-shooting-in-the-back the real killers. <br/><br/>This movie is a string of clichés to the backdrop of gun-obsession that appears to be marketed at backwater, macho, pick-up riding men's men. At one point my partner and I spontaneously laughed out loud when we were subjected, at an inappropriate moment, to 15 seconds of Wahlberg walking ridiculously towards the camera in slow motion, a giant US flag as his background - A scene which highlights the general masturbatory tone.<br/><br/>Both dialogue and action are hammy and unrealistic at best. For example, Marky Mark turns up at the house of a woman he doesn't really know. Shirtless and injured, he explains in graphic detail how she has to cut into his wounds and stitch him up, before sucking on an aerosol and passing out. Only in an ill-thought out, macho fantasy world would this woman silently take on such a burden of a known assassin without politely telling him to ""f@*& off"" or at least phoning the police while he was asleep. The movie continues in this vein, and the underlying philosophy seems to be that what we need in this world is a man who's really good at shooting and prepared to murder from afar anyone whom he thinks is bad, or anyone who hangs out with them. <br/><br/>If you want action, find a film like ""Taken"" or the Bond films, where at least the characters have some complexity and drive.

","A rather more gritty, dirty, nasty take on the Bourne Identity theme. Bourne is the story of one man. Shooter is the story of a nation.<br/><br/>Betrayed soldier Swagger aka Shooter (Mark Wahlberg) lives a Ruby Ridge like isolated existence against the stunningly beautiful backdrop of forested mountain country. Is that the only way Americans can seek beauty, virtue, spiritual healing? By fleeing to the wilderness? But the Government institutions that screwed him once come back to exploit his love of country and heritage a second time. They want a Lee Harvey Oswald patsy like that portrayed in Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" An Ethiopian politician is about to speak the embarrassing truth about the role of Big Oil and US Intelligence in killing off the villagers unfortunate enough to be protesting about their displacement for a pipe line installation.<br/><br/>I came home from Shooter and turned on my television, to see the last few minutes of Part One of James Jandak Wood's documentary ""Crude Impact"". It concerned the killing of Nigerian villagers who were opposing the building of a Shell Oil installation on their land. It had earlier dealt with the incursions of Texaco into Ecuador.<br/><br/>This ain't Rambo  This is real life as we live it in the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>I think the most sobering moment in the film is the depiction of Shooter (with some assistance from a disaffected FBI agent) killing off a platoon of his own country's soldiers. A patriot taking up arms against his own countrymen.<br/><br/>Another disturbing aspect is the degradation in which his countrymen live. Kate Mara has been criticized for her performance as his dead spotter's widow. I fail to see its defects. She is no less a cipher than the arms expert whose knowledge Swagger seeks out in his quest to discover what is going on at the rotten core of his country's government.<br/><br/>It seems that all the characters live in conditions of near squalor. Even the inhabitants of the big cities. Philadelphia has a grimy, unkempt look, crying out for a coat of new paint. It brings to mind that Talking Heads song, ""I Wouldn't Live There If You Paid Me"".<br/><br/>And they all mumble so incoherently that the provision of subtitles would have been a boon to the viewer.<br/><br/>All except the ""front men"" like Ned Beatty's senator  but then he is no more substantial a character than the sum of his lying words.<br/><br/>I have heard criticism of the film's climax. Maybe Swagger is more clever that Lee Harvey Oswald, but it is that culmination that injects some element of hope into the nightmare that has been portrayed up on the screen for two absorbing and stimulating hours.<br/><br/>I saw ""Half Nelson"" earlier in the week, In that film an intelligent, articulate, widely read teacher gives up the struggle and reduces his own existence to that of a drug filled haze. At least Shooter seeks a way to reform the system, even if it is the clichéd route of the old western heroes.<br/><br/>When do we get an American hero who can take on the evil system without resort to bloodshed, and win. It does not have to Luke Skywalker. Let's have another Jim Garrison (from ""JFK""), using words instead of bullets. And let him triumph this time.<br/><br/>This film really got to me. It altered my mood for days. Left me wanting to see it again. It is more than just another action movie."

","This whole movie was a pretty big waste. You might like it if you like ""ill ass action"" because he's a sniper and that explains it all. The screenplay was very lacking. The dialogue of the characters were too weak and not expressive enough, not even the acting was good. The acting that was closes to ""good acting"" was Michael Pena's (Nick Memphis). We could all tell that he was the nervous and tense type of person, but that should've been expressed in his performance in the battlefield more often, they did that a little which was okay. What about the main character? Bob Lee Swahger (actor Mark Wahlberg) was barely expressive of his character. His performance was rather poor. I know he could do better than this. We've all seen him as the annoying guy on The Departed, Wasn't his acting ""decent"" in that movie? But let's get more into the character Bob Lee Swahger. In the battlefield, he was very tense, (which is normal), at home he was a very quiet and bitchy carefree kind of guy, and later on, while he's at the climax, he suddenly cares for those people who were killed. I mean, does he suffer split personality disorder? (Note to Antoine Fuqua (director): next time, let us know if your character is going through a change, or a split personality disorder.) The director and the screenplay writer should give a more stable character. I mean he did kick some ass, but I'm assuming that the director used that as a cover-up for his character. We should come to like/hate the main character in the story, that's how well developed a character should be. Also Bob Lee Swahger was like a killer robot. Also Danny Glover's character (Antagonist Colonel Isaac Johnson) was very... Lacking. So was his acting. It was so cheesy. He was lacking so much emotion that the character should possess. The character, according to the screenplay, was lacking. Ned Beatty's (Senator Charles F. Meachum) role was the MOST lacking. His lines were so poorly directed, his ""bad guy"" character wasn't well proved ENOUGH. I can't get too much into the characters; let's get into the film making.<br/><br/>The film making was so poor. There was one scene in which the colonel was telling his bodyguards that Bob was their man, and right after that they showed a scene in which Swahger was sitting with his dog and the camera went out to a scenic view. I mean what was the point of that? That was a flaw in the editing and the directing. The director shouldn't throw something random and useless like that to viewers. When a car goes down a hill, going down the pathway would make it easy for the car to go. If the car were to run into this sudden stop in the path and just fall into the gap that would not be good. That was how that scenic scene was. The change of scene was so lacking. There was more into the film making, such as the cinematography of the battlefield in the beginning. They should've made better angles. They should've made an angle of the camera being right above the snipers to show exactly what they were seeing from their distance and to give the feeling of how they were feeling. The lighting of that scene was flawed also, it should've been gloomy to make us feel as they were feeling. Also the scene where the agent was kidnapped, and there were random sniper shootings, the angles should've remained where the agent was so we would've felt the same as he was.<br/><br/>Can't get completely into the film making, so let's get into the ending, the ending was just horrible, they ended with a car going down a road, that could've potentially been a symbolic ending but not for this movie. They should've ended it with a scene showing a wolf secretly hunting down its prey that would've been very symbolic.<br/><br/>Anyways, there is still much to say on the movie, I'm assuming that many will disagree with me and debate me on the topic. I'm open for debate."

","This movie typifies liberal's view of America - soldiers killing innocent people at random to help fund big oil projects. Abu Ghraib is all about money and oil, 9/11 was a conspiracy to force America into war so oil companies could prosper (the 9/11 book is shown prominently on the snipers table), etc. First, if anyone doubts what Iraq could have done to us go to www.halabja.org and see what they did to the Kurds. Well, we caught the guy (Chemical Ali) and hung him! If it was up to President Glover Iraq would still be dropping poison gas on women and children killing thousands per hour if they disagreed with anything mandated by the government. This movie doesn't go into concepts such as how Hugo Chavez, Danny's best buddy, actually closed Venezuela oldest television station, RCTC, back in May and fought back crowds of people that were protesting this injustice with fire hoses and violence. They closed the TV station because it disagreed with the Government. This movie doesn't mention any of it because it appears that's what these liberals want for us!<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is about as high quality as an episode of 24 (actually I do a disservice to 24 by comparing it). None of it made sense - the sniper gets stuck behind enemy lines and is left there to die. His friend is already dead. The top military decided to leave both of them there to die so they wouldn't talk about their illegal mission. But then swoop - he's playing with his dog in wooded hills 3 months later - wasn't he just screwed in the middle of some enemy camp ten seconds ago? Didn't the military decide he should be dead? Next thing you know he's watching out for snipers to supposedly protect the President but he's in a dark room with all the main players? How's he watching for snipers in a dark hotel room? Then they have some fat city cop (apparently ""in the know"") try to shoot him and fail - why some city cop - why not one of the snipers supposedly in the room, a highly trained FBI guy, or some other conspirator? He escapes. Then instead of going to the press - he decides to handle it on his own with the widow of his friend who died two years ago (oh, I thought it was just three months ago as explained in the beginning of this sequence?). The screenplay must have been written in crayon by a fifth grader (and I do a disservice to fifth graders by saying that). <br/><br/>Then when others, including the President who was almost killed, find out about all the mass killing and corruption they say, well we're just gonna let this one go this time. And he still doesn't talk to the press! Let's be real - he'd have a series of book deals, Larry King, FOX NEWS, and his own series within 3 days! Instead he decides to kill all the bad (and probably Republican) politicians and associates that he disagreed with in cold blood - exactly what Hugo Chaves probably would have done! Listen, I have respect for political views and an open mind but don't try to pawn your views off to me in some made up lousy movie - message to Hollywood - we're not that stupid! Come up with some even handed facts make a movie about that and bill it as such and then I can decide whether I want to pay to see it.

"Blossomsinthenight","3","8","18","4 August 2007"," Gun propaganda?
","Was this movie sponsored by the NRA? Love of guns is central to the movie, both visually and plot-wise, and guns are presented as the tool of the good patriot passed down from father to son to fight for justice and freedom. But what really happens is Wahlberg's character spends most of the movie violently shooting people in his quest to exact revenge and prove he's innocent of shooting that one person he's been accused of shooting. Make sense? The side of the movie that is intended to justify this behavior - awful happenings in ""Africa"" (that faraway land) lead by a few rotten apples in the government - is skimmed over and abstract. The bad guys end up charicaturally evil... The whole point of the movie isn't justice and freedom, but guns and how cool they are.<br/><br/>That said, it was rather enjoyable up to halfway through and I found it fed my craving for a good gun-filled action flick filled with mystery and cover-ups... Wahlberg's character is hilarious: he is a true American cowboy, independent, strong, with only his guns and big dog for company.<br/><br/>This could have gone well, especially if the movie had stuck to the action-suspense genre: good actors, direction, etc. But the plot is so poorly developed and the violence so unsatisfyingly justified that it ends up being a disappointment."

"stevetseitz","1","8","18","31 March 2007"," terrible terrible ideas makes terrible terrible movies
","First of all, I like Mark Wahlberg. He is the only reason I saw this film and I was rooting for him because he seems like a good guy and I think he can act. With that out of the way, I feel free that the reader will have no misconceptions that I am trying to slam Mark Wahlberg with my review. The movie, on the other hand, is another story. This is simply awful and derivative film-making. Plagiarism is punishable in school by expulsion. This movie copied so many others it's hard to know where it became original. I will list the movie and the way in which this film copied it: ""The Bourne Identity"" (highly trained agent uses his know-how to stick it to the man), ""Sniper"" (obvious reasons) ""Arlington Road"" (expert turns fall-guy), ""In the Line of Fire"", (Washington intrigue and assassination plot) ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (American hero turned brainwashed trained assassin) This film was reasonably paced and had some decent action scenes. The problem was that the people Wahlberg was killing weren't adequately identified. In much of the film, Wahlberg almost appeared to be a mindless ""Jason/Micheal Meyers"" type character only he used a gun instead of a machete. Gratuitous violence with no cinematic message is poor film-making.<br/><br/>Tip for the director, if you are going to try and make a ""realistic, gritty"" film keep the tone consistent throughout. You can't turn your character into a bullet-proof superman. There was never any peril for the clichéd ""female interest"" and the clichéd ""sidekick"" was lame.<br/><br/>Tip # 2 for the writer and director, if you are going to try and actually make sweeping geo-political statements don't load your movie up with every implausible conspiracy theory because by bundling sound and unsound ideas together you end up letting the rotten apple spoil the rest. Example: If I use the dialog of a character to impress upon the audience my belief that the Democrats and Republicans are just rich, evil, versions of the same thing, don't have the same character talk about fantastic plots to kill Kennedy or faked Moon Landing hoaxes. It just makes you look stupid.<br/><br/>Isn't the movie going audience in America sick of the ""African tragedy device"" as a plot gimmick? Anytime a screenwriter needs to portray a government official as evil, he slaughters an African village. I think more African villages have been slaughtered in bad screenplays more times that there ARE actual African villages.<br/><br/>Africa is screwed up enough without having to have some corrupt western political wheel screwing things up worse. Besides the ""corrupt western political wheel"" is the most overused cliché in these films and is the 2000's version of the black-hat wearing mustache-twisting movie villain in early silent films."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Whalberg) was a soldier who's best friend was killed on a mission that went wrong. Since then he's been in seclusion up in the hills- until he's approached by a government agent (Danny Glover) with a proposition- stage a hit on a US senator. With his expert knowledge and professionalism, Swagger agrees- only to find himself set up for a real assassination attempt and in a desperate race for his life.<br/><br/>With the first three films of his that I've seen, Antoine Fuqua has proved he can deliver on all levels of quality, from excellent (Training Day), to average (Tears of the Sun) and then downright awful (King Arthur.) With this rather precise decline in quality from film to film, I really had to sit and wonder just what kind of film Shooter would turn out to be. The answer: average again.<br/><br/>I know he'd made a few films before it, most notably 1998's The Replacement Killers with Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino, but TD was the film that really pushed Fuqua into the big time with Denzel's Oscar win. What happened to that film's raw, dynamic intensity and tense, powerful atmosphere? Why was it just not present in the next few films he made? <br/><br/>This is a total pot-boiler of an action film, with every cliché in the book trotted out in rapid succession and a mumbling Whalberg as our action hero, along with a supporting cast including Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty who don't seem too excited either. The film has a very cheap look to it for a film that went to theatres, with some iffy looking CGI and fake model helicopters, as well as a total lack of any exciting action. It's defenders might say it has an intelligent, twisty-turny, Bourne-esquire plot that you have to pay attention to, but I paid for action and Shooter had it's sight crooked.<br/><br/>It's better than KA, but this is still a bland, uninspiring effort all the way, one to nod off to when you need to get an early night. A damp squib from a director who started with such power. **"
"gjung01","5","6","13","27 March 2007"," Great novel, Disappointing Movie
","I had read the novel that ""The Shooter"" was based upon, ""Point of Impact"" by Steven Hunter. It was an engrossing read and I could not put the book down until I finished it. The one thing that struck me was what a good film it would make. After seeing the film, I saw something very different from the source material. First, the events of the novel are brought up to present day as opposed to 1991 when the events of the first novel took place and the main character is marksman who was on a special mission in an African country protecting contract workers putting up a oil pipeline as opposed to Vietnam. Mark Wahlberg is a likable actor and perfect in any protagonist role he plays but may have been too young for the role and still has the East Coast/Boston thing going when the character was supposed to be a Southerner. Characters were missing, the drama and motivation is also missing in favor of action sequences of which Antoine Fuqua has made a specialty. One scene has an old gun expert virtually explaining out all of the narrative and background for what seems like 10 minutes to get around having the movie deal with it itself. The villains are not even despicable enough, they don't have enough screen time and we basically see characters getting roughed up by nameless thugs who are quickly dispatched in two minutes. The character of the FBI agent Nicholas Memphis was an important one in the book. He is a marksman also but haunted by a mistake that rendered his deceased wife paralyzed and is a clumsy agent who rediscovers his capabilities once more when he learns of inconsistencies and aids Bob Lee in clearing his name. All of this swept aside and Nick Memphis is merely a rookie agent fresh out of the academy and it doesn't help that Mike Pena doesn't even play up the comic relief potential of the character merely looking like he is constipated with something in his eye. This could have been a great action film but it chose to go with big explosions and bloody shootings with a younger cast at the expense of a compelling, suspenseful story with characters who were real and that you cared about. I know this is not a book review site but I had the same feeling after watching ""Sum of All Fears"" where they changed the nationality of the villains and made Jack Ryan young in the guise of Ben Affleck. I judged the film without taking into consideration the literary source and found the film to be rote, banal and underwhelming."

","It takes some doing, to turn a GREAT book into such a terrible movie. I challenge ANYONE to read Stephen Hunter's series, and to then see this awful film. The flaws range from a script that is WAY too busy and riddled with holes. The secret to Hunter's books, is that he keeps everything relatively simple, and makes the inner turmoil of Bob Lee Swagger the ""rub"". Instead, Mark Wahlberg is so miscast, and the more they give him to do, the flatter he falls. It is not his fault that he is nothing more than an average actor, but it is the fault of producers and directors to let him fail this wildly. These are the types of movies that make me have to write; thanks to these enormous wastes of money and of time. So much talent in Danny Glover, Ned Beatty, and Antwon Fuqua simply frittered away for nothing! The writer is to blame, and Lorenzo Bonaventura as Producer should be ashamed of himself, for throwing someone's money into the toilet. I love action-adventure, and these books, but this rivals ""Conspiracy Theory"" and ""The Last Action Hero"" for pure Hollywood bloat. Levon Helm's 4 minutes are the ONLY redeeming quality here.

The longest gunfight in the movie, towards the end, is filled with slow motion shots of the protagonist. But hes not doing anything. Just a shot of him, standing, holding a rifle, with the sunset behind him. It did this about 3 times during that scene.

","I normally have mixed feelings toward Mark Wahlberg movies. Mainly because he's in some spectacular films, but I usually don't approve of his acting, which causes a paradox for me. This however was the first one that I thought he actually was suitable for. The end result was a production that I thoroughly enjoyed much more than I originally expected. I had heard beforehand the novel was simply amazing and while I'm sure the book is better as that is pretty much always the general rule, I don't think this translation will be too far below the high standards it set.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" had many strong points and it got off to an excellent start. It kept up its momentum until about a little over halfway through when an ever so slight cheese factor popped its ugly head up. The frustrating part was it really didn't need to throw in a slow-motion walking scene and the worst part was the ending as it just screamed, ""we should've just let it finish at the prior scene but wanted to throw in more action for the sake of it."" There were some corny quotes but nothing I couldn't tolerate. Possible plot holes did appear but only if the viewer engaged in some hardcore analyzing, which the typical one probably won't for this. The tiny disruptions in the flow of logic are easily overlooked however and the picture is honestly very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The comic relief was blended in smoothly and really polished off what would normally be some rough edges as there is some depressing ideology thrown around. There was definitely a sneaky reference made to Dick Cheney's hunting accident which was really funny as it happens so fast that it's hard to catch until after the fact. The action was great and very fast-paced. The coolest factor was that despite most of the situations being either improbable or even impossible, they were shot in a way that didn't make them seem too unbelievable at the present time. This was by no way a mindless flick either. The concept wasn't completely original, but new paths were followed and did branch out into uncharted domains.<br/><br/>Already controversy has emerged that anti-American themes are displayed a lot. I have to disagree with this because while dissatisfaction with the sleazy way things are being run under our current administration is the underlying theme. By voicing that opinion is a perfect demonstration of the true American way. The oil crisis is looked down upon, as are some of our other questionable foreign policies. Specific monstrous atrocities are used as an example, but since they're in other countries no one over here really cares. This rings a true bell. Another moral that is stated by the attorney general near the end is that, ""justice doesn't always prevail."" That couldn't be anymore on the money either. Lately it seems the bad are the only ones being rewarded since they're willing to do things honest people won't.<br/><br/>The acting was varied and Mark Wahlberg's voice actually changed at least three times. It might've been intentional but if it was, it didn't need to be. Everyone else was at least halfway decent and it was nice to see Ned Beatty appearing in a quality picture again. I highly recommend this film as it offers an interesting perspective on our present nation's status and is a great way to pass two hours. It offers edge of your seat entertainment and is the first straight up action movie that can spark fairly intelligent conversation afterward that I've seen in a long time. ""Shooter"" will blast away most audiences and should snipe its way to the top of this weekend's box office."

If only they could avoid the politics, this would have been a better film. I don't know what Walberg's politics are but know that Glover now sides with a communist in Venezuela, so it's obvious why he'd like to be part of a film like this.

Ned Beatty is deliciously evil as the morally bankrupt man in high place and Michael Pena steals numerous scenes as the unassuming but determined FBI agent. The female roles are, as with so many action films, cardboard cut-outs.

I thought is was a decent enough story but the dialog was so bad you couldn't understand what the actors were saying, it took away from understanding what was going on. Someone mentioned Danny Glover's whispering his lines. I think the director did a lot of blunders by not setting up many scenes so the outcome would have made sense. There was just too much garbled dialog. Another complaint was that the film was shot too dark. It would be nice to see what's going on to at least make sense of a scene. There is a story here but just too damn hard to make out the dialog to help the viewer follow the plot. I blame bad sound editing for this fault. There were many places that just didn't make any logical sense and that was the fault of the director. It's a shame when a picture is screwed up by technicalities as this one has many. Hollywood thinks it's really ""trick"" to shoot a film dark. This is a lot of BS. There is a time to shoot scenes dark here and there but throughout the whole film?.....No, I'm afraid not.

""This is stuff a little above your pay grade,"" etc. Of course we have the evil fat white government men, the only helpful people at the FBI are trainees, and Wahlberg's character has no moral problem with mowing down dozens of America's boys (soldiers with no idea about the ""conspiracy"" and are just doing their duty apprehending a suspect).<br/><br/>Wahlberg makes no mistakes. Everything he does is used. In one scene he puts a dozen or so pipe bombs, even napalm bombs, around a house before infiltrating it to question one of the bad guys. Why does he do this? Well, because somehow he knows 40+ armed men will emerge from the woods outside within minutes to come after the same bad guy. I wonder- if they didn't attack at that precise moment, would Wahlberg have to go back and pick all those bombs back up? I mean, kids might find them, you know. He also somehow takes a picture of a VIN number with a camera phone from 8 feet away. (I guess after living in the woods for three years he was constantly on top of the latest cell phone technologies.) No character is interesting, worthwhile listening to (unless explaining more technical information about what's going on). The women do things like whimper and fall into the hands of the bad guys.

","While certainly watchable, it's quite improbable, but so are most action movies. Enjoyed watching it, but when it was over and one starts to really think about it....well...not so hot. Forget SUPERMAN. The main character does everything Superman does without the cape. My, my, what an incredible man. Even when he gets seriously hurt, he recovers almost in an instant and is off running, rolling around and doing all kinds of stunts without even a twinge of pain or stiffness as a real person would. The plot was quite convoluted and didn't quite make a lot of sense. Some of Mark Whalbergs dialog was hard to understand, and Danny Glover even worse. Again, kind of fun to see, but don't think about it too much."

Insomnia curing bitter pill that is short on brains and almost as short on realistic action.

","In as much as I went into this movie with somewhat low expectations, I came out shocked at how bad both the writing and the characters were handled. In the film, you are taken into the life of Bob lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) who is a scout sniper with the military. He loses his partner on a mission which went awry and we're off. Now the rest of plot functions like a paint by numbers. Kill shoot, frame, repeat. Some of the actions sequences were very well designed and executed -- I also think that Antoine Fuqua might be a good choice for a Ghost Recon movie if it ever gets made, as this sequence (I won't spoil it as it's one of the best designed set-pieces in the film) was it's only redeeming quality and the only reason I finished watching it. I expected more...a lot more."

","Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, THE DEPARTED) is a disgruntled vet. Ultimately left for dead on a sniper mission toward the end of his career, Bobby survives while his spotter-partner ""takes one for America."" Several years later we find Swagger living a life of self-imposed exile in the Colorado Rockies, his only friend a mutt who guards him and his home. He has no plans to re-enter society until...<br/><br/>Enter Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, DREAMGIRLS), a ""patriot"" who claims that the life of the President of the United States is in danger. Knowing Swagger's history and his righteous defense of everything American, Johnson approaches the sniper-extraordinaire with a proposition: help them find out how an attempt on the President will take place and thus they can defuse it.<br/><br/>Come to find out, Johnson isn't working for the President at all and is in the pocket of a U.S. Senator named Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty). Their plan isn't to kill the Prez but to eliminate another threat that stands near him during a speech in St. Louis (naturally money is involved).<br/><br/>Having utilized Swagger, the Colonel attempts to off him but fails, much to the chagrin of Senator Meachum.<br/><br/>Swagger is now on the run, wounded and bleeding, his face plastered on every television screen claiming he attempted to kill the President. Knowing that he has to get away no matter what, Swagger runs afoul of Secret Service agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, CRASH). Hobbling him in quick, military fashion, Agent Memphis is just ""glad to be alive."" Which brought up a unique question: Why didn't the sniper just kill him? This drives Agent Memphis to make some terrible discoveries about his boss, his job, and what America values most.<br/><br/>Double-crossed for the last time, Swagger seeks out those who framed him and uses his sniper training to ultimate advantage. Anyone less than 1,000 yards away is surely in trouble now. He even eventually brings Agent Memphis into his fold and teaches him the fine art of Sniperdom.<br/><br/>SHOOTER's details are more interesting than the whole, as are the DVD special features. How a shooter positions himself. The effects on his shot from weather and wind to the curvature of the Earth are brought into play, making the mechanics more fascinating than the story.<br/><br/>There's also the fact that some HUGE holes develop later on. Swagger nearly gets killed, then suddenly BANG! we're somewhere else where he can eliminate a threat to himself. There's no rhyme or reason to this showing that director Fuqua needed a little help come editing time. And then (drum roll) the big problem: Swagger is in custody and then, without clear reason, he's set free. The ridiculousness of this event is mind-boggling, even while watching a fictitious film where one must suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>This film might appeal to military types who like to watch long shots being made at moving targets, but other than that, it's probably a safe pass."

The plot turned far-fetched and the dialogue turned silly. For all the government conspiracy that went on none of it reached a satisfactory conclusion.<br/><br/>For that matter, the characters themselves were one-dimensional and uninteresting.

","I saw this movie on cable shortly after it came out and liked it immediately, as it appealed to the same sense of Justice presented in so many 'Good vs. Bad' movies. I won't delve into the details of a film critique because I'm really not qualified (although I did take a college course in that). And it's already been done. I recently watched it again for the third or fourth time and decided to add my 'User Rating' here. After reading some of the (voluminous & redundant) reviews, I felt I needed to say something MORE about the CONTEXTUAL importance of this film. <br/><br/>That being said, this 'Review' is based upon my personal experience with military missions, Marine Snipers and the 'MIC'. The movie portrays what may seem to many to be an exciting action-adventure, fictional-fantasy. The TRUTH is there is more reality than fiction hidden in the compressed action & dialogue of this script. I suggest that you watch it again & suspend all disbelief while considering details of the script-<br/><br/>""Bob Lee Swagger: Suppose I was looking for man who could make a 2200 yard cold bore shot, who's alive that could do that? Mr. Rate: Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago, said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger. Never met the man, so I wouldn't know. Bob Lee Swagger: Ya, they said that alright. Mr. Rate: They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, WMDs were in Iraq and Anna Nicole married for love."" .....""Still got the shovel""<br/><br/>The message in this movie is WAY more important than the cinematic details....

","Shooter starts as ex-counter intelligence sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is contacted by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) for an extra special patriotic assignment, US intelligence have gotten wind of a plan to assassinate the President by a sniper & Johnson wants to use Swagger's skills & expertise to locate the sniping point & stop the assassination. Swagger reluctantly agrees but is double crossed as the Presidential assassination was bluff to cover their real target the Archbishop of Ethiopia & Swagger is framed for the murder, barely escaping the scene with his life Swagger is hunted by the police, the FBI & those responsible for the assassination & has nowhere to go or turn to. Swagger must uncover the truth & put away the bad guy's before they get to him...<br/><br/>Directed by Antoine Fuqua this fairy routine action thriller isn't too bad but isn't anything to write home about either, clocking at over two hours with a fairly exposition heavy plot that is surprisingly light on action Shooter is merely adequate at best. The plot is stand action thriller stuff, some one man army ex-military with a troubled past is forced out of retirement for one reason or another & basically takes on the bad guy's all by himself & predictably wins. Based on the novel by the Pulitizer Prize winning Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter this is a surprisingly slow moving action thriller that never really gets going, sure there is the odd fight & the initial action surrounding the assassination of the Archbishop & Swagger's escape is cool but the rest of it is quite low-key with only a couple of explosions & a few shoot-outs to show for it's two hour duration. The plot really isn't that clever or as cerebral as it thinks it is, we have had corrupt Senator's, evil US military Colonel's for hire & endless streams of bad guy's willing to line-up & get shot before many, many times & Shooter adds little to the mix. There are also problems with the plot, it's hard to believe that Swagger would fall for such a ridiculous plan & why does Swagger just take Johnson's word for it? Why not at least check him out or even ask what agency he works for? Considering he is the most wanted man in America with his face plastered all over the media Swagger manages to move around surprisingly freely, are we expected to believe that a gun used in an assassination isn't checked by the FBI at any point to make sure it even fires? The idea that the FBI wouldn't check maiden names for people connected with Swagger is hard to believe & quite why Swagger is let free at the end to kill the bad guy's is a mystery, didn't he still break lots of laws? At two hours long it does get a bit tedious & the lack of outright action becomes a problem, while not the worst action thriller out there Shooter felt like a direct to video mid budget flick. The character's are weak, no-one is given much screen time apart from Swagger & he's the most cold & emotionless person in the thing.<br/><br/>Most of the action revolves around long distance sniping & that gives the action scenes a detached feel as Swagger is rarely on screen with his nemesis, there are a few fights & a few stabbings but there's not much action going on. A house explodes & a few pipe bombs go off as well as a minor car chase but it's surprisingly small scale & forgettable. The look & style of Shooter is quite nice with a steady camera & none of that machine-gun editing that is so irritating in modern action films.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $61,000,000 this is well made I suppose, filmed mainly in Canada. Keanu Reeves was the original choice to play the lead but Walhberg got the part & he is alright if a little one dimensional. Singer Eminem was offered a part as a villain but turned it down while Danny Glover has an annoying whispering type lisp for some reason.<br/><br/>Shooter is a standard action thriller that doesn't have much action & doesn't work as a serious thriller because of all the implausibilities, a very cold & humourless film that I thought was watchable enough but nothing special & I doubt I would ever want to see it again."

Natually, Hollywood had to include a Senator spouting nonsense about the Iraq War being all about oil and that the government always lies because money rules the world, blah, blah, blah. Hunter's Bob Swagger is a true hero who only killed people trying to kill him. The ending of the Shooter just makes Swagger look like a killer. The best book of the series if one called Black Light.

"jahu-14571","6","1","1","11 October 2019"," Entertaining action thriller with some terrible writing
","I like thrillers, so this movie kept me well entertained, but it was also unintentionally funny thanks to bad writing.<br/><br/>When the movie starts during that mission in Africa, you know Bob's buddy isn't going to live, because he just took out the photo of his girl and started talking about her. Guess what, things go bad and an enemy chopper shows up. Bob tries to shoot it down with his rifle, but of course that's not good enough. Soon, machinegun fire from the chopper turn his buddy into Swiss cheese, but conveniently Bob who was standing right next to him is fine. Even more conveniently Bob whips out a high caliber rifle that he kept just for the occasion (instead of using it earlier).<br/><br/>So Bob gets involved with an assassination attempt conspiracy, but the bad guys lack the imagination to figure out that their plan has too many gaps and there will be people questioning the whole thing. Thankfully for the plot only a rookie FBI agent does and no one treats him seriously. Maybe except for that one female agent who gives him the benefit of the doubt. She is almost an interesting character by the virtue of having nothing about her explained (less said is sometimes more). Unless you count news anchor, shop owner and wife of some guy, the movie has only two female characters (not that more would help the silly plot).<br/><br/>Of course the only person who can help Bob at this point is his best friend's girl who conveniently trained to be a nurse (an protagonist is wounded when he reaches her). What I don't get is, why at this point Bob tries to take blame for his friends death. I mean, he sure could have taken the .50 cal out earlier, but it's not like the whole ordeal was his fault. Was he feeling guilty because his friend joined the army because of him? Also, conveniently the president assassination conspirators were indirectly responsible for the guy's death. And the movie will come up with some more reasons for protagonist to want them dead.<br/><br/>They could have kept the girl a secret from the viewer (instead of foreshadowing her at the begging) which would possibly made her a more interesting character when she finally shows up, but no. At leas they didn't pursue the romance route. It could've happen, they gave hints that it might happen, but in the end, it didn't happen or at least not on the screen (maybe some romance was filmed but later scrapped).<br/><br/>At some point, in the quest to clear his name and get the bad guys, protagonist assaults a well guarded house in the middle of nowhere. As he makes his escape he kills 2 dozen soldiers who probably weren't even part of the conspiracy. Did I mention, he takes out another chopper?<br/><br/>That's some ridiculous action and all, but that's not the point. The point is that the bad guys are really stupid. At the end of the flick, knowing full well that our boy Bob is free and at large, they place themselves in a house in the middle of nowhere (not unlike the one seen earlier) except this time without the army backup. Why are they surprised? You only wonder if Bob was smart enough, not to leave a ton of evidence on the crime scene (but I'm not sure if the writer thought that far).<br/><br/>On a plus note, I actually feel like reading the original novel now."

There's some decent actors in supporting roles, but it's the political stuff that really 'gets in the way' here. <br/><br/>WHen the film starts to dive a little too far into the political realm late, it really only highlights the improbability and ridiculousness of it all. We could have just shortened things a bit and left all of that a little more vague and it would have worked so much better.Or better yet, traded some of that stuff for the possible love-connection, while politically incorrect, might have added some spice with a little more impact than the political meanderings. It's like the ideas in the plot were good, but the execution failed. I think the writing in some of those scenes just kinda makes it seem a bit over-the-top. For example a late scene where he meets with the Secretary of defense and others is just awful. The pipeline stuff and mass-grave stuff are really good ideas, but the writing and scenarios/scenes for these ideas never come to fruition. <br/><br/>BUT, there's a lot of good here. When they're not overdoing the political stuff, they're making an excellent action film.

"jtindahouse","7","1","1","25 August 2011"," Good action flick with misplaced morality perhaps
","Not being the biggest action fan, but being a big fan of Mark Wahlberg at the moment having just seen The Fighter, and also being quite intrigued by sniper films, I decided to give Shooter a look. I got pretty much what i expected going in - and that was one of a couple of faults I found with this film.<br/><br/>I just felt, while there was the odd little twist here or there, overall the whole story felt by the book. Maybe not so much predictable, just unimaginative and nothing making you say ""wow, didn't see that coming."" At times it even felt a bit like a video game with all the casual shooting and killing of apparently more than expendable soldiers.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next problem. Who was really the villain in this movie? Wahlberg's character killed one hell of a lot of people in this film. Usually writers find a way for the hero to continue to evade capture and achieve their mission, eg. finding the real killer, without having to do serious harm to anyone. This film however seems to throw that rule out the window very quickly, and while that does make for better entertainment, is it really right that at the end he is let go scot free, simply because there wasn't proof he killed the archbishop? I'm not too sure how I feel about that one. I'm fine with villains getting away with things, I just don't like villains being portrayed as heroes or vice versa.<br/><br/>But squabbles aside this is a pretty darn entertaining movie. Wahlberg is fantastic as Bob Lee Swagger. So much so that I couldn't help wishing he'd been considered for the upcoming Jack Reacher film One Shot (also based around a sniper funny enough), in which Tom Cruise has recently been cast in the lead role. Which led me to wonder whether a franchise could be made out of the Lee Swagger role. While I think it would certainly be possible, there is perhaps just one too many similar franchises in circulation at the moment, ie. Bond, Bourne and hopefully Reacher soon. But nonetheless hats off to Shooter for being an above averagely entertaining entry into the increasingly blasé action genre. 7/10"
"ajs-10","7","1","1","3 July 2011"," A decent action-thriller...
","This film is based on a novel by Stephen Hunter caller ""Point of Impact"". It charts the betrayal of a marine sniper and his efforts to clear his name. Originally set around the time of the Vietnam War, the film brings events up to date and into the 21st Century. There's plenty of action and explosions, and even a damsel in distress, so it covers most of the bases. I'll give you my thoughts after a brief summary.<br/><br/>Marine sniper, Bob Lee Swagger is on a mission in Africa when is spotter, and best friend, Donnie Fenn is killed. Left to die by his superiors, he eventually gets out and immediately resigns his commission. Three years later he's living alone in the mountains with his dog when a Colonel Isaac Johnson comes to him with a proposal. There has been a threat on the President and they believe only a highly trained sniper could carry it out. They want Swagger to scout out possible locations and report back to them. They play on his patriotism and eventually he agrees. On the day the threat is due to become real; they insist he attends in order to advise them. Little does Swagger know, he is about to be set up. Injured, he escapes and, with the help of a couple of friends, he plots his revenge.<br/><br/>A very well made film with some nice action scenes, stunt work and CGI. A decent plot with plenty of twists and turns, not all of them too predictable, thankfully. Performance wise, I thought Mark Wahlberg did a decent job as Bob Lee Swagger, as did Michael Peña as FBI agent Nick Memphis. Of the bad guys, the pick of the bunch were, Danny Glover as Colonel Isaac Johnson and Ned Beatty as Senator Charles F. Meachum. Oh, and I should also mention the damsel in distress, Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn.<br/><br/>As revenge thrillers go, this is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff. There are no stand-out performances, outstanding dialogue or even radical plot-twists. One thing that did strike me was the total lack of humour, not even one wise-crack from a bad guy quite disappointing. But having said all that, it does do what it says on the tin and I did find it quite entertaining. It's never going to win any prizes, but still Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.7/10"
"CagedinSanity","7","1","1","14 July 2009"," Crappy ending, but well presented
","I just watched 4 movies in 2 days so excuse me if my brain is a little fragmented.<br/><br/>It's really hard to give this movie a number, because it has rattled between 5-8 in my head. So let's go with a 7. Every time I think it's a 5 because it's rather odd ending and lack of violent fight scenes, I just think of how well it presented itself.<br/><br/>So we got Mr. Swagger, a retired sniper. He's retired because his command left him and his partner to die (and his partner does) after a mission. 3 years pass and he's an isolated mountain-man complete with a loyal dog and a ponytail. A bit stereotypical but whatever, we'll roll with it.<br/><br/>So Danny Glover comes on the scene with a cracking voice that kind of tells me he's about to die any second. That said, he's an awesome actor... I just call it like I see it. Anyway it's rather obvious from the get-go, that his moral compass is so F'd up, it's amazing he finds his way to his car. (That's a line actually used in the movie, and it's so brilliant I'll be using it in the future). Danny's character wants Mark's character to plan a presidential assassination so they can actually PREVENT one. But the movie did a good job in making me NOT expect he was a double crossing asshole, but I had some hints. I wasn't expecting it, but I wasn't surprised, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>So. He get's double crossed, shot twice out of a building, and is framed for the murder of some African prince (who was 2 feet away from the president). So here comes the action, warts and all.<br/><br/>First, it actually gets SLOWER after he is shot. He goes through the entire middle of the movie running around bleeding and repairing himself... and eventually meets up with his dead partner's wife because, for some reason, he needs a second person to sow him up. Not sure why, plenty of action heroes patch themselves up and he was doing fine himself. But whatever, we need that OBLIGATORY love side-story. Once again, movies find themselves going a specific formulaic story and hope it works. And it doesn't, because they even go so far as having the woman CAPTURED and tormented for a while. Yea, totally didn't see that coming the second she let Swagger in her house. Sigh.<br/><br/>So that's pretty much the whole movie right there. Him running away. To be fair, he eventually does get all better, recruits a new sniper spotter (a pointless FBI agent, because they needed swagger to have more than a female ally, I guess), and does wreck some shop. But there's only, like, two good fight scenes that actually involve Swagger, doing... something.<br/><br/>Now this sounds pretty harsh for my 7/10, so let me get the redeeming quality out of the way before I drive the last spike through this movie's heart (Being the completely retarded ending).<br/><br/>It was a FINE movie. A good mindless conspiracy-action akin to Jason Bourne (Gods, I must have referenced the Bourne movies in my last 4 reviews, but it's hard not to) that simply spends too much time on the conspiracy and not the action. Doesn't hurt it too much, as it's got good actors with a fine script and the dialog fits every character (even if the rookie FBI guy was pointless).<br/><br/>However, the movie reminds us several times that this ""conglomorate"" cannot be defeated, and Swagger is just shooting at specters. This was a fine idea, showing us that not every enemy can be defeated. One of the enemies is a US Senator and killing him would be an instant-death-penalty or Life in Prison, as the characters imply throughout the finale. It tells us that the villains are practically unkillable. So what the FFFFF... is with the ending? Swagger storms a cabin full of the movie's villains bragging about how they won, and kills them all. The Senator's last words are ""Are you out of your mind? I am a U-S Senator!"", to which Swagger replies ""exactly"", and head-shots him. WHY? Sure, he bombs the cabin but if it's not perfectly obvious who was behind it, the people in the world of ""Shooter"" are complete F'ing morons.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have hated that so much if they just cut off that ridiculous ending. A better ending would be Swagger walking down a street, or walking back up to his home, and someone giving a final monologue about how the good guys don't always win. But no, this is America.

","During the late 70's Hollywood laid down a series of sophisticated films tackling the controversy surrounding the presidential administration at the time. Movies like All the President's Men and Marathon Man involved one man taking on the government after accidentally being exposed to sensitive life-threatening information. That era of Hollywood is clearly over, and despite the controversy that surrounds the current administration, documentaries are the only genre of film that seem to cleverly bring attention to these matters. Shooter is weighed down heavily with its own political agenda, that in this case seems to be the major priority, making the action a sort of obligatory addition. This is why Shooter is heavily flawed, and also why the action is heavily distracting , being that it makes little sense much of the time. There is a sniper stand-off in the snow, on top of a mountain for no reason whatsoever, other than to have the snipers themselves dressed in white instead of the usual camouflage we have become so bored of seeing them in. Mark Wahlburg, one of my favorite actors in recent years(coming off of this years best picture The Departed) is the vehicle for this homage to Rambo, making his resume slightly less attractive. Action junkies will be happy to see plenty of explosions, car chases(an insult to the French Connection), and a slew more one-liners that even Schwarzenegger would envy. All in all Shooter is exactly what it looks like, the only surprise was that none of the cast have shot themselves after seeing the final product."

","OK. I'm sorry. I know he's drowning in ""Departed"" love, but Mark Wahlberg is still just a so-so actor. He's tolerable in stuff like ""Invincible"" that doesn't stretch his ability. Kind of like Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me if You Can.""<br/><br/>Thankfully Wahlberg doesn't go all ""Gangs of New York"" on us with ""Shooter."" It is what he is: good-looking yet ho-hum. Kind of like Sylvester Stallone's ""Assassins."" Granted, the material here never really asks Wahlberg to create a character. So he grunts with pain, stares into the distance, and talks not a whole lot.<br/><br/>Luckily, the action's GOOD, exciting, and filmed well, like when Wahlberg blows up a propane tank which then blows up a helicopter. Cool stuff. Antoine Fuqua knows how to stage a fireball.<br/><br/>Too bad, then, about the ridiculous shadowy-government-conspiracy plot. And couldn't the producers at least have found someone less obviously evil than Danny Glover? <br/><br/>Keep your eye out for one shot that struck me as odd: Wahlberg slips on his sunglasses and struts in sol-mo towards the camera. It seemed to last for five minutes.<br/><br/>Better sniper flick choices: 1973's ""Day of the Jackal,"" 2001's Jude Law/Ed Harris sniper standoff ""Enemy At the Gates"" (at least for the action scenes) or even 2003's ""Phone Booth"" with Colin Ferrell."

No cliché is avoided, including the ubiquitous Ned Beatty in his celebrated corrupt senator role. I shan't waste time pointing out the various plot absurdities, not the least of which is the almost miraculous recovery of our man Mark Wahlberg from wounds fired from a handgun at almost point-blank range. Not only does survive a jump from several stories up, he then hijacks a car, is involved in a car chase - all the time apparently bleeding to death - plunges into the Delaware river, eludes and all-out man hunt, makes his way to Kentucky - and still has not bled to death - undergoes home surgery at the hands of his former buddy's widow - oh, I give up. It just gets worse and worse. Most certainly there will be many out there with brains the size of a pea who will cheer Shooter to high heaven. My advice is to give it a miss."

","""The Shooter"" is an extraordinarily disappointing excuse for a movie. In fact, it's so unbelievable that it wouldn't make a good Saturday morning cartoon despite the fact that all the characters are outlandishly cartoonish. The whole film seems to have drawn heavily from the far better done vigilante movies of Charles Bronson. As an armed avenging angel, mumbling Mark Wallberg is certainly no Charles Bronson. Not even close. The cartoonish and stereotypical supporting players are no great shakes, either, but the idiotic story line really doesn't give them much to work with. I had to laugh, though, when I saw short, fat Ned Beatty in the role of a US Senator and wondered if the movie's makers chose him for his uncanny facial resemblance to one of our former Secretaries of State. If so, I'm sure the former Secretary will not be all that pleased.<br/><br/>By far the only good feature of this movie is its cinematography. It's good to see Philadelphia for a change, a city not featured all that often in films; and the scenery in the mountainous far west is beautiful and spectacular.<br/><br/>Thinking about how awful this film is, I've only just realized that for years now explosions and gunfire have taken the place of yesteryear's car chases and demolition derbies in Hollywood's bag of action film stereotypes. I guess when you're making really stupid movies all you can really fall back on to get the audience's attention are explosions. If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with blasts.<br/><br/>Pyrotechnics aside, most of ""The Shooter"" is just a dismal dud."

Once the premise was revealed, however, the story fell flat, the dialogue became laughable, and the action sequences appeared to be remixes of what had been done before--I found myself remembering scenes from the The Fugitive, and the Rambo series.<br/><br/>Wahlberg was fine, and left nothing any other actor could have brought to this movie.<br/><br/>If those who read the book and watched the movie thought the movie was better, it doesn't say much about the book."

Including the fact that he self doctor's himself after taking two policeman's bullets.<br/><br/>After surviving an incident in Ethiopia where the USA isn't supposed to be having a military presence, Mark is recruited by a mysterious colonel played by Danny Glover to plan a presidential assassination from a distance, something he's an expert at. I mean really, if bells didn't go off in this man's head.<br/><br/>Anyway it's a set up, and Wahlberg spends the rest of the film out smarting the entire secret federal government which apparently is headed by a Senator from Montana played by Ned Beatty.<br/><br/>Shooter is a film way too caught up in its own agenda of showing the USA to be the big bad Satan of the planet earth. Everybody in the film has done better work and 50 years from now this will not be a big item at a Mark Wahlberg film festival.<br/><br/>Nice location photography and special effects.

","Think about this:<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg. Long-range rifles. Explosives. Those three things can bring a smile to my face, and when they're all piled into the same two-hour ball of fury, it can even make me blush. Shooter is the kind of movie that starts you out by grabbing the bull by the horns and not letting go the entire time. In every sequence in the movie, something happens that'll make you turn to your friend and go ""HOLY CRAP!"". Unless you go to see it by yourself, in which case, you might need some friends. The premise of the movie is simple, yet sufficient: an ex-military sniper (the best in the world) is set up for the murder of the Archbishop of some African country. However, one thing the government didn't count on was Bob Lee Swagger getting away from them. And so begins two hours of cat-and-mouse. Normally, I hate cat-and-mouse movies, but this one is just so awesome I can't help but love it. Supported by Danny Glover, Kate Mara, and Michael Peña, Mark Wahlberg leads a cast that are just really, really freaking BA. That's the only way to describe it. Marky Mark has become one of those actors that I will go see a movie just because he's in it (Shooter, The Departed, Invincible, Four Brothers, I Heart Huckabees, The Italian Job). The movie has a few twists and turns along the way, making sure to keep those who crave a smarter sort of action movie satisfied. It's no Bourne Identity-level plot, but it's enough to justify a few explosions and gunfights."

","This is the sort of silly anti-American (""It's all about oil!"") lefty Hollywood film that confirms to foreigners and soft-headed Americans that the USA is the source of all evil in the world. We have no enemies except ourselves. And it's not even good film-making: long stretches of it are boring, confusing, illogical (the Ethiopia story makes no sense), totally unbelievable, and, when all else fails, the film-makers resort to explosions and over-the-top violence, including the justifying of torture and assassination as long as they are done for politically correct reasons. The makers did not even do their research on military equipment and tactics -- nearly all of it is wrong -- and know nothing about how the US government operates. Beatty's Senator is particularly laughable as is the Attorney General bit -- whoever wrote those parts knows nothing about the law or how government works. I am also tired of movies with Canada standing in for the USA. I can always tell.<br/><br/>Wahlberg's acting is muted and passable (although he mumbles a lot) but most of the rest of the actors are just mailing it in. Glover is particularly bad -- he looks worn out, tired and bored. I did not give it one star as some of the scenery is quite nice and some of the explosions not bad.<br/><br/>If you want a political paranoia film that has some class, suspense, and humor then you should go see Pakula's 1974 ""Parallax View"" which this film tries to rip off without success."

I'm going to assume most of you have seen the trailer so you have a general idea what the film is about. And after seeing the film, I can say that the trailer pretty much shows you the entire film. Wahlberg plays yet another typical patriotic bad-ass but at least he played the role well. I didn't really buy into Danny Glover as the bad guy. But the film does at least feature a few memorable comedic bits (remember the ""Shovel"" speech, hilarious!) My biggest problem with the film was the ending and I won't spoil much but it just dragged too long before the ultimate climax. Overall, an average action film that maybe would have gotten a PG-13 had it not been for all the head shots.

"rajdoctor","4","3","7","15 April 2007"," Shooter
","Shooter Let me say it in the beginning. The movie is a typical 80's Hollywood action movie. This time the angle of the story is different.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story about a retired sniper Bob Lee Swagger  played by Mark Wahlberg (remember The Departed last scene shooter), who is called by Colonel Isaac (Danny Glover) to give expert inputs on protecting US President from sniper attack. Mark is pitched on the other side of the US law by government, CIA and FBI and framed for attempting murder of the US President. Now he has to prove find out the real truth behind his framing, prove himself innocent, and put the corrupt system in place like a Rambo. Kate Mara plays the love angel (it has to be there) of Mark, who like typical Bollywood style is taken hostage in exchange for the Mark to surrender. Michael Pena plays the supportive anchor for Mark in joining the battle against the corruption.<br/><br/>There are good action scenes that build up the adrenal, but all that we see is just repetition of what we have seen in numerous movies. The movie is full of clichés. The hero is larger than life. Because he gets shot in the beginning  throughout the remaining movie none of the bullets showered on him touches him! Kate Mara  has she done some plastic surgery on her face or what? Her role is the most loosely written and she tries to show sudden range of emotional changes that is funny! Mark Wahlberg tries to bring to lie the Die Hard, Rambo  one man army image; I should say that he succeeds to a large extend. I just hoped that he story, script and screenplay were tighter. The story is taken from one of the five novels written by Stephen Hunter on the main protagonist character Bob Lee Swagger. I assume that the thrill of the novel must be engaging and representing the scope of making it a movie, but the Director Antoine Fuqua fails to convert the book magic into an interesting movie.<br/><br/>Young teenagers might enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>(Stars 3.5 out of 10)"

"Rodrigo_Amaro","4","2","4","29 March 2010"," Disappointing effort in mixing action and drama.
","Hollywood has told many times the story of one good man who fights everything and everyone in the pursuit of good deeds or saving the world and even something more. Sylvester Stallone in the Rambo series or Matt Damon in the Bourne series are some examples of such characters that follows the same path just like the main character in ""Shooter"".<br/><br/>After a recent tragedy in which his partner was killed during an operation in Africa, Bob Lee Swagger(played by Mark Wahlberg), an ex-sniper special forces is approached by the Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) to get back in action in order to prevent a possible attack against the American president. Initially, Swagger turn down the offer, but since he's the only one who can track down a possible killer and because of his know-how about machine guns he moves forward. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie? Well, an not original story at all. Mark's character is involved in the assassination of the president (or attempt to an assassination of the president and the murder of a bishop, things very hard to understand), he has to fight with the people who contact him and discovers plenty of lies. We've seen this thing many times before. But worse than this, is the fact that this movie is filled with indecision. Antoine Fuqua, director of the brilliant ""Training Day"", unfortunately couldn't make up his mind and keep wrestling with the viewers stating a dramatic movie in one way and then a violent action movie in other way. This indecision affected the whole movie. The first hour is enjoyable, very thrilling, but after that is all downhill, and then rises a little bit in the climatic scene near the ending (the scene where the villains are happy and everything seems perfect to them until Bob reappears). The movie's result? Disappointing. Despite the fact that a great ensemble cast is included (names like Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija, Ned Beatty, Tate Donovan and Kate Mara are also in the movie), and many great action sequences, this is a low action film that went in the wrong direction. Michael Pena, a great actor in movies like ""Crash"" and ""World Trade Center"", has one the worst first appearances in a movie. In the beginning his character seems completely lost, not knowing anything that happened during the president's attack and all of sudden we're told that he's a training agent. FBI would put a guy like that in such a operation? And then he starts to investigate the plot and then he looks like an good agent? C'Mon!<br/><br/>And, of course, there's the reason why Bob was incriminated, which is quite good, but I don't think that's something interesting to be included in a supposed-to-be action movie. It may work to some viewers the political context, but if you don't like it stay away of this film.<br/><br/>I'm giving four stars because Mark Wahlberg and Danny Glover were good in it, some action sequences are quite entertaining (the beginning and the shootout in the house in the middle). That's it!"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","4","19 January 2008"," Starts strongly, but falters in the second half
","I saw this film in two sittings and, as luck would have it, interrupted my viewing pretty much at the point where it stops being one type of film - conspiracy thriller - and turns into the routine type of shoot-em-up that Arnie was making back in the mid-eighties. Sadly, that is where the film also starts to deteriorate. Up to this point - where disaffected military man Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and FBI agent Memphis (Michael Pena) pay a visit on the old guy who helped bury the guys who shot President Kennedy - it is an absorbing thriller that places Swagger in a seemingly impossible situation from which, using only his guile and military training, he must extricate himself. After this point, though, the film grows increasingly silly, piling up ludicrous plot twists with alarming speed as it abandons all logic in favour of big explosions and bloody violence.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film conspiracy theorists must love. Obviously inspired by the theories of Lee Harvey Oswald's innocence, it contains some neat ideas but is spoiled by too many plot holes and downright unbelievable plot twists (Swagger's immediate release from custody, for example, on his word that he had disarmed all his weapons before leaving home. OK then, you're free to leave? I don't think so, somehow).<br/><br/>Danny Glover, in the kind of role usually bagged by Morgan Freeman gives a good account of himself as a Colonel with questionable motives, and Pena is believable in a stereotypical role as the rookie FBI agent who is the only one to believe Swagger's protestations of innocence. Wahlberg is also good, although in a role, it has to be said, that would probably only stretch the most limited of acting talent."
"hall895","6","2","4","8 August 2007"," Not particularly memorable
","Shooter is one of those films which is neither memorably brilliant nor memorably awful. It's stuck in kind of a movie no-man's land, reasonably entertaining but no better than just OK. It's worth seeing but you really won't be missing anything if you skip this one.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this is one of those ""conspiracies gone wild"" movies in which the whole world is out to get our hero. Mark Wahlberg plays the hero in question, former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger. Swagger is framed in an assassination attempt on the President and the chase is on. The FBI and those shadowy conspiracy guys hunt Swagger down while he attempts to prove his innocence without getting himself killed in the process. It's pretty much up to Wahlberg to carry the film and he does a fine job of it. Some of the material he has to work with is not particularly stellar as the movie does tend to drag at times but Wahlberg creates an engaging, easy to root for character. The supporting cast doesn't offer much in the way of support. Playing the requisite romantic interest Kate Mara's southern accent leaves something to be desired but she's otherwise fine. But her character isn't given much to do. Danny Glover really seems to be mailing in his performance as the lead bad guy. Perhaps a lesser known actor would have brought more energy to the role, Glover just seems to be there to collect a paycheck. The best performance in the supporting cast comes from Michael Peña as the one FBI agent who actually seems interested in finding the truth. Other than Wahlberg, Peña really has the only well-developed character in the movie and the actor does a good job of bringing the character to life and showing the way he evolves as the film moves along.<br/><br/>So, what we end up with is a movie with a familiar plot, only a couple of decently written characters and some troubling acting missteps. The thing does take its sweet time in moving along, fifteen to twenty minutes easily could have been cut here without being missed. And too often the plot comes to a screeching halt for extended action sequences. Yes, you know going in this is an action movie but really, how many people can get shot and how many things can get blown up before you really become numb to it all? But if you really do like seeing things get blown up you're in for a treat. Explosions galore in this movie. In the end, the movie is a reasonably enjoyable ride. You get the sense it could have been a little better but at least be grateful because it certainly could have been a lot worse."

However, in good action movies the main character doesn't kill people unless he has to, e.g. in self defense. This was not the case in Shooter. Mark Wahlberg went on a killing spree. There were too many scenes where he kills 50 guys (and viciously kills them) just to get to one guy. Clearly, throughout the movie he pushed the limits of justifiable killing. But the last killing scene of the movie tipped the scale. Since Mark Wahlberg's name was already cleared, this killing was motivated by revenge rather than self defense.

And that's what makes this movie really fun when he starts to take things on the offensive.<br/><br/>My only criticism is, as I implied in my title, a few preposterous things happen so be prepared. You know, stuff like when a person gets shot multiple times but is still able to swim across the Delaware River. (I mean bullets, sure, but all that Jersey waste'll kill ya faster than battery acid.)

","23 March 2007. Warning: Spoilers. I can't say I was impressed with the ending, but most of the movie was involving and interesting. This solid action thriller is held together by Mark Walberg and contains the classic ""Three Days of Condor"" suspense and chase as well as the ""The Bourne Identity"" sophistication to make an overall nice thriller. Of course Walberg's near escape from death has already been pointed out as being a bit suspicious but the aftermath is handled about as well as any movie I've seen. There is a good interweaving of two characters trying on different tracks to solve this mystery, though its final explanation isn't as nefarious as some movies, more like ""The Interpreter."" While not in the top flight class of thrillers like ""Bourne Supremacy,"" this movie definitely adds to the quality of this genre. Seven out of Ten Stars."

"sddavis63","5","0","0","20 August 2017"," A Conspiracy Theorist's Delight
","If you're into conspiracy theories, then this movie is definitely for you! This is the conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theories. It seems to involve people in all walks of life. The military is involved. There's a senator. The FBI is playing a part. Local police officers are a part of this. The wealthy are definitely in on it. It's huge. One problem with the scenario is that I never quite was able to put my finger on exactly what the conspiracy was. The movie starts with a supposed American peace-keeping mission in Ethiopia going badly wrong. But from there - while Ethiopia is always front and centre - the conspiracy seems to widen and it seems to be about more than Ethiopia. The movie just started with Ethiopia. It's there that we're introduced to the character of Bob Lee Swagger (a name you have to love) - who's played by Mark Wahlberg. Swagger survives the debacle in Ethiopia, but his friend and partner doesn't and Swagger - filled with guilt - becomes a recluse back home. Then he's recruited to help stop an assassination attempt on the president (except that it really isn't) and ends up being framed for the killing of the ""Archbishop of Ethiopia"" who was appearing with the president. I didn't really get the point of making the Archbishop of Ethiopia the target of the plot - unless it was to somehow imply that the Catholic Church was also involved in the conspiracy? I thought ti would have been more powerful if it had been perhaps the President of Ethiopia who was killed. Also, the scenes toward the end of the movie portraying Swagger's meeting with the director of the FBI where he clears his name seemed unlikely. At the very least, it was too easy. Just as unlikely was the meeting on the snow-capped mountain. You have to see that one to really understand it.<br/><br/>So it's a kind of convoluted and ill-defined conspiracy, the point of which as far as I could tell was to make the rich richer? And what seem to be the climactic scenes (the two I described above) kind of sputter along unbelievably. There's certainly a lot of action in this, and it's not dull. Just a bit fuzzy around the edges if that makes any sense. I didn't really think that there was a need to develop a romance between Swagger and his late partner's widow Sarah. That seemed just too cliché for me. The performances were pretty good. Wahlberg was fine, and so was Kate Mara as Sarah and Michael Pena as the FBI agent who figures out that something's not right and ends up on Swagger's side. I did appreciate seeing veteran actors Ned Beatty as the entirely corrupt senator whose life and career seem to revolve around this conspiracy, and Danny Glover as the ""Colonel"" who recruits Swagger.<br/><br/>If you're really into conspiracy theories, this certainly gives you one to remember. If you're not - well, it's not a bad time waster anyway. (5/10)"

","I quite enjoyed the struggle of the abandoned sniper left in No Mans Land as an expendable asset, just like a piece of toilet roll or a tissue.<br/><br/>The fact that the CIA/FBI or whatever guy knew that a sniper would never poke his gun out of a window was a pretty nice breath of reality.<br/><br/>However, what I don't like is how many times this film got pretty easy facts wrong. With a sniper like a M107, firing at a range of, at most, 1,500M, travel time would be, rounded up, over 2 seconds. Yet Swagger seems to think that all rounds travel at the same speed. And, in the very first scenes, his Spotter uses what looks like an M4 with an M203 and a scope of some sort, yet he can accurately engage men at, as he quoted, 900 yards. <br/><br/>Various plot holes as well. When the attack helicopter made it's first run, it didn't use it's rocket pods, which would have killed both men. And, Swagger would have known that a 7.62 from an M24 wouldn't stand much chance of penetrating the canopy of a helicopter outfitted with rocket pods and guns that I didn't bother identifying, yet he decides that instead of using a M107 to engage, he would just fire his 7.62s at it, letting his friend die.<br/><br/>But of course, it's only a film, so I shan't pick at it any longer. I did like the soda can suppressor....Wait a second.<br/><br/>*Siiiiigh*. He called it a silencer. I immediately hate him more.<br/><br/>There is no such thing as an actual silencer. They suppress gunshots but the shot is still really loud, but of course this, again, is only a film, so I'll overlook it.<br/><br/>Also, love how the guys at the start of the film immediately know where the rounds are coming from, and set up a mortar for indirect fire accurate to about 20 feet of their position. That isn't them firing blind, that's just shell dispersion. The shots should be going all over the cliffs, considering it wouldn't be a stretch to have him in an outcropping anywhere on the face.<br/><br/>So, all in all, good action film, but horrendously bad at having it's facts straight."

","When it comes to action films Antoine fuqua is a pretty safe bet as a director and this film is pretty solid addition to his collection even though it does have problems. The premise of the film sees a retired sniper bought in by the government to try and prevent the assassination of the president. Until he is framed for the shot taken and ends up on the run. Now at first I wasn't sure if I was going to buy mark wahlberg as this deadly sniper but as the film progressed I started to like him more. He started to gain a bit of a personality and was damaged a bit showing his vulnerability. Michael Peña was also really good in this film, he is the cop hunting down wahlberg and he brings his usual enthusiasm to the role but a bit more modestly which I really liked. Kate Mara was okay in the film but I felt like her character didn't really have anything to do in the film and could have been completely written out of the film. Danby glover was completely underutilized in this film which ends up making it more difficult to get invested in the story. I like the revenge aspects of the story and when done I think they were done pretty well. But this film just got a little bit too convoluted for its own good and didn't do enough with its character to make you care enough. The script was okay with some good dialogue but sometimes it becomes wooden and boring with a bit of a lack of humour in there as well. The action scenes involving just simple sniping and stealth were really good. However, at some points there are literally choppers involved and it just becomes unbelievable and ridiculous. Overall this film is alright but there were simple things that could have been done to make it better."

As a whole though it is enjoyable action - easy to watch which gives it a very comforting quality. Most of performances are also good which gives it more credibility than you might have expected.

It follows all the typical plot ""twists"" but that's okay because it's done with enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays the action star that he always plays when in an action film but that's okay because he plays it well. He fully commits to the role - that borders on comical - and so therefore he makes it work.<br/><br/>Michael Pena is a surprise as his character starts slowly but evolves. He is the unlikely hero for a big Hollywood movie which frankly is refreshing.<br/><br/>The biggest miss is Kate Mara who I generally am a big fan. Her attempt at a Southern accent is painfully bad and borderline insulting. It's also unnecessary to the story as is the need for random scenes of her in a bra. While she is obviously beautiful, it would be nice for her career if she could be more than a body.<br/><br/>The Shooter has all the realism of Rambo 2 but that's not the point.

The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as former Marine Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger (who also happens to be a sharpshooter) retires and is in peace at home with his dog relaxing and doing target practice as usual, then he meets former Colonel Isaac Johnson (played by Danny Glover) and his other friends and they talk about a conspiracy to assassinate the president of the united states ( whose name is not mentioned in the film) for about five minutes or so then Johnson leaves Swagger's residence and after Johnson leaves Swagger thinks about it and approves of the idea. After a few days he says goodbye to his dog and goes on his way to assassinate the president , and after the archbishop of Ethiopia is done with his speech and the president and one of Johnson's teammates attempt to shoot the president and instead hits the arch bishop, then all hell breaks loose Swagger gets shot twice by a cop who witnesses the assassination attempt and runs away. then he meets FBI agent Nick Memphis (played by Michael Pena) who is just about to arrest him and again Swagger gets away realizing he just got framed.And also while watching this movie one other movie entered my mind without thinking about it and that was Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993) because of the chase scenes. Two things I find funny with the characters is the last names of both Wahlberg's character Swagger which is a term used to mean cool, and for Pena's character which is a town in the state of Tennessee. but in the end it was a very well done movie."

You don't need to have seen that many movies to guess what will happen to him in the next few minutes.<br/><br/>The story is very exciting and the script offers great action sequences, but in between the narrative is not very tense - especially as we switch between the hero, the FBI agent(s) and the private contractor guys, in the pivotal moments after the Philadelphia plot. The ending also feels disjointed and in your face: after the grand-scale shootout there is no longer a sense of immediacy and emergency, it's only about putting that scene here to tell this and that and bring the whole thing to a close.<br/><br/>If action is the best part of Shooter, characters are really the weakest. Everyone is either wooden or one-dimensional - sometimes both - so absolutely nobody shines in there! Mark Whalberg is as stiff as ever and his character doesn't even allow him to be more than this massive sharpshooting nerd while Danny Glover is nowhere edgy enough for his part.

I did not like Max Payne at all (and almost everyone did not) because to me, it was too slow paced either. We believe the posters, the trailers, but the movies become disappointing. At the beginnings of the movie, in the scene that Swagger tries to save the president from the assassination, there is a goof; the bad cop's visibility distance is perfect and he is not an amateur, but he misses Swagger. Is it possible that he does not want to do it? May be, otherwise, it is a goof. Returning to action, absolutely, I don't call this movie action, it is a thriller (but a bad one) The biggest action scene is the one takes place in the/in front of the cottage. However, even this is not long enough and seemed me mild. The snowy scene on the mountain is well visually, but not an action scene. Our man is wounded and goes to a woman and those parts steal a lot of time of the movie. Why they do that? Because of lack of enough budget? No, I don't think so. Because, directors are too lazy to make action scenes which is backbreaking? May be. Think about The Shooter and think about Die Hards, Mission: Impossibles, Bourne Supremacy etc. If you still think that Shooter is an action packed, then there is nothing about it."
"toms615","7","3","8","22 August 2007"," One of the best, technically speaking
","Following closely the original character in Stephen Hunter's book, ""Shooter"" goes beyond and adds depth to the Swagger character. Having Mark Walhberg actually take intensive training at FrontSight was did much in eliminating so many potential goofs. A movie aimed at the potential audience that ""Shooter"" aims at (no pun intended) has got to get it's technical aspects as correct as humanly possible. As such, ""Shooter"" succeeds.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not one for ""conspiracy"" themes, as they're often (always?)incredibly lame. Using FrontSight for technical advice was a stroke of genius; using Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky for political advice was stupid. Just using the original novels storyline would have made a good movie a great movie.<br/><br/>Seven of ten stars."
"moviegeek310","7","3","8","2 April 2007"," So-so movie, pretty awesome action.
","I really had no idea what this movie was about going into it, and I still don't really know coming out. Basically, it's your run-of-the-mill action movie, where the guns never stop blazing. I did like this film; it just wasn't extremely well made. Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger  what kind of name for an action hero is that?  a retired sharpshooter. Fresh off his Oscar win, Mark does a good job as the Rambo-type character. In one scene he even fixes a bullet wound with basic items from a grocery store, MacGyver style. He's the type of guy that if you saw him walking down the street, you'd cross to the other side of the road. Director Antoine Fuqua (King Arthur, Training Day) does a good job at pacing the film, and keeping it interesting, and though I haven't read the book the movie was based on, apparently he kept it faithful. The cinematography was nothing special, but at least kept the movie intense.<br/><br/>What I caught from the plot in between explosions is that Bob Swagger is hired to prevent a sniper assassination of the president. Instead, he is set up and is made to look like the assassin. After, it's just your classic tale of revenge on the bad guys. There is much more to the plot, but I didn't catch it or remember it, because I was to excited for the next slam-bang shootout. Another problem aside from the plot is that by the end of the two hours, you get a little tired of the same action scenes over and over, but it still is cool. ""Shooter"" is a movie pretty much catering to testosterone loving dudes, and the girls will just find it repulsive, and stupid. So guys, this one is for you, and if you're like every other guy and like non-stop action, then you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is rated R for strong, graphic violence and language."
"blanbrn","8","3","8","23 March 2007"," Good action drama. With a great plot and a big twist of conspiracy and corruption.
","""Shooter"" so far has to be one of the best movies, I've seen of 2007 due to it's interesting plot and well paced action. The story is good you have Mark Wahlberg as an ex-marine and experienced marksman who is one day called in by some former associates to conduct a supposed assassination on the president only to have him prevent it! Well this is a big frame up by corrupt government people especially ring leader federal man played by movie vet Danny Glover. So then the attempt is to unmask the real assassins of an archbishop and not the intended president! And the framing begins as the government tries to prove the bullet came from the Wahlberg characters weapon, leading to a wild chase from Philadelphia to Kentucky and Virgina and ending up in the nations capital for a climax. And plenty of fun is experienced watching this movie with it's action and will to survive and it was good to see Ned Beatty as a corrupt U.S. senator who's in on the benefit of schemes to help his power. This is a likable film due to the action and acting of Wahlberg and it does a good job of showing about government corruption and right-wing federal conspiracies. It gives hope that real justice like that of the old west or Rambo style needs to be brought back to the real world. Hopefully this film can also spark a new franchise for Mark."
"jakeyoftampa","7","3","8","13 March 2007"," Surprisingly Intelligent
","Although advertised as a typical bang 'em up action flick, ""Shooter"" is a surprisingly intelligent and even provocative film. Mark Wahlberg ably plays the title character, a former Marine who finds himself involved in an elaborate political scheme. Wahlberg adds depth and charisma to a role that could have easily been played by any run-of-the-mill wooden actor (think of Stallone and Seagal flicks in the '80s). He's backed up by a strong supporting cast, including Michael Pena as a wide-eyed FBI agent, Danny Glover as a morally ambiguous superior, and Kate Mara as the Southern belle who also ends up tangled in the crossfire. Rhona Mitra, however, is wasted in a role that likely ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is, obviously, an unapologetically violent film; Men are shown being shot in the head, chest and neck ad nauseum. But the filmmakers realize that the most disturbing violence in the film is that of an establishment that is free of remorse, and while it may take excessive violence to get there, the point is proved."

Pena develops the character with finesse, so you believe the transition he undergoes from FBI agent to Swagger's assistant and contemporary.<br/><br/>Kate Mara (hottie #1) as Sarah Fenn is refreshing and believable, moving from confusion to commitment to rage in her efforts to help Swagger.<br/><br/>Rhona Mitra (hottie #2) as agent Galindo is perfectly professional and comes off as the woman who wants to keep her job while defending the efforts of Agent Memphis.<br/><br/>Elias Koteas is the brutal, cold and ruthless enforcer whose experiences have led him to believe he is above the law.<br/><br/>Both Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are impeccable as Col. Johnson and Sen. Meachem, the villains behind the scene, all more villainous because the operate under the guise of law.<br/><br/>Overall the film is quick and tight, with clearly defined good guys and bad guys, and the cinematography, photography, and script are a perfect fit.<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, language, and sexual sadism, it is sad to say the teens have probably seen this level of violence in the online games they play, but the little ones probably don't need to see it.

Well, at least he does what he's paid for, and some scenes turned out very well. <br/><br/>What didn't turn out so well was making him a Rambo. A shooter? A SHOOTER? A shooter is a silent man miles away, bringing instant, painful death via large smoking hole in the head. Not overgrown kid running around with guns blazing... In last case, I'd prefer a robot from the future or one true overgrown kid - Sylvester Stallone. The one who actually fits into this role and is a cute killing machine.<br/><br/>The scenes with house in the mountains (so MacGyver) and killer pulled into killing without him wanting this is a very special trademark of EVERY S.Seagal movie, and it could describe intro random movie of his. You knew that, didn't you. And this even isn't one of his films!<br/><br/>Few nice scenes aside, I don't really recommend this movie to anyone.<br/><br/>I don't think that there's many bad movies. ..

","To say this film was bad would be rather harsh. The action sequences were well crafted with excellent lighting and great cinematography to boot. I was slightly disappointed however, not by the storyline but by the sluggish and ever so dumb delivery of the plot, each juncture was covered, any misnomers explained, leaving nothing for the intuitive film goer to 'get ones teeth into' so to speak. Apart from appreciating the action the film had to offer, (an appreciation of which can only, of course go so far for any film) I found myself board and disappointed by a predictable and overly simple plot / delivery combination, and also becoming agitated by the ever increasing notion that this film had been made for a remedial audience.<br/><br/>'Shooter' has some great scenes and Mark Wahlberg gave a gritty and distinctive performance in this film with great support from Michael Peña. I was impressed by Rade Serbedzija's performance but felt it was sadly let down somewhat by the dull script and slightly 'out of kilter' screenplay. With this in mind I think the film has not achieved what it set out to do, which was to make a gritty, epic, action thriller. Instead, apart from a couple of good performances and some good action moments, it has ended up as an easy to follow, slightly 'dumbed down' film, sure to entertain the masses yet also sadly sure to disappoint the few who might go looking for a gripping and stimulating action thriller."

Pena was great in his role, what a wonderful actor, he made the movie come alive. Otherwise, its an airport novel ""thriller"" book brought too directly to the screen. The setup was interesting but then the plot lost its way. The whole idea of the ""good"" super killer sniper compared to the ""bad"" super killer sniper made explicit how absurd this notion was, how could one honestly root for someone who was responsible for so many dead people under dubious circumstances.

The female actresses are very pretty and supportive of their men (the Wahlberg character has an accomplice), but the main character is the Shooter.

Finding Philadelphia as the perfect place for the assassination to be successfully executed Bob Lee Swagger is also to later finds out that he in fact is the pasty chosen, by those behind the scenes, to take the fall for murdering the President of the United States!<br/><br/>Everything goes perfectly with President Butler, who had no knowledge of what was happening, in fact used as a ploy to knock off guest speaker Ethiopian Archbishop Desmond Mutubo, Dean McKenzie, who's the real target of the assassination attempt! Knowing within seconds that he's been set up in Mutubo's assassination Swagger makes his escape after being shot by Officer Simmions, Alan Peterson, who's in on the assassination plot, and who's later murdered himself, and is on the run for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>There's the usual and expected heroics by innocent fugitive from the law Swagger who with the help of his former and dead US Marine buddy Donnie Fenn's, Lane Garrison, wife Sarah, Kate Mara, and rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis, Michael Pena, eventually uncovers who was behind Archbishop Mutubo's assassination. Swagger soon realizes that he in fact was unwittingly responsible for a mass murder committed by a rouge US Government agency headed by the mysterious Col. Isaac Johnson, Danny Glover, some three years ago in Ethiopia! It was this knowledge and his willingness to reveal it to the American public that lead to Archbishop Mutubo's murder!<br/><br/>The movie ""Shooter"" is filled with shocking revelation in how people high up in the US Government use their office and the power that goes along with it to commit crimes worthy of Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union! What makes ""Shooter"" so effective and at the same time disturbing is that a lot of what it brings out in its storyline you can read and see in your local newspaper or network TV news show!<br/><br/>The only thing about the film that's way off target is its very feel good ending that, despite being one of the best and most exciting sequences of the movie, ruins its credibility which was the best part about it up until then. Still ""Shooter"" is not a movie to be ignored, even though many high up in government would want you to, since its one of the most accurate conspiracy film to ever come out of Hollywood! And thats saying something in these troubled times where after 9/11, in fact there's a scene in the movie where Swagger is seen reading a book titled ""9/11"", where publicly being critical, like ""Shooter"" is, of the government can get you either fired from your job or disappeared into a government run hell hole detention camp like Gitmo or Abu Ghraib!"

It can be predictable and a little cartoonish. However, this movie is more intelligent than your usual cup of action. Mark Wahlberg is great, and the shootouts are a pulsating experience. If I can have this much fun at an action movie, than it's one that works."

","I have included a spoiler warning as a precaution although I am only going to talk about the first half hour (about a quarter) of this movie.<br/><br/>Expert sharp-shooter Bob Lee Swagger (played by a very solid Mark Wahlberg) lost his friend and spotter in an operation in Africa because the support camp pulled out at a critical moment, leaving them behind to face a battalion of soldiers, artillery and even helicopters. Survived, he quitted and lived in idyllic seclusion in the company of just one faithful dog. Three year later Colonel Isaac Johnson (an equally solid Danny Glover) seeks him out because he is one of the few men in the world who can foil an assassination attempt on the US president during his public appearance in one of three big cities, with a shot fired from a mile away. After checking out the three potential targets on location, taking into consideration the impact of wind on the bullet that will have to travel 6 seconds, Swagger eliminates Baltimore and Washington, focusing on Philadelphia. Comes the fateful day. The government security people, under the direction of Swagger, sets the trap for the would-be assassin. Climax. Only ten seconds to the anticipated shot. Can they stop and catch the assassin in time? End of the movie? Well, my half-hour is up, and it's only the beginning.<br/><br/>Without divulging anything further, let me just say that this movie is better than most in this genre. You would of course see the intrigues and double-crosses, but the plot here, unlike many no-brainers you have seen before, has evidence of a brain behind it. The pace may be just a little slack at times but the actions, when you get them, will not disappoint.<br/><br/>What I like best about this movie is its guts, in giving people in power and high places a relentless hard slap across the face. But times have changed too. Unlike the good old days of James Stewart and Gregory Peck, when justice under the system always prevails, we are shown a harsh reality in which the system is not working any more. Poetic justice has to be bought, with violence and violation of the system, taking the law into your own hands. Has our world really come to this? It's impossible not to ask, emerging from the escapism of the cool dark cinema into the reality of cold, harsh daylight."
"erikgloor","8","2","6","16 April 2007"," A Total Gas
","Prepare to not be bored by a single scene in a movie.<br/><br/>That seems to have been the guiding principle in the making of the latest Mark Wahlberg vehicle, 'Shooter.' Wahlberg plays a Rambo-like uber-sniper who can shoot someone's head off from a mile away. And as grisly as the kill scenes are and as appalling as the body-count gets in this film, you'll never be able to accuse it of having not kept you riveted.<br/><br/>In a twisty plot that addresses, if not engages one's intellect ( as well as one's apparent need for gratuitous violence ), Wahlberg's Bob Lee Swagger is coaxed out of retirement to help that ""hidden hand"" part of our government that's always up to no good in the movies. They tell him the president's been threatened with assassination and they need him to plot a defense. Turns out he's been set up to be a patsy in the way a lot of conspiracy theorists suppose Lee Harvey Oswald was set up for the JFK assassination.<br/><br/>But what if Oswald somehow escaped the hidden hand and set out to expose everyone involved? Swagger assembles a working-class team of three to take on a Colonel-turned-spook; a fearsome Russian defector; a comically Machiavellan U.S. Senator; their assorted goons, and a federal bureaucracy overrun with the kind of cynical, self-serving jerks everyone supposes it must be. Along the way, stuff blows up, people get their arms shot off, innumerable heads explode and I must admit, it's a total gas.<br/><br/>Somehow, Wahlberg strikes just the right note in another understated blue-collar hero and is almost totally believable as an expert marksman, survivalist, commando, and dude who can beat anyone in a fight.<br/><br/>What disappoints is the standard Hollywood hokum that crops up inevitably: Guys sprinting through a hail of automatic weapons fire without injury; life-saving rescues just in the nick of time; unmotivated and often absurd heroics; gunshot wounds that heal in a weekend with no lasting effects. This film is smart enough not to need any of this junk, but embraces it out of habit, apparently.<br/><br/>You probably won't feel good at the end of this movie in the way you don't necessarily feel good after a looping, high-velocity roller coaster ride -- but you definitely won't be sorry you saw it."

","Don't mention about the trailer... Even I've never really seen it =P... but the movie is basically what the poster is showing you or trying to tell you. A shooter who shoots with marvellous marksmanship and shoots at an extreme distance which is considered impossible for many. The character Bob Lee Swagger, or Swagger for short is played by Mark Wahlberg, a highly skilled sharpshooter arduously trained by the United States Army. He was sent for (in this movie intro) a peacekeeping mission which turned awry and became a shoot-to-kill mission, in what appears to be a dramatic shooting event, after which they were left to battle out for their lives. His partner and best friend, Donnie Fenn (his spotter) was killed on that mission.<br/><br/>Despite having escaped from that dangerous escapade, he seek no revenge but lived out his life in a mountaineous region blanketed with trees with his dog, though he never will be able to forget the tragic incident which led him to retire prematurely. Hunting quickly became his only hobby and favorite pastime and not until 3 years later when the US Army sought his help back then again. This time, the Secret Service (apparently) went to him with a CMH medal to show their loyalty to king and country, to protect the country from enemies, foreign and domestic. The viewers are then introduced to a Colonel Isaac Johnson who earned that CMH (Congressional Medal of Honor - America's top award medal bestowed on those who went above and beyond their call of duty to save lives or show their loyalty to King and Country) for something in which he claimed that he did something silly. Swagger was persuaded to join in for a mission in which intel received and reported claimed that an expert sharpshooter was hired to take down the President of the United States (POTUS) during his welcoming speech in an event which took place in Philadelphia where the Archbishop Desmond Mutumbo (Dean McKenzie) was there to visit America and gave his speech. After some encouraging words and self-conscience instilled into Swagger by the Colonel as what all defenders of the country would do if they were him, he finally gave in and travelled to certain parts of America to sweep out potential given sites for the presidential speech which will be held (prior to this, they weren't sure which would be the favorited spot). What they wanted him to do was to sweep all the potential sites to see where would the sharpshooter most likely be if he were the killer. The ""enemy"" was suppsed to be the best and highly skilled brought in from another country for the assassination. What all seem to be like a well-versed mission, came something wrong when no actions were done by the Secret Service to pull out the assassin, instead they got a low-life fake cop to punch Swagger with 2 bullets from point blank. Falling to his great height from the stake out building, the story in this movie then starts on how he tried to salvage his own life through the streets of America; hunted severely not being able to go to a hospital.<br/><br/>With his time spent in the Army, it was clear that the skills he picked up along the way did him good, like what he mentioned in a line in the movie. First we were trained to kill people, and then we were trained to keep ourselves from not getting killed. He managed to survive through the ordeal after getting shot, in which many would have thought that he would have died from torrential bleeding. Recovering from the typical method of not being able to get himself hospitalized is quite normal nowadays for US Army and any other civilians alike in movies when they are being hunted especially. But the beauty is that you learn creative things and how to improvise the simplicity of things to be used as a medical aid. I did learn something interesting, but of course, applying it would be ridiculous. You watch for yourself =P Aside from the thin plot which raises few eyebrows, the way the movie was crafted to build up the suspension on the usage of sound and visual effects was superb. For counterstrikers, you would simply love this movie; needless for me to even start to involve people who are interested in headshots, guns, bombs, improvisation skills on home-made weapons and martial arts? For statisticians and strategy-lovers, Shooter has it all in a pack to appease your appetite for lots of killings, shootings, planning, strategizing and well, maybe a bit of a romance left intact.<br/><br/>This thriller/action movie may not be the best in comparison to the Die Hard's serials, but it's definitely more realistic in comparison to the Transporter 2 (I'm still 'awed' by the flying Audi that has the capability to do backflips and somersault to detach the electronic bomb planted below)."

"eernie76","4","2","6","24 March 2007"," Disappointing if you've read the books
","Being a huge fan of Stephen Hunter, I had high expectations when I heard they were making a movie based on one of the Swagger books (Point of Impact). I've been saying for years that this series lends itself to a potential movie franchise. Then I heard that Mark Wahlberg was set to play Bob Lee. Nothing against him as an actor, I think he is very talented and was brilliant in The Departed. But this character is supposed to be a Vietnam vet and I didn't think he had the right look or age for such a role. Then I saw the movie. They tried to modernize it by making Bob Lee a Marine sniper doing special opps in Etheopia a couple of years before the story takes place instead of a Vietnam War vet. My opinion is this detracts from the character and the story significantly. And anyone who has read the books I think would agree with me. I also got the impression that there is no intention to continue this series as a franchise, either. I don't see how that is possible. For starters, future stories revolve heavily around the death of his partner Donnie Fenn, a scene which was summed up in about 5 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Not to mention Bob Lee's relationship with Donnie's widow Sarah whom they dumbed down to nothing more than eye candy in the movie. I don't think she appeared fully clothed in a single scene (not that I minded all that much). And then there's Bob Lee's father Earl. A lot of the future books revolve around him. Earl was a WWII vet and some of the books take place during that era. If Bob Lee is supposed to be as old as he was portrayed in the movie, there is no way his father could be a WWII vet. I don't see how this series is supposed to continue. Which is sorely disappointing to me. I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the movie here, but it was hard for me to enjoy it since I'm such a huge Hunter fan. As a stand alone movie, I guess it was OK. I probably would have enjoyed it more had I not read the books. So if you haven't read them, check it out. If you have and enjoyed them, go see it with caution."

With smart, intense action scenes right from start to finish, the movie had me fully enthralled for the entire 2 hours.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is one of those rare actors who can carry a whole movie playing the infallible tough guy who knows what's right and will not fail to enforce it regardless of pain or the odds against him.

"elshikh4","7","1","2","26 February 2010"," When Fiction Speaks The Truth !
","Now this is an action thriller to live long.<br/><br/>In this script, (Rambo) meets (The Fugitive) in a very good way. It gives us hot conflict, action, and - surprisingly - serious points. True that all the factors were used hundreds of times before, like: kill the friend, frame the innocent, kidnap the girl to threaten the good guy, or having a helpful sidekick, a noble hero who doesn't die tragically, and an eraser solution for the big gamers lastly.. but it worked, sometimes highly. For instance, look at the meeting in the snow, where the hidden shooters have been killed one by one by another, smarter, hidden shooter; this is unusual stuff for what's supposed to be usual short scene. Or how there is always someone to spell out the missing facts, and answer most of the questions, though this time it was ""for keeping you till they come, and it must be the truth otherwise you'd leave!"". And it got more than a hot time..<br/><br/>The thing about the political satire is that it's so familiar nowadays to pick up the evil guys from the newspaper's front page, namely out of the politicians or the president's men. For one reason, they got out of their holiness since Watergate, and for another, the common evil guys ran out of gloss already. Let alone how powerful they are, and how hateful they can be too. But when it comes to (Shooter), it's not another (Absolute Power - 1997)'s dealing where the president of the Untied States is totally insane bad guy. It has politically involved evil guys, and a political point of view as well.<br/><br/>Although the characterization fits another commercial Hollywood moneymaker, but not with a peaceful manner this round. Here, you'll hear great lines like when the corrupt Senator (Charles F. Meachum) speaks his mind freely: ""There are no sides. There are no Sunnis and Shiites. There's no Democrats and Republicans. There's only haves and have-nots."", or: ""This is a country, where the Secretary of Defense can go on TV, and tell the American public, oh, that this is about freedom! It's not about oil! And nobody questions him, because they don't wanna hear the answer, because it's a lie!"". It's obvious, so bitter, remark about the filthy war in Iraq, which links up perfectly with Mr. (Rate) character's remark, which I loved the most, about the big lies: ""They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, WMDs were in Iraq, and Anna Nicole married for love."" They are great lines, simply because they're true!<br/><br/>There is such a striking satire against the plots of the undeclared American policy since (J.F.K) assassination: notice well how the crime scene, in the movie, is so unquestionably similar to the one of (Kennedy)'s, how eliminating the killers fast is a security move to hide the higher real conspirators which's mentioned clearly in the movie's dialogue, then see the similarity between the name of the movie's lead (Bob Lee Swagger) and the name of (Kennedy)'s supposed assassin, who had been killed vaguely, (Lee Harvey Oswald). Actually the movie, while being the fair fare, connects angrily and finely many hidden plots from the 1960, in latent way, with the recent wars in Ethiopia or Iraq, however in explicit way, to assure that power and money were the real motives all along. And it's no mistake if you find yourself asking where did I see before that shot of that fat bald Senator, played by (Ned Beatty), firing a shotgun near the camera in hunting gear, because the answer is quite known: it's (Dick Cheney); the Vice President of (George W. Bush) at the moment, or as what (David Letterman) used to call him: ""The Lie Count""!<br/><br/>The script's only point of weakness remains at its last 10 minutes. Yes, the lead had to burn his important evidence, the mobile's record, just to ensure his life until getting to the investigation's authority. Yes, he had his proof of innocence within his gun. But any of these, if managed to keep him alive and prove him not guilty, doesn't relate a thing to Colonel (Isaac Johnson), played by (Danny Glover), at all. So it was so naive moment when they showed the committee of investigation the photos of the massacre of Ethiopia; this is in no way a childish conviction, or a complete ""blank shot"". Moreover, when the movie triumphs eventually for the bloody justice of revenge as a substitute for the incapable law, it's nothing but easy, so tacky, even predictable solution that lowered (Shooter) to be a (Death Wish) movie, with high quality and earnest talk!<br/><br/>The direction made a close to flawless job. Every minute was catchy and masterful, with plentiful satisfying action. The acting wasn't that great, but the script didn't go deep much, so it kind of served the main aims. It's only (Michael Peña) as (Memphis) who seemed like clueless idiot, and (Glover)'s voice that seemed utterly sick. The music didn't try to emphasize any important sense, or leave any effect.<br/><br/>Despite anything, this above average entertaining movie will live long indeed. After years, hope not to be too long, it will be re-watched with more appreciation for being that bold at its time, to say the truth about what not many of the major studios' movies dared to even speak about or hint to. Hence, with assured next books, TV shows, etc. that will say the truth about the 2000s decade, the other Vietnam (or Vietnams!), and the real motives--this movie will be there and ready. Sometimes, fiction has truth more than what reality does!"

","Shooter is one of those rare joys where a film which, on the face of it, offers an average package of enjoyment, turns out to deliver much more.<br/><br/>It is an action/conspiracy thriller where protagonist Wahlberg's master sniper is manoeuvred into position as a patsy for an assassination within a conspiracy where all loose ends end up dead. The tension in the film is created by uncertainty as to whether Wahlberg's resourcefulness will be sufficient to protect him against the sheer power of the forces ranged against him, both political and physical.<br/><br/>The film is intelligently plotted and steers clear of many of the glib shortcuts commonly encountered in such movies. For instance, Wahlberg is shot early on and, rather than soldier on manfully clutching his wound, he actually has to address the fact that the wound is sufficiently debilitating that it will kill him unless it is properly dealt with.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well realised, there is some interesting gun stuff if that's your thing, and the performances are all good. Wahlberg delivers on the action, although his performance is not particularly nuanced, and I was never convinced that the incisive intelligence of this well-trained survivor resided within the same body as the action man hero. Danny Glover's voice seems to have developed a speech problem of some kind.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie a great deal more than I expected to."

","Antoine Fuqua, the director behind the tight Training Day and not-so-tight Tears of the Sun, directs Jason Bourne.. um, Mark Wahlberg in a very Bournish agent action/thriller film. Sounds mildly interesting, but turns out to be a great improvement over Tears of the Sun, and nearly as good as Training Day.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger, a sniper who got betrayed by his employers and was left in the battlefield with his best friend. Swagger survives but his friend dies. Embittered by this Swagger leaves the army and moves into a wilderness to live a solitary life. After three years Swagger is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (always fantastic Danny Clover) and offered a new mission, to prevent an assassination of the president. Swagger eventually accepts the mission and for this point on the ride begins with its twists, turns and some high adrenaline packed action.<br/><br/>This film deserves a credit for its abiding interesting script, I couldn't wait to see how this story would unfold, and its well paced and gruesome action scenes, there were numerous head shots as you could guess there would be in a sniper movie, and hand-to-hand combat scenes were realistic and brutal as well. Swaggers jiu-jitsu skills compete with his sniping skill.<br/><br/>But there were three major flaws which prevents Shooter getting a higher rating from me. One star away from every these fooleries: 1. Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara). Not a bad acting but her character was absolutely needless. And thanks to her scenes this film drags a bit in the halfway.<br/><br/>2. The ending was quite disappointing, but not going to say anymore about it, don't want to spoil it for anyone. Seems that some viewers actually think that's a great ending.<br/><br/>3. The whole America thing. Im not saying that this was anti-American or pro-American, and I don't really care if this was either one, I'm just SO bored with films commenting the state of America somehow. I live in Europe and I do not care! For Americans, think it like this, imagine if, for example, France would produce movies for universal distribution as much as Hollywood. And every second french movie would handle french government or politics somehow at least in some subplot. Would you grew tired of it?

","I have to admit I found the violence, which was a bit excessive, to be an integral part of the story. In Shooter, the good guys win in the end by a landslide! Not only do the good guys win, but they have to win! The mass murder of innocent civilians that took place in the name of corporate & government power in ""Ethiopia"" can not be allowed to happen all over again in Ecuador! In this film you are left only with black & white, life & death choices. <br/><br/>While this is supposedly a work of fiction, Hollywood, in my opinion, just substituted Ethiopia for Nigeria, or perhaps, Cameroon!<br/><br/>It's a simple fact: There are so many mercenary forces around the world for hire, they are even currently employed, in a huge way, to fight in Iraq against the insurgents! So it's not so far fetched that they are being used in very poor countries to get rid of tribal/indigenous people who are trying to stop large development projects, like an oil pipeline. I know I would get a bit testy if some outside force, in cooperation with my central government, was going to force me off my land and/or harm the environment that my family is dependent on for wholesome food and clean water! (For further information on on this complex subject, see the obscure documentary - ""Pipe Dreams"" by Terri Hathaway or read anything by the late Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.)<br/><br/>But what does this have to do with the American justice system? I couldn't think of a more scathing indictment than when the U.S. Attorney General, himself, throws up his hands in the air and says there is nothing he can do! How can the most powerful U.S. law enforcement agency possibly stop American mercenaries in the employ of corporate and government interests working both inside and outside of the United States? In other words - when it comes to extreme human rights violations, the lofty U.S. Justice system is powerless, and only the story's hero has the courage, and ability, to stop these foul villains from committing further atrocities in the name of progress!<br/><br/>What a commentary on American society!"
"thejimhale","10","2","7","3 April 2007"," Great flick
","Always been a big fan of Stephen Hunter and this movie did not disappoint. The film moved with great action and visuals throughout. This is the first film I actually liked Mark Wahlberg in, and though I didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Kate Mara, it was superfluous to the movie itself. Don't wait for the DVD, the big screen added quite a bit to the visuals. I will say that if I had the option of picking the actor for Bobby Lee Swagger it would have been Tom Beringer. That being said Wahlberg was very believable as a ex-special forces guy. It is obvious he worked out quite a bit in the gym for the role. Danny Glover gets better and better as an actor. He plays the cynical government man to the tee. Somewhat unbelievable that a supposed Congressional Medal of Honor winner would be so sleazy but... whatever."

"kooleshwar","8","2","8","26 April 2007"," Return to the 80's style action movie...
","I've been off new movies for a while now thanks to the sheer amount of emotional content even in relatively simple actions movies of late, even Casino Royale felt more like a romantic movie than an action one.<br/><br/>The fact my friends and I decided very late that we wanted to see a movie and this was the last show of the day.<br/><br/>I expected another love on the run kind of movie going by the adds, considering the fact that fugitives on the run always fall in love in the last decade or so.<br/><br/>BUT BOY WAS A I Surprised.....<br/><br/>Action Movies in classic period 70-80s weren't about love, like the movies of today, they were about simpler and stronger themes like hate, anger, revenge, saving the world,survival or sometimes even none of the above. They were action flicks pure and simple and made with the boys in mind, with good special effects, lots of blood and gore, and the scantily clad women who weren't always the love interest. Those were the years, you had the occasional emotional action flick but those were appreciated as there were not many of them. (PS as i say this I must say I'm only 24 and watch movies on DVD's now and Video before that I've grown up loving boy movies like predator, aliens, Rambo etc.).<br/><br/>This movie is the simplest big budget action film I have seen in years, which is like the 70s and 80's action flicks.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about love, its about feelings that are often much more stronger, PATRIOTISM, HATE, REVENGE.(The best part is that the intimate moments don't culminate in a kiss,an event that was hardly seen action films of yesteryear's but is seen in more big budget action films nowadays then in romantic comedies, for this alone this movie deserved 8 stars).<br/><br/>We have the older themes like the one-man army who's out for revenge and at the same time wants to clean the system.<br/><br/>The hero isn't a emotional boy-toy hes a super-killer like Rambo, Dirty Harry, Arnold etc.<br/><br/>The girls are not there providing emotional support to the men, but like the classics take the back-seat to make way for the action. (And the gratifying but unnecessary exposure is also provided, sadly none from Rhonda Mitra though).<br/><br/>The movie is made in the superlative and no attempts are made to relate it to real (unlike the action movies that have the most outrageous action sequences but make the man a homo/metro whatever its called nowadays just to make it more real, think of that when a car flips over 5 times, or when face masks are printed in 5 mins).<br/><br/>Attempts made to errors in the law of science and logic will turn up dozens of examples but I don't care and neither did the mostly male audience.<br/><br/>The attacks at the system are not overdrawn conversations but simple, hard-hitting facts, you may not be emotionally drained but amidst all the mindless fun, you get thinking.<br/><br/>The acting is good even though its hardly important, yet the parts played by all the characters are good (considering the fact that the film is in the superlative).<br/><br/>Technically this film is very good as any big budget film should be, with lots of real explosions and stunts and minimum use to CGI.<br/><br/>The one-liners are few but they are very very good.<br/><br/>Considering the genre of the film the only real flaws the film has is that when you see a film made in the superlative based in the real world sooner or later your mind starts churning and you begin to reject material( Did he just do that, how can that happen, no way not again .......etc etc etc), the longer than normal length gives you just about time to start thinking about this before the movie ends.<br/><br/>The lack of stylised action scenes, especially since the movies all about guns, we needed some defining action moments but this film doesn't really have any.<br/><br/>In all a great action film thats simple and mindless fun, and a must watch for fans of the simple no-nonsense action movie.<br/><br/>A must watch for the guys although some of the girls seemed to like it too.<br/><br/>-s no defining moments or stylised gun action scenes, the superlatives finally get to you maybe due to the slightly above normal length.<br/><br/>+/-s none really this movie is plain and simple.<br/><br/>+s pure and simple mindless fun, lots of guns, blood and gore and explosions, good acting (considering the points), good chicks,revenge flick about a guy who cleans the system (got me goosebumps),no kisses NOT ABOUT LOVE (THANK GOD FOR THAT).<br/><br/>Total 8/10 (not counting the fact that it exceeded expectations and the fact that its a simple fun action flick don't compare it to dramas and then cry about it)."
"The-Sarkologist","4","1","3","6 May 2018"," Military Business
","The funny thing about movies like this is the suggestion that the US army being used to promote the business interests of American companies is one huge conspiracy, when in reality it is not. Actually, everything that is said in this film was said by General Smedly Bulter back in the 1930s when he outed the banking cartels' attempted coup against Franklin Delanore Rosevelt. Okay, I should probably suggest that there is still some innocence among a lot of people who believe that the United States is some benevolent world power, and comparatively speaking it is, but on the other hand it is basically as benevolent as was the British Empire.
 So, in this film we have a sniper in the Marines who has been deployed in Ethiopia. After completing his mission, the government basically leaves him for dead, believing that he is good enough to pretty much extract himself, which he does. The film then jumps a number of years into the future where he is living by himself in a cabin in the mountains, when he is approached by the CIA to hire him to prevent the assassination of the president.
 Well, things don't go down quite the way he expected, because he is set up. I guess this is the thing with being a soldier - it doesn't matter how good you are, you are still expendable. It seems that this is the case with soldiers throughout history. It seems that the powers that be simply do not care whether a soldier is good at his job or not because, well, in the end they are little more that trained killers, and trained killers are basically embarrassing, particularly for a country that holds itself out as a beacon of virtue.
 Then again there is really nothing benign about business. Well, in a way there is, but in a way there isn't. I guess that is what the British Empire was all about - looking for ways to be able to secure trade routes and to build up its wealth. Then again, as Britain, and in turn the United States, has proven and that is that wealth doesn't come through military conquest, but rather through establishing trade. However, the catch is, is that there is honest trade, and there is gunboat diplomacy. The second is what the concerns that are raised in this film - companies want to make a profit, but they want to do it on the cheap, and if it is cheaper to slaughter a village full of farmers then so be it.
 Yet as I suggested, there is nothing really new about this film. In a way it is just the same old same old. We have a soldier that is so good that he can take down a platoon of trained soldiers, is able to outwit all of the government agencies, and in the end, through some fluke, he manages to be found not guilty of attempting to kill the president, despite the fact that everybody was wanting to crucify him on the flimsiest evidence available. Okay, while it is fun, it still is just the same old same old."

","Extremely disappointed with the movie. The movie started out in a bright fashion, picking momentum gradually, but beyond the halfway point, it just lost it's fizz and turned out to be into yet another mindless action thriller packed with variety of mind boggling shooting and fighting scenes.<br/><br/>Looking at the positives, Mark Wahlberg was good, but the role didn't demand much of his acting skills. Michael Pena seemed clueless and I felt Danny Glover was good in his bad-ass, immoral role. <br/><br/>This movie leaves us with questions left unanswered at the end. The whole movie is let down by it's ending part, when all hell breaks loose. Nevertheless, Antoine Fuqua has given us a good one-time watchable movie. The last scene, involving Mark Wahlberg is just amazing to watch.<br/><br/>6 / 10"
"MLDinTN","6","1","3","13 August 2008"," lots of action with high body count...
","that after a while just gets to be too much. I thought this movie was pretty good, but the last 20 minutes go down hill. We are introduced to Bob Lee Swagger, the best sniper in the us military. He's who they call for all the secret missions that no one knows about. His partner dies and he quits the military. Several years later Colonel Johnson says the country needs his help. They've learned an attempt will be made on the President's life by a sniper and they want Swagger to show them where the sniper might shoot from, etc... Only problem, the President isn't the real target and the Colonel is out to set Swagger up as the shooter. Young FBI agent Memphis becomes involved because Swagger tells him it's a set up. Middle part of the movie is Swagger on the run, trying to recover from 2 bullet wounds. Once well he goes after Colonel and his associates. All the bodies do get kind of silly because the bad guys seem never to hit Swagger. Once Swagger turns himself in, that is when I thought the movie went down hill. The explanation of the rifle not being able to fire, what kind of FBI agents didn't investigate that. And then the final act of revenge was surprising.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like all the violent action films, then this is for you."

The movie is incredibly stupid, not that the performances are poor or badly written.<br/><br/>Who knew that major performers like Wahlberg, Ned Beatty, etc, would act in this dreck. Must be the money.<br/><br/>Okay, with some fathomless plot about war in Ethiopia and the consequences, and maybe an assassination plot constructed by a strangely improbable group of authority figures, this is not a exactly Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Some nice cinematic moments, mountains, snow, some great pics of DC and Baltimore, so there's that.

"masterjk2","7","1","3","11 August 2008"," On target
","This is a pretty well told story and since it disses the current buffoons running the govt., it got my approval. The storyline made sense most of the time even if I always find tedious these movies in which a mere human seems to be a superman... bullets fly all around Wahlberg but never hit him, except for the dufus cop at the first of the movie... and of course he actually missed because he was supposed to kill him. But, if you can forget all that and treat him like a Jason Bourne, the movie works and Wahlberg is almost as talented as Damon in the ""faster than a speeding bullet"" arena. Just the right amount of evil coming from the FBI and the crooked Senator... not so much as to make them laughable and enough to make them a serious threat. If the movie has a fault it is that once again we see the system failing. We know who the crooks are, since we movie goers are omniscient, but no one is in real life... so the blow out at the Bozeman ranch (Bozeman never looked so good!) is excessive... but we accept it because we KNOW he's killing evil doers. Unfortunately, life is far more complex."

"johnny-08","6","1","4","15 January 2008"," Mixture of movies we all watched before
","In the lack of truly good action movies, ""Shooter"" makes a little difference because it is mostly intelligent, fast and easy to watch. Of course this movie has problems and this is definitely not the best of its genre, but Fuqua provides us good fun through entire movie with universal message that something is wrong in America. And not only in America, in every state you can find corruption on the top, but America is too big and always juicy to talk about. Why? Because of its external politic to other lands (mostly). That issue is represented in this movie (conversation between Wahlberg and Serbedzija is great), but it also has something that bothered me. The ending. You cannot just walk in the house and do what he did (senator!!!). If this was reality, Wahlberg's character would be a killer and not a hero in eyes of viewer. Here Fuqua mix what is right and what is wrong and here he presents his rage about the current position America is in. He did that by giving us the mixture of movies we all watched before. ""The Fugitive"" (Wahlberg is wrongfully accused just like Ford), ""Assassins"" (church tower where the rifle is), ""Rambo"" (setting up the bombs) and lot more action movies were our main hero manages to kill all his enemies, even when he is outnumbered. And it all works out very well because of Wahlberg. He really can pass for action hero. Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are bad guys and Rade Serbedzija gives us very believable performance too. Most beautiful part of this movie is Rhona Mitra and there is also Kate Mara in it. So, Fuqua managed to make a solid movie. This is certainly not his best but it is recommendable to watch for all action fans."

Kate Mara was good in her role, you might have also seen her in Brokeback Mountain and We Are Marshall which both are good movies (Brokeback Mountain I have not yet seen).

","Shooter wasn't that bad at all. Like I say, it was a decent film for the conspiracy genre. Despite the stupid message shoved in our face, ""Shooter"" is completely enjoyable. First, I'll list off the good parts. The violence and gun play were excellent. Wahlberg really did have the ""bad arse special forces guy"" feel to him when he took guy after guy out with sniper / other methods. He could probably hit a pin from 1,000 meters out; almost robot-like. Secondly, the characters were alright, but given for a conspiracy film. You always have the fat (beep) who looks the part of a greedy pig who screws everyone over. He was probably modeled after Dick Cheney, given his obsession with shotguns. Kind of a scary guy.<br/><br/>Did I also mention the scene where Marky Mark owned those mercenaries (I mean, contractors) and got away? Truly awesome.<br/><br/>Now, the parts that sucked in this movie: The big one is the fact that you had to basically ignore the stupid Liberal message that they were trying to give. I mean, the military randomly massacring a village, and then leaving their own men out there? Dumbest thing I've ever seen. Also, the ""haves and have-nots"" speech made me nauseous. Also, way too many clichÃ©s and blatant advertisements. The plot was corny, but typical.<br/><br/>I think this is a good movie. 7/10"
"Antagonisten","6","1","4","26 September 2007"," Fuquas best
","I wasn't exactly expecting a miracle when i sat down to watch this movie on DVD. Antoine Fuqua had never made an enjoyable movie before this one, and Mark Wahlberg with his mumbling acting is not one of my favorites. Although, i have to admit that Wahlberg has gotten his act together lately. Expectations where nevertheless not very high.<br/><br/>The story here is easy to recognize, you've probably seen it many times before. One man is betrayed by his government, but is lured back by his sense of duty and patriotism, just to have someone screw him over once again. In this case it's the sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) who is disillusioned when his spotter is killed in some African country (or some such). Now the government wants his help to flush out a sniper who wants to kill the president.<br/><br/>The problem with a movie like this one in the suspension of disbelief. While many movies try to pass themselves off as fairly realistic they still demand that you turn off parts of your brain. This is one such movie. Wahlberg with his hillbilly name constantly faces off against hordes of people who are easily as ""elite"" as he is. There are all manners of special forces people trying to kill him and he mows them down by the dozens. And not only with sniper-rifles either...<br/><br/>That being said, i still enjoyed this movie in general. The action scenes are pretty well made, the story itself is not very original but it works. Also the actors are pretty good, with especially Danny Glover in good shape. And in general i'm willing to forgive action movies for a lot of the inconsistencies that comes with the package, as long as they are entertaining. So just turn of the part of your brain that says one-man-armies doesn't exist, and you'll be able to enjoy this movie. It is without a doubt Fuquas finest to date.<br/><br/>I rate it 6/10."

The set up when Bobby Lee (Lee Harvey Oswald anyone?) finds out he is framed for the alleged killing of the president of the US, is a tribute to the best conspiracy movie ever made; Alan J. Pakula's Parallax View. Then there is the obvious link with the JFK shooting (twice). The Masonic symbols can be spotted if you look for them, the website being used by Bobby Lee, the book he is reading (the official 9/ 11 report). That's the modern take on conspiracies. And then there is the Senator's speech, basically a repeat performance by Ned Beatty from his stellar speech in Network (one of the best movies ever made). It's fast paced, so it will not bore the modern MTV-generation. All in all recommended!"

It's obvious from the preview and DVD cover. But it does not matter because the film is loads of fun and ""simple"" summer entertainment. It won't win awards for it's screenplay, actors or pyrotechnics. Maybe for it's sound editing, but that's beside the point. The film's goal is to keep you engaged and Antoine Fuqua ( director of TRAINING DAY and TEARS OF THE SUN ) does a good job ninety-five percent of the time, thus, making the film exciting to watch, even if there isn't any explosions or shoot-outs. <br/><br/>Danny Glover is a great bad-guy and fans of his should see this film for his performance, even if they don't love him as a nemesis. Warren Beatty has lost some weight and he is delightful for the older age crowd. Michael Pena ( WORLD TRADE CENTER ) has an excellent supporting role as well. <br/><br/>It should excite Adventure/ Thriller fans for two hours and you'll either re-watch it for the action scenes/thrills or for the entertaining aspect of it all.

","Very good, fast paced, entertaining, and the most dangerous and honest social commentary that I have ever seen in a Hollywood movie. If you know anything about how the world actually works, then you will want to watch and listen closely. At the very beginning you can see a clue that the director has done his research into conspiracy with the book that Walberg has on his desk. It is a joke to anyone who isn't brainwashed and sort of a clue to the theme.<br/><br/>We have seen much of this movie before in movies throughout the years but it doesn't feel that way.

","As my summary and score indicate, there is something missing with this movie. To be precise there is 33% missing. First I'll cover the 66% that made it. Marky Mark is spot on. I still haven't figured out why he isn't a huge action star. He's a good looking kid and a far better actor than other more popular action stars. He has certainly been successful, but action super stardom has eluded him. In this movie he is pitch perfect as a the disgruntled ex-military sniper. He is bitter, intense, and deliberate. The overall direction of the films is quite good also. The look and feel of the film is somewhere between Ridley and Tony Scott. It is razor sharp and a little frenetic. Most of the supporting cast is good. The procedural look at the sniper craft is really cool. <br/><br/>Now, the 33%. There are Gaping plot holes in this movie.$ It seems to give a great deal of screen time to stupid stuff, and then totally ignore things it shouldn't. Ned Beatty and Elias Koteas are awful in this film. The real shame is both of their characters seem unnecessary. I would also like to point out something that has bugged me for a long time. In all of the sniper movies they talk about all the precise adjustments necessary for these long shots they take. Then, when the camera cuts to the scope view it is centered right on the target's head. I love the procedural minutia, but they really should explain this. My last and largest complaint about this movies is the final acts. This movie has two endings. The first one is on the mountain, where it should of ended. The second one makes NO sense whatsoever. Did they reach the end of filming, realize they had some money left, and just keep on rolling. I am not going to give away the endings, but you will know what I am talking about."

From the previews I was expecting hand to hand combat and bombs going off every second, I was mistaken in a good way. This movie was a very intelligent action movie with a ton of great actors in it. The ending scene in which Wahlberg is out for revenge against Mr Glover was one of the most terrific ending scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time.

"bburns","6","1","4","5 June 2007"," Mark Wahlberg is no Harrison Ford
","Ever since ""The 39 Steps"", the theme of an innocent man framed for a crime he didn't commit has been a staple of action movies. And likely, it won't go away anytime soon, as long as it keeps happening in real life (the Duke Lacrosse scandal, anyone?). ""Shooter"" tries--and fails--to adapt this age-old theme to the post-9/11 political landscape.<br/><br/>In the prologue, we see Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) as an army sniper in Iraq. His job is to protect a convoy from terrorist attack. When he fails and his best friend dies, he isolates himself in a Montana cabin with no communication with the outside world other than the Internet.<br/><br/>Eventually, he is approached by government agents (Danny Glover & Elias Koteas) with a request that he please lend his expertise to warding off an assassination attempt on the President. He reluctantly accepts, but at the same time knows these guys are crooked. His worst fears are realized when the agents kill an African arch-bishop at a Presidential rally and Swagger is framed for the job. And for the next two hours, Swagger has to play a delicate balancing act of letting the authorities pursue him without actually letting them catch him so that he can prove his innocence once and for all.<br/><br/>This is a competently written, directed and acted film. And I suppose I would have liked it, except I saw it done so much better 14 years ago in ""The Fugitive"". In that film, Harrison Ford's performance was justly nominated for an Academy Award. The roles of both Swagger in this film, and Dr. Richard Kimble in the other required the lead actor to make seamless transitions from sympathetic everyman to shell-shocked victim to menacing opponent. Ford could pull it off. So could Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"". Wahlberg simply can't. It's not that he's a bad actor. He's actually very good at playing innocents (""Boogie Nights""), blue-collar heroes (""Invincible""), and even anti-heroes (""The Departed""), but in movies like this or ""Planet of the Apes"", I have always felt that he lacks that certain grit that made John Wayne, Charlton Heston and Clint Eastwood so great, despite their limitations as actors.<br/><br/>As far as the other actors are concerned, music fans will be interested in seeing the Band's Levon Helm without a beard and wearing an old-fashioned pair of wire-rimmed glasses. On the other hand, I was underwhelmed by Ned Beatty pouring on a syrupy deep south accent for a U.S. Senator from Montana. Everyone else is pretty much forgettable.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is a run-of-the mill action movie with exactly zero surprises unless you've never seen ""North by Northwest"" or ""First Blood"". There's nothing particularly wrong with it except for a bit of miscasting, but it is completely lacking in originality. 6 out of 10."

","I had no idea what this film was about before I entered. It stars Marc Wahlberg playing a Marines sharpshooter veteran incredulously named Bob Lee Swagger. He was abandoned in the Ethiopia war zone by his superiors, so when he made his way back in the States, he becomes a loner. Sounds familiar??? Yes! This film could be the rehash of Rambo or any Chuck Norris movie of the 80s! There was definitely an 80s feel to it in the first few scenes.<br/><br/>In this film, Swagger was recruited to help analyze and prevent an assassination attempt on the US President. However, it turns out he would be framed for the crime. Of course, he escapes this tight set-up and, despite two gunshot wounds, was able to tackle an FBI agent, steal his car, drive the car into the river, escape along the shore, hot-wire an abandoned car and make his way from Philadelphia to Kentucky! Of course this is just the start of a series of superhuman artillery exploits in the forests, in the fields, in the snow! It is very exciting for an action film. Big explosions everywhere. Characters are either one of two: 1. Too superhuman, as was Swagger, but also Sarah (Kate Mara) as the widow of Swagger's best friend, who was amazingly able to do bullet extraction surgery in her bedroom! Or 2. Too caricature, as were the over-the-top evil characters of Danny Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty. Of course, we don't expect Wahlberg (or anyone else for that matter) to earn his next Oscar nomination from this film.<br/><br/>Finally, we only watch these kinds of films for the adrenaline rush, and for that, ""Shooter"" still gets an average score."

","I love sniper flicks and this one was pretty good. The sniping seemed dead-on to me, though the only thing I can compare it with are other sniper movies <br/><br/>The first part is a bit slow as they lay out most of the story. The story is kinda cliché and predictable, but not as hollow as one would fear. The movie really comes to live during the action scenes, sniping or just general shooting or fighting, it's good. What bugged me about the first part was that there were a lot of scenes of a weirdly grunting Marky Mark after getting some lead pumped into him. They kinda stretched that too long, just like the car chase. <br/><br/>Part 2 is grand. A lot of violent action. The more general action seemed a bit over the top, but the sniping once again ruled supreme. There are some nice plot twists but they'll only surprise you because the storytelling is so crappy (Which brings up the question if bad story telling can actually improve a mediocre script ) <br/><br/>The acting in general was OK, not Mark's best but not awful either. He's believable though I felt like he kinda changed his southern accent thingy around a bit inconsistently. Danny Glover's lisp and messed up voice kinda annoyed me, same goes for the other old guys (Ned Beatty?) who seemed to just wheel in their performances.

I have nothing to say but high marks about this movie.<br/><br/>It had everything an action film needed. It had a great action hero, in which Wahlberg glimmered in. The appearance of Michael Peno as Wahlberg's sidekick was great, but the best performances were the surprising re-arrivals of Danny Glover and Ned Beatty, as the greedy and notorious villains. The other actors, both as the good guys and the bad guys were well-suited in their roles, without a hint of being hokey or wooden.<br/><br/>The film also had a strong, flowing story that had no flaw to it, which even held a bit of a moral. The movie also had an Eastwood style to it, along the lines of the ""Spaghetti Westerns"", which made the movie better than the average action flick, in which nowadays bases off of Jackie Chan and James Bond films.<br/><br/>The action sequences of shoot-outs and car chases were intense and cool, but a bit on the violent side (since Mr. Fuqua is unafraid to show violence from his previous films). The film dragged a little in the middle section, but there are no other complaints I found in the film.<br/><br/>As an ""action junkie"" I was deeply satisfied. Not the perfect film, but deserves a 9/10!"
"EUyeshima","5","1","4","11 April 2007"," Testosterone-Driven Revenge Thriller Too Heavy on Polemics and Too Light on Characters
","Surprisingly, for an elaborately staged revenge action piece, this 2007 movie is too politically ambitious for its own good. Director Antoine Fuqua knows how to stage an over-the-top battle and a desperate chase scene with plenty of eye-popping firepower and expert stunt work, but along with screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin, he also wants to make the story a topical commentary on the current political landscape. They are caught in cross purposes that don't mesh well at all, especially toward the end, because the movie is basically a man-on-the-run B-picture with an A-picture budget.<br/><br/>Based on ""Point of Impact"", a suspense novel by Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter, the densely plotted story focuses on the aptly named Bobby Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who happens to be one of the most expert marksmen ever. Abandoned by the U.S. military during a deadly secret mission in Ethiopia, he has since become a mountain-man survivalist who is recruited three years later by a shadowy figure, Col. Isaac Johnson, to help prevent a predicted assassination attempt on the President. A sudden, Hitchcockian twist occurs a little over the half-hour mark, and the rest of the movie is a series of convolutions that spiral completely out of control by the overblown series of finales.<br/><br/>All of this may have had a chance for resonance if the characters were developed beyond the level of action figures. Looking seriously self-possessed, Mark Wahlberg does his best to make Swagger a more dimensional character than the Rambo-constrained script demands, but the film doesn't give him much breathing room beyond his angst over his spotter's death and his burgeoning anger at the U.S. government. On the latter point, he suddenly articulates his perspective like a McLaughlin Group commentator, one of many laughable elements that seem to multiply once Swagger takes charge of his mission of vengeance. As the initially reluctant FBI agent who searches for the truth, Michael Peña brings much needed humanism to the story, but his character's arc is absurdly presented in broad strokes.<br/><br/>With a convincing Kentucky accent, Kate Mara looks at first to be playing the spotter's widow as a feisty, vulnerable figure, but she is reduced almost systematically to a nearly mute damsel-in-distress as the story progresses. Similarly, Danny Glover plays Johnson with some interesting texture at the beginning but then quickly moves into Simon Legree territory. The worst casting occurs late in the movie with Ned Beatty as a pompous U.S. senator pivotal in the political conspiracy behind Swagger's set-up. A far cry from the Machiavellian corporate tycoon he played in ""Network"", Beatty plays to the rafters with zero subtlety. Still, it is hard not to be impressed with the film's technical aspects, particularly the sharp cinematography of Peter Menzies, Jr. and the propulsive editing by Conrad Buff and Eric Sears. Lemkin's polemic-heavy script, however, cannot begin to elevate the movie beyond its testosterone-driven genre."

As much as I liked him in a supporting role in some of my favorite movies like, of course, the Lethal Weapon stuff, I found his performance lacking in some way.

Unlike many recent and overly edited action films ""Shooter"" doesn't always have cuts every half second during the action sequences so you can actually see and thoroughly enjoy the action. Then, possibly best off all, the film doesn't compromise with violence in order to get the precious PG-13 rating. Then again, Antoine Fuqua isn't a director to fall into that trap having previously delivered a series of good movies (Replacement Killers, Tears of the Sun, Training Day) with the possible exception of ""Bait.""<br/><br/>This is a thoroughly enjoyable and solid action film. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence"
"SadieClaire","Null","1","4","8 April 2007"," Conspiracy theory action flick
","Mark Wahlberg has certainly come a long way since his Marky Mark muscle flexing days. Now every time I see him in a movie, he blows me away with his acting abilities. When did this happen? I don't think it was even a gradual change. It's like he made The Departed with Scorsese and that was it. There's no stopping him now. I guess we should put every mediocre actor under the direction of Scorsese for a few months and see what happens after that. Hollywood would be the coolest place ever. But until then, we can keep ourselves occupied with Mark Wahlberg and the great line of movies he's putting out these days. <br/><br/>Shooter is Wahlberg's latest achievement in acting. In this movie, he plays an ex-marine gunnery sergeant (Bob Lee Swagger), who goes into seclusion after his marksman partner is shot to death by the enemy in Ethiopia after Swagger and his partner are left to die by American forces during a mission gone wrong. Three years later, FBI finds Swagger in his mountain home he shares with his canine best friend to get his help in stopping an assassination plan against the President of the United States. From this point on, the JFK conspiracy parallels being to surface one after another. The three names, accused assassin being shot, the shooter of the assassin being shot, so on and so forth. But all of these similarities also give the movie a mysterious feel that makes it stand out from the rest of the falsely-accused-man plot lines. Swagger only realizes that it's all been set up when he gets shot. He barely escapes alive, starting the nationwide manhunt. But soon he becomes the hunter. As he tries to bring the responsible parties to justice he receives help from Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara), his ex-partner's girlfriend, and Nick Memphis (Michael Pena), the rookie FBI agent who uncovers the conspiracy. Memphis becomes the perfect sidekick while the movie cleverly stays away from pursuing a love story between Swagger and Fenn. The events that follow the climax don't make much sense at first but they all get tied together in an attractive package in the end. <br/><br/>Shooter definitely lives up to the expectations. In addition to providing great action scenes, it gives the audience a smart storyline to follow with surprisingly honest political views. It's a great movie to get your blood pumping and conspiracy theories floating in your head."

Mark Wahlberg plays a pretty good role as a Gunny. Even the rank itself is dry; of all the military ranks to portray a his character as a sniper...Gunnery Sergeant.<br/><br/>The action is very entertaining, and if you're a fan of military cinema and a fan of weapons, you'll definitely enjoy this movie. This is the type of movie you would watch with a bunch of guys; this definitely isn't romantic nor pleasant. The weapons and how the characters operate them were fairly accurate (which is more than I can say comparing it to most other typical action flicks). I was relieved to finally watch a movie where a bolt-action didn't have infinite rounds in them. Danny Glover did a terrific job of being a villain, a role that I would never see him play. He may have already, but I didn't see it.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun movie to watch, but I wouldn't expect this film to be nominated for anything. Don't expect this movie to be a masterpiece you can critique, but you can expect firefights, explosions, and a lot of killing."

After his country screws him during a mission in Africa in which his close friend dies , Mr.Swagger (Walhberg) retires to live a life of solitude in the country however that peaceful silence is once again broken when his 'country men' need him only to screw him over again. It does not seem like much of a plot but the good thing is that it moves at a quick pace with action all the way through it and with no silly little sub-plots which bore the audience. Mark Walhberg seems to step into the shoes of an action movie star with considerable skill and I was very satisfied with his performance and Danny Glover also kept the movie rolling along nicely. To conclude Shooter is a welcome return to action movies from the likes of Commando and Die Hard , movies which no matter how many times you watch , you can never really get bored of. Any how I would recommend Shooter to anybody who enjoys a different kind of action movie, the script might not be as sharp as one could hope for but it kept me in my seat for 2 hours.<br/><br/>SHOOTER - 8 OUT 10<br/><br/>JUST LIKE THEY SAID THAT WMD ARE IN IRAQ AND LIKE WHEN THEY SAID ANNA NICOLE SMITH MARRIED FOR LOVE!"

","If the John Malkovich ""Booth"" character in In the Line of Fire had been a good guy, he would have been Bob Lee Swagger, Mark Wahlberg's character in Shooter. Walhberg plays a master sniper/marksman who fought for his country, then dropped out after being abandoned by his superiors in a firefight in one of those African countries where the U.S. wasn't supposed to be. He lost his partner in the fight and retreated to a cabin in the mountains to live a life of solitude. Then one day, along comes a government agency colonel, played by Danny Glover, asking Wahlberg to help foil a presidential assassination attempt going to occur in the next two week. Smell a set-up? Well, it is. The assassin misses the president but gets the Ethiopian leader for whom the rally was designed (smell a set-up?), and it all gets pinned on Wahlberg. The rest if mayhem and destruction from coast-to-coast as Wahlberg escapes the entire government (well, I guess if Bin Laden can, anyone can), kills bad guys, and seeks redemption. He is helped in his efforts by a rookie FBI agent who spotted Wahlberg shortly after the assassination (Michael Pena of Crash, Babel and World Trade Center). The agent, Nick Memphis is the only agent in the whole U.S. who figures out that Bob Lee couldn't have done it. It's a big-budget shoot-em-up, blow-em-up with great photography and a totally implausible plot. And, yes, there's a girl  the widow of his dead friend, played by Kate Mara (We Are Marshall), who is a teacher and, apparently, one heck of a nurse/trauma surgeon.

","I have seen Shooter three times now. The scenery is gorgeous. Awesome. The emphasis on long-range sniping mechanics means that a lot of mile-away scenes abound, but even so the vistas are pretty wonderful.<br/><br/>There is a lot of blood and gore, but the feeling is somewhat remote, not related to a slasher-type gore fest. Like the discussions of technical matters in shooting long-range, the blood and sprays are a part of the story telling, an accompaniment to the shot. A reminder that not only was the target hit, but the bullet killed the target. The blood seems a touch of reality that reminds us that the point of shooting is death, not just completing a difficult task for the shooter.<br/><br/>The first time I watched Shooter, I thought of the Bourne movies. Wahlberg seems to be presented a few times to deliberately borrow from the appearance of Bourne, probably to borrow from the success of the Bourne films. But this film is different. This is about a quiet individual, looking for answers. A Marine scout sniper searching for peace after the death of his fellow soldier and friend just before retiring.<br/><br/>On the down side, the editors of the film need their hands slapped. Several scene transitions stand out as exceeding bad, disruptive of the story, discontinuous. And perhaps the director just failed to get the cabin scenes to come together: 'rougher than a corn cob'.<br/><br/>Language. The 'F' word is used about four times in the movie. So seldom, it felt jarring and out of place. Like other roughnesses and detractions, it seems this should have been changed. Not because using common language is bad, but because using the 'F' word where they did takes away from the gift that the movie makes to the viewer. Like the editing, this is something that a professional filmmaker should have seen before shooting, should have been obvious while shooting, and should have slapped the editor and screeners across the face with 'needless mistake'.<br/><br/>This story could have been shot as a western, and done well. Set in today's world, the nature scenery is awesome, the hero is compelling, and overall the story is interesting and rewarding. A feeling of determination and grim accomplishment prevails; this is not about the excitement of mayhem, or even beating the bad guys."
"Ndirsch11","5","1","4","29 March 2007"," 'Shooter' shoots itself in the foot
","The new Mark Wahlberg film thinks it has many tricks up its sleeve. The plot of ""Shooter"" involves a suspected presidential assassination, a covert government conspiracy, genocide in Africa, oil pipelines, rogue agents, and corrupt politicians. Don't be fooled, however, by the film's overly elaborate and obtuse plot: there's less here than meets the eye. ""Shooter"" is just your standard action thriller dressed up to seem smarter and more intelligent than it actually is. It wants to be the next ""Syriana"" but fails.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is a very loose adaptation of Stephen Hunter's novel, ""Point of Impact,"" about a former military sniper on the run from corrupt government agents. Mark Wahlberg plays the former military marksman, Bob Lee Swagger, a patriotic man who used to have great faith in the priorities of the American government. His belief systems were destroyed in his last mission in Ethiopia. In the opening scene we witness how Swagger was sent to Ethiopia to defend some African villagers. To Swagger's surprise, his superior officers shut the mission down and order all witnesses, including Swagger, to be killed. Swagger survives and goes into semi-retirement out in the American West.<br/><br/>Swagger is now a changed man, someone much more cynical then he was before. When he gets a knock on the door one day from government agents he's understandably unenthusiastic. One of the agents, Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover), however, makes him an offer he can't refuse: help protect the president of the United States from a suspected assassination attempt. The shooter is an expert marksman so it will take another expert marksman to stop him.<br/><br/>The rest of the film, unfortunately, does not live up to the promise of these early scenes. Suffice it to say, Swagger is being conned by the very people he thought he could trust. Swagger, we're led to believe, is just one part in an elaborate conspiracy to deceive the American public and distract them from the truth. The truth involves the cover-up of crimes committed by Big Business in compliance with certain shadowy figures in the American government.<br/><br/>Swagger, now on the run, is trying to uncover the truth so he can prove his innocence. He finds a couple of allies along the way, including the widow of a dead friend from his military days. Kate Mara plays the widow, Sarah Fenn, a poorly written role that simply serves as a convenient plot device. Swagger also finds a friend in Nick Memphis (Michael Pena), a young FBI agent who comes to suspect that the government has something to hide. Michael Pena (""World Trade Center"") turns in a tepid performance in yet another poorly written role.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" contains just about every conspiracy theory cliché you can think of. What's frustrating, however, is that the film really doesn't seem very interested in the ideas it's presenting to the audience. It certainly never feels very compelling or convincing. Watching ""Shooter"" is like listening to a guy who keeps hinting at terrible things to come and then says ""never mind."" For a film trying so hard to be provocative you would think ""Shooter"" had something important to say. It ends up being rather boring and uneventful despite all the plot twists and turns.<br/><br/>The director of ""Shooter"" is Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day,"" ""King Arthur""), an action director and nothing more. Fuqua's talents are limited to staging stunts and spectacular car chases, so it should come as no surprise that ""Shooter"" feels like your standard action thriller. What this film needs is more attention to characterization instead of elaborate action sequences. The action and violence, although well staged, lacks suspense and a proper payoff.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is a film that takes advantage of people's fears in a post 9/11 world. We're living in a cynical time in which fewer and fewer people trust what our government is telling us about our role in the world. So isn't it about time that Hollywood made a political film that actually had some politics to it or at least something important to say? ""Shooter"" is not that film I'm afraid. Its plot is absurd and convoluted and its characters are without depth. For those looking for a great American political thriller, I'd suggest the original ""Manchurian Candidate"": that film still has the power to shock and surprise even today. I'm willing to bet that even conspiracy theory nuts will be dissatisfied with what ""Shooter"" has to offer."
"ferguson-6","6","1","4","25 March 2007"," The Challenges of Democracy
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Antoine Fuqua is best known for ""Training Day"". He obviously has a love and an eye for machismo moments and settings. Here Mark Wahlberg dodges bullets, bombs, helicopters and politicians ... while also providing himself with emergency medical service, going on a mission to take out the bad guys and even getting the girl. Busy day at the office.<br/><br/>Yes, we have seen all of this many times before, and often done better in ""Bourne Identity"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Mission Impossible"" and even ""MaGuyver"". Still there is always something fun about a good guy is wrongly accused and goes on a ""him against the world"" quest to clear his name and right a wrong.<br/><br/>This one has enough explosions to make Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott jealous, but Wahlberg brings just enough soul to his role to maintain our interest. Good support work from the underrated Michael Pena, a lispy Danny Glover, two beauties - Rhona Mitra and Kate Mara, Elias Koteas and a sleazy Senator played by Ned Beatty. There is also a nifty little appearance from the great Levon Helm, who just doesn't grace us with his presence nearly often enough.<br/><br/>Even though some of the photography is beautiful, if you are looking for thought-provoking film-making, this one isn't for you. If you are looking for adrenaline rushes and testosterone-pumping action, give it a shot."
"ArmsAndMan","5","1","4","25 March 2007"," Read the Novel 'Point of Impact' Instead
","Stephen Hunter, unlike Robert Ludlum, writes exciting and graceful prose, creating credible and dimensional characters in his novels. With the arrival of 'Shooter,' it looks like the Bob Lee Swagger stories have been pegged as the next franchise to compete with Ludlum's Bourne series. But in this movie debut, the skill of Hunter's writing is lost in the translation, and worse still, the filmmakers have taken liberties with the novel's plot.<br/><br/>Despite problems with the third act, and a finale out of nowhere, 'Shooter' is exciting and funny for most of the ride. The director has an opening sequence that is truly exciting, full of 'sniper craft' and combat thrills. And the political commentary throughout is bracing and welcome.<br/><br/>Sorry to say, the final scene almost negates everything good that unfolds before. Maybe Mr. Hunter could be more involved in the next adaptation of a Swagger novel, but he may not be willing. In a recent interview on NPR, the author admits his novel was drastically cut to fit the medium, the screenplay being 'post cards from my novel.' Hence, I suggest you read the story as it was intended, in book form.<br/><br/>After you take a look at Stephen Hunter's novels, be sure to rent the DVD of David Mamet's 'Spartan.' I kept thinking of it while watching the 'Shooter' screenplay spiral out of control in the third act. If 'Spartan' had been a hit, we'd be enjoying a franchise of sequels from the pen of America's best playwright-turned-moviemaker."

","Shooter: bad poster, crappy title, good movie. When my friends and I heard about this movie we thought it looked like crap, but after seeing the trailer we were convinced this movie actually seemed promising, and indeed it was. Shooter is The Fugitive meets a little bit of Die Hard and Rambo. There's plenty of action for the whole family here. I wasn't much of a Mark Walberg fan until I saw The Departed, and now after I saw Shooter I'm converted, he can really hold his own here. The only downside was Danny Glover's sluring accent. It kinda got annoying, but hes still Danny Glover and so hes still cool. Antoine Fuqua gives us yet another solid a flick, good stuff."
"jantoniou","7","1","4","25 March 2007"," Utterly predictable... and quite enjoyable
","Make no mistake, ""Shooter"" is a formula Hollywood actioner -- but then, aren't they all? The setups, like the sniper shots, come from miles away. These setups, and the good guys and bad guys couldn't be more obvious. Few characters get beyond one or, tops, two dimensions, including Wahlberg's jaded ex-sniper, Bobby Lee Swagger.<br/><br/>Bobby is setup from the word go to give the appearance that he killed--or, rather, attempted to kill--the President under the pretense of being a consultant to avoid an assassination. Make sense? In any case the ultimate purpose of this setup is never made clear even by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The Shadow Government component of the movie is laid on very thick, with countless interwoven shadow agencies working in concert with the Evil Bad Guys (tm) to execute on a plan which, ultimately and finally, seems quite pointless.<br/><br/>But, then, there really is no specific plot point to this movie. The quasi-political overtones, the shadow government agencies are all window dressing to vaguely justify the copious on-screen violence. Swagger, needless to say, follows the mold of ex-military killing machines cemented by John Rambo and his storied silver screen heirs (can you say Van Damme and Seagal?). The non-chalance that he approaches his role as a government trained killing machine approaches psychopathic.<br/><br/>Good thing Marky Mark gets shot early on and needed to go through the requisite bleeding--barely alive--harrowing extraction of the bullet--feverish nights of recovery so we can get a good view of his sweaty chiseled bod. Coupled with Kate Mara's obligatory cleavage shots the filmmakers deftly cover at least three major demographic groups within the first 30 minutes. Good job! Speaking of Mr. Wahlberg, it's fair to say his acting range hasn't advanced significantly from his days of pants-dropping glory. Swagger's character however fits this limited range perfectly. For that reason I actually liked him a lot in this movie. He doesn't try nor need to stretch his acting chops. Unlike Arnold, Wahlberg doesn't yet have the built-in self-deprecating acting chip to enable him to do comedy -- so, like Arnold in his early career (c.Commando and T1/T2), he is an ideal action star. Like Arnold he seems to embrace his limitations in this movie and he fares far better for it.<br/><br/>Michael Pena as Nicholas Memphis (a name only a pulp novelist or action movie scribe could come up with) plays his bumbling but very smart FBI agent in a very engaging and likable manner. He's easy to side with as the conspiracy swirls around him. I hope to see a lot more of him in movies.<br/><br/>Kate Mara as the love interest Sara has one of the most believable Southern drawls I've heard in a long time. It's a soft one just like a Kentucky or Tennessee native (""mid-South"" vs. deep). This coming from a native New Yorker is quite amazing.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is an ideal popcorn matinée flick, full of action that keeps you going pretty much to the end, which I have to admit is quite silly and overdone. But, then, this is pure entertainment--if you like a lot of gratuitous violence, of course--and worth the cost of admission."

However, my criticism towards it is the fact that the people use his ex-partner's wife to be the bribe to get what they want. I mean, he just talked to her for the first time. lol.

Will you ""JFK"" people PLEASE spend one hour out of your busy lives watching the scientific NOVA documentary ""Who Shot President Kennedy?"". And the absurd 911 conspiracy on how the towers fell is treated seriously by the NOVA documentary ""How the towers fell"".<br/><br/>I hope that some day some movie maker will have the courage to attack real enemies (eg Muslim extremists). Or how about a movie about Executive Outcomes, and how they saves lives as opposed to the UN which later took over in Sierra Leone? That story exposes the UN as a real source of evil.

","I missed the opening of this film and that may account for some of my confusion about who was who and who was doing what to whom. I gather that Mark Wahlberg is an expert sniper who has been framed for the assassination of an African archbishop and wounded in the process of escape. I never had a clear idea of who Wahlberg was working for. Sometimes he's called ""Gunny,"" which suggests the Marine Corps. At any rate, he's a phenomenal shot. His grouping on the range is something like an inch and a half -- and that's at ten hundred yards (or was it ten thousand), which is the length of ten football fields. I don't believe it but -- okay, he's a great shot.<br/><br/>It's clear who the bad guys are though. This isn't much more than a lone avenger in an action movie, after all. He's been set up and is now pursued by the FBI under the leadership of Danny Glover. They chase him all over the place and he barely escapes each time. He's aided by an honest FBI agent (Michael Pena) but mainly he survives each attempt on his life because (1) he has second sight, and (2) his enemies always miss while he never does.<br/><br/>Is Mark Wahlberg handsome? I keep reading that he is, but to me he looks like any of the ordinary guys I went to high school with. Some of them wound up with checkered pasts too. But my chief impression of Mark Wahlberg is that he has considerable talent as an actor. He was quite good in ""The Departed"". But in this film, locked as it is into strict genre conventions, he doesn't have a chance to display much of his talent. I mean, it's the Steven Seagal role. What the hell can anybody do with it? There's an attempt at social significance, perhaps with the general idea of cashing in on the public's cynicism and anger towards the recent cascade of scandals and recklessly arrogant preemptions. Imagine a corrupt group within the FBI, acting on the orders of a corrupt sitting Senator (Ned Beatty) to eliminate opposition to the construction of a pipeline through an African country. And which organization comes to the rescue? The Department of Justice (""thanks to the separation of powers""). Well, it's pretty nervy in its intent.<br/><br/>There is some nice location shooting, including a couple of scenes on a trackless and snowy slope among some majestic mountains. The requisite action scenes are well done too. I kwelled when Wahlberg walks away from a house and it explodes behind him. And what does he do? He continues walking. A less imaginative director would have Wahlberg dive in slow motion towards the camera while the fireball blooms behind him.<br/><br/>Not a bad film, for what it is."

","The Shooter experience began for me, as a drab Sunday afternoon visit to my local cinema, with nothing in mind for viewing and a disappointing lineup on all screens. One of my compadre's noticed an action film called Shooter on the board and since none of us had heard anything about it, we decided to go and check it out. As with most films I see, my thoughts towards the mystery action film were pessimistic. Five minutes in however and I was spellbound. From the moment Mark Wahlberg began his sniping kill-fest on top of an Ethiopian hill, I was hooked.<br/><br/>The violence was extra gratifying, as watching sniper bullets scramble the brains of mortar chugging rebels was right up my street. After enticing me in with this taster sample, Shooter then threw me hard into the main storyline. So far this out of no-where film was taking my breath away and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what was around the next corner. The story basically consists of a counter operation of a presidential assassination.<br/><br/>As you may find however things in this movie are never straight forward, and the whole operation lands our hero Bob Lee Swagger into a big heap of dung. After being framed for the attempt on the presidents life and forced to go into hiding, the plot begins to expose itself more clearly and has more twists than spaghetti junction.<br/><br/>The later action scenes are done beautifully, and the mix of Bullets, pipe bombs and napalm had me drooling with pleasure.<br/><br/>Wahlberg and Glover both deliver solid and believable roles and bring the screenplay to life. Wahlberg Was a delight to watch and made his character Bob Lee Swagger more then just an average action protagonist.<br/><br/>Although this film came from no-where and then departed just as quickly it really left an impression on me, and I recommend anyone who likes the combination of adrenaline fuelled action and a brilliant storyline from a genius director to grab a copy asap!<br/><br/>One of the best action films I personally have seen. I really do suggest action fans to check this movie out."

Unfortunately he is set up to being the shooter and is hunted by cops everywhere. He must find out why he has been set up and also try and stop the real killers.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad. Mark Wahlberg does a great job as a military sniper who takes a dislike to the government. Danny Glover is also good as the colonel who sets up Swagger as the man who tries to kill the president. I didn't think he would be the bad guy after all the good guys he has played like the Lethal Weapon films or the voice of an ant solder in Antz.<br/><br/>The action was the best out of the whole film. The beginning of the film I enjoyed most. The blood help the film become more realistic. Every action fan like me would like a bit of carnage.

Sorry...there is absolutely, positively no way he would have done that. His character being as smart and intelligent as he was--no way. I mean, the government trained him on ways to avoid dying and to survive in the wilderness. A guy as smart as him would not have made the mistake of charging something to a Visa. A guy with his level of intelligence would know the moment he swiped that Visa, the Feds would be on to him. Anniversary of his buddy's death or no, there is no way he would have gotten sentimental and allowed emotion and nostalgia to overrule logic and common sense. Sorry--the writers messed up on that one. But it was the only snafu in the whole film. If not for that, I would have given it a 10, and not a 9.

Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Tears of the Sun', 'King Arthur') knows his way around this kind of material and it is to his credit that he keeps the tension almost unbearably high for nearly two hours.<br/><br/>Retired military sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is living a lonely but secure life in the mountains until he is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to return to the art of killing: the President is threatened by an assassin and only Bob will be able to trace the paces that will prevent the event from happening. Bob returns to Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia (the three places where the possible assassination could take place) and leads the FBI and CIA to the point of discovery, and at that time everything changes: to share the facts and events would be to spoil the innumerable surprises that alter the events of the story. Bob discovers who his real friends are (Kate Mara and Michael Peña) and the rest of the film is a chase and destroy mission that has the viewer gripping the chair.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg continues to prove that he is more than a hunky underwear model (though he is keeping his physique in perfect form!) and delivers one of his most completely realized characterizations of his career. The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Ned Beatty, Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija as well as Glover, Mara and Peña, and each manages to make some fairly unbelievable roles credible.

(But we've still got his biceps and obliques  give a reviewer SOMETHING to work with!) <br/><br/>Wahlberg is patriot Bob Lee Swagger, USMC sharpshooter, able to hit moving targets over a mile away, who leaves the corp disillusioned after a morally-ambiguous mission in Ethiopia goes all hela-snafu. After three idyllic years isolated in panoramic mountains with his big dog, a copy of the *9-11 Commission Report,* and web-surfing to ""see what propaganda they're feeding us now,"" he receives an unannounced, unwelcome visit from Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, lisping badly through his dentures  he really is getting' too old for this sh*t), who wants to hire Swagger for a unique mission  to deter a presidential assassination by scoping out potential methods on how a sharpshooter of Swagger's caliber may be able to pull it off.<br/><br/>Though we could hear a frame-up coming like an eighteen-wheeler with a bad clutch, our boy Swagger obliviously swaggers into it. If his mind is soft, his body is still hard (calm down, ladies!), and he fields two bullet wounds and a green FBI agent (Michael Peña last seen under a *World Trade Center*) to escape narrowly with his life, while a whole government arm deploys to manhunt him when they should be saving hostages in Iran or fixing potholes on my street.<br/><br/>Peña is Nick Memphis, who refuses to accept the ""official"" FBI version of Swagger's assassination attempt, due to inadvertently being bitch-slapped by Swagger himself during his escape. His jigsaw construction of the clues leads him to ally with Swagger, who has in turn allied with Sarah (Kate Mara), the girlfriend of a dead fellow soldier. Which kinda annoys for its cliché. Let's not kid ourselves - when the ""ally-with-the-dead-buddy's-ex"" scenario arises in a movie, the girl is ALWAYS single and it ALWAYS leads to panty  I think the first clue might have been when Sarah opens her door to the filthy, terrified, near-death Swagger (who is no more than a mild acquaintance), dressed in nothing but see-through top and undies, not bothering to close her robe. Then we just sit back and wait for Wahlberg to get the guns out which he does, as she dresses his wounds, which in movie parlance is just another method of foreplay.<br/><br/>Swagger and Memphis uncover the all-purpose ""corrupt government plot"" behind Swagger's setup, with quite obvious digs at the George W administration along the way. (At this juncture  2007, four years into an unwinnable war after two years in an unwon war  it's quite easy to dig and get a collective amen.) When Colonel Johnson lisps, ""Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?"" Swagger replies, ""Some years we do."" Oh, snap! <br/><br/>Directed by Antoine Fuqua, from Jonathan Lemkin's screenplay of Stephen Hunter's novel, *Point of Impact,* Swagger's quest terminates Rade Sherbedgia and Elias Koteas as bad guys along the ladder, Ned Beatty eventually uncovered as the corrupt senator atop the ladder, reveling in the nation's political audacity and his perceived impunity, ""We live in a country where the Secretary of Defense can go on national TV and say it's about freedom and not about oil."" ""The bosses know. We know their bosses know. The problem is in admitting that the leaders know."" With his words, this movie might as well be handing out subpoenas to Rumsfeld, Bush, Rove, Cheney and Libby.<br/><br/>It is astounding to realize that the definition of Patriot has flip-flopped to someone who DOES own a copy of the *9-11 Commission Report.* Not ten years ago, anyone surfing the web, mumbling about propaganda would have been considered treasonous. But Swagger is painted as the reddest, whitest and bluest Patriot in this film  BECAUSE he questions the government. Illustrates how adversely the George W. Bush Klan has affected the United States: that the HERO of a popular movie  not ""anti-hero"" or ""ambiguous villain"" - can criticize the administration so loudly and meet with vindication rather than stultification.<br/><br/>But this is where the film meanders into ""We Can Dream, Can't We?"" status. The conspiracy reaches to such high government offices that Beatty's character is right in contemptuously sneering that one sharpshooter can do nothing to curb it. But after a faux-climax that does not payoff (a grand, panoramic shootout in snowy mountains) and a military hearing which also does not payoff (where Swagger demonstrates his big gun  the one that can counter the earth's Coriolis effect with its power, not the one that can make ladies drop trou when body-oiled), we know that a REAL climax is coming, one of insensible  yet Eastwood-ian avenger  proportions. (Cue pretty orange explosions.) <br/><br/>It doesn't seem to matter to the film-makers that Swagger's methodology is only the corrupt administration's Decider-like tyranny and Might-Is-Right anarchy turned back on themselves  which therefore does not raise the Hero morally above his opponents but abandons him right amongst them. The paradox is that the parochial W. Bush administration regards only those people who support and behave like them (i.e. morally bankrupt) as the only true Patriots.<br/><br/>So after *Shooter* succinctly sends the disheartening, yet intrinsically correct message that you can't clean up the insidious corruption amongst elected officials with a big gun  Bob Lee Swagger does just that.<br/><br/>Now that's a Patriot."

","Well, what can I say? I came out from the theater with disbelieve. I was so sure that this movie is not going to give me much entertainment, other than gun-shooting, a little bit drama and romantic, and perhaps, a little heart beating scenes. But it proved me wrong. The storyline is great. Even greater than I first thought it's going to be. But once more time, it proves me wrong. I'm not going to tell you all guys and girls in details about this movie. This movie is supposed to rock anyone with their sense of war. This movie, is also for those who like being a sniper. It explains a lot about it. And I'm sure you can enjoy their brief but clear explanation about every details, and everything that can affect a sniping process. So, for you guys and girls who like a ""payback"" kind of movie, this is the most perfect movie for you guys. Enjoy!!! I rate this movie, 10/10"
"antoniotierno","6","1","5","2 May 2007"," nice chase-revenge thriller
","A film in the tradition of Jason Bourne (in the terrible Bush era) and acted with character and skill. Mark Wahlberg's performance is not as strong as in ""The Departed"" but the whole story is quite entertaining though. Violence is not exaggerated and the movie seems vaguely like the recent ""Deja Vu"" but without its visual effects nor its science fiction. Would say ""Shooter"" is definitely worth the price of admission and also logic, despite some holes in the plot. To sum up the picture is enjoyable and enjoys the viewer who doesn't expect too much but it's better than many action movies now at theater. Probably it's midway between Stallone's epic films - due to the action - and the modern thrillers"

My theater is near Walter Reed Army Medical Center, so I got to hear a lot of comments by those who know, that half the stuff Marky said in the movie was complete bunk. Also some real flaws, such as the everlasting bottle of torture water, and backward American flags...not on the arms of soldiers, but hanging on the wall...stretch the tolerance of ignorance.<br/><br/>Worse was the overt message that our government all the way to the President is nothing but a bunch of money hungry CYA Republicans.<br/><br/>The gunfire was worth seeing, as was the HTH combat, but don't blink else you miss it.

"Robert_duder","8","1","5","23 April 2007"," Mark Wahlberg proves his action movie chops and succeeds!!
","Shooter was just one of those action films. It won't be a stone cold classic and it won't take home any Academy Awards but you pay your ten bucks, watch explosions, chases, and the intense hero kick some villain ass and you love it and that's exactly what Shooter is and does. Shooter succeeds on so many levels. In many ways Shooter borrows from great action flicks from the past but manages to make those pieces it's own shtick and pull it off. Shooter also has a plot that makes for the best action films...vengeance.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg has had some great roles in the last few years but this is really the first time I've seen him grab the reigns of leading man and really prove himself and he does that. The film, with a lesser star, might have been mediocre at best but Wahlberg adds significant class to the role. Michael Peña is perfect for supporting actor as Wahlberg's improbable partner. He does a terrific job and is a great action sidekick with a tinge of humor to his performance. Kate Mara is the sexy female lead to Wahlberg's rough and rugged masculine role. She spends her first few moments on screen in a bra and underpants but she still holds her own and makes the role significant enough to warrant mention. Her and Wahlberg have excellent chemistry although their romance is not explored to it's fullest for the sake of the action. Danny Glover, Elias Koteas, and legendary Ned Beatty are the main villains who go to great lengths to set Wahlberg up for the assassination of the President. The three of them are appropriately villainous but considering the amplitude of what the villain does in this film they aren't used as much as they could have been.<br/><br/>Shooter almost HAS to be a praised action film because director Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to the genre having directed utter action classics such as Bait, Training Day, and Tears of The Sun. He does know what makes a great action film and that includes a good, strong story and plot and Shooter has that. We are inundated with the history of Wahlberg's character and then get to know him through his decisions and lifestyle. The final showdown has everything that a great action film should have complete with intense explosions, shootout and the bad guy getting his just end. Best of all Shooter is just a kick ass movie that you can sit down and enjoy beginning to end. It's not without it's flaws, I wouldn't say it has quite the staying power of some action films and I admit it is a little forgettable in the long run but for the time I spent in that theater, I loved every minute of it. Check this one out for sure!! 8.5/10"
"jemps918","6","1","5","22 April 2007"," Unlike Bruce Willis who can pull off corny scenes with a well-timed smirk and nifty lines, Wahlberg's style as an action star is more like Matt Damon: serious and efficient.
","Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Tears of the Sun) takes too long to unravel this story based on Stephen Hunter's novel Point of Impact.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, since Mark Wahlberg is convincing as Bob Lee Swagger, an excellent marksman who has taken up a hermit's life after the death of his spotter and best friend (played by Lane Garrison, who incidentally also plays the quickly killed off ""Tweener"" in Prison Break). Sought to help figure out an assassination plot against the president, Swagger reluctantly agrees to help but finds himself double-crossed and framed. On the run, he sets out to find the real killer. In true Rambo fashion, he takes on hordes of enemies practically all on his own.<br/><br/>Danny Glover is subtle as the evil Colonel Isaac Johnson, and Michael Peña (World Trade Center) is also good in his role as the unassuming FBI agent Nick Memphis. It's just a pity that Memphis' dialogue and connection with Alourdes Galindo (played by Rhona Mitra, a TV staple on Nip/Tuck, The Practice and Boston Legal), the sexytary with the inside info, was not convincing and felt very contrived. Her appearances were just too convenient. <br/><br/>Also in the supporting cast is Kate Mara (Brokeback Mountain) who plays Sarah Fenn, Swagger's bestfriend's widow. Sadly, her roles becomes the trite damsel in distress who of course knows how to sew, with gratuitous shots of her in a state of undress. But one couldn't really complain because she was eclipsed by Wahlberg's own naked torso scenes.<br/><br/>While there are quite a number of terrific action sequences, overall, it was quite draggy, with some unforgivably corny parts (the terrible musical score doesn't help either!). Unlike Bruce Willis who can pull off corny scenes with a well-timed smirk and nifty lines, Wahlberg's style as an action star is more like Matt Damon: serious and efficient."
"owlglass","10","1","5","22 April 2007"," On target
","WARNING: SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua doesn't like government or politicians, and the bigger they get the less he likes them. Shooter, as if evidence were needed, is an anti-government polemic wrapped up in an action flick, with a hero (Mark Wahlberg) Bob Lee Swagger, a former sniper and a man possessed of simple ethics and deadly skills. The government is a present-day one, instantiated in a grossly-overweight 'US Senator' (Ned Beatty)who likes to proclaim this every now and then like a creed and declaration of his license to act with impunityplus his henchmen, led by Danny Glover, as Colonel Johnson, as an ice-cold opportunist and manipulator. Not many shades of gray here. You know who the bad guys are and who to cheer for.<br/><br/>Bob, after having been used and left to die by his government in a mission behind enemy lines and seeing his friend and spotter die beside him as a result, manages to escape and tries to live a life alone in the mountains somewhere. He's sought out by and manipulated into becoming a patsy/fall-guy for the assassination of a foreign leader, though it looks like he was after the US President. Hunted by everyone and sundry, and with the assistance of his former partner's wife (Kate Mara) and an FBI agent (Michael Peña), whom Swagger declined to kill when he might have, and who as a result starts thinking the wrong (right) thoughts.<br/><br/>Though Swagger must realize in the end, as must the audience, that here indeed, as the bad guys explain several times, we don't live in a world anymoreif ever! not on the large scale anywaywhere the sheriff can fix the problems of his town with a few judicious killings, he does his best to make sure that, at least insofar as he himself and one other person he might still care about is concerned, he'll make sure that things are set as much to right as they can be.<br/><br/>As usualas in Tears of the Sun and King Arthur, for exampleunderneath the action flick there lurks a polemic that pays homage to the 'simple' soldier; the man without grand agendas, who just, for whatever reason, wants to do the job he volunteered for or was dragged into by contingency; while being deeply cynical about the motives of anybody much above the rank of the truly 'operational' soldierthat being the ones who end up in actual battle, rather than watching it from a distanceand definitely of those elevated to the status of 'leaders' of human societies; be these leaders in the nature of 'emperors', as in King Arthur, or of democratically elected politicians, as in Tears of the Sun or Shooter.<br/><br/>I happen to share Fuqua's cynicism of these people, and indeed of everybody in 'politics', and so sympathize with the sentiments of the movie. But I also understand that a lot of people will ultimately find it uncomfortable and therefore will probably turn off it. This might also apply to many who otherwise would agree with Fuqua when it comes to specific politicians they despise, however, because he does not proselytize and pretend that there's actually much hope to change the world either. It is what it is, and though individuals may win their personal battles, the result is at best a glitch in the system, barely glimpsed and forgotten by the next breath. As such, Shooter is a bleak vision. Very satisfying on one level, because we see the scales of cosmic justice tipped a bit closet to the point of equilibrium; but we also realize that they remain disconcertingly askew, with little hope for change.<br/><br/>The movie is rated 'R' (in New Zealand, where I saw it, 'R-16'); not, I suspect, just because of the violence and the heads exploding with well-placed sniper rounds; not because of the sex, of which there isn't any; but mainly because in the end Swagger does something that many, who would otherwise have sided with him, must surely find disturbing, despite all the bad things the evildoers have done, as he goes on a calculated final killing spree. It is lawless and ultimately denying that in some things there can be any hope for justiceor, in this case, the assurance of personal safetyand that sometimes there is only one solution to certain problems. The audience will have to take that home and ponder itif they see past the action/conspiracy flick at all!and decide how they feel about it."

Very little boring bits as well, the action kept on coming right until the very end.

It's also a good deal of libertarian propaganda, which I don't mind since it adds a very distinct color to things. Here's the scoop: Marky Mark just wants to be left alone with his guns in his house in the woods. Is that so much to ask? Apparently, yes, as the stupid government has to come in and mess up his life. He is sought after by sneaky Washington bad guys to help in their bad guy plot, mislead to think he's helping America, which he's a sucker for, framed, sent on the run, and ultimately faces his foes one by one, Bond-style, in an action-packed showdown in the names of honor and freedom.

Yeah he carried the story acceptably in addition to the other members of the cast doing what they were paid to do to satisfactory standards not that I mean to disrespect them but the parts they played were interchangeable. Antoine Fuqua is a capable director as I really liked Training Day and I feel that he did enough as the director to show the film in a good light leading to my reason for giving the film a 7/10. The thing is that I reckon the story is kind of basic in parts being that it becomes predictable but the action makes up for that as the fight scenes and overall action was well choreographed. Had a slight eighties feel which I'm not knocking as I feel it worked well for the movie.(maybe why I gave it a 7) So if you like berg and a motion picture just to sit back relax and enjoy over a bag of toffee popcorn and a cold beverage then you won't be disappointed. ;]"

","OK, when my sister took me to the theaters she said ""what do you wanna see?"" Instantly I thought Shooter because I'm a Mark Wahlburg fan and I love actions =). So we seen that.<br/><br/>The acting in it was GREAT. I found the only ones lacking at some parts, were Donnie's wife (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name!)I just found she played a bit of an anorexic, depressed woman a bit too much. But as for Micheal Pena (which some might remember from World Trade Center) played the rookie cop so well, and he could make his acting go from intense to kinda silly in 5 minutes. For my last review is Mark Wahlburg, I haven't seen that many of his movies (I'm forbidden to watch Boogie Nights!) but his acting in this was spectacular, he played the old shooter, almost cynical alone person scarily well. But my favorite thing was HE SHOWED PAIN, he wasn't ""ouch, it hurts!"" He was obviously hurt.<br/><br/>For the plot, the plot was amazing, a little hard to get your mind around it but still a great plot.

"allykat_d","10","1","5","3 April 2007"," One of my favorite books and the movie did it justice
","I loved ""Point of Impact"" by Stephen Hunter. It's one of the few books that I've read multiple times (along with books by Vince Flynn and Tom Clancy). I love a good conspiracy, and even better is a hero who does the right thing without getting hung up on what is politically correct. Usually, movies from books get it wrong. I gad a hard time getting behind the Bourne Identity even though people were raving about it. That was a head scratcher for me. But I saw it a second time and I warmed up to it. The book is still loads better.<br/><br/>I thought ""Shooter"" (Point of Impact) got it right, and this is from someone who's read the book 4 times. In fact, the movie is actually better in some ways than the book. And dare I say it, this movie is better than either of the Bourne movies which I have come to like very much. Maybe I have a different perspective since I'm familiar with all the books these respective movies were written from? Maybe knowing the books as well as I do clues me in a bit more? I think the key to ""Shooter"", now that I've seen the movie twice, is that you've GOT to pay attention to every scene. From the opening scene of the burning village you need to pay attention. I think the majority of reviewers missed some subtle things. The problem with a story like this is that if the conspiracy is too blatant, the hero is blamed for being a bonehead and not 'getting' the obvious, but if the hints are too subtle, the story is blamed for being preposterous because it's easy to miss important dialog. It's a balancing act that I think Antoine Fuqua, Mark Wahlburg and the writer (forgot his name, sorry) pulled off very well **if you pay attention**.<br/><br/>This is just one more opinion, and we all know what opinion are like right? If someone is reading this who has not seen the movie, please don't go in expecting Rambo or Commando. Listen/watch each scene carefully and you'll see that the conspiracy is brilliant. Johnson (Glover's character) and company, make certain someone takes the blame quickly so that law enforcement will stop looking for the real culprits. It happens all the time, which is why we see innocent people sent to jail. There was a 60 Minutes show about just this topic.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding when I gave this movie a '10' out of '10'."

","""Shooter"" really surprised me. When my dad took me to see it, I thought it would be another crappy, shoot-em-up film that contained excessive gore and too much sexuality. Instead, I got an adrenaline-rushing flick with great acting, a thick, intense plot, and even better...Mark Wahlberg! In the beginning of the movie, it flashes back to a less successful sniping mission Wahlberg and his best friend Donnie are sent on. Three years later, Wahlberg has retreated to an outdoor cabin, living off beer and enjoying his dog's company. Then one day a US colonel (Danny Glover, Silverado) arrives at his house with a story about how he believed an assassin would try and kill the president during an outdoor speech, and that we wanted Wahlberg's opinion about how this could be accomplished. Wahlberg, completely falling for the scam, accompanies the men to Pennsylvania, but not before delving into the sniping game once again, taking wind readings from various buildings around the site. Of course, Glover and his men completely set Wahlberg up, framing him for the death of Uganda's (?) ambassador, but not before shooting him twice. Wahlberg, seriously injured and hunted, runs to Donnie's widow. During these events, Nick Memphis, an amateur FBI officer, is delving into the attempted assassination, and uncovering information that, for his sake, should definitely stay put. His suspicion about Wahlberg's crime turns into realization that the man is innocent...after being kidnapped and tortured, saved at the last minute at the suspect's expense. However, during this time, government officials have captured Wahlberg's gal, and are asking for his cooperation in the case in order to turn the suspicion away from them. What will Wahlberg (just remembered...his name is Bobby Lee Swagger in the movie) and Memphis do? Once again, this was a great movie with much more sewn into its plot than this comment summarizes, that is begging for your viewing!"

There were only two disappointments, but nothing is perfect. First, the plot was a little simplistic and the main character seemed a little gullible. at first, but without that... no story.

Nevertheless there's something about his faux seriousness that really entertains and although he's consistently as animated as Peter Falk's glass eye, there's an reassuring bluntness to the Marky Mark cinematic experience that delivers, just as Jack Nicolshon is always Jack, Sid James Sid and Michael Caine, er, well...<br/><br/>Having said all that this is never offensively bad, in fact as alluded to already, the Markster is quite endearing, if a little trigger happy and Ned Beatty, in a thought you were dead bit part, is appropriately slimy as the bent Senator who you long for Walhberg to give serious lead poisoning. It entertainingly veers from a patriotic exercise in defending democratic ideals to a not so crypto-fascist manifesto for dealing with corrupt lawmakers. Rule of law? Just load up and tell me where they're going to be.<br/><br/>Fast paced, fun and packed the occasionally pleasing set-piece, Shooter is much better than a bullet in the head but whoever told Danny Glover to put a cotton bud against his lower lip and slur every other word deserves a visit from Walhberg in the very near future."

","This was one of the best action films i have ever seen. Before i start the film is like a combination of john wick because at one part the main character states that his dog was killed by one of the antagonists and it also has a heavy feel to jason bourne and also since the main character slightly looks like him. if you like jason bourne films you will love this one. The action scenes dont just come out of nowhere, they come at certain times and are specific to the plot and actually have purpose rather than other movies with wacky action scenes out on nowhere for no reason. This movie actually has purpose. Being a rated r film, it has a pg-13 undertone to it since i feel like most of the characters are nonchalant about most of the problems. My favorite scenes of the movie was either the field shootout scene or the snow sniper shootout or the last 25 minutes in general. All in all good decent film but it can be boring at times. Acting was ok but i feel like sometimes when characters get shot they dont show enough emotion so that makes feel a little cringe worthy when they sound like they are faking it but other than that please watch this."

","Shooter (2007) This is a conspiracy action thriller that follows a veteran who is framed for murder by a rogue secret private military unit.

It did moderately at the box office and got mixed reviews by critics. Some critics mentioned that its lack of plausibility took away from the film. This is a common error most critics make when reviewing movies. They forget what the film is supposed to be and the audience it is geared towards. This is first and foremost an action thriller. We are expected to suspend some beliefs. Compared to most films of the genre, I don't feel it did anything unreasonable. Hell, I've seen some stupid stuff in action films far worse than anything here. The film has done far better in the video market. It has even spawned a decent television show of the same name.

"Eric_Cubed","8","0","1","15 July 2017"," Unbelievably good yet awful reviews
","Well, there's not too many that liked or even mildly appreciated ""Shooter,"" but I am happy to say I am one of the few detractors. It's a formula for sure, but somehow by some miracle it all comes together as a very enjoyable film with a strong political message. Let's start with the acting. It turns out Marky Mark is a fairly fine actor in the right role, much like Brad Pitt (e.g. as Pitt appeared in 12 Monkeys). He gets into character, loses himself, and because he has this skill, the audience believes the character's hype, no matter how ingratiated. Michael Pena is the Latino call to Don Cheadle, two of the finest, most likable, most entertaining and most fun to watch actors of this generation or any other (see Pena's performance in Ant-Man, and Cheadle's role in Traitor for further evidence). Danny Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty are all pitch perfect (especially Beatty). The formulas' are aplenty and abound, which is why this is not a four start movie. The Fugitive template is used well, with the usual clichés: escaping protagonist after car crashes in the water, hero violates every law on the books and in the end is bafflingly exonerated, the token slow motion patriotic scene of Marky and a few others. But unlike the Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal or Nicolas Cage revenge flicks, this one comes with a strong message: political corruption is a conglomerate, and cutting off the head of the snack only results in another group of people, cartel-like, assuming the roles of their predecessors. ""You can't kill human weakness with a gun,"" Beatty states, and deep down in our cultural hearts we know this is true, for our entire political institution is based and predicated on the weaknesses and vulnerability that created it (also known as the human condition): greed, avarice, jealousy, money, power, loss---they all figure in and are part and parcel of our organizational belief system (warrior values, simplistic either/or thinking, propaganda). It's Shakespearean, it's archetypal, and it's completely true, relatively, for all celluloid is a painted picture of the Zeitgeist Gestalt (the notion that art, that being movies in this case, imitates life and vice-versa). And in America, the our system is essentially narcissistic, grandiose, entitled, arrogant, self-absorbed. Objectifying with abandon. Sadly, that is our generational norm, our legacy, one we must change if everyone is to survive. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is a bit too much to read into ""Shooter,"" but the sensibility, the nuance of what I am getting at is still there. So 3/4 stars! Watch it NOW!!!!"
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","20 December 2016"," Bourne clone does good
","A straightforward gung-ho action thriller without an ounce of originality to go with it and yet it doesn't suffer at all because of that. SHOOTER encapsulates the best and worst of modern cinema. Yes, it's a film that looks good: incredibly slick, with a realistic script most of the time, excellent special effects work and a good pace. Yet it's so derivative – particularly in a shoehorned car chase that screams THE BOURNE SUPREMACY – that only those who aren't fussed at all about unoriginal films are likely to enjoy it. Luckily, I'm one of those people, fully aware that all films and their plots have been done before and that there really is nothing new under the sun.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gives one of his better performances as the stoic hero, and he's given good opponents in Danny Glover and Ned Beatty, two actors who are rarely seen these days. The underrated Elias Koteas also has a nicely menacing part. But the addition of the excruciating Kate Mara detracts from the enjoyment, and the scenes she shares with Wahlberg just seem to go on and on. Luckily she's become a much more interesting actress in the subsequent years; here, I'm sure her character could have been written out of the script to better effect. Still, good action sequences and some gritty violence propel this one along nicely, and it's a film I wouldn't mind seeing again some time, one of those easy watches that you want to see when your brain's a bit tired."

","Since I've read all of the novels with the leading character, Bob Lee Swagger, I really don't know how, where and which this film had adapted from Stephen Hunter's novels. If just followed what the film's storyline, script, scenarios and the plot twists, it simply looked more like James Thayer's ""White Star"".<br/><br/>I strongly believed that the screenwriter(s) had goofed the hero's name from Stephen Hunter's novels, but 80% of it was actually stolen and extracted from James Thayer's novel instead. I do think that this movie's product people should pay him 80% of the movie right fee and 10% to Hunter to borrow the more widely known character's name.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad but the scenarios and the twists simply not quite possible and highly unlikely to ring true.

","After being abandoned on a mission that didn't officially take place marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger resigns and makes a new life for himself in the remote mountains on Wyoming. Three years later he is approached again; intelligence has discovered a plot to assassinate the president using a highly skilled sniper; it will be Swagger's job to figure out how and where it will be done so the shooter can be caught and his backers identified the problem is the people he is working for are setting him up to take the blame. Swagger manages to get away from the scene but is badly injured. He is now the most wanted man in America and he is determined to find out who framed him and why. The only people on his side appear to be Sarah Fenn, the wife of his former partner, and Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent.<br/><br/>This movie gets off to a fine start with its effective prologue before getting into the main story. Then after an efficient set up the action starts and seldom lets up for too long. Mark Wahlberg carries the film in the role of Swagger; he is believable in the role. Swagger is a great lead character as he isn't too invulnerable; he gets shot and has to deal with the consequences. Michael Peña also impresses as Memphis; playing him in a way that isn't stereotypical for this genre. Danny Glover is solid enough as the chief bad guy Colonel Isaac Johnson and Kate Mara is good in the role of Sarah. The action is exciting; mostly it involves shootings, not surprising given the film's title, but there are also explosions and some fights. While there is inevitably some blood the gore isn't excessive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the action genre and those who enjoy a good conspiracy."

"jsb0809","4","0","2","17 December 2014"," Has potential, but is very unrealistic
","5 years ago, when Shooter first came out, I thought it was great; And honestly, it truly is a good movie. I remember being on a Marky-Mark, Bourne kick, where I was seeking constant action and excitement. As a 14 year old, not diving in and only looking at this movie on the surface, it was a fun and exciting movie to watch, just as I had wished. However, as hard as it tries and as much as it wants to be, Shooter is not a realistic action movie. <br/><br/>I must give credit where credit is due, and applaud director, Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua does a great job focusing on the contrasting close ups and wide shots early in the movie. Although a poorly generated computer image, the opening scene's wide shots resemble natural human vision, wide and vast. This theme of ""looking down the barrel"" continues throughout the movie as it contrasts with the frequent close ups, resembling the view you'd get looking down the scope of a Swagger's Barret. As I mentioned, it's trying to be realistic and Antoine Fuqua - A for effort man, but this film falls very short from realistic.<br/><br/>It can be argued that most ""good"" action movies have to have some sorts of craziness in it to stand out; and I'd agree and say that's true. But there are many issues and many more ""goofs"" in this film that I couldn't get over. How cliché of a setting is the dangerous mission in the small innocent African village? Why does an entire village have to be blown to smithereens and everyone's life taken because of some evil, money hungry men in the west? As a member of the United States Army, it bothers me that Gunnery Sergeant (a rank that only exists in the Marine Corps) Bob Lee Swagger is first introduced to us wearing the Army Combat Uniform. Yes, it is a minor detail, but it is kind of a big deal to service members. As a sniper, concealment is everything. No soldier would come out of their prone, unknown position to try and take on helicopter and a platoon-sized element on their own. Swagger and spotter, Donnie, left for dead behind enemy lines..? We are talking about the US Army, or the United States Marine Corps (not sure which branch to reference) either way, the most powerful and sophisticated military and government in the world. In no situation, would any branch of the military ""leave a fallen comrade,"" nor would such a high profile assassination in government be held together with just a senator, Colonel, and their foot soldiers. As with all the goofs, they are all little, minute details that must have been overlooked, effectively tarnishing its sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>I also find it very difficult to believe that a fresh out of academy, FBI agent Memphis (Michael Pena) would be so quick to jump sides. The most realistic approach would be to stay on the FBI side and work more in depth on the evidence if he felt so strongly against the allegations on Swagger. Like mentioned, the FBI is still US Government. The FBI would have much more resources to track Memphis before Swagger, a fugitive at this time, would be able to locate Memphis with his attackers. The whole movie jumps. It'd be nice to see the planning or the recon done by Swagger to justify his moves always being one step ahead of the entire FBI. In Shooter, Swagger is portrayed as superhero that has the god sent ability to avoid all but two of the thousands of rounds shot at him in the 2-hour movie. Swagger either managed to dig up Wonder Woman's bulletproof bracelet or the entire team of the FBI and SWAT agents must have been 12 year olds and got their only combat training from a Call of Duty video game. It's common sense to lead a moving target; how Swagger out runs every round shot at him by two officers posted up on a hovering helicopter is beyond me. The same is true with the helicopter pilots. Their only training must have come solely from a flight simulator. How to you miss a stationary target with two mounted M230 chain guns firing 624 rounds per minute? All the pilot would have to do is wiggle the cyclic stick or tap the rudder pedals in the helicopter to create a spray that would have most definitely taken out Swagger. <br/><br/>The ending is also a disaster. No matter how upset Swagger maybe, it's pretty unrealistic to go Hugo Chavez on the senator and colonel. It's irrational. Swagger had no signs of PTSD or anything else that could possibly justify their murder. Swagger would instantly be the number one suspect; He has already proved to the world that he's capable of what is literally, the impossible. With this country's judicial system, they would have been in custody awaiting trial immediately after Swagger's release. <br/><br/>Action movies are great. Many are unrealistic, but I guess we like the fantasy right? That's fine. I just feel like Shooter tried too hard to be realistic when it is not. That's my problem. They made an effort, but it wasn't a very strong ever. They went into to great detail where it wasn't really needed. There are numerous plot holes that could have been given more attention instead.<br/><br/>So, in short, Shooter really is a good movie, don't get me wrong. For a weekend on Netflix, this is a great choice if you're feeling like vegging out on the couch and not using your brain for a couple hours. However, you have been warned: Critically thinking, If you try to think through this movie, its very possible you will get very annoyed, very fast."
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","15 November 2014"," ""I don't think you understand. These boys killed my dog.""
","Except for the idea that former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and FBI detective Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) could blow up an elite team of twenty four assassins and go on to decimate a mountain cabin with a U.S. Senator (Ned Beatty), I thought this was a pretty effective thriller. The set up with the hiring of Swagger for his expertise in sniper tactics was convincingly done, and with the kind of skill required for such long distance marksmanship, it makes me wonder when a real life attack like the one depicted in the film might some day be attempted.<br/><br/>Say, keep an eye on Swagger after he's shot by Timmons (Alan C. Peterson). While on the run, he makes his way to some room off an alley, and when he closes the door behind him, all trace of the bullet hole and bloody wound on his upper right chest is suddenly gone. For a minute there I thought this was an X-Men movie with Wolverine in the lead.<br/><br/>You know what was really cool? Seeing Levon Helm in the role of the crusty, old firearms expert that Swagger and Memphis visit to learn about bullet rifling. I loved the way they wove a Kennedy assassination conspiracy into the story with Rate's (Helm) avowal that he still had the shovel that buried the three grassy knoll guys. The 'X-Files' also had a cool way of inserting the Kennedy assassination into the mythology of that show with the character of the Cigarette Smoking Man. Fifty years plus since that terrible event and writers are still toying with the assassination theories, I guess we'll just never know.<br/><br/>Well look, I know you have to leave reason and logic on hold while watching pictures like this, but there's no reason you can't have a good time with it. For me, it's all about looking for plot holes and goofs to see if the story stands up under careful scrutiny. Watching this flick, I kept a careful eye on Swagger as he made it a point to fulfill Nick Memphis' statement made early in the film - ""In a conspiracy, all loose ends are trimmed""."

","I know that those who are proficient hunters have a true appreciation for the details involved in long range shooting. The technical, physical and psychological skills are tremendous. Hence, my appreciation of the film is a bit lost in the continuous sharing of detail above my knowledge base. I came in looking for an action/conspiracy movie. Our heroes possess the previously mentioned skills and share with us their knowledge through small cocky or passing snippets, not deadpanned ""I know everything about guns that you could never read"" speeches. The storyline works until the last three scenes where parties continue to meet up, somehow, someway, despite there being no chances of any of that ever happening in real life. It's a lot to swallow. Another silly aspect was the beauty of the females in the film... was that really necessary? On second DVD viewing, I watched the deleted scenes and realized two things: all humor was edited out of the movie and that mark Wahlberg, a fine actor who I've enjoyed in other movies tremendously, was just doing his best Bruce Willis imitation."

"thewillt08","5","0","1","28 July 2013"," This is Why Snipers are Awesome
","I always said Mark Wahlberg belonged in action movies. Well, Shooter proves my point. Don't get me wrong, Mark Wahlberg is a very talented human being from the Funky Bunch from action films to comedy films, this guy has done it all. In Shooter Wahlberg plays a talented sniper who is set up by Danny Glover to assassinate the president. Obviously Wahlberg is innocent so it becomes a story of vengeance, justice, and discovery of the truth. I expected a few things from this movie and what I got was different in a good way.<br/><br/>Action movies such as these are one of two things, a reckless bloodbath, or a decent or even good story with a lot of awesome and unrealistic action scenes. When watching a movie like this you got to take reality out of the equation. If it isn't too unrealistic it works and in this movie, most of the action is believable. In fact, the action scenes in this movie were some of the coolest and best I have seen in a while. The acting itself even surprised me. Mark Wahlberg did a very good job playing the ex-marine. He talks with confidence and he clearly knows what he is talking about. His hand to hand combat is very impressive. He clearly did his homework for this role. <br/><br/>Danny Glover is one of my favorite actors ever but he doesn't play the best villain. He is mostly all talk and by that I mean he doesn't really do much. When he is on screen he mostly just takes up space and rambles on about how dangerous and skilled Wahlberg is. In a way he is smarter than everybody else because he knows the reality of the situation and the fact that his plan is screwed. The Russian guy in the wheelchair was a better villain because he had interesting backstory and he put a cool twist to the story which was overall impressive.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the good stuff, the action. I love snipers. The idea of the weapon and how you can kill somebody from so far away with precision is interesting to me. The wind factor and angel was cool as well. The best scene was the snow scene. The meeting in the snowy mountaintops was foolish and pointless to begin with but they made up for it with some awesome sniper shots. Wahlberg is in a snow suit so he can't be seen and he takes out three or four men within a minute or two. The entire scene was clever, well written, well shot, and exciting. I almost re-winded my Netflix to watch it again. It also set the plot towards an ending and it was an all-around great scene.<br/><br/>There were a few characters in the movie that weren't that great like the girl that was supposed to be the love interest but couldn't really find time for and the FBI agent who had a strong beginning but faded off in the end. The FBI agent was convinced that Wahlberg was innocent and he was digging into it. Danny Glover and the rest of the people involved did not like that and after a fail attempt on his life Wahlberg takes him in as a student. The guy is useful and has a few awesome moments but in the end he is forgettable and unimportant which I think is sad because he was a good and string character.<br/><br/>There is one scene I need to talk about and it is probably controversial. That scene is the raid on the house. It starts out great with a few stealthy kills that looked awesome. Wahlberg plants some pipe bombs for insurance and that obviously foreshadows a shootout with a lot of explosions. This is where I see the problem. I understand the situation. It is the middle of the movie and there was a good time since an action scene so it needed to be big. There is a fine line between big and unbelievable and a few times this scene flirts with it. It is entertaining but 20 on 1 I don't see how it was possible. I was hoping the pipe bombs would take out most of the guys but it really didn't and they had to e taken out by an endless clip of pistol and assault rifle. It was a good scene just too exaggerated for the sake of excitement.<br/><br/>Overall, Shooter was a very fun and exciting movie. The story was good enough with a few good characters and a twist and turn or two. I would gladly watch Shooter again with some friends being as I think it is a great background movie. It is a very good time and Wahlberg did what he does best, and that is be an action star. He was right at home in the role and it was great for his career. Shooter proudly gets the WillyT Recommendation for being a fun action movie that was better than I had hoped."

With Swagger agreeing to assist with this mission he is framed as being the shooter during the president's assassination by this private military company.<br/><br/>Swagger manages to flee the scene but gets wounded my two gunshots fired by officer Timmons. He runs into rookie FBI agent Memphis assaulting him for his vehicle. Trying to treat his wound he pays a visit to a former sergeants widowed wife, who was shot and killed from a previous mission. She helps to save his life by treating the gunshot wounds because she knows he was not the shooter who shot the president.<br/><br/>Swagger then leaves Sarah's house leading to a mission of his own to find the person behind it all. The private military company is on to him and everyone whom he comes in contact with. FBI agent Memphis knows that Swagger is innocent and as he is digging deeper into the investigation evidence proves Swaggers innocence. Agent Memphis is kidnapped by ""three men who doesn't exist,"" they took him to an area attempting to kill him and set it up to make it look like he drugged himself and committed suicide.<br/><br/>Swagger ends up killing the three men and saves FBI Agent Memphis who is then trained by Swagger to become his second snipper. They work together as a team to kill everyone involved with this presidential assassination plot. Because even though Swagger was an innocent man there was supposedly not enough evidence to prove that he was. According to the media Swagger Lee is still a wanted man but by governmental officials he is set free to go.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was amazing! Everyone especially Bob Lee was made to fit their characters so perfectly. Everything was so precise and well transitioned into making this film, it was probably one of the best action films I have ever seen. The movie made me look at life in a different kind of aspect. ""Nothing seems like what it really is."" Innocent individuals are being accused of committing crimes that others are hired to do and getting away with while putting others in endangerment.<br/><br/>This was a great movie! It's made me look at life differently. There was a line said from the movie, went a little like this; ""not everything is always what it seems"" I guess it means that you really can not trust anyone out there even if they are of high authority, because those are the ones you really have to watch out for. You can find yourself in a bind if you are not aware of the things that can happen to you."

It's always nice to see familiar faces in a film, but when they are in roles that just about any extra could have done, just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>The great Rade Serbedzija as Michael Sandor, a fellow disabled shooter recruited by Glover was not bad. his one scene with Walhberg was really good. His line, ""I'm just one dead man talking to another."" Priceless.<br/><br/>The great Ned Beatty as the Senator Charles F. Meachum, was also a treat as was Glover's. Beatty playing a bad guy was nice.<br/><br/>The late great Levon Helm as Mr. Rate,the gun experts, was a very wonderful treat. Helm just stole the few scenes he was in with Walhberg.This was to be one of his final films. He made one more film and apparently retire because ,I'm assuming ,of bad health. He passed away in 2012.<br/><br/>Jonathan Walker as Louis Dobbler another of Glover's cronies did a little better job than Koteas did. He had a bit more to do and say per say. He reminded me of another actor, Michael Emerson in this role. Kind of looks like Emerson in some scenes.<br/><br/>Louis Ferreira as Head FBI guy Howard Purnell was nice. He had few scenes but made count the scenes he was in nonetheless.<br/><br/>And last but not least, Melissa McCarthy (of Mike and Molly fame) does an uncredited bit as a Night store clerk Walhberg encounters on his getaway from the FBI. I didn't know or recognized her, her scene was way too brief but thanks to IMDb, now I know! :)"

"Lonewolf473","Null","0","1","14 May 2012"," Great Action Movie.
","First off I would like to point out before watching this film I had never heard of it. A friend recommended this to me out of the blue as a good action film to watch, and I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>---------------- <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays a great lead in this film as Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who is abandoned during a mission which leads to his best friend and spotter being killed. After the back story, the film picks up with Swagger approached by members of the US government including Colonel Isaac Johnson, (Glover), who ask him for their help in an attempt to stop an assassination on the President. After reluctantly agreeing to help the government, he heads off to stop the assassination, correctly inducing the assassination site with where the sniper shot will be taken from.<br/><br/>He is ready and waiting for the sniper to make his move, when the plot unfolds that Colonel Johnson had always planned for Swagger to be the scapegoat for his own uses, and they try to kill him. After failing to take him out he goes on the run, wounded from 2 gun shots, and is now a worldwide target for the entire nation to find. <br/><br/>He escapes the chase with the FBI/ Police, and after partly patching himself up, he goes to the only person in the world who he believes might believe his story, his best friends widow Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara). She aids Swagger by stitching and healing his gunshot wounds, and Swagger leaves to hunt down those who tried to kill him to clear his name. <br/><br/>While Swagger is on the run, FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) who Swagger had a brief run in with whilst escaping, is trying to figure out what really happened. After inspecting the sites of the assassination, he is beginning to feel that Swagger might be innocent. He is intensely trying to figure out what happened, when Colonel Johnson wants him rid of before he tells the FBI what he has found out. <br/><br/>Henchmen of the Colonel snatch Memphis and begin to interrogate him, and they begin to set him up to look like he committed suicide, when Swagger appears and saves him. Swagger teams with Memphis and they go together to find out more information and evidence to prove he is innocent. <br/><br/>The Colonel, knowing Swagger is getting close to collecting the information he needs to prove his innocence, capture Sarah Fenn. Jack Payne (Elias Koteas), the Colonels right hand man, plays a borderline psychotic government agent who helps in the capture. <br/><br/>The climax of the films comes together when they meet in a snowy mountain location, suited to Swagger and his sniping skills, and after taking on the odds of 3v1 sniping, he prevails and collects the evidence he needs to prove innocence. Swagger meets with the head of the FBI and clears his name, but the Colonel is unable to be prosecuted as they have insufficient evidence to prove his guilt. The FBI throw a small hint to Swagger on how to solve that problem!<br/><br/>---------------- <br/><br/>The performance from Mark Wahlberg was the stand out performer in the film, with Danny Glover and Michael Pena also playing great parts. The roles of Kate Mara and Elias Koteas were slightly exaggerated at times, but it did not bring the film down by any means. <br/><br/>The action scenes, specifically the sniper scenes were shot and played out very well, especially at the beginning (grass environment) and the end (snow environment). Each scene showed how Swagger used the environment to his advantage and how it helped him overcome the odds. <br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys a good action film should definitely give this a watch."

If you know anything about physics and hydrostatic shock, you suddenly get the picture of why the acting is so bad. They glamorize their facts in almost everything, from the screenplay writer to the scout sniper expert. Who supposedly coached Mark Wahlberg into being the ultimate bad-ass. The dialog is so bad and the premise of the story is so inaccurate, I can't fault the actors for their performance."
"xlfgfnadltswm","5","0","1","10 January 2012"," a satire of poor Hollywood thriller clichés :D
","Although entertaining and stresses political themes of ""paranoid"" government conspiracy, corruption, and abuse, the film fails as being a legitimate thriller not because it is improbable (it is a movie, after all), but because the basis of the plot centers on one of the biggest plot-hole clichés of thrillers: an illogical, credulous mass vs. a suspicious few or one.<br/><br/>==WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!== In this case, the credulous mass is the FBI and the aware single man is Special Agent Nick Memphis. Even when Memphis is informing his superiors of holes in the investigation against Swagger, he is told off as being tired, misunderstood, even ""crazy"":<br/><br/>* Being suspended from field duty, Memphis is working on the FBI tip line and receives information that a man whom appeared to be (and was) Swagger came into a convenience store and asked for materials that could be used to make an IV. Memphis was told off when one of the items Swagger bought was sugar, even though Memphis told him it has been used for centuries to treat injuries.<br/><br/>Sure, this was only circumstantial, but in great contrast, the evidence and facts that Memphis compiles and shows to his superior afterwards was too plausible to ignore and dismiss even the slightest bit suspicion. <br/><br/>In this scene, Agent Galindo goes into a conference room and finds an exhausted Memphis pouring over reports, documents, and photographs. These was amongst Memphis's findings (out of order) which Galindo ignored.<br/><br/>FINDING TWO: Witness report inconsistent with general sniper MO The responding officer (part of the conspiracy) claimed that he saw a rifle barrel sticking out of the window of the sniper's nest which called him to investigate. Military snipers never would do that for it greatly risks revealing there position, and an elite sniper like Swagger would know that.<br/><br/>FINDING THREE: Investigation advances way too fast Less than 30 minutes after the rifle shot was fired, the first ballistic and forensic reports started to come in, even when the feds and secret service were just ""closing the perimeter"" and ""scrambling"" helicopters. Galindo dismisses it as the result of efficient cooperation between federal law enforcement agencies, but Memphis says (which is humorously true) ""Were the federal government, were not THAT good.""<br/><br/>FINDING FOUR (Really?!): Facts of marksmanship That fact that this doesn't even raise the slightest bit of suspicion in Galindo is ridiculous and laughable. <br/><br/>Accordingly, how the FBI (and what the conspirators wanted) saw it was Swagger was trying to assassinate the US President but he ""missed"" and hit the Archbishop of Ethiopia instead. Memphis points out the holes<br/><br/>First things first, because there was no wind at the time the shot was taken (video footage confirmed this as the flag behind the president was still at the moment), it was unlikely that environmental factors could have affected the shot.<br/><br/>Second,Memphis indicates that the idea of Swagger ""missing"" the President was highly inconsistent with Swagger's record.<br/><br/>Using Swagger's results from a prior USMC shooting competition he took part, Memphis showed that he had successfully placed 5 shots dead-center in a one inch spread while shooting from a thousand yards away. Yet Swagger, when ""he"" made the shot from 2,000 yards away, he ""missed"" and hit the Archbishop, TWO FEET away?<br/><br/>If situation happened in real life, it is highly unlikely that"

","I choose to do a review on the film Shooter made in 2007. This action thriller is very exciting and one of my favorite films. Throughout the film there are a lot of parts that will put you to the edge of your seat and leave you waiting to see whats going to happen next. I like how it puts you in the perspective of being a trained tactical sniper and how their minds work. For example, Swagger is left in charge of figuring out how the president was going to be shot at in the beginning of the movie, he takes you through all the places where he would preform this assassination until he figures out where it is going to be done from. I think this is a very unique perspective to have in a movie and like how they have done it in this film. Bob Lee Swagger really was acted out good and I liked his character a lot. He was really smart and could think on his feet really well, this made the movie interesting because it was always cool to see how he was going to get himself out of tight situations, or the next thing he was going to do to see why he was being framed. Also there was a lot of action throughout the film, there was a lot of gun scenes and some very good explosions that were really realistic. In the scene where Swagger is ambushing the cabin it almost makes you feel like your there because of how realistic it is and how the cameras are being angled.<br/><br/>Overall on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this film and 8 there was good acting and kept me watching through out the whole film, it was very good. This film makes you think and i like that in a movie. There are a lot of thrilling moments in this action packed movie and is sure it keep you at the edge of your seat."

","I was not among those who loved Training Day, so I didn't watch King Arthur(well, that wasn't necessarily the only reason), and this is the first Fugua film that I really liked. Like TD and Street Kings, this isn't constant action(what there is is all excellent and effective); there's a lot of tension, and there is a level of realism and detail(especially to the sniping, this is one of the best depictions of it in this medium... heck, it's one of the few to actually include the spotter, and he's an indispensable asset). This is quite gripping, it keeps your undivided attention from start to finish. The characters are mostly well-written, nicely developed and psychologically accurate. There are exceptions; the villains are pretty one-note. The acting is good, other than, for some reason, Glover and Beatty. Wahlberg is surprisingly convincing(and note that he isn't a one-man-army, it's closer to Bourne or such). This is beautifully photographed, with absolutely stunning scenery, and remarkably well-edited, not flashy and not plain. The plot is engaging and satisfying(if the ending is a tad Hollywood). Dialog is great, as is the sense of humor, very natural, in the case of both. There is a lot of bloody violence and a bit of strong language. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary track by the director, 11 minutes and 22 seconds of deleted scenes(completed ones), a 7 minute 22 second featurette called Independence Hall(nothing other than a boring, jingoistic history lesson), and the 22 minute documentary Survival of the Fittest, which I will review on its own page here on the site. I recommend this to any fan of the cast and/or this kind of movie. While not something you haven't seen, it does what it's supposed to and the presentation is impeccable. 8/10"

","Strictly speaking ""Shooter"" was akin to the Bourne series minus the adrenaline. Had the pace and action were put in a higher gear, it would have qualified for the action film of the year. <br/><br/>Swagger, a sniper in the beginning of the plot, loner afterwards is framed for assassination attempt. The story progresses about him unravelling the conspiracy and coming out clean. The plot is quite intricate and layers get peeled as the story progresses. <br/><br/>Mark Walhberg was a perfect choice for the role of the sniper. Kate Mara though pretty had a badly sketched role, maybe straight out the book. Danny Glover gives a towering performance. The meek character of Michael Pena did not quite fit in."

","Imagine First Blood mixed with The Fugitive, and that gives you an idea of what to expect with this film, from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, King Arthur). Basically Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), one of the world's great marksmen, and son of a Congressional Medal of Honour winner, left the military years ago, but is brought back and recruited by lisping Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover). He wants Swagger to help find a way to have the President of the United States killed within two weeks, and he does do it, but he is set up as shooting another politician. The authorities did manage to get two bullets in Swagger's chest, and are convinced he is dead, but he was only wounded by the shots and on the run from the police, and wanting to know who double-crossed him. Obviously villain Johnson is determined to hunt him down and kill him before Swagger, who he knew was still alive, can get to him and his schemes. Also starring Michael Peña as Nick Memphis, Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn, Elias Koteas as Jack Payne, Rhona Mitra as Alourdes Galindo, Jonathan Walker as Louis Dobbler, Justin Louis as Howard Purnell, Tate Donovan as Russ Turner and Rade Serbedzija as Michael Sandor. Wahlberg is a good chisel-jawed lead, Glover is okay as the villainous Colonel, and there are some good chase and action moments, it might have some twinges in the plot, but it is a likable action thriller. Worth watching!"

","Shooter is about a retired US sniper who has been volunteered from the FBI that they is going to a presidential shootout during his campaign. Okay, already it sounds dumb and the man who is called Swagger is really smart... so why would he agree to that and not be suspicious of the... ""FBI"". So the president is shot but he is not the one who dies, the minister of south Africa i think is the one who dies. Another stupid remark. So now Swagger is a fugitive and a suspect of the shootout so they are trying to get him down, and now it loses the political elements and goes into a pure action film. And that is when it gets more exciting. Again only the last 1/3 of the film is actually edge of the seat tension, 2nd 1/3 of the film was informative but not creative, the first third introduces the character but does not have a major goal that actually matters. if you re gonna have the president shot and almost killed, then it is common sense that he should be in the story much more.<br/><br/>But still the action was fantastic but i expected more."

"moviesleuth2","7","0","1","25 April 2009"," Nearer to a bullseye than most
","Snipers are frequently shown in movies that have high-stakes situations, but never before has there been a movie about a sniper. After all, how interesting is it to watch someone sneak around and wait for God-knows-how-long for the perfect shot? Fortunately, director Antoine Fuqua and the writers (adapted from a novel by Stephen Hunter) understand this, and that's what makes ""Shooter"" a success.<br/><br/>""Shooter"" is more of a revenge film than a conspiracy thriller. Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) was one of the best snipers in the world until he was left to die on a mission that wasn't supposed to happen; his partner and best friend, Donnie (Lane Garrison) did die, which hit him really hard. Now living alone in a remote part of Wyoming, he has resigned to solitude. However, three years later, Colonel Issac Johnson (Danny Glover) tracks him down, and asks him to plan an assassination attempt on the President, so the U.S. can figure out a way to prevent a REAL assassination. But Swagger is betrayed and he has to stay alive long enough to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>This is the kind of role Mark Wahlberg does whenever he's playing an action hero. In this situation, it works. Danny Glover is adequate as Johnson, but he doesn't have the range to play this type of character. Michael Pena is completely miscast as Nick Memphis, the FBI rookie who becomes Swagger's partner when he realizes that Swagger is innocent. Personally, I would have picked Lane Garrison to play Memphis, who, despite being in only one scene, creates a likable enough character to have resonance throughout the movie. Originally, I would have thought that Kate Mara would have been too young for this role, but I was surprised as she is entirely believable (complete with an adorable Southern accent). Rhona Mitra is utterly wasted in the throwaway role as Memphis' co-worker. My guess is that the producers gave her the role to inject some sex appeal, but her appearance doesn't support this; she's too plain looking. But the worst offense is that her acting abilities are thrown away. Mitra is a capable actress (see Season 3 of ""Nip/Tuck"" for a really good performance by her).<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua knows what he's doing with this movie. It's dark, intelligent, and it never drags. The film deserves its R rating (an action movie for adults! Go figure.) and is all the better for it. ""Shooter"" is a fast-paced thriller, but Fuqua doesn't maximize the ""Big Reveals"" to outrageous proportions (in fact, one might argue that they should have been done with less subtlety).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Shooter suffers from some problems. The worst offender is its terrible lighting. The film is too dark, and while only a few scenes take place indoors, it's still too dark (too dark for a gritty feel too). Less important is the conspiracy is rather hard to figure out at times.<br/><br/>Still, ""Shooter"" is a great ride."
"Christopher_Reid","7","0","1","18 April 2009"," Good. And with some nice visuals.
","So, for whatever stupid reason, I chose to watch this movie Memento-style (that is, backwards chapter-wise) and I must say that it was an exciting and enlightening experience. Why did I do this? Other than being crazy, essentially to switch things up. With how formulaic movies are becoming these days (or have been since the beginning of time), what better way to cut through to the heart of a film's qualities than by destroying its narrative flow? Exposition no longer counts for anything but style and mood persevere. The story is easily pieced together.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, I was reminded of Memento whilst watching Retoohs (let's call it), what with suddenly being thrown into all manner of situations with no clear explanation of how or why. In fact, funnily enough, the scene which least grabbed my attention was the opening one (when it finally came). It eases you in whereas the others just take off and expect the audience to keep up (which I liked a lot). It was also fun trying to piece things together backwards, speculating about what's already happened and how people got where they are rather than the regular what's coming next, which is ironically much easier. The stupid thing is, almost all movies are probably about 10 times more predictable forwards than they are backwards.<br/><br/>Films are meant to create tension and build to astounding climaxes, right? But these days, the over-emphasis on dialogue prevents the audience (presumed to be borderline retarded one would think) from having time to sit back and enjoy the film. Does everything really need to be explained? It's an interactive experience (in that you ideally personally relate to the story and characters based on your own past). Retoohs has the courage to meditate at least a little on its ideas. When filmmakers believe they've got something special, they're not afraid to take their time, savour the moments. The audience can sense this a mile-away and are all-too-willing to join in.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the actual movie itself, probably my favourite thing about it was the cinematography. Or whatever you call it, the locations, the overall look, the way the action scenes were filmed. In terms of acting, Mark Wahlberg's minimalistic kind of acting always seems to work somehow and the rest were perfectly good at acting serious. Danny Glover's voice was hilariously difficult to understand a couple of times but otherwise, he was just fine and dandy in his role.<br/><br/>I think the strength of the movie lies in its simplicity. When it sticks to the facts of the story and its implicit power, its quite entertaining to watch. Too many movies try to force too much out of the plot (creating fake drama and emotions) but Retoohs goes easy. It has more respect for its audience than the typical (action) movie. Just give us something we haven't quite seen before, wow us with impressive stunts, committed acting and some plot twists and do it honestly. At its best, Retoohs is a memorable movie experience and even a bit thought provoking. But it also doesn't try to be a classic and in that it certainly succeeds."

","The movie is a standard American movie. It's about Bob Lee Swagger, a sniper (pretty good one) who is sent in a mission to protect a convoy that retreats from mission. The mission goes wrong for Swagger and the army is leaving him there. Three years from this, Mark Wahlberg(Swagger) is called again in a mission for the army... Things go very bad. From then the movie transforms in ""we kill everybody"" movie.<br/><br/>Swagger is practically invincible. I like the scenes, when the camera shows Swagger in slow motion just after killing or destroying building. As i sad above, this is another pure American movie...the ending is interesting... Is pretty god to watch on weekends so go ahead and prepare the popcorn."

","Well, what can I say about Shooter? A politically charged thriller rolled up in an action packed 2 hour blast-o-rama. A little too rolled up. If the director's original intentions were to make the action movie with serious political motivations he succeeded and failed in equal measures. You can feel the political under-tones in several spots but then over-blown action rolls over and kills it. When it seems like it's going to go deeper and it does seem like it too; Marky Mark and co. blow s*** up and kill heaps of people putting you off the trail. While it did succeed in making a better action movie then most in the market, it still lacks but what do you expect. If you want to sit down for 2 hours and watch explosions this will satisfy and make you feel smart. Knock yourself out. *** out of *****"
"super16","4","0","1","23 July 2008"," Clichéd but not without interest
","This is a fairly polished production; however, the script takes some very easy short-cuts or falls back on some very clichéd characters. The parts of Johnson (Glover), and all of the other bad guys are comically, characteristically ""bad"" guys. Glover's role, in particular, ends up the moving towards a portrayal where he is tossing off purely two dimensional lines so bad they are laughable. Wahlberg's portrayal is fine, if limited to very few notes. As some other reviewers notes, Mara is essentially limited to some expressions of fear and anxiety. Pena is well used, although a fair portion of his role towards the end of the plot ends up in deleted scenes. <br/><br/>The lack of credibility in some key points (A. that Wahlberg's role wouldn't ask for any kind of basic identification and would feel that it would be necessary for one man to do the wind and location scouting readings, versus telling any number of presumably other competent Army, FBI or other agency snipers to assist -- and, of course, confirm; B. that every other FBI officer, experienced officers, all, would question Pena's recollection. memory and interpretations -- with the KEY exception of one secretary; C. that a large, amorphous well- staffed and well-funded ""agency"" could exist in the U.S. government overseen by only one lone senator from the great state of Montana) probably didn't ruin the movie for anyone who wanted a action piece, but it hurts the movie as both a suspense or thriller feature. The comparison by one television to the Bourne movie is totally off the mark. This movie lacks the intelligence of those plots, the acting, writing and stunt work, as well as the believability quotient of that series."

The story is brilliant and the character of Bob Lee Swagger is a new hero I'd like to add to my list of cool movie hero's. He's real smart, kinda like Jason Bourne, with the exception that Bourne used everyday-used objects as weapons, while Swagger uses bombs and rifles. But then again the bombs were all made of ur normal warehouse-products. I agree with the others that the character of Sarah didn't quite fit the film, but then again, it is rumored that there will be a sequel so maybe she'll have a better role in that movie.

"muggie2","6","0","2","13 January 2008"," Good... but not great
","This movie could have been so good. There's a lot of intelligent writing, good action scenes, a sense of tension that pervades the film throughout, but the whole end sequence seems contrived. The identification of the real shooter and the overblown portrayal of his character is heavy-handed, and from that point things seem to degenerate. A pity, because until that point the film was done very well. While the plot line was mostly good (great through to the late parts, average thereafter), I'd have to say that the characters didn't fare so well. Start with the good - there's fewer of them so it's easier. Mark Wahlberg gives a good performance as an embittered retired sniper, his attitude seeming to fit well with the character as written. Michael Pena's performance is superb, his character comes through strongly and is believable. I'm a little ambivalent about Glover's performance. He does a workmanlike job, but it doesn't really feel like there's anything behind it. He comes in seeming very professional, but by the end all he has is a a kind of smarmy arrogance that is not only grating, but seems counterproductive. Ned Beatty does the same - when we see him he seems quite effective, but by the end he is almost a caricature. To make matters worse, the female characters here are a complete waste of space. Kate Mara's performance consists mostly of emotional reactions after what seemed like a promising beginning, and Rhona Mitra seems to exist merely as a plot device. I saved the worst for last. Elias Koteas plays a character that seems to be in the wrong film - did he wander onto the set from a B-grade gangster movie, perhaps? Overall it was still kinda good, but I was hoping for so much more. *sigh*"

","This movie surprised me. it is the usual action film with the gore, blood, macho male with mega muscles and cardboard female characters. The ending was not surprising. What surprised me was how well it was made. The protagonist had depth; even Pena's character was good. Kate Mara and Mark Wahlberg had excellent chemistry; my only complaint is how the directors refused to develop it. This isn't a masterpiece by any means. It's a very good action flick.<br/><br/>I don't like how they portray the female characters. They are either tough girl wannabes (Rhona Mitra) or vulnerable girlfriends (Kate Mara). I know this is typical in action flicks, but I still hate it. I wish they would focus on a woman for once; or at least made Kate Mara's character stronger.<br/><br/>The ending was too contrived. Killing the senator and Johnson was needed, but I wish they put more unpredictability in it. I also didn't like how they underdeveloped Rhona Mitra and Pena's relationship. It came too sudden. But it's an action flick. Relationships are secondary to the pot. They should have cut Kate Mara's part altogether. I liked her. She did very well in her part. It's the character I had a problem with.<br/><br/>All together, I think this was very good. I enjoyed it completely. Of course being a girl I have problems with the way women are portrayed.

","Shooter came right out the gate with an action packed scene where marksman, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Walhburg), gets into an intense shoot-out (more like blitzing) with enemy Ethiopian militants (that's important later) and losing his best friend and spotter, Donnie Fenn (Lane Garrison). Swagger feels betrayed by the US government and goes into exile after a premature retirement. <br/><br/>Three years later Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) finds Swagger and commissions him to help save the president from what Swagger is told to believe is a planned assignation of the president. Swaggers excellent marksman skills and knowledge make him the perfect candidate, so he believes, so he reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>When he arrives at the expected assassination location things become really twisted. So he goes on the run with the whole world against him with only FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) and Donnie's widow Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara) on his side. You won't believe the twisted situation he becomes the center of.<br/><br/>This plot made the movie unbelievably hard to turn away from; you'll be on the edge of your seat to the end. It really shows how justice is rarely served in our society we live in. On the other hand Walhburg did serve justice to the part; he is extremely convincing as this ruff, tuff trained killer with that me against the world attitude. Danny Glover's role was a breath of fresh are from his legendary roles in the Lethal Weapons saga (I don't want to give away to much). The fighting and battle scenes were well produced and the blood and gore were icing on the cake. The story progressed well and made it pretty believable.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua did an excellent job, even after following up Training Day, one of my favorite movies. Both movies used the often over played ""crooked cop"" or cops, but the stories are so compelling that they will suck any action, thriller fan in. If you haven't seen it SEE IT. I doubt you'll be disappointed."

","When I say the next Rambo, I don't really mean it in either a good way or a bad way, just a descriptive way. Mark Wahlberg has developed an outstanding career as an actor, and he proves here that he is one of the best action stars working today. In Shooter he stars as an astonishingly gifted rifleman. What do they call that? Precision shooter? Something like that, I have no idea. I think sniper is something different. Anyway, he becomes involved in a complex plot to assassinate the president, a conspiracy that reaches to frighteningly high levels of government. Basically, he goes on a one man mission to take down the machine that is trying to frame him, while all manner of police and government officials chase after him. What you have here is a complex premise built on the chassis of a weak B-movie. But the production values are impressive and the acting makes it work. Much better than I expected."

","I was like I would hear that ""Shooter"" is same as ""Jackal"". Yeah, Shooter starts with this familiar subject and but the film shows that it is a big mistake comparing with ""Jackal"". In fact the director gives us some clues that sergeant Bob Lee Swagger is called out for this aim. But the film turns to a different shape differing from ""Jackal"". Bob Lee Swagger who is fighting for USA in Africa is now in his house to seclude himself because of losing his partner in Africa. He is deceived with the feeling of patriotism and he is wanted to develop a possible assassination plan to the president to prevent the real one. Colonel lsaac Johnson who is inside dirty works in Africa with a high level senator Charles Meachum persuades Swagger. Swagger works for that in such manners which will make him number one suspicious after the assassination. In fact assassination isn't against the president, it is against headpriest of an African's country because of the wish of destroying assassination reasons. Like everyone Swagger doesn't realise the real fact and moreover he is charged with the assassination because of his perfect assassination plan and he finds himself in a well-designed trap.<br/><br/>The technical details got me amazed and I especially admire visual effects producer. According to me starting and finishing scenes are very important for a film to deserve good comments. ""Shooter"" already deserves that. I think Antoine Fuqua did a good job with ""Shooter"" and I will be waiting for the other ones to follow his line. Musics are also so creative.<br/><br/>Let me talk to some players. As I said above Mark Wahlberg dominates almost the whole film. I don't remember such a film that Wahlberg completely carried it to the summit himself. But it is unjustice not to talk about Danny Glover's performance. As Colonel lsaac Johnson, Danny Glover really does his best. Michael Pena also fits in with beginner agent role and his role's form changes after assassination.<br/><br/>Pointing my words, I touch on gun specialist's, crippled man's and Senator's talkings. These are all about USA's acts all around the world. USA people, I call out to you. Give ear these words and don't believe the people who govern you any more. Why? Because, there was no mass-destruction weapons in Iraq where people are hungry appeared during the invasion. Abu-Ghraib is not a terrorist capturing central where most innocent people is jailed. In fact, most important points that I will remember about the film are thoses.<br/><br/>As a summary, ""Shooter"" is a top-class film and surely watch it."
"EijnarAmadeus","6","0","2","30 September 2007"," Shooter lacks of depth but gains in tension and action
","Mark Wahlberg should use SHOOTER as a revitalizer for his career, not just hasn't his career been filled with up and downs, but he truly needs to find the roles fitting him, SHOOTER's Swagger does. It's a rather empty movie, where it lacks off depth and punch, it delivers a full-on touch of shoot 'em up drama with impressive weaponry and action. And you quickly realize that SHOOTER isn't about anything else than entertainment; enjoyable and punchy action-movies will probably never grow old, but they will always seem somehow dull compared with more soulful delivering, as say the Bourne movies. Director Antoine Fuqua is clearly the movie's savior, he keeps it real and tough, not boringly typical and straight-forward; just look at the way he combines macho action with womanly curves, it that makes any sense. Danny Glover's bad-guy businessman with cigar and shades is a straight-ahead performance, the plot is twisty but feels calculated and the although the punches comes neatly, they are predictable; it is Wahlberg and director Fuqua that keeps the pressure on the right spots, meaning that none of them made any missteps here. SHOOTER is a pretty cool movie, easily said."

I was also impressed by all the theories how to shoot from a long distance. The sceneries and the cinematography were great and also the good camera work. The story lets open for other sequels if there is a better one and if there is again a high professional director at work.

Yes, Whalberg may be a military killing machine on the run from cops and government guys, but that doesn't automatically make it an old school action movie. Whalberg did kill quite a few guys, but he wasn't mowing down people and wild gunplay and blowing everything up in sight.

"honorhorror","8","0","2","4 September 2007"," Balanced and traditional, with some brilliant ideas
","Based on novel just like the Bourne trilogy, Shooter deserves a nod for its own stylish sniping scenes and some brilliant ideas in a simple and direct action movie.<br/><br/>Recommended to action fans.I don't have to say much about the actions, for you can see by yourself. Actually if I didn't see Bourne Ultimatum before viewing Shooter, I would give Shooter a higher rating. However, through the very traditional car-chasing scene and ultra-typical hero-framing conspiracy,you can sense that, the director Fuqua must be a very modest person. The entire film is shot in a quite balanced way, and you can almost find nothing short in each part. The movie starts with main character Bob Lee, a second-to-none sniper who was once abandoned, now recruited to help stopping a president assassination. However he is framed.If you already knew the end just 20 minutes after the beginning, what is that to expect then? That's what the director wants to show us. You can predict that all the bad guys will get what they deserve, since the movie is so typical in the genre. However as the story went on, some twists really got me, for example, that the archbishop was shot instead of the president in the plot. And a few audiences with sharp eyes may notice it in the first place, but the majority will only find it out along with our hero. The characters are believable. Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee seems a good soldier, yet not unstoppable like Jason Bourne but vulnerable and has his own weakness. In fact this movie is very reviewable for its brilliant lines and a very creepy(yet satisfying) Danny Glover only.<br/><br/>There are some moments I found out meaningless or stupid. For example the angry widow played by Kate Mera unnecessarily shot the bad guy to death, was overdone. Another one is the end. The evil senator and evil colonel sit together laughing about their successful plot in a remote house, ignoring the fact that their greatest threat Bob Lee is still alive and active and is most likely to kill them in such an environment. I mean, since they are both politically sophisticated, how could they have left Bob Lee alive despite that he already gave in once(destroy the evidence to the senator)? Apart from that, the movie is shot in detail and again, worth a nod.<br/><br/>8/10."

I didn't think I'd like this flick, and wasn't going to view it, but was persuaded to see it by a friend of mine, and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. Solid performances not only by M.W. but I also enjoyed the supporting performances provided by sinister Ned Beatty, who I haven't seen in quite a while, and likewise, a lisping Danny Glover.

","What makes a good film is honesty. What makes honesty is reality... believability. This film is one of those in which you can say... ""That COULD happen."" It is an adventure flick so you have to stretch it, but it is there within grasp. According to the tech expert they hired for all things guns, a shot from about a mile is possible, but with results more severe than we see in this film: And that is all that can be said without making it a spoiler.<br/><br/>An example of this kind of film is ""Seven Men from Now"" by Budd Beotticher, we believe the Randolph Scott character: That he is lightning fast, although this is not shown, just the effect. In this picture, we believe in the Swagger character. How did they do that, endear him to the viewer? Well, with a simple thing called HOMAGE.<br/><br/>For guys who like depictions of sergeants yelling loudly, what does the word GUNNY mean to us?<br/><br/>It took me 2 viewings to obtain the significance of Mark Wahlberg's characters NAME: Bobby Lee Swagger. Not that Wahlberg yells loud at anyone in this film... It is what he represents. In the scene where Wahlberg and Pena meet the Levon Helm character, Helm calls Wahlberg ""Gunny."" Although The real Gunny's first name is Ronald, we got a guy that could BE a younger version of ""The Gunny"" shooting his way through the flick. At what time did I start thinking about R Lee Ermy? I don't know, but it happened twice. So I figure that this was intentional Homage to The Gunny, who is great at shooting watermelons- So I had to believe that there was an intentional connection there.<br/><br/>This man that Wahlberg is portraying does not look like R Lee Ermy, but he is ""The Gunny"" and like his namesake, is a master of all guns and sniping scenarios and there is just enough tech in the film to allow us to believe what we see.<br/><br/>What we have to believe is that Swagger is a sharp operator: Thinking several moves ahead, covering himself and dealing with it when fat Philly cops get the drop on him. The way this is filmed, what we see as viewers is what Bobby Lee sees. We see things that could be significant, we just don't know what the significance is. And where Fuqua kicks us soundly in the ass is that we see all the things that Wahlberg sees, but the card-house collapses so rapidly that all we can do is watch Wahlberg surviving and then later wreaking vengeance.<br/><br/>I liked this almost as much as that remake of The Italian Job- Same kind of vengeance tale, except that I hated the bad guys in this flick much more than Edward Norton, who is hard pressed nowadays to play evil guys- He had better luck in The Score playing a heartless M-Fer. The guys in this film make Norton's crooks look like Weenie Roast MC's.. These are well you have to use the word that starts with F. These guys are just F_____D, not to cause anyone to be offended by the word, but just as definitive descriptions of these guys.<br/><br/>what makes this film refreshing on top of the complete vileness of the crooks, is the level and amount of practical effects used. Not up to Tony Scott's level with exploding barges, Antoine Fuqua is on his way with this style of film-making. And this director leaves his stamp on us- Give him some scripts like the ones Scott has done well with and this guy could do a lot.<br/><br/>The cast in this is pretty choice, especially Danny Glover and Ned Beatty... But the best shock is out of the blue, Elias Koteas, with a receding hairline... playing the crook of crooks, and we are satisfied when he is dealt with. actually, I was surprised to even see the guy... so far from the guy with the hockey stick in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or even the cripple from ""Almost an Angel""<br/><br/>I always rate these things by how much my butt was kicked the first time I saw it... And although there are a few little things in the flick which bother me after the 4th viewing, overall, I was convinced, even the 3rd time I saw it. Lately, if a film stands up to at least three subsequent viewings, it is one that goes in the movie collection. That's is why I can recommend to anyone who likes explosions, this film is worth the investment of a couple of your hours. Especially for the last thing I have to say about it: Kate Mara. I don't know where she came from, but if I see her name on something else, I'll watch it for certain."

","All these other people commenting on IMDb missed the whole point. It's not about the rightness of it, justice or hurt feelings... this is about a guy's dog. You kill my cat and I'll come after you, guns blazing.<br/><br/>Other than that, very impressive shootings, but in a rather naive and cardboard setting. You know the type: bad is bad, good is good and lots of bad people die, while the good guy slips through hails of bullets. I would really love a true sniper movie, but alas, I don't think snipers are into movies much, so everybody guesses. To see a whole villa not exploding from a simple burst gas line would be good, too.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is exactly what it says it is: it's about a shooter. He does the shooting all movie long, then the film ends. I like Mark Wahlberg, I think he has proved his worth as an actor, he just needs better roles. Bottom line: average, yet not disappointing movie."

","My friend and I want to watch this movie and I have to see that this is a great film. The story was interesting and I think Mark Walhberg's acting was good too, oddly enough there was no sex in this film and not really that much gore and yet I found it to be entertaining and plain out good. What was more interesting to me was how the storyline seemed to be all over the place and then it all came back to one spot and showed that everything was connected. And well a lot of explosions and gun use were used in it, that was cool, but there were times that I was shouting at the screen ""SHUT UP AND KILL HIM ALREADY!"" but still I was amused. After seeing this film, I think it should deserve more attention like other films this year are getting."

","When I first decided to watch Shooter, I was a little nervous about the violence, but soon discovered that the action in the movie covered up the brutal, close-up violence. <br/><br/>Shooter is the story of Bob Lee Swagger, a former Marine Sniper who retired from the military when his best friend/spotter was killed and he was left alone in a foreign country to fend for himself. Three years later: A mysterious man, Colonel Issac Johnson, approaches Swagger and asks him to plan a presidential assassination.The plan will never be carried out though. This is the only way to discover where someone(who REALLY wants to kill the president) would do it. Bob Lee decides to help and soon finds himself framed for the assassination attempt on the President of the US.<br/><br/>Shot twice and running from every initialed agency in DC, he goes to Sarah, the widow of his best friend, who was in nursing school for some time. She helps him re-gain his strength and heal, not to mention does several favors for him. With the help of her and young,handsome FBI agent Nick Memphis he takes down the conspirators who have framed him for murder. <br/><br/>Bob Lee Swagger brings a whole new meaning to the word ""sniper"" and is excellently portrayed by the astonishingly muscular Mark Wahlberg(Four Brothers, The Italian Job). Also in the cast as Sarah Fenn is Kate Mara(24) and, as FBI Special Agent Nick Memphis is Michael Pena(World Trade Center) with Danny Glover as Colonel Issac Johnson.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good movie with lots of action, a little subtle romance and some hard-core butt kicking, you'll love Shooter!"

This movie doesn't fail to pull you in. From the beginning, this is a great and it has an excellent (but very much expected) ending.<br/><br/>For the people that were stuck into some roles, they did a great job.

"lususnaturae","6","0","2","4 July 2007"," It's not ART, but I enjoyed it
","Hey, it's only a formulaic action movie - and as such, it's acceptable. Yes, the script is hokey, the characterizations shallow/overblown, some things are a bit implausible. So what? <br/><br/>Shooter is a type of movie not really seen much in recent years - one in which we hearken back to the old Hollywood heroes - tough, honorable, taciturn, gutsy. Some don't get his ""duty/honor/upright"" character, but rest assured that there are plenty of people like that - they actually exist. Those who are honorable and honest tend to assume that others are the same way; so honest people are easier to fool. The setup cover story is plausible considering his high level of expertise and service background. A deleted scene mentions his internet access being tampered with when he tried to check out Johnson online.<br/><br/>Some these days seem unable to attend to details, or remember info from one or two scenes back that explain the current action. Beware, the following contains some SPOILERS:<br/><br/>Swagger has a through and through shoulder wound - you can see the second wound on his back in the homemade IV scene. Sarah didn't have to dig a bullet out; just clean and close the wound. The hip wound is never detailed for us. I did wonder about the use of an auto hose straight from under the hood for an IV - wouldn't it likely be contaminated with dirt, radiator fluid or whatnot? Not really what you want running into your veins.<br/><br/>He is sitting on the mountain because he is thinking about his sworn duty to protect the US versus his desire NOT to do it because he feels betrayed and disillusioned - the scene makes sense.<br/><br/>He photographs the plate instead of memorizing it because photos are tangible evidence. He shoots the engine VIN, then the opened hood and front plate to associate them with each other and the spot where taken. <br/><br/>It is not surprising that Sarah helps him - her dead husband loved Swagger, and vice versa. Some of us are willing and even honor-bound to give that kind of trust to strangers if they were trusted by a loved one...it's common with certain kinds of upbringing. Turning him away would be a betrayal of Donnie.<br/><br/>What IS unbelievable is that she never closes and ties her robe. However, even though the female roles in this are old-fashioned and limited, on the whole the movie is a lot more respectful of women than most recent action flicks. He has good manners and also doesn't spout the F word constantly - which is right on target for this kind of character. Refreshing.<br/><br/>After Swagger kills the 4 guards the number of attackers is 24, plus helicopter. This is made plain when Johnson asks the Senator to customs-proof the arrival of 'the 24 man crew we used in Ethiopia' - Swagger gets to off the guys who killed the villagers - and whose retreat he unknowingly covered when Donnie was killed. Pay attention, people. The numbers were against them - but the escape is plausible, considering the ambushes he laid as he went in - ask anyone who is trained in that level of combat.<br/><br/>The AG agrees to the meeting at the request of the FBI. <br/><br/>The bullet would match his gun if not mangled on entry. It was taken from where he shot it at the stew can and wrapped to prevent other marking when re-fired - as the old gunsmith told them could be done. <br/><br/>He 'magically' appears in time to save Memphis because he sets Memphis up as bait and then follows him. Again, pay attention. <br/><br/>*If he doesn't kill the 'head bad guys' in the end, he has to live with knowing that they will probably murder more innocents - I would have done the same thing. True, others will take their place - but that's not the same moral quandary. <br/><br/>Mark was quite decent - but with some badly delivered lines and lack of expression. His 'these boys killed my dog' line is WOEFULLY wrong - that clichÃ© line is pivotal, and he blows it with a flat, rushed delivery. But, he is believable overall...and this character has good serial potential. Mark stands like a Marine, addresses people like a Marine, moves like one - they researched his role well. Wahlberg is masculine and solid...promising as a hero. He even has that rare ability to be both believably tough and yet tender/romantic - a quality that only the major action/film stars have. <br/><br/>I'm a female who loves action flicks. This film was intended to be simple and unsubtle - like the older films starring McQueen, Wayne, Eastwood. Viewed in that light, it's decent entertainment. A lot of the lines are wince-worthy, the bad guys too cartoonish - but the action, gorgeous camera work & settings make up for it. They aimed for a tongue-in-cheek feel, but didn't pull it off consistently. <br/><br/>The well-researched sniper scenes are fascinating and show how incredibly dangerous a highly skilled sniper is. (where do I sign up?!)<br/><br/>Good popcorn action."
"ian-jones","7","0","3","1 July 2007"," Shooter - hmmm.....maybe, maybe not.
","As far as action movies of this day and age go this one was quite good, plenty of action and lots of blood. The opening sequence was very well done and epitomised the kind of work snipers and spotters have to deal with. This aside, the rest of the film seemed to lose focus, the main plot gets moved up and down and side to side so many times that it made it hard to keep track of who was good, who was bad or who was just there to be shot.....I was always waiting for a sucker punch that never came. Mark Wahlberg's stock has increased in Hollywood over the last 3 or 4 years ever since ""Four Brothers"" and most definitely ""The Departed"" so he could pretty much make a TV movie right now and still appear in the next Scorsese flick.<br/><br/>All in all an enjoyable watch but no Oscar nominations for this one."
"RCWjr","6","0","2","23 June 2007"," Not totally bad.....but not really good
","It always happens. A film comes out and makes it appear that the armed forces have one person that is above all others in skill. Wahlberg plays such a character in Shooter.<br/><br/>A wronged, burned out military vet last mission went wrong and sent them into a spiral, only to be recruited some years later since they are the only one that can fill the bill. In the process they fall victim to the same deception they fled from which leads them to get help from a hot female with no other purpose in the movie other than to look great and give our hero some humanity. Hero is also helped out by one of the few honest people on the side of the law/government who end up uncovering a big secret that puts them in harms way that leads to a show down with the burned out vet after previously mentioned female character is kidnapped, which prompts said hero to mount one last ruse which in the end the burned out vet has to take matters into their own hands since the government, though aware of injustice is unable to do anything. <br/><br/>Above is pretty much the synopsis for half of the action films ever made. This one follows it to the letter. With some nice performances and action sequences, it still can't rise above being anything more than Sniper 4 in the disguise of a new film starring an A-list acting lineup.<br/><br/>In the end, it is harmless entertainment, but when it comes to putting down the hard earned dollars, this is a rental at best."
"carronuk","7","0","3","7 May 2007"," Hit the target
","I enjoyed this film. More so then even I imagined I would. I thought Mark Whalberg did a cracking job in the lead role, and I can not believe this is the same member of the well know boy group in the 80s. It seems like he has come so far since those early days.<br/><br/>Briefly the story is about an ex marine (Swagger) who is hired in order to ascertain how an assassination might take place on the President. He is subsequently 'set up' and has to go on the run. Along the way he enlists the help of his dead partner's widow, and an FBI agent who realises that the assassination isn't all it seems. <br/><br/>Mark Whalberg did exceptionally well in this film, especially as the supporting cast did not produce the best performances I had ever seen. The film moved well, and I didn't have to keep checking my watch. There were some parts where it required a lot of imagination in order to believe some of the things Swagger did, for example the second helicopter scene (you'll know which one I mean)<br/><br/>I also thought that the film had finished twice before it really did:<br/><br/>1. At the mountain meeting, where Swagger decides to destroy the tape evidence (honestly, why bother getting it in the first place, and damn nearly getting himself killed?) 2. At the presentation during which he demonstrated that his gun doesn't work and therefore it is clearly a set-up (why didn't he just do that in the first place?) 3. Finally the ending, where he kills the Senetor and the Colonel (surely he should have just done that in the first place?)<br/><br/>All in all, if you're looking for cracking action film, with a good entertainment factor, and something that you don't insist should be realistic, then I would definitely recommend this film."
"drivah","8","0","2","14 April 2007"," She shoots, she sews, she scores.
","Sure Kate Mara's bit part is a bit part. But she is sufficient to stitch up Hero at critical point, do an excellent bit as a normal person playing an actor (she is doing Holly Hunter as Tammy Hemphill playing the blond?) playing a normal person in another scene, and generally move the plot along. And she has excellent targeting and marksmanship. I also liked the use of actual 'off the shelf' tech. The various Barret(R) arms being showcased without 'magic'. Except for the 'remote' operated M-3 tripod thingy implied - IMHO there is no way a remote operated weapon could be used to shoot the black guy - the CPE is too high. Anyways, my other minor plot holes are, the FBI can't do computerized databases in the first place despite lots of our taxpayer money spent and with multiple times at bat. I'm not sure the FBI actually successfully uses IT on anything more than a local basis if that. You don't design a security system to shout out 'this is secret but exists and you cannot access it, nyah nyah, na, na, na'. I am even of the opinion that 'compartmentalization' does more harm than good. Anyways, well worth the 5$ per ticket I paid."

I promise, you won't be disappointed. It's wonderful how the previews have you expecting one thing. Then when you get to the movies, you are both surprised and pleased with the twist of the plot. The action was intense and went at a heart-pounding pace. Mark Wahlberg really surprised me with his great acting. I didn't know that he could be such a great actor as well an action-hero. Who would've believe that ""Marky Mark"" would be where he is today. Even recently being nominated for an Oscar. Well, I'm telling you. If you haven't already, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

Retired ace with a gun gets conned into government service one more time when Danny Glover's character waves the American flag at him and plays the guilt card. The assignment? Figure out the vulnerabilities -from a shooter's perspective- of an upcoming public presidential engagement so that he (the president) can be better protected. Yeah.<br/><br/>Well, what's a shooter to do? Accept the assignment, of course, so the fun can begin! If you like manhunt or fugitive-type movies then you more than likely will like this one. I did. 7 stars worth. This makes it a SHOULD-SEE movie and 1 star shy of being a MUST-SEE movie which in my opinion is 8-10 stars.<br/><br/>In balance, the plot did seem a little murky to me on one or more occasion but that could just be me being dumb or not paying close enough attention.

This movie is filled with good action sequences and for those who love sniper movies ( Enemy At The Gates ), this movie does justice.
