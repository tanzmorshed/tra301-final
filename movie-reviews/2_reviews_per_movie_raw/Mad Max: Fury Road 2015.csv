"ivo-cobra8","10","224","336","3 October 2015"," Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!
","When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. <br/><br/>At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. <br/><br/>I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. <br/><br/>NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.<br/><br/>10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise."
"isaacsuttle","10","218","329","14 May 2015"," An Action Masterpiece. Ridiculous In All The Right Ways. (9.5/10)
","George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.<br/><br/>Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.<br/><br/>Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.<br/><br/>'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face."
"MR_Heraclius","10","54","78","23 February 2020"," One of the greatest action films
","George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support."
"confrank","10","260","435","16 May 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre
","Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.<br/><br/>Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. <br/><br/>Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.<br/><br/>There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition."
"CalRhys","Null","331","567","25 May 2015"," Oh, What A Day! What A Lovely Day!
","An action essential through and through, it's plain and simple! Since the days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The Dark Knight', but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don't seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camera-work among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post- apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre."
"jethrotroll-30807","4","885","1630","29 May 2015"," Superficial action movie that lacks depth
","I'm not completely sure what I was expecting from Fury Road, but it was more than this. This is the latest example of Hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit. It's mindless, repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichés.<br/><br/>One of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used, and in this the movie mostly delivers. You have the high-powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. There's battle vehicles equipped with spikes, rigs with counter-balanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles, and there's even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make KISS jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment. And of course, each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship. And it's put to good use.<br/><br/>However, once you get past the eye candy, you realize there's nothing else to it. The story is weak. The characters are weaker. And the acting is the worst. The movie never drew me in. Not even close. Whenever the movie 'tried' to add depth and be dramatic, it was painful and embarrassing to watch. The scene where Furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene I've ever watched. And it says something when the most interesting character is Nux, a relentless slave/warrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help Max and Furiosa in their quest. Of course, one of Immortan Joe's wives falls for him, representing one of the many poorly executed clichés this movie is riddled with.<br/><br/>I can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is, to a point. This one, however, is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't hate it, but I have absolutely no desire to see it again."
"Ma_MaMia","1","1264","2364","3 June 2015"," This is what passes for a great movie nowadays?
","It's hard to believe that the same talented director who made the influential cult action classic The Road Warrior had anything to do with this disaster.<br/><br/>Road Warrior was raw, gritty, violent and uncompromising, and this movie is the exact opposite. It's like Road Warrior for kids who need constant action in their movies.<br/><br/>This is the movie. The good guys get into a fight with the bad guys, outrun them, they break down in their vehicle and fix it. Rinse and repeat. The second half of the movie is the first half again just done faster.<br/><br/>The Road Warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel something, even with it's opening narration before any action was even shown. And the supporting characters were given just enough time for each of them to be likable or relatable.<br/><br/>In this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about. We're supposed to care about the characters because... well we should. George Miller just wants us to, and in one of the most cringe worthy moments Charlize Theron's character breaks down while dramatic music plays to try desperately to make us care.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is pathetic as Max. One of the dullest leading men I've seen in a long time. There's not one single moment throughout the entire movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma Mel Gibson did in the role. Gibson made more of an impression just eating a tin of dog food. I'm still confused as to what accent Hardy was even trying to do.<br/><br/>I was amazed that Max has now become a cartoon character as well. Gibson's Max was a semi-realistic tough guy who hurt, bled, and nearly died several times. Now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with ease? <br/><br/>In the previous movies, fuel and guns and bullets were rare. Not anymore. It doesn't even seem Post-Apocalyptic. There's no sense of desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking. And the main villain's super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as Hardy's Australian accent is. They're so boring and one-dimensional, George Miller could have combined them all into one character and you wouldn't miss anyone.<br/><br/>Some of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking, and the CGI sandstorm is laughably bad. It wouldn't look out of place in a Pixar movie. In the previous movies, there was occasionally a sped up frame rate that gave a nice homage to the silent era. Now,Miller has gone full Looney Toons and sped up the majority of the action, making many of the real stunts redundant. They're too fast to fully enjoy. <br/><br/>There's no tension, no real struggle, or any real dirt and grit that Road Warrior had. Everything George Miller got right with that masterpiece he gets completely wrong here."
"tannerbrown-97210","10","138","240","15 May 2015"," Response to punishable by death''s review
","Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen."
"stephendaxter","10","903","1697","13 May 2015"," An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away
","Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. <br/><br/>The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. <br/><br/>I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10"
"donaldthane","1","1019","1941","24 May 2015"," On Par for Modern Hollywood Remakes (Meaning it Stinks)
","First off, this is another movie in which the action sequences last so long that you can go to the bathroom, get a soda, come back and still find the same people fighting the same fights you saw begin 15 minutes earlier. Personally, these type of action movies bore me to tears, because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences. In terms of story, the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point. Then they fight, then one of them wins. As an audience member, I'm ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting. And I really need the lead characters to have some logical reasons for doing what they are doing. <br/><br/>Here's my spoiler: They drive away from someplace for half the movie and then decide to turn around and go back. The only thing that happened was that they picked up a gang of old ladies. That's as deep as it gets right there. They're running away, fighting the whole way, they get away and then they decide to go back, so they have to fight the whole way. Nothing makes much sense, no characters are anything but as shallow as they could have possibly been made. If you like Avatar, you'll like this movie. If you liked Mad Max and Road Warrior, you're going to be angry about how that franchise was exploited in name and setting only. <br/><br/>This character isn't Mad Max. He doesn't have a dog, he doesn't eat dog food, he doesn't eat anything. Nobody in the film ever eats anything. Nor are people clamoring for gasoline, they all just seem to have it. There's an issue with water, but it makes no sense and the entire weak plot seems to depend on it. The movie ends with giant water valves being opened just like the air valves on Mars get turned on in the end of that Governor Arnold movie, I can't remember the name. The reviews calling this something new and different are absolute hogwash. This is nothing but things blowing up and cars crashing for two hours, which, by the way, is another egregious offense of these silly movies. They take a 90 minute movie with a great story line, and they strip it of plot and somehow extend it by 30 minutes. It's a scary trend, the kind of thing that makes one think Idiocracy was prophetic. The less the story and the more things blow up, the higher the ratings. Ridiculous!"
"sukhmanjitcheema","10","930","1775","11 May 2015"," A masterpiece on a massive scale.
","George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot. Must watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket."
"qahtanaj_85","4","430","806","5 June 2015"," visually beautiful but Boring action-action-action-no story movie
","if you wanna go and see this movie, please expect nothing but frustrating, dazing, predictable outcome action, and then just when you think the movie is ending you get an extra 30-45 minutes of the same action same explosions, same cars and faces doing the same thing they did during the whole first half of the movie. Do not expect any engaging drama or any plot of any kind, but here's the story: post apocalypse, no water (yet there are hundreds of people alive and working), no fuel (yet they all have it in their vehicles), women escaping – women returning back the same day. What a plot! Visually it was stunning, but that's all you get."
"manleytristan","1","753","1440","1 June 2015"," Want to lower your IQ? Watch this.
","It's troubling that a movie can be singularly focused on loud explosions and violence with no plot, dialogue, or character development, yet receive widespread critical acclaim. This is the first film I've ever seen that actually reminded me of the type the populace in Idiocracy would find enthralling. <br/><br/>To be clear, there are no redeeming qualities about this film. None. And I went in with pretty low expectations, figuring this would be some fun, mindless entertainment i.e The Expendables or any Jason Statham movie. The first few minutes weren't too bad: it looked cheesy, but it had potential. But then I realized that this movie is one long (boring) car chase...and that's it. Really. I mean it really was boring -- exactly what an action movie should not be. The car chases are all one and the same. After a few minutes, it just isn't exciting.<br/><br/>There is no story. The two leads drive to the middle of nowhere, then turn around. That's it. Two of the characters mention they are ""looking for redemption"" or some other trite nonsense, but the audience is never told why. Not that they'd care. Is the story about survival? At first you'd think so. Max mentions in the opening credits that he is a man reduced to one trait: survival. Yet at the film's end, when he finally has an opportunity to survive....he chooses not to? What? The movie was bad enough until this. Actually I forgot, there is an incredibly forced romance between two side characters that does nothing to further the story. This is a B movie with a big budget.<br/><br/>Likewise, there is essentially no dialogue, save a few grunts from Max and cringe-inducingly awkward lines from the rest. <br/><br/>There isn't any character development, but then again, the characters themselves resemble video game characters. There are no characters to develop, just two-dimensional avatars used for an excuse to show explosions. <br/><br/>So what is this film's targeted demographic? I'm not sure. I can imagine that if you are a 13-year old boy, really into cars/trucks/slipknot, pretty redneck, and probably a little slow, this movie may seem pretty cool. I mean it does have ridiculous cars/trucks outfitted with lots of weapons, spikes, flame-exhausts, (breast-milk?) and guys playing ""cool"" guitar riffs for no apparent reason. There's also lots of explosions and fighting. And scantily clad women. And tornadoes. And skulls. On top of all that, there is no need to pay attention to petty plot lines or dialogue in order to enjoy the film. Hell once they reach the desert, the movie repeats itself as the leads drive the truck back through the same place being chased by the same guys for no discernible reason. <br/><br/>The special effects aren't even that good. The whole movie looks fake. I know they went to great measures to avoid using CGI, but honestly, I thought I'd at least be impressed by the special effects, since clearly nothing was spent on anything else. And I'm not the kind of person who usually notices when CGI is used or not. <br/><br/>Truly awful. I would rate it lower if I could. The only recent movie that may have actually been worse that this was Lucy, which was also mind-numbingly stupid. <br/><br/>As the principal in Billy Madison once said, ""everyone in this room is now dumber for having (watched) it."" AVOID"
"lorenzgillisjans","1","739","1418","27 May 2015"," Absolutely hated it
","I can't believe why people like this movie unless you're a fan of no-brainer action-packed movies without a story. 2 hours of non stop rubbish without dialogue. I was a fan of the original Mad Max and at first Tom Hardy seemed like a great actor for the role, but this movie didn't do him justice. He did well as Bane but he wasn't the star in this movie, almost like a support character. I almost fell asleep and left the theater because I can find better ways to waste my time. The only positive thing I can say is that the world looks great as well as the props. Good job on that George Miller. At least there's something good about it. The trailer was promising and since many people praised this movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time ""to indulge in the deep content and story it provides"". There was absolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictator who holds all the water and controls the people. Let's escape, make a diversion, trap him, beat the living hell out of him and return to be happily accepted as the new rulers. Hurray."

","Mad Max: Fury Road sees veteran maestro director George Miller return to the Mad Max franchise after a 30 year hiatus.<br/><br/>Fury Road is a hallmark in action films. Miller's post-apocalyptic future provides an impeccable backdrop for the crescendo of mayhem present in this movie. From the first scene to the last, there is plenty of spectacular action, vehicular and human. The cinematography is lush throughout. From the opening shot of the lizard being stomped by Max (Tom Hardy) to all the action scenes raging in the desert, the camera-work remains consistently on point. Many iconic shots are to be found in this movie.<br/><br/>75% of the movie consists of action; so much that there isn't an 'action SCENE' present. Any action aficionados will have their expectations transcended while common moviegoers will have their satisfaction met too. What is surprising, however, is the emotional heft of the 25% that remains. Much of it is dedicated to the back story of Furiousa (Charlize Theron) who effortlessly delivers an Oscar worthy performance by mixing brawn with emotion for her internally wounded character.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult's Nux, who provides one of the best lines of the film: ""It's a lovely day!"" at the midst of a crazy thunderstorm consisting tornadoes consisting cars consisting mad humans. Nux is an interesting character in this interesting world and provides plenty of the action by his well... actions.<br/><br/>Finally, Tom Hardy's delivers a subtle performance as Mad Max. For a character whose name is slapped largely in the film poster, he receives barely a page of dialogue minus a monologue at the start. Considering the fact that he wears a Bane-like (see the parallel) mask throughout much of the film, it is surprising how powerful his performance actually is.<br/><br/>One musical masterpiece act in the movie comes in the form of the guy the mask furiously shredding a flame-throwing electric guitar while dangling above a mobile wall of speakers that roars through the desert. Imagine that. When all hell breaks loose only accompanied by that as the background music, epic is truly an understatement as a description.<br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max is a gleefully insane symphony of destruction that makes the Avengers seem like misfits and the Fast and Furious crew seem like the Slow and Sweet crew. This action packed masterpiece exhibits no shortage of high voltage, 2,000 horsepower action that also contains of lush cinematography, sufficient character development and a satisfactory plot (that works, cause it's 75% action anyways). Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of, if not the finest blockbuster of 2015!"
"punishable-by-death","9","521","994","14 May 2015"," A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.
","I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5"
"prospectus_capricornium","9","494","946","13 May 2015"," Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral
","Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.<br/><br/>The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.<br/><br/>After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.<br/><br/>Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.<br/><br/>Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history."
"leotfoster","10","393","754","13 May 2015"," Great non-stop action
","Great film, so fast-paced it makes every other film out there look slow and old-fashioned. Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. Miller is the real star of the film -- in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style, and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants, however he wants."

","I saw the original mad max... it was violent, it had car battles, it had minimal character development. I had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new version.<br/><br/>Never have I been more disappointed with a movie. The acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best, with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting.. <br/><br/>The story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial English students, the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development, it has horrible motorcycle stunts... and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things.<br/><br/>and come on.. a flame-throwing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar?... it's full of shitty clichés... badly cut scenes.. and lots of explosions. <br/><br/>Save your money see anything else and you will be better off."

","This must be one of the worst movies of all time. 2 hours of shootings and blasts. There is a lot of action, but it is the same through the hole movie. People left the theater before the movie ended, There is no story. It's a chase for 2 hours, where the main character (should be) Mad Max has a role as a sidekick. The movie title should have been ""Furiousa"". Mad Max has only a few lines, and after each sentence, he growls. The movie starts of well, but after 15 min. It is downhill with silly conversation. Normally a good action movie should be entertaining and you Would leave the theater with a smile, but not here. Then in the middle, we have a lot of fire, shootings and blasts and a lot of stunt/animated scenes. But it does not have any power It's just the same over and over again. The end has a brief rise, but again ends poorly and foreseen. The old Mad Max movies starring Mel Gibson had power and lines with humor and bite. Maybe they are going for a new story in this movie.....but there is none to be found. Crap!"

","first of all , i am not fond of writing reviews pertaining to movies but this movie reluctantly compelled me to write a review for the first time. So lets start,i had been desperately waiting for this movie since long and today i got a chance to watch it and after watching it i was left agape with incredulity that how a movie like this is being applauded by the masses , Seriously it had nothing, except for extraordinary nonsense action. This movie is devoid of a sane story but in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in recent history. Mad max fury road is highly overrated and is mocking other movies which have ratings between 8 and 8.7. Albeit, I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Chalize Therone but their acting could not save it from becoming a complete ruin. i am giving it a one point and seriously if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i would have given it much lower points. Its also a suggestion to IMDb developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations. Finally i am exhorting that do not watch this movie its a detestable and a ridiculous movie."

","Complicated hero who is easy to latch onto. Fantastic plot that is plausible in this environment. Terrifying nemesis, horrifying and relentless. Non-stop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe. This movie will have you feeling parched and gritty. Usually Not a fan of 3d - however, it works perfectly here. This movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it. if you love mutant vehicles, art cars, burning man, etc. you will be satisfied. A few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern Cadillac - the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me."
"mgamble9","4","188","369","16 June 2015"," Very disappointing...
","I was so amped for Mad Max after seeing the average review was high... WTF? Is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie was not good... No character arcs except for Nux and his was so contrived and abrupt that it shouldn't count... the basic story was very lame... the plot was goofy... all the 2D character villains with their bizarre mutations (the hovering baby-man? This movie had shades of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie... I'll investigate the user reviews here more closely next time so I don't get burned again... I still hope to see some awesome Furiosa cosplayers in the future so that adds a few stars."
"mike_brunton","1","239","475","24 June 2015"," A travesty of the original Mad Max movies
","I will be honest with readers. I only really watched the first 30 minutes of this Hollywood blockbuster. What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome. Honestly, once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film."

","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.<br/><br/>I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.<br/><br/>People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.<br/><br/>The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.<br/><br/>What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.<br/><br/>Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.<br/><br/>If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. Papa want a sequel"

"dandare4479","9","43","76","15 May 2015"," Kinetic Awesomeness
","Mad Max Fury Road is a stunningly beautiful and highly charged kinetic thrill ride. It is brilliantly filmed with amazing, and well suited bombastic soundtrack. The star of the film is its direction by George Miller, showing generation MTV how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem. Almost every shot is moving, similar to a James Cameron action sequence. As mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase. The first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it. Chalize Theron is great and adds presence to the film, it is one of her best performances. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance but I found his performance somewhat lacking, he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue, I preferred Mel Gibson's Max. The film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace, but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it. Is it an action classic? as a chase film , yes I would say it is, along with set design and stunt work involved But the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10, not much is explained in the film. The ending seems sudden and could of done with some more depth to it, especially the Max character. It is still a wonderful and refreshingly directed film to add to the Mad Max Cannon of films."
"Rskz","1","164","327","1 June 2015"," Half a movie, played twice!
","I believe this to be one of the first reviews I ever wrote about a movie on IMDb, but I just cannot understand what all the hype about this movie is about! Seriously! #30 in the Top#250 !? Are you all kidding me?1 This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very very long time! I love action movies, so this is not coming from a ""The Notebook"" kind of guy, but seriously, there is nothing nothing good about this movie, it's borderline (if not full-on) ridiculous! A chained guy playing a flame throwing guitar?! Does it look cool? Yes, but in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be taken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever post-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to happen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50% of the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie, yeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie half-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What a stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and when they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again, not ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a movie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a storyline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline... what storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie, Silent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he survived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa (Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw Ruler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the bad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the movie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with them this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast milk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the semi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where they are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that somehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They tell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back to where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing them, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making they're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector, you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half. The get there, with the dead body of Immortal Joe (yep, he died.) and become the ruler (I guess) of these Mountains that miraculously has tons of water, that no one has any clue where it comes from. Max leaves! The Pathetic End!"

","Cold-blooded, botanically medieval, crusades-like, and horrifically thrilling—that's Fury Road. As for Max, it looks like he's the same archetypal Bane, only this time, he's more immune to ""I'm not afraid, I'm angry."" He's silent, and angry, and frustrated. He's Rango-like, reflective of the quest to solve the water-mystery. With everything red, orange, and yellow, it seems like you're viewing 300 blended in Saw, and over-the-top F&F.<br/><br/>George Miller revises his ideological construct in the most exhilarating, dreadful, and striking manner this time. For all I know, the audiences spoil themselves with ""cinematic orgasms,"" if that's a thing, throughout the movie. They're not afraid of the porcupine-trucks, maybe a little on the edge of madness, but that goes without saying. Here's a hint as to what it was like: Bane and Miranda beating the beep out of war-painted, anti-Christian, Hulu tribe—only this time, it's some dark, full-raged action with mountain bikes, and trucks, and springy tentacles moving idiotic half-Willy, half-Wonka The Da Vinci Code Bettany's horrendous versions. Miller puts his tribal culture in the crux of action, which reveals an unorthodox, authoritarian, and devout portrayal of enmity. The sport-arena action is complemented by prayers in Citadel, banging of drums, skeleton-wheels, and skeleton-feels. It has a bizarre feeling—you're dredged into the modernity of Prometheus and antediluvian era of the Exodus.<br/><br/>More than anything—Max's deafening seriousness, Furiosa's bald-grace, armless-attraction, sense of responsibility, and and absolute congeniality to the role (always imposingly remarkable,) religious affirmation, banging, puffing, booming, clatter, splash, tick-tick, boom—the ""fantasized-realism"" behind all the get-off-my-property-you-crazy-lunatic is what gives you the honesty-chills. The stunts, the effort, the don't-care-about-ourselves-just-love-the-movie-please pledge, and the extraordinarily enormous—480 hours of footage into 120 minutes of freaking-awesome warfare—blows me off of my seat in the cinema to the pale, scorching blaze of the sun, amidst the crazy-eyes of this action-genre Orange is the New Black. Even the over-editing has that medieval, darkly comical feel to it, just like 300 for example (can't think of another movie with such aberrant effects, but such positive response.) <br/><br/>But like any other movie, there are points where you start questioning yourself. Nothing seems to justify Max & Furiosa's relationship, mutual combats, strategies, certainty of plans, and stuff like that. But by then, the movie's not about logic or sense anymore; it's more about seeing what you wouldn't in ages. With such a brilliant ensemble—I mean it was pretty good for a solely madness-based movie—you couldn't care less about the abacus-loving dumb-toads sitting in exactly the middle seats of the theater to get the most balanced view of the screen, and judge the minus-plus of the 120 minute long clip. I feel like reporting their stupidity to the CIA—enough with the pen and paper!<br/><br/>Mad Max comes equitably with the characters, their roles, and the titular projections. Each name is qualified by its corresponding characteristic with the character in the movie—Spikers, Rictus Erectus et cetera. This complements the heartfelt glow to the movie itself—everything's done for the movie. They didn't feel any need to impose worldly sense into it, which is the best part, because that miniature world seemed pretty damn believable to me—but why? Maybe it were those religious beats, maybe the dragon-roars of engines, maybe it was just the psychological effect. Whatever it was, it did what it planned to.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road puts forth the idea that there's so much more to combats than mere combats—MMFR incorporates belligerent, spoiling-for-a-fight attitude, oppressed landscape, estranged and barbaric drug-lords, heavy-weight weaponry and wheelers, and poster-paint bombings. The intensified red-blaze of fire, the sandstorm-effect, the preposterous turn of events, the nonsensical touch of things, and the wacky script—everything wrong with the movie is everything good about the movie. Mad Max: Fury Road revises the post-apocalyptic scene—utter dryness of region and minds—and uses the irritating sense of that dryness into a rigorous will to get past it with victory—Fury Road's victory. It's not about the comparative analysis of protagonists and the white-witty-wackos, it's about what's happening throughout. And when it happens, you're only remark is: ""What a lovely day."""

","Mad Max Fury Road follows a determined man named Max Rockatansky to wander the post-apocalyptic wasteland alone, Max surely joins Furiosa, a fugitive imperator, and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord and are trying to get to a safe haven. I really can't describe how in awe I was with this film, I was extremely impressed. The stunts, the makeup, the action & the camera shots were all so dead-on and did not fail to impress. One thing that kinda upsets me is that when the film ended and everyone was walking out, I overheard things like ""that was garbage"" or ""what a piece of sh*t film"", that really angered me a little because I know that a lot was put into this film and they think they can do better? Unbelievable. Anyway, this didn't dissatisfy me at all and let's talk about why it did! Even though this is supposed to be a action film, they added some slow moments just to emphasize more character and fondness toward each person which was fantastic. George Miller did such a satisfactory job with that. The action, don't let me forget about the action, this is what made the film so much more engaging to watch and I mean that with each insane character given, it made the action more fun and insane to watch. The score was unbelievable, I'll just leave it at that because you know, it was! Tom Hardy had some pretty big shoes to fill but yet he knocked it right out of the park with given so little dialogue to say, he still manages to be a complete badass. Same goes for Charlize Theron, she played such a cool character with some great sympathy for herself and the people shes protecting and yet she does have some sweet skills and the prosthetic arm was a nice touch. Also for Nicholas Hoult, he plays such a basket case that will do anything to impress Immortan Joe and yet, he starts to become a very likable character. I swear, the makeup in this was was so spot-on that I really believed that these were actually mental people and also I thought that half of the people in this looked like albinos which added more effect to the mental aspect of them. The camera angles in this were flawless it was unbelievable even with so much going on at the same time, George really managed to get a lot of what we had to see, wait, I mean we needed to see! Hugh Keays- Byrne did such a menacing job as Immortan Joe, he played the role as such a character that doesn't let anything get in his way and always gets what he wants but yet so insane. Yes, there was a lot of disturbing images in this that can probably make you gag a little, it's truly a sight for sore eyes of what I had to see in this but hey, we're talking about a Mad Max film here. The costume design was very odd as well which looked so deserted and worn that them fit so well each character. My favorite part of the film would have to be the beginning scene, George proved he really knows how to work a camera and really made the atmosphere of the situation Max was faced with, more exciting and intoxicating! Overall, I might of exaggerated in this review but who cares, it was worth it and I mean't every word of it and this film might possibly be a modern day masterpiece! With a 2 hour runtime, this film really seems to go by fast but yet who's worried about that when you're distracted by such insanity. Please guys, go see this action packed, pulse pounding & off the wall thrill ride to Fury Road with the Mad Man himself!"
"kara_coates92","1","127","253","25 June 2015"," Repetitive, boring Mad Max barely does anything in it.
","To be honest I went into watching this film with a negative mind anyway as I had heard that it was just crazy people driving round a desert. They were not wrong. It was terrible. Tom hardy just grunts most of the time and it is called mad max but it is barely about him. He doesn't do much in it. It is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it. And then when I finally had a feeling of relief because I thought the film had ended it hadn't, they pick up some old ladies and turn back round and go down the same way they just came from to have very similar fights, in the same places, with the same people except the old ladies they pick up die. So it's just pointless but rubbish fighting all the way through with big cars, lots of fire and no good story. This is a typical boys film. I normally love action films with cars and fights but this was just repetitive and boring.it didn't excite me, make me laugh, shock me or make me want to know what was going to happen next.

","There is no way to review this movie without spoiling it.<br/><br/>So: spoiler warning has been issued.<br/><br/>The scenes are not built up in any way and the characters have no depth in them. This is not the Mad Max we've familiar with.<br/><br/>The entire film consists of two scenes: first they drive one way and then they drive back. The end.<br/><br/>Lot's of explosions and weird looking vehicles taking part in a road war on a post apocalyptic world. Absolutely boring and unrelated to the earlier Mad Max movies.<br/><br/>There is no reasoning behind the actions the characters are making. Everything they do is either purely mindless or just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious flaws in the script, Tom Hardy is excellent as Max. He is tormented, strong and intriguing. I really would have hoped for a more meaningful story for him to go with."

","Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic value: 4.5 stars Big questions value: 4 stars Family value: 2 stars (This film has a mature rating due to the violence, take this into consideration before viewing)<br/><br/>We have not seen Max Rockastansky (Tom Hardy) on movie screens in 30 years. This is a welcome return to Max and the crazy, post-apocalyptic world of George Miller (Mad Max, Babe). Max lives an existence of sheer survival. As a former police officer and family man, he is now a tortured shell of the man of justice he used to be and merely wants to survive. After being captured by the leading cult forces of this futuristic wasteland, he finds himself in the middle of a pursuit of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the wives of the masked Immortan Joe (Hugh Keyes-Byrne). Max becomes the pivotal force to assist in Furiosa's escape and redemption. Mad Max: Fury Road becomes a race for life, redemption and hope. Shot in the barren desert of Namibia, the fight for life becomes an adrenaline charged chess match that in making the wrong move will cost you your life. No summary can do the action justice, except to say to is a new visual standard that needs to be experienced. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a lesson in conveying depth with minimal dialogue. George Miller delivers a masters class in story telling and stunt driven effects that successfully convey back story, cultural nuance and the justification of these desperate acts of disobedience and violence. Even as the fourth outing for this character, we are given a fresh storyline and wealth of new characters for a new generation. It is not necessary to see the original films to enjoy this chapter in Max's adventures, but it might be worth going back to watch the first two films in this anthology. The cast is captivating and effective in their roles, but they have to take a back seat to the energetic stunt work and effects. This world seems to be a maniacal and messy existence, but becomes an enjoyable, orchestrated primal experience. Who would have thought that through the Mad Max franchise Miller would be able to convey his cinematic brilliance and deliver this visceral masterpiece. Not to dismiss the acting, Hardy is brilliant as the tortured lead character and delivering a believable portrait of his desire to survive the present while mentally enduring his past. He is given minimal dialogue, but is able to become the heart of this post-apocalyptic tale. Interestingly, Hardy is not the primary lead in the film that bears his name. Charlie Theron's shining portrayal of Furiosa is the literal and figurative driver of the film. She manages to redefine feminine heroism for film makers. She has strength, purpose and a sacrificial depth that presses the story beyond a mindless chase scene. In a genre that tends to victimise or sexualise the female leads, Miller portrays a strong female led without any unnecessary feminist underpinnings. In masking her natural beauty, Theron is allowed to develop her strengths and vulnerabilities without making a political statement. Both Hardy and Theron are supported by an excellent supporting cast that moves this experience from a mere adrenaline rush to a story of fighting for your right to live, seeing that sacrifice is part of freedom and ultimately for the hope for redemption. <br/><br/>On many levels, Miller seems to realise that action without reason loses its purpose. In adding a spiritual component to Mad Max: Fury Road he allows for a narrative depth in the script. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the cult leader in this dark, twisted world. His character delivers a dark and demented message of the need for effective leadership and that leaders need to provide people with purpose for their sacrifice, even if it is misplaced. This story shows that there is basic need for something beyond our material needs that gives society drive and direction. Also, the flower on this desert wasteland is hope. Even the jaded heart of Max is turned and assists in getting those under his charge to their promised land and in giving them hope in the bleakest of moments. This is an essential cinematic vehicle when placed against the backdrop of the depravity of mankind. Miller manages to capture this element and allows for the story to consider the realities of mankind's history and future. If the film does have a weakness, it would be in the conclusion. In all that they desire to achieve and find through this film maker's journey, the finality has an empty satisfaction. After watching a film like Mad Max : Fury Road it might be worth reading through Revelation. Fortunately, with the God of the Bible there is more we can hope for in the future.<br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where is real hope found? (Deuteronomy 31:6, Romans 5:2-5) 2. Can we find true redemption? (Psalm 111:9, 1 Corinthians 1:30) 3. Can we exist without others?

","I hated this movie. I never got into the world or the characters. Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up. I don't generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme. In the end it was plot free, character free nonsense.<br/><br/>But. I can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences. The visuals were stunning, the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling. Immerse yourself in the world and the action and I could understand this could reach 10 out of 10 proportions. I never got there and sadly hated every minute. Just a personal view."

","2 hrs of wasted time. Nothing but chasing. At least the original at the time was worth watching and at least had a story line. I'm so tired of someone trying to remake a movie just for the money. I guess they forget about the people who have seen the original and try to impress the new comers who don't know what the hell they're watching but a stupid action flick. Wake up directors. I could make a better movie than you. 98%, really? Way to push people to watch a awful movie. Hopefully there will be a better remake of this movie one day. Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes and come out with some original story lines."
"DoubleOscar","10","49","91","16 May 2015"," A Masterpiece of Madness
","Let me start by saying this. This movie is MAD. The title was not lying. This film was exactly what one wants from a summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>George Miller has come out publicly and said that this is neither really a reboot or a sequel. This is simply another story following Max Rockatansky. In this story, we see Max being captured By Immortan Joe and his band of War Boys. Once he escapes he comes upon Imperator Furiosa who is attempting to rescue the ""wives"" from the oppression of Immortan Joe. Cue action. I love how sometimes simple plots like this can set up an entire world of action. In the action genre, we don't need very convoluted and intricate plots that keep taking unexpected twists and turns. In Mad Max: Fury Road's case, the simpler, the better.<br/><br/>Now on to what everyone is wondering about. The action. And yes, the stunts and music when it's all going down is some of the best action ever put to screen. By the time the climactic chase rolls around, the action is even more jaw-dropping and breath taking than before because the stakes continue to be raised. This movie is a two hour chase that never has a dull moment.<br/><br/>As for the characters, they were all spectacular. Especially Furiosa, played beautifully by Charlize Theron. Though she is a bad-ass, she never upstages Hardy as Max. Being the emotional core of the film, playing Furiosa was one of the harder tasks to correctly perform and Theron knocked it out of the park. For Tom Hardy as Max, he was just as great as Theron. Having minimal dialog and mainly using grunts to show emotion, Hardy gave Max a surprising amount of depth, though still not nearly as much as Furiosa. This is not a bad thing however, since Max was never a truly deep character, he was an action star who kicked a lot of ass. And of course he does that in this film. The rest of the characters were played great as well especially Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) who brought even more emotional depth this.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a gleefully insane film. The relentless pace never holds back on the audience and it always has them glued to the edges of their seats. If you can, I highly recommend everyone does themselves a favor and witness this master-class action phenomenon that will arguably go down as one of the finest action films ever made."

","First I loved the original Mad Max films, OK Thunderdome was a bit iffy but it was OK. This has to be the worst film I have seen this year and I was so looking forward to it. I have seen others call it a masterpiece or work or genius. I don't know what planet they are living on.. No real story and Tom Hardy who is a great actor only spoke about 25 lines in the whole movie. The actions scenes are great and the whole film is action scenes but we know nothing about the characters. Most of the film seems to be a rehash of the chase at the end of Mad Max 2 But with Mad max 2 there was a character build up.This is one film I will not be adding to my DVD collection If I had paid to see this I would be knocking down the door for a refund!!!"

","The engines start roaring and without warning, you've fallen into this completely demented and absurd world - over the top and ridiculous - in Fury Road, Madness reigns. <br/><br/>The shock is so great that even if you're familiar with the universe, it may take you a while to swallow everything, to get all the visual clues, to try to understand what is happening and how you can believe and embrace such a ludicrous world, but once you do, and you will, Fury Road takes you in an exhilarating ride.<br/><br/>With a minimal plot and as little dialog as possible, Mad Max is a triumph on visual storytelling. Supported by the most epically constructed action scenes in years (or ever) and by unmatched imagination (or insanity), this two-hour car chase proves to be a lot more than a loud quest for gasoline. You'll be stunned by the action, but ultimately, left wondering what it all means - and suddenly Fury Road doesn't look that mad anymore.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the most surprising thing about Fury Road is that Max is still there, as silent as ever, but its Furiosa, beautifully played by Charlize Theron who owns this brutal and glorious extravaganza."

","Anyone that gives this a bad review just doesn't enjoy movies. Intense action, interesting characters, and bloody good fun. An all around great summer movie. The people that complain about there being no plot need to be more informed about the world of fire and blood that is Mad Max they're insane and need to watch the first three for a little background. I was impressed with the depth of this movie with vibrant characters and in camera visuals 80% done in camera and very little CGI. Miller adds more depth to his apocalyptic world in a way never before seen. He makes you feel the pain these people are going through. It is one of those movies that are few and far between and should be seen as the amazing goose bump riddled spectacle that it truly is. Nonstop over the top edge of your seat fun. The production is over the top and every scene is filled to the brim with eye candy. Don't listen to these people spouting crappy reviews they are the same people who wouldn't know a great movie if it sat on their face and wiggled around and they loved glitter. Make it your summer goal to go see this film in the theater you will not be left wanting anything but a sequel. Oh what a lovely day! And an even better movie."

","It was saddening to watch the movie. No matter how much I try to put it in words, I fail to describe how bad it is.<br/><br/>There is a dominant warrior heroine (Charlize Theron) and totally out of place beauties who do not belong to that world. (Ms. Theron is utterly beautiful herself but she was not depicted as such in the movie.) We have no idea about what happened to the world neither about why we have a mix of 40s-80s cars, 18th century to 19th century weapons and tech that we do not know as of yet.<br/><br/>CG was outdated, action was bad, and reasons why certain actions have been taken and their consequences were also very disappointing.<br/><br/>I would say do not even bother watching this.

","Mad Max: Fury Road Review Just had the chance to watch this movie. Mad Max isn't so much a remake but rather a continuation of the story. It starts of with Max already in the post apocalyptic world. Where as Mad Max 1 was a prelude with still having some law enforcement in the world. and the rest of the series is set after all of the chaos breaks out. Fury Road is set in the same universe.<br/><br/>The Story is fairly simple, but still enjoyable and loyal to the Mad Max Universe. Furiosa helps young women escape Immorten Joe and is headed for her childhood home. Through Actions of one of the War boys to tag along Max with him, They end up on the War Machine of Furiosa and end up trying to help become free.<br/><br/>The Acting for most part wasn't bad. I do feel that Tom Hardy wasn't the best choice as I never really felt that he was mad like (Mel) he actually reminded me and my friends of his portrayal of Bane. His accent and voice were very close to the one he did in Bane, he also had very limited number of lines and that just made it more like Bane, not to mention that he carried himself as big guy with muscles, even though the whole time his body was covered, you felt his size in the film.<br/><br/>Pacing is what i loved the most from the film. It had the perfect amount of actions separated with suspense moments to draw you back in before unloading more fast paced action. Right from the start we start of with some chases which don't just stop but actually slow down for you to be able to enjoy them a lot, and then the director uses the sense of character waiting and reaction shots to tell the story of action as to not over bore you with it. But most importantly the actions scenes are never the same and vary a lot. So that you don't have that feel, ""Oh its the same fight as before in the movie"" <br/><br/>This is a very solid movie. I give two thumbs up to the director for actually making the film very well paced. Much better then Avengers Age of Ultron and all of the Transformer films, They both can take a lot away from his style. 8.5/10"

","Water is a scarce resource so when it is dispensed and made available to the populace it is by opening a valve of some sort that allows it to cascade from a cliff face and down onto an arid dry dessert floor bed. Some people have cups, mugs and buckets to catch it in, so hey it's not a total waste. <br/><br/>We see some water in the film, but no sign of food apart from the two headed mutant lizard Mad Max stamps on and eats, there really isn't any implication of how anyone gets a meal in a dessert with no water and the occasional lizard or bug. Despite this there is a demigod like figure who is worshipped by a populace of thousands. Not really the every man for himself, dog eat dog world of the future one may have been expecting then.<br/><br/>And as for where the gasoline is coming from, well what does that matter, even though oil was the principle cause for conflict in all previous films as it was the most valuable commodity it's not even an issue here even though it's the stuff that sustains the film's entire action sequence.<br/><br/>The flashbacks imply Mad Max's past, we see them at the beginning when he's being pursued by some sort of dance troupe in make up, or the bad guys. What the dessert lack's in water is compensated by a tremendous amount of white powder and dark eyeliner.

","This Mad Max is supremely surreal/Dali, absolutely fascinating even. This one, like the first 3 films, we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects, thrusting us into the post-apocalyptic world, with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the best of the series, the unforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's tribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence I'm sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory. I'm not a hater, but massive dune buggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way. Miller, you messed up bad. What happened to Max, a ""shell of a man"" who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long forgotten and buried it. In this way this movie pisses me off, in the same way ""The Phantom Menace"" did.

Mad Max: Fury Road tries so desperately to be madly violent and grotesque, bloody and hardcore, but FAILS miserably - script is just stupid and feels like its written by five year old.

","When talking about remarkable action movies, a few titles come to mind. Movies like Die Hard, Terminator: Judgment Day, The Matrix and The Dark Knight are great examples of it. And if you're into this kind of film, congratulations. You've just won another golden ticket to the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road opens this summer as one of the best movies I have seen in the past decade. I have recently re watched the first three movies of the franchise to dive into this world once again. After I was done with it, I came to the same realization that I did a few years back. I did not like them at all. And as a consequence, I had no hope for this one. In my mind, it was going to be as mediocre as the others. Fortunately, I couldn't be more wrong. After three decades trying, George Miller has finally got it. That post-apocalyptic world he created 36 years ago is bigger, better and crazier than ever.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a word to describe Fury Road, insane it is. It is visually stunning and packed with exhilarating action scenes. The execution is so impressive that you get yourself smiling in the middle of a gory scene. You can feel the effort and passion put into making this movie through the silver screen. The actors job in constructing the characters is so effective that you dive into this world almost instantaneously. Props to Hardy and Hoult who conducted their characters with talent, each one in their own crazy way. But specially to Theron for creating such an extraordinary and strong female character. Furiosa is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Hard to be pleased by this kind of movie, I was blown away. It has been a while since I walked out from a movie theater with this amount of satisfaction. Fury Road can be disgusting and beautiful at the same time. It is unique. It has reached and stepped on the same ground as some of our beloved blockbusters from the past. But not only this, it has marked itself as a milestone in the action film history."
"rivendel-21931","1","67","132","7 September 2015"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","After finally renting ""Fury Road"" online I'm completely baffled by the positive reviews it's gotten. Three elements made the original ""Mad Max"" movies work: the supercharged car and chase scenes, the shocking stunts often done with practical (real) effects, and Mel Gibson's portrayal of a post-apocalypse anti-hero who is hard and cynical, and the ultimate survivor.<br/><br/>The first movie introduced this world, still in a society we knew but in the middle of a collapse into anarchy, and we see Max when he was a cop before he lost his family. The second movie took this world further where there was nothing left but roving gangs, and the infamous battle down the highway, with a few surprisingly deep philosophical questions. The third movie is where it jumped the shark; the car is gone, and instead the vehicles and people are like something out of a comic book. Max is guardian to a group of children and campy humor replaces cynical reality.<br/><br/>""Fury Road"" is essentially ""Beyond Thunderdome"" remade on a huge budget. The supercharged pursuit interceptor is literally in it for maybe 5-10 seconds, and shows up briefly in a chase scene later.<br/><br/>Absolutely nothing works; the action scenes appear to be deliberately sped up by probably 20% over normal film speed and the result is it feels like a hyped up and amateur martial arts movie. The spectacle is huge, but so overblown your mind doesn't think it's real. As an example of how silly it gets in the earlier movies they had nitrous, now someone literally climbs onto the hood and spits fuel into the intake. For some reason the pale albino foot soldiers have a thing for spraying their mouths with silver paint before doing something suicidal.<br/><br/>I can remember in the ""Road Warrior"" when the female love interest is pulled off of the truck and Max literally steps out of the door at speed and dispatches the bad guy with a shotgun blast through the windshield; here so many flying bodies and explosions happen it all runs together.<br/><br/>Guns were rare and often unreliable in the earlier movies, this made the idea of marauders doing battle with darts, arrows, and thrown weapons more plausible but also brought the action scenes into close up intensity. Now everyone has a firearm; there isn't a single paved road yet somehow the societies can keep high octane vehicles running.<br/><br/>The producers went into overkill on outdoing each idea with a bigger or more bizarre one. One car has tank treads, for some reason the main villain has rows of pregnant women hooked up to milking machines. One bad guy is a portly businessman in a suit with a club foot and a prosthetic nose, yet holes cut in his clothing to expose his nipples. Many of the vehicles have the style of 2-3 car bodes stacked on top of each other. One of the bad guys is a blind guitarist on a rig that is like a giant sound system, the guitar doubling as a flamethrower. Whatever.<br/><br/>Much has been made about the feminist aspect of this movie, but it's not really brought into focus, just another random idea tossed into the mix. Furiosa is passable, and seems more like Max than Tom Hardy. The entire gist of the story is the villain Immortan Joe is chasing her to get his prize harem back, which he calls his property. Furiosa has some sort of dark past behind her but it's never explained, and late in the movie she finds ""home"" which is a pack of motorcycle riding grandmother snipers. That's it, no message or depth beyond that.<br/><br/>And finally Tom Hardy as Max---we see over and over hints that he is tormented by the loss of a child and spouse, but it's also never explained. Tom is quite literally just there, with none of the brutal vindictiveness that Gibson's version was capable of.<br/><br/>Overall I don't think I've seen such a mess of a movie since ""Waterworld."""
"jwball-487-920394","3","91","184","26 June 2015"," Poor remake!
","Whilst the landscape and population are interesting, the film lacks any real story as such. Max (Tom Hardy) has the charisma and depth of a mouldy pair of underpants. Charlize Theron has one arm for some reason which is never really justified, although it does add something to her character which would have been put to better use with Max. <br/><br/>The main villain, Immortan Joe is on of the better characters, albeit a rehashed version of Bane with Don Kings hair. He seemingly has two sons, one who is very small and disabled and the other who is a giant beast of a man. Yet again this is something the film makes no attempt to explain, which is a shame as it would add to the very thin plot.<br/><br/>The vehicle design is outstanding and credit must be given to the engineers who put them together, assuming they aren't all CGI.<br/><br/>To summarise the film they spend 50% of the runtime escaping the main villain and his henchmen only to turn back in the opposite direction to finish where they started."
"Mackiatoe","9","28","50","25 May 2015"," Unconventional and Genuinely Insane
","The Action genre has always been mixed, ranging from trashy profit- searching rubbish to thrilling, adrenaline fuelling epics (see Terminator 2 and Aliens).<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road thankfully fits into the latter category, but it is fundamentally and wonderfully different. Out goes the usual CGI, explained back story and lack of enough good characters, and in comes a truly insane thrill ride, that somehow manages to make 2 hours of following a truck one of the most enjoyable things to watch in recent times.<br/><br/>Let's go over the one thing that I disliked about this film (and honestly, dislike is a fairly strong word in this case): The exposition. Or rather, lack of it. The extreme pace of the film results in details seemingly whistling by, meaning it can leave you wondering whats going on. But then again, the actual story foundations for the film are so small that really, it doesn't matter that everything isn't explained. So long as we know the names of the characters and where they're heading to next, nothing else really matters.<br/><br/>What it chooses to focus on is an excellent cast, lovely cinematography and wondrous, wondrous carnage. Practical effects take the lead role here, with amazing vehicles, well timed explosions and constant tension and thrill. The benefits of this are best seen with the big crashes and the huge fuel tanker explosion towards the end of the film; it ends up looking stunning. The Polecats really make the most of this, adding an extra layer of danger while cementing the realism that the film thrives off of.<br/><br/>I also particularly loved the sheer attention to detail; every car is different and exceptionally well designed. Sound work is equally amazing, with the soundtrack being entwined with vast array of engine noises, explosions and, in the case of the Doof Wagon (which I'm now calling one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a movie, ever), live rock music. <br/><br/>Performances from the cast are excellent. Tom Hardy's Max is very much the usual gritty, rock solid hero that Gibson portrayed all those years ago. Charlize Theron's Furiosa (isn't that just the best name you've ever heard?) really stands out for me, balancing out Hardy's character with a strong and bold performance. And for once, it's a female action hero who hasn't been raised or taught by other men - she's a real self empowered super lady. Nicholas Hoult's character is also a personal favorite, while the Brides and the Many Mothers created an ensemble of female characters that don't get wasted like they so often do in other action flicks. Everyone gives an enthusiastic performance, and it only adds to the quality of them film.<br/><br/>There's plenty more to praise here, but I'll highlight some of my personal favorite aspects from the film: The make-up and costume departments did an incredible job here, giving us a massive range of extras that really diversify the entire film. There are plenty of great names and phrases used in the film, including ""Bloodbag"", ""Immortan Joe"", ""The Organic Mechanic"" and ""The Bullet Farmer"". The film seemed to obey the laws of physics for the most part, and was especially good at ridding any infinite-ammo guns or strangely enough, unnecessary explosions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can't say anything that is inherently negative about Fury Road. It's fresh, bold and so well made that you can't help but be enthralled by its insanity. On the face of it, it's nothing more than a overly long car chase, and yet it isn't. It adds just enough complexity right where it's needed - the characters, vehicles and action. Combined with the great array of characters, sheer attention to detail and wonderful cinematography, it's actually unusually diverse, and its humane undertones only help to differ it from normal action films. And in that respect, it's one of the best films in recent history."

","George Miller's masterpiece Mad Max:Fury Road will definitely create tension and will leave on on the theater sweating and with no words as how epic this film was. Is shaping up to be as much a unique experience for longtime Max fans as it will be for those who've never before visited Miller's vision of a sun-scorched hellish post- apocalyptic world, populated largely by violent maniacs. So don't worry if you haven't seen the older movies, there is absolutely no need to. 120 minutes of vehicular carnage and craziness, this movie has all aspects it needed to be.""Fury Road"" is a beautifully realized vision of the post-apocalyptic future, filmed in Namibia but looking like it was another world. And almost no CGI was used, it felt like it was real as of how amazing cinematography was, this is why it will leave many other movies behind. Tom hardy as Max gives a wonderful performance as replacing Mel Gibson, the main character of the older mad Max movies. Also the other heroine Charlize Theron plays Furiosa really good as well. Having to cut her hair and giving her best indicates she is really into the roll of Furiosa, feminine form outside, but masculine form inside. In addition, the movie also had a good but simple plot, but it definitely didn't need a deep plot. Having not much dialog also helps other people from different countries to enjoy it, as they may not have subtitles. The music was phenomenal, only one time watching the movie is enough to enjoy and get it into your head, even some of the action is synchronized with the music. So i greatly recommend you to go and join this crazy ride, specially in 3D as Miller uses chucking arrows, bones, and parts of cars and bodies at you. 'What a lovely day' indeed.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10, and Im looking forward to see it again"
"mrmatthewhoffman","1","85","171","17 June 2015"," Reasons to Never See this Movie (from a Mad Max fan)
","Reasons to never see this movie: 1) There were so many explosions that, had I walked out of the theater and into a car bombing, I probably would not have noticed. 2) Max was a bumbling idiot that did almost nothing useful or productive in the entire movie. One or two small things, yes, but he spends the entire first 1/4 of the movie as a total spectator, which brings me to... 3) This movie could have been made without ever including Max. It had nothing to do with Max, as mentioned above he did nothing really useful, and he was almost the flattest and most emotionless character in the story. 4) It has little to do with reality or, frankly, physics. At one point there is a dust/thunder/tornado/lightning/darkness storm that has no apparent cause except to make the interminable chase seen different for a couple of minutes. 5) The villain? An overweight dude with no physical presence, dressed in clear plastic armour, and with a serious breathing issue. It's like if Darth Vader had lived to 150 and brutally interrogated a million donuts. He has no personality, and, basically, no lines worth noting. If he had been silent the entire time, it would have been better. 6) It makes no reference to the previous three movies. At all. Was this a reboot? Why even include Max then, since Max didn't have any actual impact? Oh, right. The ""franchise"". So George Miller made this movie trying to draw on his fan base for success? I don't know, but this is the truth... 7) I am a fan of the first three Mad Max movies. But my support of this franchise ends there. Like Aliens 3 and Terminator 3, there is nothing worth seeing here, unless you want two hours of explosion and nothing, nothing else."

","Lets make one thing clear there is no way to say this movie was great.<br/><br/>From the first second you are put right into a hostile environment where without any argument a man gets attacked. It stays unclear why (because it stays unclear why the half living needs its blood. that half living seems fine without it the rest of the film.) <br/><br/>Though that isn't why i grade this movie so extremely low. The thing is that there is nothing more to the film than chasing each other till some key figure dies. Every moment i was watching for something new and impressive. Butt even the guitar/drum car was not loud enough to be that. The bomb sticks are immensely overrated and multiple armies can't take out one single truck loaded with water. There I named another point of annoyance the amount of water they keep with them in a car chase. Who takes a truck full of water to a chase? They could at least have dumped some to be a bit lighter.<br/><br/>So there is now way you can call this a good movie. It was a boring slow and monotonous action movie that does not deserve a rating above 4 stars. It's a shame that even todays critics call this a good movie."
"bjornlovoll","1","106","217","29 May 2015"," Not a Mad max film.
","Pro's: This was not the worst movie I've seen. If it hadn't been called a Mad Max film I'd have given it a 3 or 4. So a -3 points for deception.<br/><br/>Con's: This is not a Mad max film. His character is entirely irrelevant. He plays no role in the development of the plot (such as it is). None of the male characters are really relevant except the arch-villain (and his role is VERY limited). The central character is Charlize's ""Furiosa"". The acting is generally very unconvincing. <br/><br/>There is no real story being told here. It is without a doubt the worst of the mad max lineup, if you even count it as being a mad max film (I don't). At no point did I reach the level needed for voluntary suspension of disbelief. This is a very silly movie, and not in a good way like Willy Wonka. There were numerous other issues too. I'll leave off them so as to avoid any spoilers for those who plan to see it.<br/><br/>Bottom line I walked away from the film feeling as if I had duped. I went to see a Mad max film and got ""Furiosa, girl power"". I recommend renting and viewing Mad Max 1 or 2 again and giving this one a pass."
"bibeaultj","10","27","48","15 May 2015"," Excellent.
","Wow. As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, this film nearly delivered on all fronts. The tone is dark, but the film never takes itself too seriously, and has an insane sense of self-awareness. Some of the concepts are so insane, outlandish, and stylish you can't help but laugh and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>The visuals are utterly unforgettable, creating some of the most memorable images that I have ever seen in a film. In addition to the beautiful desert landscape, like I previously mentioned, the film takes it's ideas and multiplies them to the nth degree. Some of the smaller scenes, that have barely any significance to the story, I remember because of the smallest visual detail that is presented in them, even if that scene in the long run, really holds no significance and is never mentioned again.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is great in the role of Max, keeping the mysteriousness and the likability of the protagonist in full force. What's fantastic about Max too is that, his past is never revealed in a exposition like scenario, rather it is told cleverly through visuals, a display that director George Miller respects the intelligence of the audience and doesn't want to spell everything out for them. Charlize Theron however, absolutely stole the show. Her acting is excellent- perfectly conveying her character and the emotions that are being dealt with. Some scenes she was in actually had me in near tears, her performance was so good. The exposition of her, unlike Max, is conveyed through dialog, but it doesn't feel forced. We don't get some long monologue from her about her past, rather it feels like a casual mention. It expertly tells us about her while keeping just the right amount of exposition left out, allowing us to connect the dots with other pieces of dialog or other visual details that reveal more about her. Simply put, she might be one of the best leading female protagonists put to the screen in a while.<br/><br/>The characters are always given time to develop, even the smallest of characters. The film has the perfect blend of action and character driven moments, allowing the audience to take a breather every now and then and just soak in the characters of this world. I forgot to mention, the action is amazing. Because the film has the perfect plot that pretty much lends itself to action, it never stops moving, and gains so much kinetic energy you wonder if it'll ever stop. And sometimes, that can be a negative. Too much action at once can leave the viewer restless, but thankfully this doesn't become much of an issue until the end. It helps that in the action scenes, you can actually see whats going on, and the film doesn't over utilize shaky cam.<br/><br/>I was really surprised by how much substance the narrative and the characters had, dealing much with themes of redemption and attempting to rid of a dark past. This is an action movie that isn't only a popcorn movie, this is likely something that you can analyze and find hidden meanings in. Because of this, people who are more into the artistic side of film (like myself) will enjoy it as well.<br/><br/>This is the best film released all year and the best summer movie since the likes of Inception. Actually, in many aspects it might be better than Inception. It very well be the best action film so far this decade, and that is no exaggeration."
"minicoop1227","9","26","46","15 May 2015"," Awesome acting, amazing action, a Mad Max film for the history books
","WOW. My initial reaction. Absolutely incredible. This was a blast from the past and a brand new experience all at the same time, and I LOVED every second of it! From beginning to end this is a visceral and vicious film that any action film fan will enjoy. In a post-apocalyptic world where oil is the desire of Immortan Joe (evil comes to life from Hugh Keays-Byrne), but water holds the real power, Max (embodied perfectly by Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (exquisitely played by Charlize Theron) must team up to escape. Nux (a surprising performance by Nicholas Hoult) is a great addition to the team.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action movies, this is right up your alley. This is the best action movie of the year, if not the decade. It could even be the best action movie of all time. It was fun, nuanced, and amazing. You think in seeing an action film, the character development won't be there, but George Miller brings you into the world perfectly and allows characters to say only the things, which are absolutely needed to tell the story. In an interview Tom Hardy was quoted saying that ""you can fit all my dialogue on one page."" Initially I scoffed at this statement, but after seeing the film I can't argue with it. It's a rare moment when it's funny because it's true. He has so few lines that his time on screen heavily depends on his actual acting ability and he doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Not only is the acting on all accounts fantastic (Charlize Theron brings it home, once again), but the way this was filmed blows my mind. Every stunt was done in real time and was not CGI. This might not sound that impressive, but once you see the film, you will go insane trying to think of all the planning, money, and skill that went into every single shot, stunt, or intense moment of the film.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I was cheering, laughing, and clapping, probably to the dismay of others in the theater, but I was so invested and involved in the story that I didn't care. Many others were doing the same. It was that much fun. But more often than that, I found myself staring in awe of some of the incredible, beautifully composed shots during this action-packed adventure. The poster above is a part of the opening shot of the film and it pulls you into the world, both literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>One last note, I think this has been the absolute best use of 3D that I've ever seen. Mad Max: Fury Road proves that 3D can still be exciting and add to a storyline as opposed to just being a flash in the pan (*cough-cough* Avatar) Never forget the importance of water in this world, or (Mad) Max Rockatansky will find you and make you regret your incompetence.<br/><br/>If you like action films, GO SEE MAD MAX: FURY ROAD NOW!"
"insipid-brilliance","1","89","180","30 August 2015"," Thank God I'm not alone
","There's little point in rehashing what others have said about this ""film."" To do so would require more effort than the producers expended. It's mindless, careless, utterly disposable drivel. Give me five minutes with any scene, if they can properly be called scenes, and I'll give you vastly superior results. Not because I'm an expert film maker, but simply because I care. I care about great titles from my younger years. I care about the craft of movie making -- good acting and inspired casting, with quotable dialog that involves the audience and makes them feel for the protagonists and despise the villains. I care about smart story with detail that paints a vibrant picture of another world, one that helps us understand our own. I care about dramatic tension and pacing, plot twists and strategies, and fresh ideas that show me something I haven't seen before.<br/><br/>None of those elements can be found in Fury Road. It's simply a long action reel with superficial Max Max theming. Video games have better plot. George Miller clearly doesn't care anymore, or has simply lost what talent he had.<br/><br/>The only interesting thing here for me is the wild and unprecedented disparity between ratings. One star or ten? Are you kidding me? Sample the writing from praisers and notice the slick marketing language and textbook film school speak. Are these people who can't discern packaging from product, a la unboxing videos? Was a substantial portion of the budget spent on an army of film industry shills? I don't know. But perhaps IMDb's review and rating system has been compromised. Trust me, those of you who think you honestly liked this movie -- it will be forgotten in a year, and you won't be coming back to it in five, fifteen, or thirty years. There's nothing to come back to. Even Thunderdome is a masterpiece compared to this abomination. I'm just glad I didn't actually have to pay to be insulted."
"thekarmicnomad","9","25","44","16 May 2015"," A fantastic Car chase through the poisoned desert
","This starts of very quickly with little ceremony and gets straight into the action; and this is an Action film with a capital 'A'. The expected Mad Max components are there; raiders, apocalyptic locations, cross bows etc; but the film is essentially one massive car chase.<br/><br/>But I wouldn't let that put you off. The action is constant and relentless. The clever use of minimal CGI means everything looks fantastic.<br/><br/>It stays true to the Mad Max theme with an element of cheesiness which is vital for this kind of movie to stay brutal but stop it getting too dark.<br/><br/>There are strange contraptions, men on poles, mutated cliché characters preserved from the old world. The vehicles are wacky, interesting and varied. I personally loved what can only be described as the worlds most improbable morale boosting device? <br/><br/>The only two gripes I have is the cgi for the flash backs is very poor along with the obligatory 3d scenes of steering wheels hurtling out the screen (they are even more annoying when you choose to watch in 2d). And the story is a little insulated. You are either in the big rig or chasing the big rig - I would have liked to see a dash more of the ruined world.<br/><br/>But there is an awful lot to love about this. Some may find it a little simplistic, some a little too camp. But I think it would have been difficult to win all hearts and minds with this one."
"thnhhk64","9","25","44","16 May 2015"," THIS is how you make an action movie
","I will be quite simple with that, this is a rather simple movie after all. I'm not a fan of all of the superhero genre, people ask me why- and no it's not that I don't like it because it's a comic book at all, but it's just that the films tend to be just CGI filled, and lack any interesting atmosphere. I won't even talk about characters here.<br/><br/>So, unlike those films, Mad Max: Fury Road does it all right, instead of CGI-filled action sequences we have ACTUAL stunts, this obviously, whether if consciously or unconsciously make the action look far better, also, unlike all those other modern action movies, we actually KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, it's not just focusing on character each time and basically confusing us and not showing the entire battlefield so it may have the feel it is an actual fight- sequence, no, this film actually makes us know constantly what's on our back, sides and front.<br/><br/>Of course I need to also address the unique post-apocalyptic atmosphere in this film, the music also fits rather perfectly. The ways those apocalyptic people fight with strange gadgets on top of their vehicles is also very entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>So, I would definitely recommend this film, it is no Citizen Kane, I mean it isn't something deep- nor it should be, in fact I would say this is what a summer blockbuster should be- it may be not very philosophical or heart warming, but it is very entertaining and a lot of fun- and even memorable! Something we barely hear about in today's action films.<br/><br/>So go watch it, recommended! 9/10."
"irastija","9","25","44","15 May 2015"," Breathtaking movie with memorable action
","Who hasn't watched any of the Mad Max movies, he can be ashamed of himself, because those are one of the most lovable action pieces of all time. I've been waiting for this movie for a long time, and what motivated me even more for this movie is the lack of good quality action movies in these modern times.<br/><br/>Movie starts in medias res. There we have Max, who is in the middle of a conflict between a gang and Furiosa, and there we have our plot for 2.5 thirds of this masterpiece. George Miller describes this post-apocalyptic world just as I have imagined it, everything is dry, there is lack of water, and carelessness of people for its nature got people to a conflict between themselves.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy gives an alpha-male, bad-ass looking performance that reminded me of one in Lawless, where he didn't need a lot of words to speak but he was charismatic. Props to Hardy, but Furiousa steals the show for me. On many moments it seemed to me, but it actually is, that she was the main character of the movie. She is that character that we can relate to. She is that character that we feel for, and that is where Charlize Theron did a great job in.<br/><br/>Picture of this whole movie is amazing. It is all executed very well, and to think that there is very little amount of green screen gives an enormous plus to the movie. Action doesn't stop, it is all paced, and just when you think that action stopped, it is just so audience can take a moment of rest just so it can take a adrenaline rush few seconds later.<br/><br/>I have absolutely nothing else to add, I have enjoyed this film very much, and I hope that many directors will look up on George Millers style of shooting a movie, which is not just a fun way to take, but also very interesting and attractive. This movie excels in every way possible, it has interesting plot, lovable characters, and memorable action. It is a must-see modern masterpiece."

There could have been so much more story telling and character development but the film forces you to do the work of filling in those blanks with your own imagination.<br/><br/>Nothing groundbreaking to see here. Mad Max is the kind of movie you watch ""because it was on"". The good parts are quite good but it still struggles with a b-grade script."

And let me be clear, without exaggeration, that Mad Max: Fury Road has the hands-down dumbest scenes I've ever seen in a movie, the ones where we see the large ""music"" truck with the drummers and the idiotic electric guitar player who inexplicably joins the soundtrack with solos and flames.<br/><br/>Hands-down, dumbest. Ever. Worse than Jar-Jar.<br/><br/>We really only get a half-movie, because the first half is stuff driving one way, then they turn around and do everything again in the opposite direction, leading to an ending so triumphant that all it lacked was a golden unicorn shooting rainbows out of its flaming ass. It is surely not a great feminist statement worthy of men's rights haterade.<br/><br/>The climactic line: ""I'm Max."" And then Tom Hardy nods approval, as if to reassure himself that he is an actor and really can memorize such inane dialogue.<br/><br/>I don't care if the action scenes looked cool.

"kieranbattams","9","24","42","16 May 2015"," The future belongs to the Mad.. What a lovely day!
","Mad Max: Fury Road, the newest from George Miller was a film i never had much interest in. I haven't really seen the others in the franchise (i say haven't really because i have seen about half of the original) but to be honest it isn't really nesscessary. Im not sure if this is a prequel or sequel but whatever it is doesn't really matter as this is quite possibly the action film of the year and has some of the best action sequences of the decade in fact.<br/><br/>If i were to explain plot here it would seem very thin because in terms of plot there isn't a huge deal of it, although this isn't really a bad thing. It follows Max as played by Tom Hardy who does do a great job following the footsteps of Mel Gibson, as well as rebel Furiosa played by Charlize Theron at the top of her game. The two go on a journey to i guess restore order to the post-apocalyptic world we are introduced to from the start of the film. Everybody in this film does a really good job, Tom Hardy's Australian accent wasn't the best i have heard but he doesn't say a great deal, most of the dialogue does come from Theron's Furiosa and she really adds a moral contrast to his performance and they play well of each other, in fact this as much her film as it is Hardy's which i was worried about being called ""Mad Max"" and all, but it doesn't bring the film down by a single notch.<br/><br/>Now earlier on i mentioned that the film's plot isn't a very strong one. The reason this isn't a problem? Because the film is pretty much one huge action set piece. From the beginning to the very end the action does not stop. It is very much a road movie, but not a stereotypical road trip movie, it is a road movie where cars explode at every given moment and blood is splattered around with no remorse. I found out 80% of the films effects are practical and this does not surprise me at all because i had an extremely hard job pinpointing what is CGI and what isn't (with the exception of the prosthetic arm used by Theron's character). The real stand out for me was Nicolas Hult as Nux who is a character that you never know whether he is a villain or not. At first he seems insane, like our villain Immortal Joe (not the Toecutter), but you do get to know him and you do in fact feel for his character and even have sympathy for him and want him to succeed at points.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, all the non stop action sequences that are thrown at us might seem too much, but they really aren't. Tom Hardy is as badass if not more than Mel Gibson (like i said though, i haven't seem all the Mad Max films) and Charlize Theron with the rest of the supporting cast do this film justice. You hear a lot about long overdue sequels spoiling what was once a great franchise but Fury Road just improves it. I hope that Jurrassic World and even Terminator Genysis can take a leaf out of this film's book. Mad Max:Fury Road deserves all the praise it is getting and is definitely one to get on blu-ray. See this film and you will have a Lovely Day as Nux would say. Plus, the flamethrower guitar dude was awesome, look out for him."

Star Trek, Star Wars, every cruddy horror movie ever to have graced a rented VHS tape. Take it all, you greedy bastards. Melt my cherished memories down for pocket change, see if I care. <br/><br/>After the heartbreaking artistic faceplant that was Ridley Scott's misbegotten Prometheus, I'd pretty much given up on these sorts of refried treats. O, me of little faith! If anyone can tool up a bloody-knuckle, road-raging death machine out of junked parts, it's George 'Mad Max' Miller. Fresh from the theater, I feel like an overstressed carburetor into which some baldhead lunatic just spat a mouthful of pure nitro. The pitiless desert sun is blazing nova bright above, and it's a lovely, lovely day indeed. <br/><br/>I caught Fury Road in 3-D, which was cool...mostly because I now get to go back and see it without the unnecessary dimensional enhancement. And again gaze vacantly into that stupendous vortex of crazy-ass, nonstop, man-machine mayhem like the sweaty, crack-brained adolescent I once was (and of course always will be). I don't know that I've EVER in my screen-staring LIFE seen a vehicular action flick half so relentlessly thrilling. And certainly not this side of The Road Warrior. The bug-splattered, silver-glossed, ear-to-ear grin Miller & Co. smacked across my idiot mug in the film's opening moments is still fixed in place several hours later. Turns out mom was right: my face is stuck this way.<br/><br/>One minor quibble: Fury Road would be improved significantly were some sensible soul simply to take a small red pen to each scripted instance of the words ""hope"" and ""redemption"". For a filmmaker whose visual storytelling has received such widespread praise, Miller sure lays on the thematic underlining with a hefty trowel. Some may accept Max and Furiosa's portentous small talk as appropriate to the tale's mythic ambitions. Me, I just found it kind of annoying, with the clunky sentimentalism tipping stoic gravitas into po-faced camp.<br/><br/>But why fret over details? I mean, somebody who worked on this once- in-a-lifetime nightmare monsterpiece gets a screen credit for ""Wheels and Skulls"". How many other movies can you say that about?"

These two factors combined makes the movie drag. I walked out after 90 minutes, which felt like 2.5 hours. It was basically one big action sequence. If you are not bothered about story lines and love pure action then you would probably like it, if not then I would steer clear. If you have to see it for yourself I would probably rent or download it, and save yourself the price of a cinema ticket.

","George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, forget Avengers, forget Furious 7, this is THE movie to see this summer, and perhaps this decade. It is a nitrous injected, chrome plated masterpiece of savage beauty and reckless juggernaut aerobatics that has to be seen to be believed. Miller has taken the core elements of what made his Road Warrior so special and beloved, and kicked them into high gear for a revisionist take on the ages old post apocalyptic punk warrior desert chase film. Tom Hardy is hysterical as Max, a brooding, bruised hearted grump who just wants to be left alone, until he's dragged, literally into a deranged odyssey through the badlands. Charlize Theron is all rock solid tough as Imperator Furiosa, who hijacks the five breeding wives of tyrannical, terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes Byrne, Toecutter from the first Max film) and flees into the desert to find a greener place away from the madness. Miller strips away any unnecessary dialogue or clichéd 'getting to know you scenes' and streamlines the film into one sleek, forward surging force of nature, with not a moment wasted, and not a line of dialogue or glare of the eyes that isn't somehow in service of the constant 'go, go, go' mantra of the story. Such pacing is the genius of what makes it such a thrill. Also amazing is the imagination and world building. Miller uses an anthropologists eye to look at what the human mind, and civilization would evolve to in a situation like this, resulting in every character having a realistic, thought through vernacular, and some truly phenomenal, lived in style set pieces that are truly eye popping. Such attention and care is rare in this genre. Miller and team have outdone themselves with this absolutely exhilarating film, technically proficient in every way and filled to the brim with the kind of love for films and telling stories that its predecessors revels in back then."

","I think Mad Max Fury Road is a masterpiece ! Any director even thinking of directing an action film should be made to watch it. George Miller is a genius. What an amazing film, visually stunning and a pared down script that is superb, is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time !"

","I've seen a lot of action movies probably seen them all, but nothing quite like this one. Fast-paced, entertaining. Beautiful fit between the desert ambiance, the action scenes and the visual effects. It has got the non stop action and movement of Crank, the speed car chasing of Fast & Furious, Michael Bay type of explosions and dynamic scenes but shot in a Christofer Nolan way. What a perfect opener. It will blow you away from the start to the finish. A guarantied two hours never stopping entertainment. Roaring engines, speed, shootings, fire, rust, dust really a must see. Anything else would be waste of words. Just go and see it!"
"jonesmorrell","10","38","72","15 May 2015"," Maybe the best action movie in the last 20 years!
","Finally hope that high quality action movies are back! This movie takes you on a non-stop action packed ride from start to finish. The stunt work is phenomenal and the cinematography is breathtakingly stunning. Its so relieving to see an action movie that doesn't rely on CGI to tell the story, because this movie barely has ANY and it was hard to notice any at all besides this one scene. Tom Hardy is on the fast track to becoming the big budget acting star Hollywood has longed looked for because HE CAN ACTUALLY ACT! Speaking of which Charlize Theron delivers an amazing performance that should get her several award nods. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen! I highly recommend paying the extra money to see it in 3D as well. The only bad thing I can say is it was a disappointment went it was over! Cant wait to see the next installments in this franchise!"
"quincytheodore","9","28","51","14 May 2015"," Witness the majestic world of golden sand and rusted steel
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop concerto of clanking iron, broken bones and splattering blood while fire squirts from all cylinders. It's absolutely glorious. As far as sci-fi world goes, director George Miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present. The two leading actors Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are utterly convincing, so much so audience would believe they are actual occupants of the unapologetic post-apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>Max (Tom Hardy) is a survivor in a barren wasteland. He's about to cross path with totalitarian clan War Boys led by a dictator. As luck would have it he meets with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as situation escalates rapidly and they must fight for their survival. Tom Hardy looks physically menacing and exhausted by the burden he carries on the desolate landscape. He is more of an anti-hero who prioritizes his safety in the expense of his morality.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is utterly splendid. With short hair and one arm, she still manages to look beautiful and presentably strong. She seems cold yet also rigidly determines to her cause, this is a real rendition of a powerful female character, not a model shoehorned into the wilderness. Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of the War Boys is a chameleon. His character might have the most development as a lowly peon who gradually discovers the true nature of his clan.<br/><br/>Production value is exceptionally well done. From vehicles, make-up and even prosthetic limbs, all of them look as though they have wear and tear from the dusty world. Strange contraptions and weapons are aplenty, explosive spears are thrown with reckless abandon as large tank mounted with electric guitar rumbles in the background. It's brazenly unworldly and over-the-top spectacle. There is no such thing as too much here.<br/><br/>Visual is all shades of tangerine. The vistas look dry and dirty yet still can be lively or solemn as the filter regularly changes. The soundtracks blast rock, metal and techno vibe with each scene. It truly doesn't let up, riding the momentum from start to finish, though it's not just mindless explosion. Its characters are identifiable, audience would be fascinated and cheer for them between each explosions.<br/><br/>Never a murky world ridden with death and destruction seems so irresistibly invitingly. As the characters ride through the carnage, the film is an achievement in action and destruction."
"Imaculata","9","27","49","16 May 2015"," Beyond Thunderdome on acid, with a huge budget
","I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.<br/><br/>I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.<br/><br/>Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!"
"jhigginbotham151","10","36","68","15 May 2015"," Perfect in every way.
","I don't normally say that about a movie. Even my favorite films have flaws that I recognize and humbly admit to, even still that doesn't mean I love them any less. Mad Max: Fury Road is that rare example of a film that understands what it is so well that it forgoes flaws ...this is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Now I understand that's a bold statement, and I also know it's only my opinion, but it's something I thought long and hard about after walking out of the theater, still recovering from the 2 hour thrill ride I had just been on. There was not a single moment during Fury Road that I <br/><br/>a) checked my watch b) thought something was out of place c) got bored with the action<br/><br/>The characters, the music, the action, the direction - it's all top level stuff. No fluffy words in this review, I am simply stunned at Millers execution of this very simple plot. I love how Miller allows the expressions of the characters to speak for themselves, I love how he doesn't dwell on supposed important character moments because he understands exactly what to show and when to get back to the action. The music may the key ingredients in the mix as Junkie XL delivers a soundtrack full of thundering drums, epic violins and shredding electric guitar, a soundtrack that had my heart racing a million miles an hour and gazing at the screen in disbelief as cars and bodies flew through a sandstorm in slow motion.<br/><br/>The fact that CGI was kept to a minimum makes the film feel even more satisfying, like we payed to see high octane action where cars crash into one another and people perform death defying stunts ...and we get what we pay for as close to 90% of what you're seeing is real.<br/><br/>I could gush over this film for hours but I'd like to say that if nothing else, Mad Max: Fury Road gave me the feeling of being a kid again and seeing a blockbuster for the first time. In an age of bloated, CGI-filled summer movies, it's nice to see a simple, streamlined, real film in the mix. Welcome back Max, don't keep us waiting to long for the next one."
"Theo Robertson","6","60","120","6 June 2015"," Nothing More Than A Noisy Blockbuster
","I love post apocalyptic fiction . John Wyndham and John Christopher are amongst my favourite authors . They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250 <br/><br/>If nothing else the film gets off with a bang with the eponymous Max filling us in via voice over that the world has destroyed itself and man has to fight to stay alive against his fellow man and just to prove this is more difficult than it sounds we're treated to a high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action and editing . Have I mentioned the opening title credits haven't appeared yet ? This sets up the rest of the film that continues in mainly the same way <br/><br/>In short if you liked MAD MAX 2 you're going to love this one because this is MAD MAX 2 on a fatal cocaine overdose which is a great thing or a disappointing thing depending on how you look on it . Sadly I'm in the second camp because I wanted more meat on the story and there's not much narrative here . Max gets used as a gimp on the front of a vehicle , manages to escape during an epic stunt sequence , teams up with some fair nymphet maidens and protects them from the baddies and that's it as far as plot goes . The first half of the film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full of stunts , car crashes , pyrotechnics . I's brash , noisy and spectacular , so much so that I actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise and bluster . Eventually the film does settle down a bit and has characters talking in normal tones without the explosions in the background but the dialogue is just basic as are the performances , Certainly MAD MAX FURY ROAD will be up for a few Oscar noms next year but only for the technical aspects and I'm slightly surprised my IMDb peers rate it so highly"
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","25","45","16 May 2015"," An Action Film That Puts All Others to Shame
","After watching Fury Road I can safely conclude that not only will the film be welcomed by a majority of people craving a good action- packed popcorn flick, this new movie will effectively change the action-adventure game for the better.<br/><br/>The story begins with Max (Hardy) being chased by a group of crazed goons across the desert in his signature Interceptor car. The vehicle crashes spectacularly and he's immediately captured. We're introduced to a host of characters warped by the landscape and made crazy by their circumstance. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) sits atop of the social spectra. A violent, disfigured dictator who has hijacked not only the world's most needed resource, water, but the world's most precious: the future. He has taken the most beautiful brides among his dirt-pile civilization and forces them into a harem where he rapes them to birth a normal, untarnished heir. That is until Furiosa (Theron) a trusted marauder takes the harem and escapes in her war rig with a mission to take them to ""the green place"". With war parties in fast pursuit, Max is forced to be a feral warrior's ""blood bag"" until fate allows him the chance for escape and possible redemption from the thoughts that haunt him.<br/><br/>After a fifteen minute setup the entire movie boils down to one, big, long, explosive, exciting, pulse-pounding chase through the desert. Each action set-piece is a master's course in chaotic beauty and mayhem. Lest you think you've seen it all, watch the first extended chase between the war rig and the war parties...then wait another five minutes, because the expectations you just set for yourself will be blown to smithereens. George Miller decided to film in the otherworldly desert of Namibia instead of the Australian outback. The hues of the rock and sands of Namibia make for some austere beauty and intensifies the desperation of the world of Mad Max. No longer are their paved roads, only basins of flat unforgiving dirt remain. Trekked by those most craven and those most crazed.<br/><br/>Through all the absurd chaos, characters emerge. Not through dialogue or long-winded explanations but through action. Everyone we meet is stripped to their essence and pitted against each other. The number one goal for our beleaguered protagonists? Survival; it's that simple. Max in particular has quite a complex character arc given the movie's structure. He is reintroduced in our psyche as a man who once had a moral compass now reduced to an animal; wild and instinctual. He lost those he loved most and is haunted by their memories. By the end of the movie his purpose is molded beyond simply survival. His resourcefulness and pragmatism follows a logical train that ends with Max becoming a restorer of hope. A rebirth of the dark anti-hero we once loved and all with little to no dialogue.<br/><br/>Now a game-changing movie like this is not without its controversy. Men's Rights Activists have been crying foul ever since this movie's been released, claiming the movie is feminist propaganda masquerading as a shoot-em-up. Noted chauvinist blogger and blatherskite Aaron Clarey even initiated a boycott over it's perceived ""feminist agenda"". ""men in America and around the world are going to be duped by explosions, fire tornadoes, and desert raiders into seeing what is guaranteed to be nothing more than feminist propaganda, while at the same time being insulted AND tricked into viewing a piece of American culture ruined and rewritten right in front of their very eyes.""<br/><br/>With as much respect as I can give people with rudimentary understanding of discrimination; knock it off. Having physically and emotionally strong female characters is not propaganda. Nor is making an enemy out of a thoroughly disgusting human who in no way represents the male gender or the patriarchy as it exists today. If anything the warped society that exists in Fury Road is an exaggerated view of patriarchy therefore categorizing the political elements of Mad Max as satire. Even to claim the film has a feminist agenda of any kind is suspect. Not all feminists believe the same thing but a majority believe portraying women in media in the mold of a traditional male sans male genitalia, is not the best way to empower women. Not to discount Theron's performance but her Furiosa does fit that bill.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is less about the movie and more about Hollywood's insistence that 3D is the way to go. Dazzling sequences of real stunt driving and explosions that would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame are interrupted by obvious frames where 3D is injected for the sake of being injected. In one, almost delirious moment of climax, we see obvious computer generated twisted metal synchronized to look like a jack-in-the-box. It was distracting flaw but not a fatal flaw.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is not just a spectacular action film; its an action film that truly raises the bar. Those who have never seen the original films won't be lost nor will they be disappointed. Through frenetic editing, solid, smooth camera work, strong acting, brawny, metal-meets-muscle action sequences and minimalist story, every action movie the foreseeable future is going to wish it was Mad Max.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"spoonfulofhope","9","25","45","15 May 2015"," Visual Playground, Amazing cast!
","Do not go into this movie with the thought that this is going to be a direct follow on from the last Mad Max movie. It's not. It's nothing like it, but it's been 30 years since the last Mad Max was released - so what do you expect? In saying that - I thought this movie was fantastic! <br/><br/>The new and improved Mad Max uses everything that modern day technology allows. It is a visual masterpiece! To the people saying it lacked storyline and was just constant action... Have you seen a Mad Max film before? They're all a bit like that. Even though I said that the new Mad Max is nothing like the old, it helps to have a bit of a knowledge on the old Mad Max storyline, because truthfully; the storyline doesn't give you much of an introduction, it just expects you to know why & what's going on in the world from the storyline of the last ones.<br/><br/>The action, the stunts, the cars, the rigs, the weapons, the sets - they're all amazing. If nothing else - see this movie for the pure visual playground. I personally hated the first Mad Max movies. Mostly because (through no fault of their own) the time it was filmed (watching 80s movies now is cringeworthy), the lack of funding for good props and effects, and (probably because it was the start of his career) Mel Gibson's terrible acting ability. So I really didn't expect to like this movie all too much, but because of the advertisements I thought I'd give it a go because it looked visually interesting and it had a 100000% better cast. Tom Hardy is a great Max! The war boys are fantastic too. Furiousa is amazing and the wives are all quite wonderful actresses. So that alone improved this movie.<br/><br/>For those concerned that this is a ""feminist"" movie like some other reviews have stated.. That is such bullsh*t. There are strong male and female characters. And in a world ruled by men where women are nothing but baby makers - of course they've got to stand up for themselves. Someone's got to. Just because it wasn't a man swooping in to save them from the castle doesn't mean it's a ""feminist"" movie. And in saying that - Max and the war boy help save the women too. So I really can't understand where all this ""feminist"" finger pointing is coming from. <br/><br/>Overall - go see it! If you haven't seen the old Mad Max's - just do a little bit of a read up as to the storyline of the apocalyptic setting and war for fuel. It will help you grasp the storyline. If you have seen the old Mad Max's - don't expect this to be like the old ones. They had a ton more funding and tried to make this as epic as possible (and succeeded) - something I'm sure they would have loved to do with the first Mad Max's but didn't have access to the funds or technology. This movie is a fun, visual masterpiece, leaves you on the edge of your seat once or twice and overall is a great film!"
"etane","Null","22","39","16 May 2015"," Technically speaking, best movie ever.
","Before I even talk about the plot, or the actors, I Would just like to say that this films visual effects/cinematography were incredible. No, not mind boggling cgi, just flat out great camera work and practical effects. The costume and make up designers need to sweep the awards this year for their work. I walked out of the film and only hours later did I realize how good they were. Reason being, because nothing was wrong with it. The camera work and effects were so smooth I couldn't appreciate how good they were because they actually complemented the plot instead of distracting the viewer from it. That being said, oh my goodness best looking movie of all time imo. 11/10 From the looks of it, only the new Star Wars film even comes close but we will see when the actual movie roles. Okay, that was just my review on the visuals of the film, lets talk aboot that plot eh? <br/><br/>PLOT 8/10- It is what is, an action/post apocalyptic film can only have so good of a plot story before it gets too cluttered, this film does the best with what it has, a cool setting, cool characters, and really cool cars. The third part of the movie where they find Charlize's old biker clan is the weakest part of the plot, yet at the same time, it was necessary. That's the main strength of this plot, everything was necessary, no extra back story/flashbacks were handed to us, no unnecessary expostion, we were left to interpret based off of brief dialogue and voices in Max's head as to what has lead to these characters acting the way they did. This, should be the way every action movie models its plot after, nothing too deep, yet just enough to make us understand and care. Similar to the plot of taken in that we don't need information on how the villains came to be, or how our hero came to be so heroic, we are left to think, a wonderful tool in these types of films. <br/><br/>ACTING 9/10- Acting wise I was surprised. With the exception of the ""breeders"", everyone was fit really well in their parts. Never have been a huge Hardy fan, but surprisingly roles where he talks less makes his performances better. Although he only has around 20 lines in the movie, the ones he mumbles out either made me laugh or made me realize he was disturbed. Charlize played a strong female lead who was kickass and is not over the top at the same time. With the exception of the part where she reunites with her old clan, all of her lines were necessary. The villains were awesome for the most part, my only complaint would be that we only really got to spend time with two of them, the third one, the fat one, was more of a side piece. None the less, great acting across the board.<br/><br/>PACING 9/10- Start your engines, make sure you have enough gas to last for two hours because this one does not let up. From the opening scene of the movie till the canyon scene towards the end you will be thrown into an atmospheric fast paced film that is both exhilarating, and memorable. Although not every great action film is paced like this, it just works in this one, with every thing being so over the top, from the insane guitar creep, to the unbreakable bones of our hero, I don't know, it just freaking works. <br/><br/>Visuals- 10/10<br/><br/>GO SEE IT."
"deloudelouvain","7","13","21","13 October 2015"," Mad Max is back
","What to say about a movie like this one? It's easy. If you expect a difficult dramatic story then you are not going to like it. But if you expect an action movie about a whole lot of modified vehicles trying to take over a big modified truck in the middle of nowhere, with creepy looking humans, then you are going to love it. And that's what I was going to expect. I like movies like this one where you just relax and let the action come to you. Not all the time but sometimes I do enjoy a movie like Mad Max. The amateurs of steam punk will also like this one because almost everybody in this movie is strangely looking. The filming itself was good, the script is like I said what it is. It should not have been difficult to write that script. The actors all did their job like they should. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are the main characters and they are good actors. Nice action movie if you are into stuff like that, otherwise just pass on this movie and watch something else."

There is ZERO reason for her to make that statement, and yet she made it. <br/><br/>The feminist metaphor is so cartoonish that the women might as well have walked around with signs around their neck reading ""feminist metaphor.""<br/><br/>Oh, and gasoline/diesel is extremely hard to come by in your world? Hey, no problem, fuel a giant freaking truck for no other purpose than to act as a mobile stage for an electric guitarist and a bunch of drummers...you know, because in a world where resources are rare, you've got all the fuel in the world to do such a thing. <br/><br/>This movie is great so long as you don't think. It moves very fast, with lots of explosions and inexplicable visuals, so you could conceivably watch the whole thing without ever stopping to think about how most of it makes no goddamn sense. This is, indeed, what must have happened. I can think of no other reason how people could watch this and call it ""smart."" <br/><br/>Things move so fast that you never get to know any of the characters in any meaningful way. Max is the stereotypical ""psychologically scarred loner."" Gibson was able to give that character depth in past movies, partly due to his acting but also partly due to the fact that the movies stopped to breathe long enough at times to get to know him. <br/><br/>The writing is terrible. Throwing in some feminism doesn't change that. I am completely dumbfounded at the enthusiastic response to this mindless stream of dreck."

The visuals in this are also so beautiful, almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real. Like the old ones there isn't much dialogue, just pure action. The acting is great. Tom Hardy plays a great max, of course Mel Gibson well always be the best max but Tom does a great of carrying that character. The one character who Steals every scene is Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa. Every scene she's in, she's just kills it. The action is unbelievable. George miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint. Even we there's 50 cars on the screen, you can see perfectly what's happen. This movie is worth paying the ticket for IMAX 3D. This makes George miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece.

In fact, I think the word garbage would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Even though most of the action is done practically it doesn't mean anything because you don't care about the characters. One of the strong points of the old Mad Max movies is how they slowed down to give you a chance to take in the world you was in and get to know the characters.

","I can't believe this movie is got high ratings on virtually every movie rating body. It's just plain boring right from the start, with meaningless explosions to get the crowd think they are enjoying a movie. I couldn't care if the whole characters died in the movie, nothing was just believable. They tried so hard to make you feel for the characters with stupid sound tracks to try to trick us a scene is touching. I bet the only audience that would enjoy this are black/death metal fans (not to say metal fans are unintelligent) but they may be the only ones to find it interesting.<br/><br/>It's a total waste of 2hrs.

"r_massey","1","71","149","28 May 2015"," Hollywood does it again
","Being new to the world of ""Mad Max"", I went in to the theatre with an open mind, only knowing to expect cars and explosions, which I briefly saw from snippets of trailers.<br/><br/>In the end, that's all I got, just explosions, cars, violence and no story whatsoever. Due to the fact that action sequences drag on for such an inexplicable amount of time, there's no room to breathe and incorporate morsels of a plot together. The 'plot' (if that's what you want to call it) and introduction to this world is so vague that it seems that the filmmakers just wanted to skim over the ""unimportant"" aspects of a film like a good plot and interesting characters and just get straight to the ""high octane"" action which QUICKLY loses its novelty and thrill. Good choice there, mates. This film is so bad that you can't even spoil it.<br/><br/>There's not much that I can praise about the film other than the nice (and insane) visuals; the use of vibrant blue and orange tones and the barren landscapes. It's difficult to even pick out anything good about the cast; Tom Hardy, who plays the titular character, has such a small role and just mumbles his way throughout the film, so unsure of himself. Speaking of mumbling, ""Mad Max"" is meant to be set in Australia yet there's an overwhelming earful of British and American accents, that are all painfully and conspicuously 'dubbed' in the ADR process of the movie (and even then, some of the dialogue is just unintelligible). Again, the focal point of the film seems to be the action sequences which go on for almost an hour straight, if I can remember correctly (though I don't want to remember anything about ""Mad Max"" at all).<br/><br/>Smaller aspects of the film are difficult to just gloss over and ignore, such as the fact that characters endure tough and dangerous road trips for days without food or water and still have the strength to fight, speak, stand, leap from car to car etc. This film is praised for its likely representation of a post-apocalyptic world yet there are just no tinges of realism to be found here.<br/><br/>It saddens me that audiences are responding to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" so positively and enthusiastically, with a current 8.7 rating on IMDb and 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes (as of late May 2015). Are films so bad nowadays that the average moviegoer is just rendered completely susceptible and hypersensitive to mindless 'high-octane' action and plots that are barely held together by underdeveloped characters? For anyone serious about good-quality films, avoid ""Mad Max"" as best as you can, even if it means you have to drive far out into the Australian outback to isolate yourself from another one of Hollywood's 'finest'."

","I felt like loosing 2 hours from my life and I felt at last the movie ended. Continuous story less madness without any motive and irritating to the fullest. Furiosa is handicapped and drives a big modified truck or war vehicle. Illogical foolish movie making. Don't watch it unless you want to loose your money. And Mad max is a funny goat who shows style in all kind of fools around. Only thing to see are the cars ... The movie starts with Mad max running and remembering his kids or wife who are lucky that they died and did not have to bear this pain that we as a crowd had to bear while watching the same.

","George Miller's original MAD MAX films might have broken too much ground since every other barren landscape within a post-Apocalyptic action vehicle is compared to the source – and here's a reboot by the man himself, perhaps bringing something fresh to the dilapidated table...<br/><br/>Well the action scenes are done all right, and the direction is quick and tense. But the characters including MAX himself, cursed with sudden flashbacks to partially explain his brute-like mannerisms and Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa, equally bad ass and a far better driver are about as important as avatars controlled on a noisy video game.<br/><br/>The score seems intentionally melodramatic, encapsulating a grandiose old school epic vibe, trying way too hard for genuine cult status – treating our heroes like they've earned their thick skin without being fleshed out beyond cool weaponry and nostalgic roots – FURY ROAD actually feels more like a second film following a proper introduction. Meanwhile, the tyrannical main villain looks straight out of a HE-MAN cartoon, and the only hint of a plot evolves around beautiful slaves being protected from his banal wrath.<br/><br/>Technically, a ROAD is a particular section of a larger area that takes you down one specific lane, but FURY has too much open space where everything is going on while absolutely nothing happens, back and forth, in either direction."

","I grew up with Mad Max, and The Road Warrior, and I apologize for Thunderdome. I was 13 when it came out, so I was clearly a target demographic. But that one was to save the kids, and now we're saving the chicks.<br/><br/>Yes, I heard all the uproar when it came out, and it concerned me. I also remember watching the previews with an arched eyebrow, and ALL of those fears came true. The flamethrower guitar is ridiculous and pointless. Just dumb. Mounting your blood-donor to the front of your car, and then using nitro? Seriously? Hogtie him, and throw him in the back-seat, or the trunk. Isn't it important that you keep him alive if he is giving you a constant blood transfusion? But, it looks cooler if you strap him to the hood, and don't put any eye protection on. It's just a desert. No rocks, or dust or anything.<br/><br/>Every single time a woman bit it, there was a stop in action to reflect on the loss. EACH time. When the preggo chick fell, it affected EVERY cast member in the movie. It was TRAGIC to lose a woman, but dudes were getting offed a mile a minute. And their clothes stayed amazingly pure and white throughout the movie. Every male in the movie is either horribly flawed and evil, or exists to serve the women. Max and the kid are the only ""good"" ones. At the end, the benevolent women turn on the water for everyone. ... In, what has got to be, the WORST water-distribution system in existence. I'd like to believe that Joe was actually rationing a limited supply of water, and now these silly binks have just made the world's largest mud puddle for a week.<br/><br/>This movie did not remind me of the first two, at all. Yeah, they had the double-barreled shotgun with the dead shell. Whoopie. Did that one-armed chick, really hold a guy by his leg for a couple of minutes, while crushing a speeding car between her rig and another? Mmmkay. He weighs, what? 200 pounds? And she's going to one-arm it, with her robot arm that is strapped on? Wow.<br/><br/>I am VERY glad that I refused to see this in the theaters. This is not something that I would have liked to contribute to. Thanks BitTorrent, because I would have been IRRITATED to have paid for this crap. I did notice that the commercials for it stopped pretty much as soon as it came out. That usually means it's all promotion hype, and that usually means a mediocre experience at best. I was so bored and uninterested at times, I put it on pause and went and did other things. I was never glued to my couch, and I felt that I was struggling to finish it.<br/><br/>Craptastic.

This film doesn't even have a script and it was the right way to do this. The action is mostly without CGI and considering the fact that current blockbusters can't reach the greatness of this film's action by using full of CGI, one of the most if not the most endeavored action film ever. Even after the film I though that it was an ok 6 with lots of CGI but after I did my search, I found out that they really did it, they really crushed those cars, they really did.

"Danielpotato","1","7","10","19 November 2017"," Stupid movie.
","I really like the second Mad Max movie, it's pretty interesting and the atmosphere is unique, I am a fan of that movie. Mad Max Road Fury, it's just Mad Max 2 on the highway chase scene, but augmented. If it were just this, Road Fury would just be a passable and forgettable action movie. But director George Miller had the sad idea of transforming a series of action films with male focus, in a propagandist feminist product. Not that I have anything against feminists, but it's wrong for you to turn something that your fans like and turn into something different. <br/><br/>Any defense that this movie may have, falls to the ground. The defenders of this film generally claim that the film no longer makes any political comment to the feminist side, and the film goes on to value that both sexes are equal at the beginning of the third act, since Mad and Furious (and the other women) work together to get saved from the pursuit of Immortan Joe. It would be true, but the way it is done, it's too simple and execution is not good enough (considering also the size of stupid things, which happens near the end of this movie, in which I'll speak closer to the end of the text). Miller just put it in the film, to save face, if Miller had the courage and the quality, he would have developed it from the beginning of the film itself, to culminate in a quality ending, but Miller had other interests, such interests to win awards and recognition , instead of doing something of quality. With this, Miller may have won some awards from the academy, after all when the car chase scenes begin and that awful song begins, you begin to visualize the wind heads in the academy awards jumping off the couch and starting dancing and jumping like crazy , and they begin to rave how the world is evil and the fault lies with men (the academy has ceased to be relevant since the late 1950s when it began to take political positions).<br/><br/>Stupid, I know. If you do not belong to the rebel age group (16 years-26 years old) and you're not delighted with bad and second- rate music, then Road Fury is just a mediocre action movie with 3 scenes of car chases. Passable and forgettable. Not to mention Miller had the sad idea of leaving the third act of the film, with the characters coming back the same way they did in the first and second acts. Amateur.<br/><br/>I do not forget the lousy acting of the film, with the exception of Charlize Theron, no one knows how to act. Especially the women of Immortan Joe who have most quickly stepped off the walkways of a Victoria's Secret event (e.g. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and from acting, these ladies do not know anything, for sure. Or the 60-70 (with a body with only 130lb) years-old ladies coming back with Max and Furious in the third act, who begin to beat men in their 30s and 40s with 310lb of muscle easily. Or jumping from truck to truck, or from vehicle to vehicle like rabbits, defying the laws of physics. Even as an action movie this movie is pathetic.<br/><br/>Stupid movie, no doubt."

","First of all, I'd like to clear a few things out. 1. I have never written another review on IMDb. The fact that this movie urged me to do so, speaks volumes. 2. I have not watched the original Mad Max with Mel Gibson. Therefore, I cannot condemn the whole series, I will only be judging this movie. 3. I L-O-V-E adventure/fantasy/dystopian movies!!! I'm literally a junkie, I have watched pretty much every one out there. So I am not a hater of the genre. That being said, I will continue with my first, genuine reaction to this film in quotes: "" What the f..* did I just watch. These are 120 minutes of my life that I will NEVER, EVER GET BACK!!! Thank the lord I didn't go to the movies to watch it with my friends when they asked me to, 'cause apart from my time, I'd also be crying over my money now!"" Yes, in my non- professional opinion as a humble viewer, this piece of sh..* that I wasted my time watching was absolutely horrific. What do I even start with? The absolutely ridiculous , non-existent plot?A stupid bunch consisting of a lunatic, a bald chief on the verge of schizophrenia and a few hot girls, just because, decide to run off to the sunset to find a non-existent promise land and are chased by another crazy bunch of ugly beasts and brainwashed slaves for absolutely no freaking reason. Oh, and as if that was not stupid enough, half way the decide they were wrong and turn the F..* AROUND!!! So they continue being chased by the same idiots who end up not catching them after all and then they release....water...and they all live happily ever after!!! Hooray!!!! WTF????!!! If there was some interest in the history and setting of this dystopian world it eluded me , since no one freaking bothered to explore it a little further. All we get is that these people are pretty much dying of thirst due to a lack of water, but every time their ugly leader wakes up in a good mood he releases a freaking waterfall and wastes half their water supplies by spilling it all over the place. Not to mention this literally MAD Max character, who decides to pretty much have himself killed in a ruthless road trip- gone-bad even though he doesn't really give a sh..*! Why on earth (other than the obvious reason of earning some shamefull but necessary money)would wonderful actors like Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy (whom I don't particularly love, but in all honesty I haven't exactly followed so far in his career) agree to be part of this sh..* excuse of a film, I have no idea. All I can say, is that it took me three days to watch the damn thing, because I was so freaking bored that I 'd literally stop it every 15 minutes or so to go find something interesting to do with my life. But I am a compulsive nerd who just had to finish what she started, so I went through 120 ENDLESS MINUTES OF TORTURE AND BOREDOM, only to come out of it with so much anger that I had to come in here and write a review to release part of it and go to bed. So,DO NOT WATCH MAD MAX. DO NOT WATCH IT. Watch 50 shades of gray instead. It's a sh..* movie as well, but if you happen to be a 50 year old pervert with 0 love life you might actually enjoy it more. Or better yet, go find something else to do with your life. Anything really. Reading the back label of your clothes detergent would be more educational, useful, interesting AND entertaining.

","This isn't a Mad Max film, it's a road trip film that focuses heavily on Charlize Theron's character, Furiousa. ""Mad Max"" appears, essentially, as a tag along side character. He does nothing ""mad"", risqué or extreme and has little more than 5 lines throughout the first two third's of the film. You could literally replace the character of ""Mad Max"" with any other supporting actor and it would not change the film. In fact, this film feels as though it was intended to be a Mad Max styled film called ""Furious Furiousa"" and they wanted to cash in on the franchise and avoid being accused of ripping off actual Mad Max films,<br/><br/>What this is is a piece of pro feminism garbage and one, like most, that completely misses the point of what gender equality is really about. All male characters, arguably with the exception of the 2 defectors, are portrayed as violent, oppressive warmongers, all clan leaders and all ""warriors"" are male and violent.<br/><br/>The women are the oppressed baby makers and between them, Theron and a rag tag female only clan of pensioners, it's only them who can bring about justice and save the planet.<br/><br/>Strong female characters are fine, and this worked for the first hour or so until they really forced the feminist angle. A strong female (or male, black, Asian, gay... for that matter) character should not be noticeable. <br/><br/>A film with a solid minority lead stands out as great film making not because they use a minority, but because the minority character works without you consciously noticing it. Alien, Tomb Raider, Flight Plan, Silence of the Lambs, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Kill Bill, The Wizard of Oz.... all fantastic films without forcing gender bias on the audience. No one watches Rush Hour and thinks ""hey, where's the white guy!?"".<br/><br/>But this film doesn't just lose points for that. No, on the film itself, it is competently shot, crisp, sharp and well produced. However, the CGI can look clearly false (this could be intentional) and there is little to absolute zero character development - I could name maybe 4 characters and 2 of those were because I looked up the cast listing whilst watching.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film comes across as a two hour car chase finale. Very little happens outside of the vehicle and this leads to a monotonous viewing experience with a less than impressive final act.<br/><br/>I watch many films time and again; I would not watch Mad Max Fury Road again."

","First of all I must say that I've had the pleasure to see the first 3 ""Mad Max"" movies.

Summarizing my opinion, this movie was dreadful. So bad, that I couldn't believe it was the same movie that got me so psyched when I saw the trailer last year. It's a non stop of crazy cars, explosions and cgi supported stunts that will definitely please those that like cars and action movies, but whose plot makes no sense at all. Now I could be here telling you about the visions that Max has from beginning until the end, which lacks explaining, or about the fact that they begin a journey from A to B just to find out they must return to A, but if they had stayed there all along the movie would be 7 minutes long, or even to the fact that they meet a bunch of women that live in the middle of nowhere, but surprisingly one of them was waiting barenaked on top of an electric pole, waiting for whoever would ever turn there, if it took 5 minutes or 200 years!... Instead I'll only complaint that apart from the fast driving and explosion filled footage, this has no story at all. The quest begins with a purpose, but that purpose is faulty and Max's character is relutant to join any group but quickly changes his mind... he's rogue, but he's nice... Furiosa is a powerful woman but is eager to accept that man she knows nothing of, to join their getaway posse... It's all so senseless that almost made me cry!

","As expected from Hollywood, a very political film filled with Social Marxism messages.<br/><br/>It's truly an irony that a ""guy movie"" franchise like Mad Max becomes a vehicle for anti-male Feminism. Genuine masculinity is tossed aside.<br/><br/>Women are super-hero-strong fighters (utterly implausible, as always); Max is a grunting idiot of a man; men destroyed the world (the woman actually says this!); the Boys are evil depraved rapists (of course); it's no longer fuel but WATER (dehumanizing, self-loathing, blame-humanity environmental progressive garbage); they officially changed the bi-sexual gangs to be more politically correct (hey, we can't have homosexuality portrayed as depraved!); it just goes on like this.<br/><br/>Idiotic film.

There is no Oscar winning acting here for sure, but every actor deliver pretty good. There was no boring moments here. Every character was unique in its own way.

"sachan-ankit697","10","26","49","16 May 2015"," Awesome Must Watch
","Must See if you are a Action Movie Lover.To hardy Rocks........ 10/10. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are two wonderful forces of nature, bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning. Mel Gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role, but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what Max is all about. Hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive. He has that hard look, driven, and with all of his priorities set to survival mode. He recognizes that you can't sit still here, and there is no sense in worrying if you want to live.<br/><br/>He finds himself prisoner of a set deviants/mutants that plan on killing him for sport. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before. At first, he observes everything around him, as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of. In the opening scenes, he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched Earth, with lighting storms, sand storms, wind storms, and just about anything else that can be thrown at him. He pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames, but in ""Fury Road"", this is just the beginning, and in the hands of George Miller, a man who is around 70 years old, we get what was just a promise in the previous films.<br/><br/>The universe is fully developed, with just about every hellish detail up on the screen, every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions, reactions, and powerful images from what his camera captures, a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film. As I said before, the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable, breathtaking, and utterly satisfying.<br/><br/>In this film, vehicles will burn, crash, tumble, fly, and spit fire continuously, and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release. There is power, disgust, hate, hunger, envy, and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen, even the angelic wives/prisoners are not empty shells. One can feel every emotion by letting Miller's sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration, not believing that what we have seen is possible. Here CGI doesn't overpower and sterilize the content. Many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources. Here Miller works with what he knows best, but he still uses CGI to increase the power of what one sees in this movie. Very little looks fake, and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of money.<br/><br/>Miller has given us a film that captures the magic of movie-making, the realization of its power. This is the masterpiece many dream of, where nothing and no one is spared. Every penny is showcased one way or another. There are no egos to satisfy, just goals to achieve, and these are accomplished. Miller should, like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves. Much has been made of a gimmicks recently. ""Birdman"" tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh reality,and it sorely failed. Here is film which entertains, never bores, and certainly is able to mix intelligence, the hells which some beings carry in their souls, and the possibility that a future like Max's might not be that distant. The film is not fantasy, it's the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be coming.<br/><br/>I never understood why some films had a certainly look, but they lacked vision, charm, or anything remotely intelligent, and the disappointment hurt. No one will walk away from ""Fury Road"" because Miller respects the audience, understand that unless some is ""real"" and we are able to somehow relate, the experience will be meaningless. ""Fury Road"" combines the best of acting and craftsmanship. It's pure, powerful, and it delivers a visceral punch, making the best use of everyone of our senses, giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary. Miller hasn't copied anyone, instead he has set the bar high for many, and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film, something with much imagination and power, something that is quite remarkable, considering how Hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics and/or surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies. Here is a film that proves that it's possible to dream, even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on Earth."

","The trailer alone — a 2 1/2-minute thrill ride of flying vehicles and fiery skies — screams with visceral images that sear into your brain and suggest that this must be a masculine and muscular cinematic extravaganza typical of the season. So what a lovely surprise it was on this lovely day to find that ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a fiercely feminist declaration of independence — pure hearted, passionate and full of beautifully realized moments of poignancy. Yes, it's as bad-ass as you've heard: powerful yet fluid, gritty yet crisp, sublime in the daring originality of its action sequences and flat-out gorgeous to watch. Just when you think that Miller, as director and co-writer, has topped himself with a grand and gripping set piece, he goes even more gloriously over the top with the next. Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off. See it on the biggest screen you can possibly find with the best possible sound, because this is a complete sensory experience. There's one image that was so vividly gnarly, it made me jump out of my seat and grab the shoulder of the friend sitting next to me. (Sorry, Amy.) And yet it conveys an underlying humanity in exquisite and convincing ways. Perhaps this stands out even more because it exists in such an outlandish wasteland. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a movie in which men initially seem to dominate, but eventually it reveals that it's truly about strong women fighting for each other, fighting for survival, fighting for the future. Hardy, as Max, becomes a passenger both literally and figuratively. This is truly Charlize Theron's film. As the fearless and unflappable Imperator Furiosa, Theron has given us a supreme action heroine for the ages. With her shaved head, greased face, a steam punk-inspired mechanical arm and an endless arsenal within the war rig she drives, she's an intimidating and resourceful protector. Theron has shirked her gorgeous looks previously (in her Oscar- winning performance in ""Monster"") and she's dared to play truly unlikable characters (in ""Young Adult"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman""). Here, there's a beauty to her ferocity, a regalness to her statuesque demeanor and — ultimately — a tenderness and vulnerability which are heartbreaking. It's no hyperbole to say she's right up there with Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" franchise and Linda Hamilton in the ""Terminator"" films. Although the film is told from Max's perspective in the script from Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, Furiosa is the one who's truly driving the story in myriad ways. This isn't really a sequel to the three previous movies — the low-budget ""Mad Max"" (1979), the hugely influential ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981) and the Tina Turner-tastic ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) — nor is it a remake. You could call it a reboot, but that makes it sound reheated. ""Fury Road"" fits squarely within the series mythology but it's wildly vibrant and a true original. Former police officer Max Rockatansky is running from his past, from both the living and the dead as he says in a low, rumbling voice-over. From the first richly over saturated images of Max surveying the unforgiving desert landscape that lies before him — Oscar-winner John Seale is responsible for the stunning cinematography — his sense of isolation is palpable. But this ultimate loner and rebel finds himself an unwitting pawn at the Citadel, a fortress carved out of the side of a mountain where the grotesque tyrant Immortan Joe rules completely through a twisted cult of personality. In a neat bit of casting, the actor playing Joe is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous motorcycle gang leader the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max."" (He's still creepy as hell all these years later, in case you were wondering.) When Joe's most trusted driver, Theron's Furiosa, veers off course and goes rogue during a routine run to Gas Town, the chase is on, and the imprisoned Max is right in the thick of it. He's strapped to the grill of a car driven by the jacked-up and thoroughly unstable Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy who foolishly believes his loyalty to the sadistic Joe will land him a spot in Valhalla. Shaved and painted a blinding white like the rest of Joe's minions, the usually handsome Hoult is a frightening sight to behold. But his appearance also suggests an innocence — an infancy, almost — which makes him an unexpectedly sympathetic figure. (Lesley Vanderwalt was in charge of the inspired hair and makeup design; meanwhile, Oscar- winner and multiple nominee Jenny Beavan provided the artfully rough-hewn costume design, which couldn't be farther away from the clothes she made her name on in classic Merchant- Ivory films like ""A Room With a View"" and ""Howards End."") Actually, calling what Nux is driving a ""car"" suggests something you've seen before. These are the remnants of society, slapped together and souped up for survival in dystopia: muscle cars on top of tanks, vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. The level of detail is dazzling over and over again, and the tactile thrill of practical effects provides great joy and a real connection — especially during blockbuster season when so much of what we see is the product of glossy CGI. And that's basically the entire plot: One big, long chase across the desert. What happens along the way is awesome, frightening, deeply strange and darkly funny, but it's never less than jaw-dropping and it's constantly surprising. A sequence that takes place entirely within a wall of swirling dirt and piercing lighting will leave you breathless; a quieter moment amid barren trees and blue moonlight provides an unshakable melancholy. The score from Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) provides just the right tone each time: propulsive here, introspective there."

It's fun looking at all that for about five minutes, or maybe ten if you try really hard. <br/><br/>The stuff about resources makes little sense and is not introduced in a way which creates any sort of plot or dramatic tension to care about. The characters are two-dimensional and the very limited script is so poor that it's actually embarrassing when the actors mumble or shout their lines, which are often fairly incomprehensible anyway. Since it's consequently impossible to care about anyone in the film or what they're doing (let's drive all the way to some remote place for no apparent reason, then turn around and go all the way back again for no apparent reason - wow) the action just becomes a tedious parade of inconsequential noise and flashing lights. <br/><br/>As another reviewer on here said, it's like someone took the action sequence at the end of Mad Max 2, threw away all the stuff before it which actually explained what was happening and why you should care about it, then just stretched it out for two hours. That's all it is - a very, very, VERY long action sequence. Utterly mind-numbing. I'd have walked out after an hour or sooner if I hadn't been there with a friend. The irony is that it turned out afterwards he was feeling the same way about it, and if we'd both known then we could have left and spent an hour doing something interesting instead of watching the second tedious half of this rubbish. <br/><br/>There are a thousand silly B movies which are infinitely more enjoyable than this. It's boring, miserable and exhausting. There's no chemistry between characters, no humour, no spark of any kind. It's just mindless noisy spectacle which goes on far too long.

But still there was speed, the pulse of the V8, the tarmac winding on into nothing.<br/><br/>I didn't love Thunderdome, no car, no pavement, and perhaps a too uncomfortable insight into where humanity might be headed.<br/><br/>And then I waited 30 years, for this film, ""Fury Road"".<br/><br/>It's hard to not get caught up in the hype when you've waited so long for more of a story that captured your imagination as a child. George Miller leaves Max, alone and lost, at the end of each of the three earlier movies, and so you wait, hoping there will be some peace for him, or that at the very least he will continue to survive.<br/><br/>Fury Road is not truly a continuation, it is more of a distillation of the elements that defined the earlier movies, spiked with the magic available to the modern movie maker. Miller seems to be a fan of his own earlier work, such is his understanding of the essential appeal of Max's ordeal.<br/><br/>This movie then is not a redux, nor is it a hybrid of previous pictures. More it is an evolution, an elegant simplification and a beautiful, terrible translation of simple desire, horror and hope into moving pictures.<br/><br/>Don't wait for downtime in your two hours on Fury Road, there is no respite from the constant raw inundation of incredible imagery. The viewer is thrown, as though a passenger in one of the film's insane, wonderful, vehicles, from scenes of brutal mechanical destruction, to vistas of such grandeur, menace and beauty that you find yourself wishing a longer moment to absorb before the next overdose of visual stimuli presents itself.<br/><br/>There is dialogue, but I suspect you could watch the movie with the volume turned down and cranked speed metal in its place and not find yourself missing the point. And the point in question is this: We are creatures that are wired to survive, and hope is an emotional manifestation of some vital genetic imperative that brought humanity down from the trees and into speeding metal vehicles. But we also have an element of our nature that makes less sense, a fascination with chaos, with smashing, burning, bleeding destruction. Fury Road will trick you into having hope, and then reward you with chaos, and chaos, and chaos.<br/><br/>Why 10 out of 10? I nearly dropped it to a 9 because of a few seconds of Jaws 3D-esque visual buffoonery (you'll know the moment when you reach it), but everything else was so good, such unbridled, spectacular, colourful, murderous fun.

I didn't love any of the Mad Max films, but the first was interesting.<br/><br/>Almost the moment it started I hated the movie. The only thing good was the intro. I was trying to find a story, who everyone was, what was supposed to be happening. Nothing is explained, as if the movie was supposed to continue directly from a previous film. It doesn't though, it just throws in characters to give there a point for those characters to be killed. Mad Max isn't Mad Max at all, nothing like Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>All I got out of it was there was an evil ruler, only giving people water the odd time (yet they are alive somehow), he sends out to trade fuel, they bugger off, and Mad Max finds his way into the situation. They go only so far, fighting off guys on poles and a flaming guitar dude who is apparently aiding the situation with a guitar. They find the other women, turn back, and kill the bad guys in the process and give everyone the water. I honestly don't remember the names of anyone, there was nothing at all memorable about any of the characters. It could have been Captain Ahab riding around on Moby Dick in the desert for all I care. Any story could have been made into 20 minutes: Get the truck, Mad Max breaks free and fight everyone right in that one area, instead of driving to Timbuktu for over an hour of the film and then turning around in another hour, or however long it was. Clearly if they were able to kill everyone with only a few people and a armored truck, they didn't need to drive around to do so."

But as part of the Mad Max canon, or even as a film with a worthwhile story told in an engaging fashion, it's a dead fish sprinkled with glitter.<br/><br/>Putting aside the obvious financial benefits of the Mad Max brand, I honestly can not figure out why this film was made.<br/><br/>I wish IMDb offered the option for minus-star reviews."

","If you want to know what hell is like then watch this film.<br/><br/>It's a two hour action film with a pointless and meaningless story.

The art of story telling and movie making seems to be slowly dying a death."
"ofreason","1","47","97","21 May 2015"," The Desolation of Cinema Without Substance
","This film has received very positive receptions from critics. This I find quite baffling. Why so? Because this film follows basically the same approach that Michael Bay's films do! It minimizes dialogue, plot, characterization, and maximizes action, special effects, etc., in order to be able to appeal to a broader international audience (primarily in Asia). Unfortunately for this film, unlike the Transformers, who will have some cultural clout in Asian markets, I do not expect this approach will work as well as they hoped it would.<br/><br/>In addition to stripping this film down to the bare minimum of dialogue, the bare minimum of plot, almost no lines, an essentially supporting role for Mad Max (who can't even get his accent right or consistent, or deliver any lines in anything like a sensible way), this film tries to resurrect its ability to recoup its budget by appealing to the political left and its intolerance of anyone saying anything negative about whatever its sacred cow might be at the moment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film isn't actually political. If this film were, in fact, a deep political statement about feminism, communism, racism, the environment, or really, about any kind of left wing political perspective whatsoever in any kind of thought through coherent way, it would be an infinitely superior film. But it isn't. <br/><br/>It depicts men as brutal, beastly, vicious and often unnecessary or hindrances: but this is not a political statement. There are some shocking visuals (the milk scenes, the attempted baby extraction, some scenes of women being aggressive, violent, or being subjects of the same), but this does not amount to a feminist film.<br/><br/>However, by marketing this film AS a feminist film, it becomes the duty of any good left wing hack on the internet to defend it. Because since the film depicts or claims to depict or is claimed to depict left wing values, to criticize it in any way would be to concede the baselessness of their views or to lose face or something. Honestly I have no way why anyone gets as vehement about politics as these people do. This includes the reverse type: Conservative lunatics. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron is the star of this film, and had she been given more to work with, she could have done great things with it. Unfortunately, the script, which I have heard was depicted in a series of pictures and only later transferred from these images to a written form, has nothing for anyone, even someone as talented as Theron, to work with. <br/><br/>Because special effects are essentially a given with a budget the size Miller was working with, and further, these special effects were not put to any use to convey a story, principle, politics, or really well, anything, it follows that I have no regard for them. Art in order to be art must have a message. Do not be fooled. This film has none. The emperor has no clothes.<br/><br/>Because of this total poverty of story, you might even argue that this film is covertly a conservative film. It strips down the art of filmmaking to simply reproducible factors (special effects) targeted at certain markets (the American left, international markets for limited or no English) and it uses the media as a tool of propaganda to disguise its only real aim, point, purpose, or raison d'être: to make money. To further the global capitalist agenda. <br/><br/>Marketed for Liberals, made for the benefit of Neocons, Mad Max (now with 95% less Max!): Fury Road! (Now with 95% more road, less story, less fattening! Buy now!)"

","I went to this movie with my daughter, 15, and we both walked out of there convinced this is one of the worse movies we'd seen in years. Save your money and go see anything else...<br/><br/>Given the disparity of years, culture, values, etc. it is a bit surprising that one of us didn't like this movie, even just a little. In fact, the only reason this doesn't get a zero stars is that, well, there is no zeros available and some of the cars were kinda cool. Everything else, the crappy predicable acting, the crappy predictable storyline, the crappy predictable and sophmoronic writing, was crappy, predictable, and sometimes sophmoronic (yes, I did just make that word up). This is a movie that suffered from too much money (140 million budget I read elsewhere, they must have used it on the cars) too much ambition (I also read that one of the ambitions was to make it more feminist a la the Vagina Dialogues writer(s)) and too little imagination. Halfway through I started rooting for the bad guys as they seemed the only hope for ending this thing.<br/><br/>So the problem this film had was mundaneness. I didn't think Hardy's character was heroic or very interesting so I didn't care much about his fate. I thought Theron's character was supposed to be dark except that she only seemed to be broken, maybe as much as Hardy's. This left the movie without a real lead, which is OK if there is an ensemble cast with multiple story lines...but this wasn't that, it was just one long car chase into the dessert and then turn around and go back. Making the bad guys a bunch of weak suicidal wannabe Vikings didn't add a lot dimension to the plot either. And turning their leaders into caricatures might have appealed to the anti-tough crowd that likes to make tough guys kinda clownish and seriously flawed but it didn't help the storyline much. Oh wait, what storyline? <br/><br/>So if you have extra money that you want to donate to an unworthy cause, buy a ticket and send a message that this is good enough to pay for. If your AC is out and you need a cool place to hide and this is the only thing playing, spend a couple of hours in the back where you can catch a few zzzzzzzzs. The Avengers show was so full that we couldn't find two seats together so we went to this instead where there was plenty of room. That makes it our fault for not getting to the theatre earlier and lesson learned. Nobody should go through that kind of thing twice."
"skullislandsurfer","1","44","91","18 May 2015"," Feels Like An Action-Only Sequel More Than A Reboot
","This movie felt like it was a sequel to a first film starring Tom Hardy that initially set up the character and the world he survives in, other than quick narration and flashbacks. Thus the bombardment of non-stop action would make more sense in a sequel than a reboot of a franchise from a really long time ago, that some people half-remember and others don't know of at all.<br/><br/>And Charlize Theron would be the one character brought into the sequel to make it different from the original where Hardy was the main character. Thus, FURY ROAD felt like a cannonball flying without the fuse ever being lit. Playing out like a sequel of itself more than a reboot of something else.<br/><br/>Original franchise director George Miller took this rebooted world seriously, a video game meshed into a melodramatic graphic novel where anything goes, so therefore, audiences got into the sheer craziness and epic style road rage.

The trailer itself as a video ad did not get any attention and got skipped as soon as possible, I knew it was not worth it yet we eventually went to see it as we did not have anything else to do. From playing around with umbilical cords of a dead woman and (a now dead) baby, to the creepy deformed talking pile of flesh that I think was supposed to resemble a child yet had a beard, this f**k-fest had it all. Using 150 million dollars to show what the world would be like without water seems rather excessive. Not only that, how about we add every single dumb idea that comes into mind and call it a film, including killing grannies, shooting bullets at the eyes of grannies, having a human as a ""blood bank"" connected to the driver of the car, and my personal favorite, driving over a pregnant woman, then slicing the woman open to check if the baby is ""all right"". Don't get me wrong, the scenery was wonderful, especially the canyons, but all of it is completely destroyed by the modernization of a film that had none of the ""brilliant"" ideas that were described earlier. The cast have also made a significant change in the good way as they played their role perfectly, but that was not enough to cover up the tornado of horrible, horrible ideas thrown into the film. In general, this film is a typical Hollywood production with a completely ruined sense of entertainment and if no one is going to say it, it will only get worse. By all means, if you want to throw your money into a puddle (hah, get it?) go see the film. If you actually value your time, go and spend some time researching actual problems about droughts and everything, instead of wasting it watching people getting trampled over by cars."

","In the distant future the world is a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max (Tom Hardy), a survivor in Australia, is captured by the War Boys, the army of tyrannical cult leader King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for the sick War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives her heavily-armored War Rig to collect gasoline. Furiosa begins driving off route, alerting Joe who realizes that his Five Wives – women specially selected for breeding – are gone. Joe leads his entire War Boy army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.<br/><br/>Nux joins the army with Max strapped to the hood of his car, to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into an approaching sand storm evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig; Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed by the Rig. Waking up after the storm, Max sees Furiosa nearby repairing her Rig, accompanied by the Wives: Angharad, Capable, Cheedo, Toast, and the Dag. Max steals the Rig, but its kill-switch disables the truck. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the Wives accompany him, while Nux returns to Joe.<br/><br/>Furiosa drives through Biker gang territory into a narrow canyon, having agreed to exchange gasoline for passage. However, Joe's forces are close behind, and Furiosa flees while the Bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe's path. Max and Furiosa fend off the pursuing Bikers but Joe's vehicle evades the blockade and assaults the Rig. Nux boards the Rig while Joe attempts to shoot Furiosa. Angharad, Joe's heavily pregnant wife, shields Furiosa, but falls from the Rig and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and his child. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the ""Green Place"", a location she remembers from her youth. Capable finds Nux hiding aboard the Rig, distraught that he contributed to the death of Joe's wife; she consoles him. At night, the heavy Rig gets caught in deep mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with explosives, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer, pursues the Rig. Nux helps free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. He retaliates with machine gun fire and explosives. Max wanders into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer, returning to the Rig with guns and ammunition.<br/><br/>As dawn breaks, the Rig travels through swampland and desert, eventually coming across a naked woman. Max identifies it as a trap, but Furiosa leaves the Rig and states her former clan affiliation. The woman summons her group who realize that Furiosa is a member of their clan, kidnapped with her mother when she was a child. Furiosa is distraught to learn that the swamp land they passed was the Green Place, which is now uninhabitable. The group agree to ride motorbikes across the immense salt flats in the hope of finding somewhere to live. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of his dead daughter, he convinces them to return to the Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the Biker's canyon.<br/><br/>The group begins the journey back to the Citadel, eventually encountering Joe. A battle is waged by the two sides, and Furiosa is gravely wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's son Rictus. Toast is captured and put on Joe's car, but she distracts him, allowing Furiosa to hook Joe's mask to his car's rotating wheels, tearing his face off and killing him. Nux sacrifices himself by destroying the Rig, blocking the canyon, killing Rictus, and allowing Max, Furiosa, and the Wives to escape in Joe's car. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, to help her survive her injuries.<br/><br/>At the Citadel, Joe's citizens are overjoyed at the sight of Joe's corpse. Furiosa and the Wives are raised up on a lift by the child War Boys, but Max stays behind. He and Furiosa share a glance of acknowledgment before Max disappears into the crowd. <br/><br/>See this terrific movie with your family, it really deserves many Oscars and is worth seeing too many times. There is no sex or bad language,just violence and great entertaining action from beginning to end."

","Before watching this movie, I had been told that there was very little in the way of story or characters in this movie, and that the main draw of the film was the action scenes. I found that limited the potential of the movie, so that at best it would be OK, however the low expectations I had were gravely disappointed. The story was non- existent and the character were more like caricatures. So that left only the action to make it an okish movie (if the action was really superb), but even that disappointed me. The action felt both too fast and too long. From the very first action scene I thought that my computer was playing the movie at a quickened pace, but nope, the action is portrayed in a slightly sped up manner. The stylization of the action scenes was boring (besides some lovely colour-scheming), and the ""cool"" vehicles look like what a 6 year old would want out of a movie.

This is a movie for those who know and love the genre.<br/><br/>I don't know anything about the back story. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic dystopia where water has become so precious that you resent it. The population of survivors have all evolved to a point of no longer needing hydration.<br/><br/>Cars and trucks are vital, however, and it's important when driving really fast to have a blind guitarist play heavy metal music from a flame throwing instrument while chasing other cars.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, the main character, Furiosa, is tasked to drive to another city to steal gasoline. Half way there, she suddenly turns east, because she wants to take five girls to a green place she once saw as a child. There is a chase, and a sandstorm, after which the five girls find it imperative to wash themselves off in the middle of the desert with a whole bunch of water. The guy with a rake for a face resents this and points a gun at them.<br/><br/>There is a fight, and suddenly the bald crazy guy who is chained to to the other guy giving him blood, suddenly switches sides because he sees a pretty girl with red hair.<br/><br/>More fast driving, getting stuck, and then unstuck, and then realizing that a motorcycle actually can ride for a 160 days without refuelling, but then instead deciding to go back to exactly where the movie started, again, as fast as they left, with more explosions and fast driving.<br/><br/>Then the main character appears to be mortally wounded, so the Blood Bag offers the most cathartic and poignant dialogue of the entire movie when he says ""My name is Max"". Seriously. Luckily, post-apocalyptic survivors have also developed kick ass immune systems, as whole blood transfusions with dirty needles and used tubing apparently don't cause fatal sepsis, but instead return you to life.<br/><br/>What the actual .... I have no idea what this movie was about or was supposed to be about. There is absolutely no story, or character development. The film presupposes, and actually requires, that you are familiar with the previous films despite the fact that the last one was 30 years ago, and some of us may not have seen it.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film.

"snafux7","1","39","80","26 July 2015"," Another hopelessly flawed reboot from Hollywood
","Do yourself a huge favor, go watch the first 10-15 mins of The Road Warrior (after the narrator part) and think about what makes it so compelling. I'll give you a big hint, it's because they used to actually practice the craft of storytelling in movies instead of just special effects. After just 15 mins of The Road Warrior you know all you need to know to be completely hooked into the story. More importantly we meet Max and through just a few scenes we get to KNOW Max, both as the requisite underdog bad-ass character but also as a man with compassion in his heart (witness the bond with his dog or the music box that he gives to the little kid). When we KNOW characters in this way, we CARE about them, we identify with them, we root for them, we love them and become completely immersed in their world. That's what makes a good movie, no amount of special effects, explosions or hot chicks in skimpy outfits can supplant that simple fact. And that's the big problem with Fury Road. The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that we don't care about. After watching the first 20 mins of this steaming pile of crap I still didn't know who any of the main characters really were and I certainly didn't care if they lived or died. Yes it has gorgeous action sequences, cool weapons and explosions oh my! But it's completely bereft of anything that draws you in emotionally and that makes it a huge failure. Add to that a story arc that doesn't make a helluva lot of sense and a baffling disregard for the value of oil (they waste it with abandon even though it's scarcity is why they are fighting in the first place). Unfortunately blockbusters like this are increasingly becoming the norm from Hollywood, I fear we'll get to a point in the not so distant future where nobody even remembers what a good action movie is like."

","The trilogy was amazing and Thunderdome was a masterpiece compared to this one. <br/><br/>Nothing in it is memorable, characters are not developed at all, they just exist. The universe is stale and absurdly useless. Defies logic in a numbing manner. Mostly action. Low quality one. And what a shocker: certain secondary good characters die in stupid ways. Felt like they had more depth than the main ones. Hardy was on crack vacation. Charlize has faded and I do not want to see her again. <br/><br/>There is also a forced scene of emotional garbage when the music tried to make the viewer (more like targeting retarded audience) feel some empathy. It achieved the exact opposite. Apathy. Boredom. Disgust. Insult. Thankfully, it partially erased this moment with the next action moments. Or did it? <br/><br/>By the end of it you wish you did not waste so much life time on this film. Explosions and sand and some driving and... I already forgot.

I find this rating a disappointing indictment of mankind.<br/><br/>The film starts off quite well, but runs out of ideas fast - or rather it has lots of ideas, but each seems to be a cliché - and ones which are so overused as to be threadbare. It's almost like someone interviewed 8 to 12 year old boys leaving cinemas over the course of about 1000 films, wrote down a list of clichés that the audience found entertaining, and then spent all of ten minutes in an attempt to transform the research into a script.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much I would have to drink to reach the point where I was able to sustain the level of suspension of disbelief to overlook the many holes and contradictions in the plot, but would fear that liver failure would hit me before I reached the required level of inebriation.<br/><br/>The phrase ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" doesn't seem to apply here. Almost all of the characters seem shockingly two dimensional. The dialogue is appalling. The special effects are good, but the overall level of ridiculousness reduces the impact of the stunts to circus level.<br/><br/>Some films are so bad they are good.

","Max is minus in this film and gets outplayed easily by Charlize Theron and I guess the director was so glad to have her that she's by far the most interesting character of this action only flick. The story only serves to connect the action sequences which are abundant but after a while you sort of get numb to everything that is displayed before your eyes. This becomes even more clear when they turn around and do the whole thing over again stretching the film even longer and adding absolutely nothing. It had some interesting ideas but all of that never gets of the ground and the realness is lost because the genuine gritty Australian actors of the first 3 installments are replaced by Americans who seem to have no connection with the dystopian desert they're living in. Also the rough straight up violence is changed to a Chinese circus version making everything feel really choreographed and there for fake so you don't feel the tension that was done so well in the original trilogy. The CGI dust storm was the point I should have hit the stop button but I was somewhat hoping things would get better when Hardy gets freed from the mouthpiece stuck to his face,but sadly it didn't.Theron brings some weight to this but the other characters are so laughable which made it all just some what painful to watch. I simply can not understand that a director who made these masterpieces before now goes out in this way and kills his own creation. I strongly suggest his next film should be a parody titled, mad Maxine: blurry road. Which is the road the writers were on when they wrote this abomination."

Charlize Theron could have solo'd it with out Max which is not the worst thing I can think of to say about the story writer for this mess. Suppose to be a Mad Max film but Tom Hardy had no chance with this script. How many lines did he even have? No character to connect with. Nothing to make me accept him as replacement for Mel Gibsons version. Charlize Therons character had it all, story and purpose but Hardys was basically a passenger along for the ride. The whole concept of them escaping then actually escape to then u- turn back for a suicide mission so we can have a action packed ending is beyond crap writing. <br/><br/>The dialogue was terrible, an example would be poor giant Nathan Jones telling me 3 times that they're trying to use the sand storm to lose them..yeah yeah we get it, big storm coming and they're driving towards it, hmmm wonder whats going on here d'uh, no need to help Sherlock...why does Hollywood writers insist on spelling things out unless they accept that the only people that enjoy this stuff are out they're minds on drugs (like the writers clearly)<br/><br/>Action in this mess, well yeah the vehicles were inventive I'll give them that but there's only so much of them blowing up you can take before you become immune and start going ''oh yeah there goes another one *yawn'' It's way too repetitive. Especially in a 2 hour movie which is 3/4's blowing car/trucks/bikes/buggy's up.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was well laughable..some of the scenes where they're trying and failing to set some sense of mood and this music playing hahaha..it was bad, I struggle to even describe it, what were they thinking...like they realised there was no story or connection to the actors so they turned the melodramatic sounds up to 11..I have no idea. The mad guitar guy on the truck was fun though, abit over the top but yeah he was good.<br/><br/>Bad guy, the main Bad dude was erm no idea..no idea why he was in charge, no idea why he wore a mask, no idea what the hell was going on with him, just no idea. oh and his ending was meh ...forgettable.<br/><br/>I generally like post apocalypse type of movies, there's been a load made but this is one of the worst. B movies are made better..straight to TV do better.<br/><br/>This has been way too over hyped and people want to like it so they walk out going ''yeah that was proper crazy..loved it'' but really deep down they'l forget it and probably not watch it again.<br/><br/>I disliked it so much that if I was offered money to sit through it again I would struggle to accept the cash.<br/><br/>Its a case of what could have been sadly..script terrible + story terrible = shite movie."

However, if you measure the movie's success by it's box office performance, this is clearly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you believe that everything happens for a reason, then how this crappy scenario got this kind of budget?

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>They used GraveDigger the monster truck in this!! It would have been fun to be part of the vehicle design team as they were all wild, mean and powerful looking. This movie kept the vibe and atmosphere of the originals, dirty, grimy, gross and vast in landscape, to paint a picture of an evil overlord who enslaves people and withholds water in a hopeless desert land. During an escape attempt, Max encounters a few women and they begin to team up to escape the wasteland in hopes of reaching the women's homeland. Like many in this movie series, the plot felt thin and a vague and barely enough to contain the wild and spectacular car chase battles. This movie did not disappoint with its pure action which was well- choreographed, elaborate, full of dirt, blood, sweat and fire; a lot to visually digest on the screen. I wish this story had better character engagement or reward for watching as by the end I just felt dirty and that I needed a bath."

","TL;DR: If you're looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow, give Mad Max: Fury Road a watch. If you want a deep plot, move along, nothing to see here.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie got a 6/10 from me is because it only had half of what I think makes a good movie. Mad Max: Fury Road has FANTASTIC cinematography. Quite possibly the best I have ever seen, but it has almost NO plot. The plot is basically how your sixth grade teacher tells you to write a plot: main character gets in trouble, does a thing, problem gets worse, does a different thing, and the problem is solved. That's it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mad Max is a pleasure to watch. All the shots are smooth and flow very well from one to the next while still giving you a sense of fast, rough action. This is something even the Matrix has a hard time with (yes I just said that Mad Max has better fight scenes than one of the best fighting movies of all time). The effects are over the top and just incredible. The portable metal concert seen in the trailer is even better in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie inspired me to go back and watch the older Mad Max movies and the lack of plot kind of makes sense. The whole point is that he lost his family in the first movie, the world just doesn't make sense anymore, and all he sees is mindless violence. So the lack of plot can be excused to a point because it was intentional, but plot is one of the things I look for most in a movie/TV show.<br/><br/>TL;DR: If you're looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow, give Mad Max: Fury Road a watch.

","I mean sure, as far as summer blockbusters go, we have had a bit of a dry spell this year. (At least in my opinion.) However, to call this ""The Best Movie of the Year"" or ""A Masterpiece"" that's kinda stretching it isn't it? Seriously, what's so great about this movie? Were the critics watching a different movie from the one than I did? Originally, I wasn't going to write a review for this movie, but after seeing so many raving reviews for this film on the internet, and seeing the absurdly high rating this movie has here on IMDb, I felt that I had to say SOMETHING! Even if my hopes of knocking this movie down a point or two are completely moot, then at least I would've accomplished something by saying how much I hated this film, and add my voice to the small minority of people on this site that believe that this movie is nothing more than an over-hyped, overrated snore-fest. While watching this movie I fell asleep. Yes! This movie, with it's ""Thrilling action scenes!"" and ""Provocative visuals!"" Actually put me to sleep! I would go into the plot now, but I don't think this movie has one. At least not while I was awake. Furthermore, Mad Max, the supposed ""Main Character"" in this film, has no reason for even being in the film! Why call this film ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", if Mad Max himself has no motivations, or stake into what's going on? And for that matter, why even use the character of Mad Max at all? If you were gonna go that way with it, why not have Mel Gibson appear in a 10-15 minute cameo as an older Mad Max? From what I saw, there was nothing good about this movie. I probably would've been more entertained staring at a wall for two hours. Congratulations George Miller, you've accomplished something that only Rob Zombie and M. Night Shyamalan have been able to do: Cure my insomnia! I present to you, your awards: My middle finger, and a long, loud, raspberry! Bravo A$$hole!"

","The movie ""Earth Girls Are Easy,"" with Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis, conveys the feeling it may have been made by Jeff and Geena with gear borrowed from the industry.

","I am a huge fan of the original Mad Max movie. For me it is about the struggle to stay human in an inhuman world. To preserve that tiny bit of dignity, that differentiates us from the beasts that inhabit the deserts.<br/><br/>Fury Road takes everything from the Mad Max franchise and blows it up. Literally. This movie made me squirm in my seat and I was close to leaving the theater. The visuals are stunning, but there is nothing that ties them together. It is like a bucket of special effects of all end time movies, stirred together infused with a big budget and poured over the viewer in a meaningless way. The feeble attempts to create an artistic look to some of the scenes (e.g. while driving through the wasteland) are so random that they are lost on the spectator.<br/><br/>The guiding principle of Max struggling with being a true survivor and trying to stay human is cut out of Fury Road. There are some hints, but for character development, this is the weakest Mad Max ever.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that most action scenes are so over the top that they simply are ridiculous. I do appreciate the wasteland weirdo as any Mad Max fan would, but in Fury Road they are just so exaggerated that it is too much. And I am not even talking about the whole plot being full of logic errors.<br/><br/>This thing is a B-Movie with a big budget that can't make up its mind, what it wants to be in the first place and then simply turns all the Dollars into explosions. And that does not compute or entertain."

","If what you're hearing about mad max fury road is that it is one big explosion filled car chase that's absolutely true. Which is okay. In a strange Michael bay fashion it's got some impressive moments, but the insanely high review scores will simply not stand the test of time. As a fan of the mad max series I don't believe the film insults or dilutes the mad max universe. I was most disappointed in the way it failed to capitalize on it. Such a perfect world to mold a story out of and bring to life in the way the video game industry has with the borderlands and fallout series over recent years. They fail making the universe interesting and deep and desperate. It never suspended my belief like a great movie should. This could've been any desert full of bandits. It seemed to be loosely inspired by, if not a flat out off brand version of a mad max movie. <br/><br/>Instead of a story in the realm of mad max they tryed to go with a balls out action movie, which once again is fine. But they wait an hour to try to add artificial drama. AN HOUR! Not that Theron acted her part poorly by any means. She doesn't have to prove herself at this point in her career. Clearly her few dramatic lines and ""courageous intent"" come wayyyyy too late in the movie to care. Almost as if somebody was like ""wow, we need to add this ingredient to the Hollywood formula because that's what our investors demand"" it's out of place and nearly makes you roll your eyes. It came of as so forced and phony it almost wrecked the entire thing for me.<br/><br/>Also I feel like cinematic direction and results didn't match. Much of the movie didn't have that flair that I felt it was nearly achieving. I guess the only example I could transfer to written word is during the dustnado-dust storm- scene. It looks as though they were going for the 300 type filter (which by the way had they pulled it off would've been perfect) but it kind of came out as a very budget version of that aesthetic. Also the white body paint didn't do any favors throughout the film. They didn't look like blockbuster cool body makeup. They just looked like normal people going to a football game.<br/><br/>My end game is they failed to really cement the viewer in the world. Forced some very unneeded drama. And honestly many of the action scenes never felt as intense as they should've been.either budget or ability ate into the final result. Hard to tell which."

Thunderdome was garbage and although this wasn't garbage it was far from good. I mean, did they really need a mutant midget?! Did they really need a blind mutant guitarist on the front of a truck?! In a post apocalyptic world are we really going to see that many women that look as if they've just stepped off a model's runway? Besides all the things that are just preposterous or don't make sense there is absolutely no character development and the characters do not make any sort of connections themselves.

Then it got worse, the impossible landscapes that looked so good in Avatar or Star Wars seem completely out of place in the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max. I mean Mad Max, the Road Warrior! That felt real, a world with people fighting for petrol and survival! Mad Max : Fury Road is way off the reality chart. Whoever came up with the world must have come straight out the video game industry. The visual effects are unbelievable (literally): they look fake.

Tom Hardy takes on Mel Gibson's mantle as Max fantastically, showing the will to survive despite the impossible odds. Nicholas Hoult and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley also give considerable depth to the movie, proving it not to be a mindless barrage of explosions.

This is the greatest movie in the movie history, even The Terminator, Aliens, The Matrix, The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, can not be compared to this masterpiece of the movie history!

"ndlekas","1","36","76","17 May 2015"," Disguised Action Flick - Horrible Done Except For the Action
","Mad Max is set in a great story - a post apocalyptic future filled with craziness and explosions. Unfortunately George Miller botched the story completely. Regardless of what some people might think in our politically correct world, 130 lb females do not beat up large, aggressive males. Charlize Theron is escaping an evil warlord who treats his women brutally, but unfortunately, in a post-apocalyptic future, that brutal environment would likely happen, especially to beautiful women. These women would not be ordering men around or fighting them in hand-to-hand combat. I do not say this because I think that the story should only have submissive women, but think of Game of Thrones and Cersei Lannister. She works toward her own ends using her womanly wiles, in a realistic environment. Though the action sequences are amazing, I thing that George Miller did a net horrible job with Mad Max Fury Road."

","There are very few movies which deliver exactly what they promise and Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those few. This is dark, tiring, brutal and a very serious movie. But it is visually brilliant and there is no complication when it comes to the storyline. The movie is nothing like the Mel Gibson starred Mad Max but a unique, Theron- Hardy show. <br/><br/>As many of the futuristic movies, this is also set on an apolcalyptic world where there is scarcity of basic elements. It is ruled by 'Immortal Joe' who is considered to be immortal by those below him. But only few like Furiosa (Theron) who knew the truth takes on him by trying to take his many wives away from him into a better place. Mad Max a prisoner of Immortal Joe who is on neither side happens to be in the midst of this chaos, ends up teaming up with Furiosa to reveal the truth to the people.<br/><br/>The film is packed with ruthless action, some epic BGM by Junkie XL who got us that pump up feeling in 300: rise of an empire as well. It is a bit tiring to watch the first 20-25 minutes, but once you start getting the hang of the story, it gets us involved very soon. Tom Hardy hardly speaks in the movie and Charlize Theron has a very important role. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant. A very unique role for him. Other hot girls like Rosie Huntington Whitley are for the pleasant sight at times. If you are a fan of action genre, this is a movie you must not miss. All credit to the director for the grand presentation of the simple storyline."
"toadwarrior","3","21","41","17 May 2015"," A mad max film for the focus groups
","As a fan of the series I had high hopes for this film but I've left the theater disappointed. It can be best summed up as someone saying ""the last act of the road warrior was so great so let's make that into a whole film"". They've done that and as a result we get a film that's really lacking a story, is too busy and doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I think most of its problems are down to being made to appeal to focus groups rather than being a true mad max film. The UK rating for it is a 15 and it shows. The few times it attempts to do something gruesome or violent it's always out of the scene and to compensate for the lack of blood the explosions are over the top and add to the busy and distracting feel.<br/><br/>All the theatrics, flaming guitar, pole vaulting guys give you a lot to look at but when you actually think about what is happening there's very little actually going on and you're left wondering why are there so many cars simply driving for no reason other than to follow the handful of cars actually doing something? What is the point to the guy playing random rubbish on his guitar other than to serve as a distraction on the screen?<br/><br/>I like Tom Hardy but in the film he has very little to say for having so much screen time and often it feels more like he's doing his impression of a lawn ornament rather than being mad max. Charlize Theron is barely any better. You could easily take both of their characters out and very little would change about the film.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it I feel there are few wtf moments that at least border on being major plot holes if not actually being plot holes.<br/><br/>It's a great film if you've never realized there were other mad max films or you thought it would be great if they made a mad max film you could take your children (older children that is) to.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, there's not much here for you. Even Beyond thunderdome had more substance than this film and even with its awful bits with the children it still holds up better than Fury road.<br/><br/>Even the title, Fury road feels wrong as no one ever feels *that* angry let along furious."

Yes there were links like it was set in post apocalyptic Australia and yes max didn't speak much... but seriously??? . Instead we have the brand name that rely's on the older generation telling the young ones how great the originals were.. Classics, cult movies. And so we get this tripe using the name of mad max to sell an action film that could just as well be called ' THE DESERT ROAD OF DEATH' and should have. Its just my opinion but as an avid fan i thought mad max 3 sold out to Hollywood and pushed it a bit... but this is a disgrace to the franchise! as an action film its OK, 6/10, nothing I've not seen before, but trying to fill such big boots makes it a dying shame and i hope they stop here. Rename this move to have nothing to do with mad max, just happens to have a star called max and it would work a lot better. You cant just tell this story because the younger generation wont know the story and wont watch the originals because they are not full of modern effects, cgi and so on and the older generation will see that Tom Hardy as good an actor as he is does not get the character right.

","At first the film starts very claustrophobic but then soon has one nice shot after the other. Yet with such a contract between dullness and unrealistic scene's make this more of a cartoonish depiction as a ""Mad max"" universe I had expected.<br/><br/>While many reviewers complain about the ""feminism universe"", the movie just displays ""a society fueled by war and sitting on resources"" with everyone a particular role from birth with a few leaders, connected by a loyalty that isn't explained or shown. With another society of women. And a loner, Max, who is yet on another vibe but comes in contact with both and path cross with a seemingly ""feeling out of place"" person in this society. In itself, the idea is well translated and reflects on some segments of our society.<br/><br/>Max his origin story in this movie is completely lost. While there is one moment you'd feel with Max, as he decides to return - you don't get a sense he ""goes out of his way"" or has anything else to do or to go to. He also constantly is bitching about ""his car"", yet he hasn't been seen in it enough to associate it into his persona.<br/><br/>Mad Max used to exist when the world went into war (Gulf War) overoil. In a world where we imagine ""clean and reusable energy"", a post apocalyptic world around cars (the original Mad Max there was shortage of oil and hence the wars. In this version, there was no such thing. The resources they DO sit on isn't showing agony- the ""people shot of suffering people"" isn't convincing and doesn't resonate or isn't displayed in a way you'd sympathize or thing that this world is suffering and it is a ""dog eat dog"" world.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is enjoyable There is an attempt to show ""the power of love"", some philosophical idea's are suggested. But it isn't followed through - and traded for the graphics while anything other as the blazing and over the top, unrealistic action-shots looks like it's filmed in the same 40 square feet... Making it rather a mockery of the classics, with a genuite vibe.<br/><br/>Go see this film for some graphical sequences, but don't go into it with much expectations. The story is lacking- many good idea's have been put it, but never worked out or followed through and traded it for claustrophobic flashing imagery and little real content.<br/><br/>I wished I hadn't spent the money."

The violence is well done and realistic if you're into that, but the world created in this film doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. All of the vehicles run perpetually, they never need refueling. The villains seem to have a lot of advanced technology yet live like beasts. The land is said to be poisoned and barren, so how have the old ladies we encounter been surviving all these years? I guess they don't need to eat, kind of like the vehicles never need a fill up. The war rig's tires are shredded and then later they are fine. Max seems to have an unlimited supply of blood. Max says that if they bring as much extra gas as they can carry on a motorcycle, they should be able to run for 160 days! Really? I know motorcycles get good mileage, but come on! Again, is this a primitive post war apocalyptic world, or do they have advanced, high mileage technology? It's all over the map. There are many more examples of such silliness. But most annoying of all is the relentless feminist subplot that is continually rammed down the viewers throat. The high rating of this film baffles some reviewers, but that where we are in this country. This is what sells."

The fact that it didn't win was no surprise; the fact that it was even nominated was a huge surprise. If you read actual user reviews, including this one, you will see that a great many people thought this movie was awful. The film's only redeeming quality was the cinematography, which I will admit was gorgeous. Beyond that, there was nothing to keep my interest. I actually purchased the movie when it became available for digital download, and I couldn't get past 1 hour mark, and I tried three different times.<br/><br/>I liked the original Mad Max movie, but it wasn't my favorite dystopian film.

There was just no way for me to suspend my disbelief enough to get into this story.

Sadly, Hardy is less than stellar in the charisma department, and his performance is ineffectual. In addition the film sidelines Max in order to showcase other characters and reduces him to an ineffectual character on the rare occasions when he is given something to do.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is Furiosa, the real star of the movie. Her performance is better but, despite a cascade of social media claims to the contrary, the idea of a warrior woman is an old and tired one even for the Mad Max franchise.<br/><br/>The film is mainly a seemingly interminable drive through the desert.

It is affirming to know that you can still go to the movies and have your expectations not only exceeded, but absolutely blown away! The film-goer needs an open mind and a willingness to mentally go to this other world. This is a world that is a horrifying depiction of a path the world may have chosen for itself. Mad Max offers both a vision of hell, but also of the divine. The divine comes in the form of a rag tag group of strangers that accept each other, quickly care about one another, and then gain strength and confidence in following a shared vision; a hope for a better world.

"sackofwhine","10","20","39","15 May 2015"," The action movie we deserved.
","Mad Max Fury Road is directed by none other than George Miller. It's the first Mad Max movie in 30 years, which replaces cult icon, Mel Gibson with uprising star Tom Hardy. It also stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. <br/><br/>You know these days, where you just want to go to a movie, have fun and at the same time be impressed by the movies quality? <br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is exactly that, just 10 times better.<br/><br/>I can't find words how to describe this movie, it's everything an action fan dreams of and wants. It's the kind of movie that only comes along every 10 years or so. It's something else, something unique. It's pure adrenaline, balls to wall, fuel kicked craziness and it's everything I want from an action movie. <br/><br/>While the movie is crazy, it is also grounded with characters that feel real and tormented by this gruesome world where survival is the number one priority. Furiousa and Max have great chemistry together and you want to learn more from their characters. Everyone in this movie does a fantastic job. Nicholas Hoult especially was very surprising as one of the War Boys, he really had fun with the role and you can see it in the movie. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple, this is not a problem because it has been established as a movie where the main goal is to capture the audience with the mesmerizing action scenes. Mad Max Fury Road is a prime example that a great movie doesn't need a complex story to be good. Gravity is also a prime example to showcase this. While the story here is simple, it fits the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>Now, the number one reason you want to watch this movie, is the visual extravaganza Miller has brought on screen. Trust me when I say this, you have never seen action scenes on the big screen like the ones in this movie. The things you see on screen are 80% practical and every time you think about that, your mouth drops even more. There is some really mind boggling stuff in the action scenes and it is all executed perfectly. Miller has created an action movie where the action is not only well made, it is also beautiful to look at. Something that other action movies almost never archive, like the previously released action blockbusters Avengers AOU and Furious 7. This movie puts both of them to shame and I wouldn't really understand why anyone would say otherwise. George Miller has done a movie so beautiful in shot composition and cinematography, one could say this movie was directed by Van Gogh. There is some abstract scenery and imagery which is wonderful to look at. Every shot in this movie feels new, vivid, exciting and is just jaw dropping at times. Miller takes full advantage of the medium and of his tools to create a movie that will be remembered in the years to come. <br/><br/>The reviews for this movie have all been amazing and they are all well deserved. Mad Max Fury Road is the kind of movie, movie fanatics love to watch. This movie shows that even big budget studio movies can be artistically powerful. Mad Max Fury Road is simply put one of the best action movies ever made. Don't miss this movie on the big screen."

If this is a great movie, then film is dead. Clearly, this is some new genre of entertainment. An art form ? I don't know... I don't think so.... More like pointless nonsense... I wanted to get up and leave but I kept hoping it would turn into a movie. The kid, Nub, was the best part of the film and he was far from fully developed.

","It's hard to believe there is such a thing as a boring action movie, but this is it. The movie is 2 hours of car crashes mixed in with a bit of fighting. There is no plot, no interest in characters, no given reason for the fighting. This could of been a great landscape if laid out and described better. I really had no idea where they were or why earth was the way it was. It was tough to choose a side and root for one over the other as neither side was properly laid out for the audience. As far as I know both sides were 'bad' and they were fighting over gas and water control. A little bit of back story would of been great, I love movies that have a distinct before and after taste to them. We really had no glimpse into the life of the villain and what made him the bad guy. He had the perfect look and voice of a villain but really didn't shine in that role very much. I was expecting something amazing and left with a bad taste in my mouth. 2 out of 5 of us fell asleep during the movie, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. One hour long car chase is enough, didn't need to see them turn around and go back for another hour!"

","Wow, just got back from seeing Mad Max: Fury Road. What an absolutely in- your-face, relentlessly action-packed flick this is! <br/><br/>I've been a fan of the original Mad Max and Road Warrior movies since they came out and let me tell you other fans of these movies: You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>The acting was excellent. The story was solid. The action was breathtaking. The characters were over the top. The cars, trucks and motorcycles were all appropriately decked out in spikes and guns. Oh and of course the obligatory bizarre contraptions and weapons for maximum damage to the enemy. Awesome! I may have to go see it again.<br/><br/>Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!"

","The Movie seems to be pretty polarizing, which i see no reason for, some make it to be the masterpiece of the century other lable it as a trainwreck.<br/><br/>I think most fitting is something in the middle, cause overall the stunts, scenery and effects were pretty nice. The movie has its strong points obviously in the action department. I think Theron did a pretty good job at portraying a tough girl in apocalyptic times and steals the show of Hardy that was somewhat lacking a chance to shine. A fine actor was wasted on a role that could have been played just as well by any 90s action movie hero ( Van Damme, Stalone, Dudikoff, Arnold)<br/><br/>My main critique will be the failed world building, i get that this is an action movie but from what i know about the other mad max movies this just doesnt cut it. You get zero information or background about anything:<br/><br/><ul><li>what about the different tribes?</li><li>what are these ghost vision Max sees, about?</li><li>where do the breeding women come from?</li><li>what is the back story of the different areas they pass through (salt flats, swamp)</li><li>who killed the world? yeah who!?</li></ul>-what about the blood transfusion and tatoos on Max' back<br/><br/>the list is so long, they could have cut some action and throw in some scene where they are just driving and tell each other something or pass on some information for the girls and the audiance. Or some old dude just narrates it ,whatever. As mentioned by many other negative reviews the whole idea to turn around came a bit sudden, and their plan is to trap the main forces and take the city, evading a fight. Instead they just run straight into them. What kind of a dumb plan is that?<br/><br/>I really love the post apocalyptic scenario, but i have yet to find a film that can fill it with life, most of the time you just get a very small glimpse at the world and what happened. Damn i want Information how the rest of the world is doing, how the whole situation came to be, how people survived and managed to build up a new society. This might be the worst movie in that regard in that genre with such a big budget."

Some scenes did seem to be inspired by the all-time great post apocalypse movie ""A Boy and His Dog."" By inspired I mean damn near plagiarized.

"invernessmovieclub","9","18","35","14 May 2015"," It not only raises the bar, it smashes it completely!
","When director George Miller created Mad Max back in 1979, he couldn't have foreseen the impact the micro-budget film would've had on the action genre. Not only did it launch Mel Gibson into an A- list star, it's gritty, post-apocalyptic style set a precedent for action movies and had a major influence on many directors for the next two decades. Two sequels arrived in the years following and then nothing. The series ended. Rumours have persisted since 2000 of another sequel but it wasn't until 2011 when the same director, Miller decided it was time to raise the bar once again and got to work on Mad Max 4. The wait has been worth it. <br/><br/>Replacing Gibson with British actor Tom Hardy, Fury Road begins with a voice over ""My name is Max, the world is fire and blood. It's harder to know who was more crazy, me or everyone else."" We then launch straight into a chase scene over the desert plains of a post- apocalyptic desert where Max is captured by a group of cannibals. Elsewhere we are introduced to Furiosa (a pumped up Charlize Theron) who has been tasked by local gang leader Immotan Joe with driving an armoured rig full of now-scarce water across land in exchange for gasoline. Instead she rebels and heads for her homeland along with freeing Max and Immortan Joe's five wives, two of which are pregnant. And then all hell breaks loose! <br/><br/>What follows is simply a breathtaking display of action cinema. From here on, Fury Road is effectively one long chase as Immortan Joe's enormous army of lunatics pursue Furiosa across the endless desert. The film slows down briefly to introduce Furiosa's relatives, but the pursuit swiftly continues. <br/><br/>The action is simply relentless as supped up cars, motorbikes, trucks and tankers crash, flip and explode as they attempt to halt the rig with stuntmen literally flying everywhere. The stunts are simply astonishing, all the more so that Miller insisted that the majority of the action be filmed practically without the reliance on CGI – how no one was killed in the making of the movie is all the more astonishing. Director Miller, now 70, is at the top of his game and handles the action brilliantly. The locations are suitably apocalyptic (filmed on location in Namibia) and suit the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>The plot itself is simple and, although you don't get much in the way of characterisation, it really doesn't matter. There are enough glimpses of Max's past to fill in the gaps for anyone who hasn't seen the original movies. Hardy is a fitting replacement for Gibson and does a fine job as Max, however the real standout is Theron – shaved head and as far from the gorgeous blonde we know so well, she plays the role of Furiosa amazingly. <br/><br/>Not only does Mad Max: Fury Road raise the bar for action movies, it smashes the bar entirely. Sit back, switch your brain off and you'll have a blast!"
"thendoking","10","21","42","15 May 2015"," Breathtaking - Mad at it's Max
","I have always loved the Mad Max franchise - and the risk is that an addition many years later could be a real flop. Not here. Fury Road is everything Mad max stands for and more - all laid upon a vast canvas with a ""rock operatic"" pulsing score. Don't get me wrong - if you don't like insatiable action - car chases and madness - they you will hate this film (My Girlfriend who has never seen a Max film didn't really think it was great). So be warned- if this is not your type of film - then the Fury Road experience will be hours of annoying sound and car crashes. For the fans of this genre - it reaches amazing new heights - with finally a director understanding that CGI is a tool that ""adds"" to the grandeur - does not replace it. Performances are solid from the entire case - and set production and makeup are just - well - Mad. If you are debating 3D or not-- I saw it in 3D and would say it adds very little -- I think IMAX would be the best experience as it is so ""vast"" as a film. If you don't have IMAX - then I would skip 3D and go to a good HD cinema with the best sound system. In a long list of franchise add ons - Miller deserves credit for bringing something even better than the original. Enjoy."

It has insane stunts, terrificly directed and choreographed action scenes, crazy, twisted and ""take you right there"" settings, solid acting, tight and very simple script, amazing / gorgeous cinematography and very good music. All these parts are combined together in not very traditional and at the same time masterfully good way. This movie feels unique. It has lots of explosions, but strangely enough, we do care and kinda feel every single of it, even if characters or bad guys were on screen for just a second. There are some truly visionary scenes in this picture, which you won't see in a big budget mainstream movies, like the one at night in burned land. The ending is terrific, with a last scene just begging for this movie to be seen again - terrific ending which sort off reminded me of ""The Dark Knigh Rises"".<br/><br/>Overall, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is incredible picture.

The music is also like an orchestra going along with the movie the whole time adds to the drama.<br/><br/>The custom vehicles in this movie are flat-out IMPRESSIVE, I guarantee you, they must have dumped some Serious cash to build them, tons of fabrication, not 3d effects or ""prop magic""...these cars look like the Real Deal.

","Mad Max Fury Road is such a movie that leaves you spellbound and dumbstruck at the same time.. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film..

There would be no better replacement of Mel Gibson than Tom Hardy.. If I have to talk about charlize theron the first thing comes in my mind is her intensity.. She is way too brilliant in this movie.. She actually overshadows the rest.. Nicholas hoult as expected , phenomenal.. And the warlord played by the same guy from the first mad max movie , terrifying character... This movie has dozens of brutal action sequences you could hardy even imagine.. There's a scene, a guy shoots fire from an electric guitar, will blow your mind.. This movie is a landmark of action film making.. Calling it an outstanding film would be an understatement.. You don't wanna miss the best movie of 2015 and perhaps the best action movie of this decade..."
"anymouse2","4","20","40","4 June 2015"," Must be a lot of people from the film bumping the numbers
","The first thing to note about the film is that ""Mad Max"" is almost a spectator in his own film. Practically everyone else gets more action and importance.<br/><br/>I realize watching a Mad Max movie for the plot is like going to a strip club for the fine dining, but.....these idjits didn't even try. We're gonna to run away, and then realize there's nowhere to run to, and then come back. Thats the whole plot of the movie.Two hours of car chase and explosions for one sentence of plot. And its a retarded sentence; the entire premise of this world is that everything is FUBAR; no water, no food, no gas, no nuthin. Not that anyone seems interested in fighting for any of these missing resources. Nope, they just want to run across the desert for 6 months, hoping to stumble across a paradise no one else has found. riiiiight :roll: <br/><br/>Then there was the standard Hollywood made up religion; atheists who cant comprehend the faithful mindset try to reproduce half-remembered stories ""but with a twist"". It fails as always, proving the lack of imagination, empathy, or even basic consideration of their fellow man that plagues the cesspool that is the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>Sure, the colors are pretty. The action is almost on par with the other Mad Max movies, made over 3 decades ago. Which just shows how little an accomplishment that is. They managed to seed the movie with endless ""inside"" jokes that anyone who's seen the first trilogy would see, but only a very select sense of humor would find ""funny""; mostly it was just sad and pathetic. I wanted to see what this movie could do, not be repeatedly reminded of how ineptly it compared to the originals.<br/><br/>To call Max and Furioso one-dimensional would be generous, and they, sadly, are the most fleshed-out characters in the whole film. Everyone else is just the make-up department being given actors and told to create freaks. *yawn* There's 3 ""reality"" shows on sci-fi where complete amateurs do a better job to win an internship.<br/><br/>Theron is continuing her trend of terrible roles that fail to use her proved abilities. The male lead (who was so irrelevant to the film that I didn't even bother to learn his name) spoke mostly in grunts. Honestly, I cared more about Nox, the ""red shirt"" sidekick than I did about Max.<br/><br/>Then there's the bunch of girls in bed sheets that we're supposed to believe is some kind of ""grrl empowerment"" according to the latest feminazi BS. Stupid pretty sluts good only for sex slaves running away while a big strong man protects them. Gee, how could I miss the ""grrl power"" message there? <br/><br/>For all the BS about ""great music"", especially guitar guy, what little I could actually hear was simplistic riffs; Jimi Hendrix it ain't. Heck, Guitar Hero on difficult, it ain't. The only really impressive part was that when the dude hit the whammy bar, it shot flames; thats on the Pyro crew, not the musician.<br/><br/>And then, worst of all, the ""Circ de Sole"" pole stunts that were supposed to be a fight scene. That was sad, lame and pathetic. And then, when you start to look into the actual physics? Braindead f&%ktards should be beaten for that bit.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that I pirated this, and I still paid more than it was worth."

","Not much of a wasteland -- as far from desolate as you can get. There was no consequence to anything -- virtually nobody ever died, or was shown to be injured -- thus, any fighting was about as exciting as watching other people playing a sport. Captain America had more gore with its vaporizing guns than this movie had after 2 hours of nonstop shooting of real guns. It felt like a Nerf war. Like the old GI Joe cartoon, where everyone magically has a parachute. Like they were glaringly going for PG13 and failed. Since there was no consequence, it was hard to care about any of the characters' motivations. Multiple occasions were clearly made to please the super-politically-correct SJW feminist crowd, further weakening the impact.<br/><br/>There was no remaining reason for me to be spectating this movie other than to look at pretty imagery and other elements of the film. I didn't care about anyone -- factions chasing Mad Max somehow had me rooting for them more than Mad Max and crew!<br/><br/>If the movie did one thing very well, it was making everything look real and not CG -- I haven't seen this level of effects realism since the 90s. If it did two things well, it didn't shy away at showing disturbing things (milking, c-section, drug spray paint, biological issues of all types (except injury)), but it bizarrely avoided death and injury altogether -- jarringly pulling me out of the movie, continuously, as mentioned above. Not even dehydration was allowed, as everyone magically survived on scraps of water.<br/><br/>This movie was not filmed in 3D and should not have been brought to 3D. The disgusting editing resulted in scenes often changing perspective several times per second, completely jarring the viewer as they have to refocus every time. It was Transformers-esque in its action. It felt like the entire movie was the climax of an action scene -- very well done if it had been 10 seconds long. Turning the climax of an action scene into an entire movie was exhausting after about 1 minute, and was torture after 5 minutes. I should have been paid $9 to sit through this crap, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Reservation withheld for 2D version, especially if uncut and extended."

If you want to watch roaring cars driving through the desert whilst assorted petrol bombs and bullets fly by, then you're going to enjoy this.

","I have to believe that the initial reviews are fake. Especially since there are so many using the same verbiage - like the word ""masterpiece"". This film is very very far from a masterpiece. In fact, I think the word garbage would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>The film opens and closes without giving a back story or any character development. I'm guessing we're supposed to remember the previous films from 30 years ago. But besides that, it is nothing more than cheesy CGI effects and over the top action (using a lot of stop motion camera work that makes it look cartoonish).<br/><br/>I once googled 'why American films have become so bad?' and the links that came up explained that because much of the film industry money is now made overseas, films have to have very little dialogue and lots of action - so that they translate to other cultures. Well this movie succeeds at that but as far as any discernible plot or concern for the characters - it fails on every level."

I am very cynical with people who have had gushing 10/10 reviews on this site. How can this film rate so highly with so many 1/10 reviews? actually the most I have ever seen. Nothing in this movie is explained due to the almost non existent dialogue from all the characters. You are meant to just guess at the visual meaning of everything. The plot did not make sense and it was just one endless car chase scenario all seemingly without any refuelling required. No one in this film required sleep or food it seems! There were many attempted throwbacks to the previous Mad Max movies but they fell flat and were soon forgotten in amongst all the meaningless violence that was slapping you in the face. I could continue on an on but many before me have already expressed similar findings so I will stop here.

One where the main character is tough, cunning, resilient and merciless to those who would try to exalt tyranny and destroy the right of freedom, but instead got a movie about a guy chained to the proverbial dog leash. Max actually was on a leash in the beginning. Other than some grunts and one or two word responses from Max this movie was focused on Charlize Theron's character which was glorified to the Max(pun firmly intended), and shown to be almost super human to the point of accomplishing stunts, acrobatics and feats of strength that a man would never be able to do let alone a woman. Max was reduced to being one step up from a caveman and clueless for the most part as to what was going on. Tom Hardy should be ashamed for taking the role.

","Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are two wonderful forces of nature, bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning. Mel Gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role, but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what Max is all about. Hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive. He has that hard look, driven, and with all of his priorities set to survival mode. He recognizes that you can't sit still here, and there is no sense in worrying if you want to live.<br/><br/>He finds himself prisoner of a set deviants/mutants that plan on killing him for sport. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before. At first, he observes everything around him, as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of. In the opening scenes, he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched Earth, with lighting storms, sand storms, wind storms, and just about anything else that can be thrown at him. He pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames, but in ""Fury Road"", this is just the beginning, and in the hands of George Miller, a man who is around 70 years old, we get what was just a promise in the previous films.<br/><br/>The universe is fully developed, with just about every hellish detail up on the screen, every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions, reactions, and powerful images from what his camera captures, a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film. As I said before, the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable, breathtaking, and utterly satisfying.<br/><br/>In this film, vehicles will burn, crash, tumble, fly, and spit fire continuously, and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release. There is power, disgust, hate, hunger, envy, and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen, even the angelic wives/prisoners are not empty shells. One can feel every emotion by letting Miller's sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration, not believing that what we have seen is possible. Here CGI doesn't overpower and sterilize the content. Many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources. Here Miller works with what he knows best, but he still uses CGI to increase the power of what one sees in this movie. Very little looks fake, and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of money.<br/><br/>Miller has given us a film that captures the magic of movie-making, the realization of its power. This is the masterpiece many dream of, where nothing and no one is spared. Every penny is showcased one way or another. There are no egos to satisfy, just goals to achieve, and these are accomplished. Miller should, like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves. Much has been made of a gimmicks recently. ""Birdman"" tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh reality,and it sorely failed. Here is film which entertains, never bores, and certainly is able to mix intelligence, the hells which some beings carry in their souls, and the possibility that a future like Max's might not be that distant. The film is not fantasy, it's the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be coming.<br/><br/>I never understood why some films had a certainly look, but they lacked vision, charm, or anything remotely intelligent, and the disappointment hurt. No one will walk away from ""Fury Road"" because Miller respects the audience, understand that unless some is ""real"" and we are able to somehow relate, the experience will be meaningless. ""Fury Road"" combines the best of acting and craftsmanship. It's pure, powerful, and it delivers a visceral punch, making the best use of everyone of our senses, giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary. Miller hasn't copied anyone, instead he has set the bar high for many, and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film, something with much imagination and power, something that is quite remarkable, considering how Hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics and/or surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies. Here is a film that proves that it's possible to dream, even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on Earth."

It did beat out Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a couple of those categories after all. So of course my first step was to IMDb it and see what the general consensus was, and I was never more... confused. The first thing I saw was a 90 Metacritic score, and the second was a B-line of 1 star ratings coupled with brutal reviews from users. Hmm... Alright. Now I never saw the original Mad Max films (shame on me, I know). Going into this movie completely blind, I just didn't get it. Yeah, lots of action right from the get go, but it took forever to even know what was going on. Post-apocalyptic world. Guy gets visions of a haunted past, gets kidnapped, OK, old guy villain with a messed up face, thousands of followers, obsessed with breeding, tyrannical, got it. That's the first 5 minutes, then characters in cars (more like dune buggies and a tank) leave, go rogue, get chased by the bad guys just mentioned, meet up with the main character through a series of events and dozens of people commence to die in the next hour and 45 minutes of the film during what seems to be just an endless car chase that winds up ending in the exact same place it started. Wait, I get it, the people that like this movie also like NASCAR. That had to be it since I fell asleep about the same amount of times during this movie as I do during a NASCAR race on the rare occasion it's actually on my TV. However, anything being discussed during all of this action between characters was just meaningless as by this point after a good amount of intense car-chasing action and explosions were just thrown in my face, I just didn't care about any of these characters. Was the action pretty sweet to watch? Actually, yes. Everything looked cool, but that's not enough. I'd say 2 maybe 3 of those 6 Oscars were actually deserved. 4/10 for good action and looking cool, ""meh"" acting, but not much else earning points. Also big points taken away for being more recognized by the Academy than Star Wars this year."

Unfortunately however it was titled ""Mad Max"" tricking fans into seeing a movie that hardly featured the so called hero of the story, (I refuse to call him the main character at this point). On the note of sexism and sexist notions for which the movie is under fire, I will say that i was slightly offended at the theme throughout the movie of ""All men are evil except a few of them who are forced into being good and all women should not trust them"" If you can't see that in the film then you are really trying to avoid it. That is not however, in my reasoning towards the low rating as i said before the producers of this film lied to me about what it was. I hope if there is a sequel, that it will actually feature the road warrior as promised. I enjoyed ""Furiosa the movie"" but please George Miller, Don't lie to us again. you may have swindled me out of my $12 dollars this time but I don't think ill trust your work again."

","I wasn't sold on the movie from the trailers but I had a couple of friends that said they loved it so I decided to give it a shot I went with an objective viewpoint that way I could give it as much credit as possible. The best part about the movie is the lack of cgi which I do give them credit for but the story line was horrible and it was not stop action. They probably could have made this really good but they feel way short on that.

","George Miller successfully manages to portray destruction and a vast wasteland in such a way as to make it appear artistically beautiful. <br/><br/>He takes the absurdity and destructiveness of mankind's post-apocalyptic behaviour, and depicts in a way that keeps not only your attention, but also keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Although there is a minimal use of dialogue in this two hour extravanganza, this helps to add to the film as opposed to leaving essential elements out of it. The lack of dialogue has been utilized as a tool to build up to colossal chase scenes with dangling men, massive explosions and crazy stunts.<br/><br/>Due to its stark nature, there is a strange beauty in the entire film, and with the few beautiful women in the film each time they make an appearance they stand out like an oasis in the desert. <br/><br/>This movie has promise to have a sequel, however - and this makes it unique in many of today's blockbusters - this movie doesn't lead intentionally into a sequel, and works brilliantly as a stand alone film.<br/><br/>It is hard to say that this film has anything wrong with it.

While I had EAGERLY anticipated ANY further Mad Max movies, once I started seeing brief trailers for this one, I had my doubts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was right. Mad Max: Fury Road is just another modern action movie that I despise. It piles the impossible and improbable on top of the illogical and expects you to still believe it. It lacks significant plot, character development, and dialog between characters. It relies solely on action, explosions, fights, and crashes to carry virtually ANY part of the story. I mentally turned off about 45 minutes into the movie. I checked my watch at 60 minutes in hopes that ""maybe they'll get realistic and give me a reason to care"". They didn't. <br/><br/>The only three aspects I did like: 1)Some of the landscape visuals ARE good, but if you've seen the Dakar Rally, it's the same and it's REAL! 2)All vehicles built for the movie should be on the car show circuit, then put into museums. They're really interesting and outrageous! 3)There were a FEW good moments and fun lines. <br/><br/>If you want to see a GREAT action movie, see any other of the Mad Max movies.

There is more holes than there are in Swiss cheese in the story line and character archs that go un-answered. Where sub-plots get started but are never understood properly or briefly touched upon but not elaborated. The film starts off interestingly with Max being captured and trying to escape but from then on its downhill, the portrayals of the characters were the most pleasing part of the film but thats as far as my compliments get for Mad Max.<br/><br/>Yet again the the 3D is pointless as it adds as much to the film as mustard does to a cup of tea, with every so often a grenade or a random guitar comes flying at you. <br/><br/>So, this is a film if you like just explosions and a very long car chase.

I loved the cinematography, there is a scene where the characters are driving toward a gigantic sandstorm and it is so beautiful. The actions scenes are basically unparalleled, the costume design and sound is amazing. From my knowledge this film is a continuation of the previous 3 films, and the fact that this both continues on that but also opens it up completely to new audiences is amazing. I absolutely loved this movie, I especially loved the colour pallet changes, at day time the desert is orange tinted and you can almost feel how incredibly dry and terrible it is. However at night the movie turns to a dark blue, showing the beauty that exists in it. I loved this film, I don't really know what else to say. It's a movie you can either watch and look for the hidden meaning, or you can just turn your brain off.

"estebangonzalez10","9","17","34","16 May 2015"," George Miller is back and his vision couldn't have been realized better. An action packed heart pounding film
","""As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... Or everyone else.""<br/><br/>To describe George Miller's fourth post-apocalyptic Mad Max film as crazy would be an understatement because it is one of those rare over the top and unique action films that keeps you at the edge of your seat during its entire runtime with fantastic car chases and inventive fighting scenes that feel like a breath of fresh air in an era dominated by CGI effects. The visuals absolutely stun you and Miller's amazing vision of this apocalyptic wasteland is beautifully captured through the camera. It may have taken 30 years for this sequel to be released, but it is a huge improvement over Beyond Thunderdome and it manages to build on what The Road Warrior had achieved by introducing a much more chaotic world and colorful characters. Fury Road works both ways as either a sequel or a reboot, and it erases most of the problems I had with Max's character in the previous film. This is a return to what Miller had done in The Road Warrior, but with a much higher budget to work with and that allowed his vision to be fully fulfilled here. Three more Mad Max films are already in the talks and I can't wait to embark with Max on his next adventures. This is going to be a very difficult film to top and so far it's the best 2015 has to offer.<br/><br/>In Fury Road, Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson for the lead role of Max, a wondering warrior who's still coping with the loss of his wife and son as he travels through the post-apocalyptic deserted wasteland. The film begins with a group of bandits chasing Max who eventually capture him and take him to The Citadel, where a ruthless leader named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) controls the water supply for the masses that have gathered below the heights of the mountain where he is based. Joe doesn't just control the water supply, he also has a large army of War Boys who he has trained to sacrifice themselves willingly for his service, farming women who breed their breast milk, and even several beautiful wives to give him children. Joe has created quite an empire, and Max has been enslaved to serve as a blood donor for the injured War Boys. We are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as Joe sends his trusted lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to Gasland. However, she decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed. She is helping some of Joe's wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands. When Joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the War Boys who is using Max as his personal blood bag. Nux chains Max to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues. For the next two hours Fury Road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences' blood pumping. <br/><br/>I've praised Miller's vision and his direction, as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted, but it wouldn't do this film justice if the cast didn't receive its share of praise as well. It isn't easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like Mad Max, but Tom Hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter. As much as I like Mel Gibson, I have to give Hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance. He is one of my favorite actors working today. It was also great to see Hugh Keays-Byrne back in a Mad Max film playing a different character this time, but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of Joe. Nicholas Hoult was also a pleasant surprise, but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was Charlize Theron's Furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone. Theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kick-ass action star. It helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress. The look of the film is also breathtaking, and the way that Miller envisions this world is simply fantastic. The cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials you'd collect in the wasteland. Everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes don't disappoint one bit. You will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll. Fury Road is the best film of the franchise. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","You know how you go to any amusement park and there's always that really cool stunt show? It could be Waterworld at Universal Studios or the Indiana Jones stunt show at Hollywood Studios (Disney World), any of those. There's a short little story (loosely based on a deeper film plot), a good guy and a bad guy both after something, they do some choreographed fighting, they jump onto specially-made contraptions, some areas are rigged with pyrotechnics and water splashes, people are running all over set, maybe even cars are spinning around and chasing each other. For 10-20 minutes, it's a cool live show and a great opportunity to take a break from the long lines and the rides at the amusement park.<br/><br/>Now imagine George Miller decided he wanted to film one of these shows, edit his footage with some colorful touch-ups, and compile two hours-worth of said footage into a film. That is Mad Max: Fury Road.<br/><br/>I decided to write this review after actually watching the first Mad Max and The Road Warrior so I can understand the backstory of Mad Max. My initial opinion of Fury Road still stands. I really tried to like this film after seeing all of the critics' and fans' reviews. I watched the film twice to see if I was maybe tired the first time. I still felt nothing.<br/><br/>I agree that the action is quite something. All of the stunts feel real and non-CGI, which is particularly rare for films nowadays. But so what? As real as it was, the action felt drivel, repetitive, and boring. I particularly LOVE action films, but this action did not do it for me. Even with the high speed chases (that lasted the entire film), the decked-out cars, the flame-throwing guitars, the explosions, I didn't feel the adrenaline kick in as I had hoped, nor did I ever feel I was viewing a spectacle. There were some action sequences I felt were interesting, such as the chained fight, but they only lasted a few minutes out of the entire film and were mild at best.<br/><br/>It had everything, so what was the problem? What the film lacked was directing. The camera-work and direction don't do anything to help place the audience into the action, to feel it. All I get are either 1. Overhead crane shots that show how large the groups are and what surrounding action is taking place, 2. Long shots to emphasize distance, and 3. Close shots to show what's going on. The camera is only documenting the stunt show that is this film. At times where the film takes a short pause in action and progresses its ""story,"" Miller attempts to develop some emotional depth in the story, but in the end it only comes off as trying too hard to appear deep and emotional. The character development was not there to help the audience understand the emotional moments.<br/><br/>For my personal tastes, I didn't find the film's theme or look appealing nor unappealing. It didn't click with me. The cinematography was beautiful and emphasized the contrast in a beautiful, naturalistic, post-apocalyptic world. But the costume and prop design I didn't get and at times found it bizarre and gross, and oftentimes flat-out ridiculous. Minimal leather gear in the desert? Mothers basically wearing bikinis and makeup? I didn't get it.<br/><br/>Overall, don't expect any plot or character development in this film. While this IS a sequel and thus does not require deep character development, the original Mad Max series didn't have much depth and development in them in the first place. That said, you can start off with Fury Road and figure out what Max's (minimal) backstory is from there. The action is real and unique, and, yeah, it's cool to watch live for 20 minutes at an amusement park. But two hours? No thanks."

I was horribly disappointed. For a while, I thought it might be a reasonable 'take off' of an action movie with it's ridiculous script and bizarre attempts at humour, but to no avail.

","Spoiler alert!!! Mad Max Fury Road this movie is among the worst movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot! I am so surprised about the rating this move received both from critics and from people who, as I, went to see it in cinemas. I remember the movies with good ol' Mel Gibson, and the era they were made in. The story is that some lone ranger, who lost his family, gets caught by some far out cavemen gangs members with a strange leader. Then we have another 3 gangs or whatever we should call the. Our hero is caught and tries to escape and is caught again. He is then made into a blood bag and by some coincidence drawn into a chase as a mobile blood bag. The chase is all about catching ( and possibly killing) Charlize and her followers, who is birth machines of the leader. The chase is better than the catch ( Möterhead) is not true when it comes to this movie. Max is teaming up with Charlize and they try to escape all of the gangs, and eventually meets up with one-armed Charlizes old gang ( or should we call them a tribe). The destination of their escape has turned from green meadows into some wasteland and Charlize cries. They now team up with the old tribe of Charlize and drive back to the evil gang/ tribes HQ to gain control of the evil dictators tribe / gang and give freedom to all.<br/><br/>For the love of God- The story, the plot and the actors are all in all an insult to every human beings intellect. There is absolutely no reason to spend 2 hours watching this pile of doo-doo. Not even the action sequences or the effects makes any positive impression whatsoever. I watched it with my oldest son ( don't tell anyone he's 12 years old), and he likes stuff such as Grown-ups 1 and 2, Insurgent, Divergent, Hunger Games, even Bolt and is basically very easy to entertain through movies, and he likes a large variety of genres. He looked at me a couple of times, and once he asked me "" Why are they spraying silver lack/ paint on their mouth?!"" I couldn't come up with any other reply besides "" well, they have to do something!"". He did ask me some questions once in a while during the movie, but when we were done watching it, he said to me that this was by far the most horrible movie he has ever seen and he is 12! I concurred<br/><br/>I remember the cows that delivers milk for the tribe cows being rather voluptuous women I remember spraying silver lack / paint in their mouth before going on a suicide mission, I remember wasting 2 hours of my life. I will recommend everybody to spend 2 hours doing something completely different – either seeing another movie or simply starring out the window this is 2 hours you will never get back again!"

The cinematography is also great, but THAT'S IT.<br/><br/>This is one of the most overrated action films that I've seen in years, this will never stand the test of time like the ones mentioned before, it will be forgotten years later."
"madmax3","1","19","39","7 July 2015"," If you're a fan of the original trilogy, this movie is not for you.
","to be honest, i grew up on the original trilogy, and i love it to this day. when i heard that a new mad max is in the making i was really ecstatic about it. but when i heard that Mel Gibson won't be max, well, after waiting for so many years for a forth movie, i was extremely disappointed to say the least. and it got even worst when i heard that the lead went to a limited ""actor"" ( i am using the word ""actor"" in the most loose way i can here) who lack charisma, and ability to lead a movie like hardy, especially when you consider the budget of this film, they could have gotten a real star to play the part (russell crowe? hugh jackman anyone??).The rest of the cast didn't add any optimism (Charlize ""I'll make you movie as long as your check clears"" Theron, Zoë ""My mom and dad fixed my career"" Kravitz, the list goes on),i was really not looking for this movie to come out. yet i decided to watch it with a non biased opinion. so, this movie didn't really need a ""first degree"" actors, mainly because the acting, characters, and story line comes second to the visual effects. If Gibson was here, it wouldn't make a difference. so if you like the 3D movies, this one is for you, however, if you expected to see a continuation to thunderdome, well bad luck buddy. this movie was made as a re-boot to attract new audience, and not for the old ones. in road warrior and thunderdome, you got a pattern: the movie starts, give you a good build up, that leads to the chase at the end. it seems that in this one miller told himself:"" wait a sec! why wait the entire movie for a chase? lets just start the movie with a chase, and forget the rest!"". and thats how it goes, 5 minutes into the movie, the chase starts, and only ends 2 minutes before the credits. if you've watched road warrior and thunderdome enough times, you would see a lot, and i mean a lot of scenes from these two movies that looked like they were copied and paste over and over again (such as the famous truck crash to the vehicle in front, and so on). the story is also a big mash, mainly from thunderdome (instead of tomorrow morrow land, here they are going to that green place). and as for max? well he doesn't say much. he is supposed to be insane (thats what they tell us at least) but mainly he acts like a person that suffers from some degree of retardedness. even in the fighting scene he doesn't do much. mainly runs, but nothing more. the real stars of this movie are the vehicles and the effects. so if you are a fan of the transformers movies, this one would be right up your ally. however if you are a fan of the original trilogy, you wont get much from this movie. It adds nothing to the original trilogy story. Its just an average action movie for our time with little to no story, and lots of shiny lights. the fact that even if they would have change the entire cast, it wouldn't have made any different, pretty much explains itself. but oh well, for us true fans, we'll always have mad max 1 to 3."
"gurlypowa","5","19","39","30 May 2015"," 8.7?? first time i've disagreed with other users.
","well this is coming from a girl who loves playing games like Resident Evil, Call of Duty, and Dead Space so i wouldn't consider myself a girly girl. The movie reminded me a lot of Ghosts of Mars, and Death Race, both of which i liked marginally better. The guitar guy needed to be the first one to die because he was giving me a headache. the plot could be summed up in one sentence. (i wont give spoilers). I love action movies... but this movie had maybe 3 minutes of hand to hand combat (this scene wasn't even very good), and the rest was a car chase. ONE LONG CAR CHASE. at least Furious 7 had nice looking cars! these cars were dirty and ugly, which pretty much describes the every character and costume in the movie. The scenery wasn't pretty either... just wasteland. If I'm going to watch something with no plot it needs to be pretty mind blowing otherwise. The action in it wasn't even intense.. just lots of vehicles blowing up. Like throwing exploding spears into adjacent vehicles. I was bored of exploding vehicles 15min into the action. No real INTENSE moments (remember Furious 7 when Paul Walker was hanging out of the back of a truck that was hanging off a cliff and he had to run up and jump onto Letti's car?THAT WAS INTENSE!)the main character Max had maybe 50 words for the whole movie. there were also a lot of ""eew gross"" moments which were pretty unnecessary.. (like the mothers milk... what the heck was that all about). Hubby didn't like the movie either and this is a guy who thinks Mortal Kombat, Heavy Metal and the Rocky Horror Picture Show are the best movies ever made. I usually go by IMDb user ratings when i go watch a show and this is the first time I've disagreed with the rest of the users. for a movie to get over 8/10 it has to be captivating to virtually all viewers (eg Lord of the Rings Trilogy). We went as a group of 2 males and 2 females and none of us liked it."
"houa_x","2","19","39","27 May 2015"," Lots of action but thin plot
","The movie had lots of action with cars/motorcycles etc, but had a really loose plot and little character development. This made the movie quite boring to watch as I fell asleep and zoned out a couple of times. Generally, it was a disappointing movie and not enjoyable at all as there really wasn't anything special about the movie. The ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic in my point of view but at least the acting in general was okay. I definitely do not recommend anyone to watch the movie in theater unless you want to hear 2 hrs of loud motors and electric guitars. Although, the movie might be better for those who have watched the Mad Max franchise. Unfortunately, as a member of generation Y I have not seen the franchise."
"radamanthe","1","16","32","13 January 2016"," Garbage...
","If one expects that this movie is worth seeing after the praise heaped upon it by critics, sorry but try something else. The plot is silly, the characters are paper-thin and the premise ludicrous. The main actors don't even have to act, as the only thing they do during most of the time is grunt. I understand that one of the reasons this joke of a film has gained support is because it allegedly presents a feminist angle to a traditionally masculine franchise, i guess the definition of feminism for the director and writers of this atrocity is some scantily-clad and extremely beautiful women being saved by a female g.i Joe. The whole movie has the aesthetics of a music video with many explosions, motorcycle stunts and the aforementioned scantily-clad women, which shows that its main target audience are idiots with short attention spans and voyeurs."

","This movie was bad because nothing happens except a chase in a desert, where there is nothing to look at. For some reason this one arm chick decided to steal this crazy leader's wives(aka breeders)and is chased in the desert. And for some reason most of the crazy leader's followers are pasty white and bald. Why they don't have a tan in a desert? I don't know.<br/><br/>Any way, this guy is tied to the front of a truck chasing the one arm chick and when all vehicles explode he lives and after fighting with the chicks, decided to ride with them. They're searching for a green area which doesn't exist so they go back from where they escaped. And during all this, you just have crazy people chasing them and vehicles exploding but there always seems to be more.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Just a bad movie. Save your brain cells and skip it."

","What do you get when you cross the undeserved and awkward haughtiness of Katherine Heigl with the laughable seriousness with which Natalie Portman conducts herself?<br/><br/>Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>Why do people keep reinforcing this stupid delusion Charlize Theron has that she's tough? 15 shots in a row of her giving a stern look to the camera followed by an ironic pan-out to demonstrate the character wasn't actually aware of a camera and was just looking in a mirror isn't good film-making; it's laughable.<br/><br/>Bad music video laughable.<br/><br/>I seriously want to know what demographic keeps Charlize's action career going. Watching another one of these ego-boosting PR shoots is almost as painful as sitting through anything with Scarlett Johansson, but at least Charlize can act when she's not casting herself as another fierce, fresh, fearsome heroine du jour.<br/><br/>Actually, I have another f-word to describe Charlize's action-movie career: f****** awful.<br/><br/>It takes more than a sh***y robot-arm and a disgusting boy-hair- style shaved head to look like a badass. Fight the patriarchy on your own time, Charlize; don't waste mine.<br/><br/>In any case, something must be totally lost in translation between Hollywood and normal people these days; everything is so imbued with fugly stoners, nerdy super-hero crap, or androgynous hipster fantasy that I don't find anything believable."
"thecrowing33","10","16","32","13 June 2015"," Crazy fun with a modern message
","In a world of reboots and sequels, Mad Max: Fury Road embodies the bold and creative vision that many strive for.<br/><br/>When first hearing about this film, I was all in. I'm a huge fan of Tom Hardy, and the first trailer sold me on a franchise I hadn't known existed prior to this film. However, this wasn't the case for a couple of moviegoers that I had a brief exchange with. The older gentlemen had arrived early to be the first in line for the film, and what they said intrigued me quite a bit.<br/><br/>""I've been waiting for this film for 30 years.""<br/><br/>That's crazy! It has been 30 years since the release of the last Mad Max film, and I can only imagine the excitement of having a favorite movie from three decades ago brought back and re- envisioned for contemporary audiences. In any case, all fans, young and old, are in for one exciting thrill ride that verges on insanity.<br/><br/>The film opens with the initial capture of Max, a wanderer who is running from a dark past. He is taken to the Citadel and is used as a ""blood bag"" because of his universal donor status. Meanwhile, Furiosa, a servant to the evil Immortan Joe, plans a daring escape and helps the wives of Immortan Joe along the way. Upon hearing of this, Immortan Joe calls for his horde of followers to hunt down Furiosa and return his ""property."" The remainder of the film follows the over-the-top car chases and battles between Furiosa, her fellow slaves, and the accompanying Max.<br/><br/>George Miller, the director of the film, has been in production for this film for the last 25 years and has been shooting it for the past three years. Because the film has received so much attention, the cinematic experience audiences are in for is nothing short of spectacular. The cinematography alone is a beautiful and larger-than-life seasoning to the already intense action sequences. Speaking of the action sequences, can we talk about them? Miller is a creative genius, and it shows in these extremely lethal cars and rigs. Fury Road's car chases feature innovative weapons and over-the-top pyrotechnics. I mean, how can it get any better than a guitar that also serves as a flamethrower?<br/><br/>Setting aside the grandiose action scenes, Fury Road also impresses with its talented cast of actors.<br/><br/>Though Tom Hardy is most known for being a serious and frightening presence, his portrayal of the insane Max Rockatansky is not only scary good but funny, at times. Audiences will be thoroughly satisfied with the balance of breathtaking action sequences and brief moments of laughter. While Tom Hardy comes off as the main character in the trailers, he shares quite a bit of screen time with other actors. Charlize Theron, his co-star, does a beautiful job of capturing the complex layers of her character, Furiosa. This is also seen in the film's hints of feminism.<br/><br/>Though, I use the word ""feminism"" apprehensively, because I can't think of another word for it. Mad Max: Fury Road clearly wants to say something about the misogynistic clichés present in many movies and it attempts to flip those clichés on their head. For instance, one scene finds Max having a hard time hitting his distant target and only has one bullet left. In a major role-reversal, Furiosa approaches him from behind, grabs the gun, and finishes the job that Max couldn't. And the obvious example of misogynistic attitudes is found in Immortan Joe's feelings toward is wives. He constantly refers to them as his ""property"" and treats them as such. The women retaliate by fleeing with Furiosa in the beginning and write on the wall, ""We are not things!""<br/><br/>Parents should be wary about taking your young children and teens to this film. Though the R Rating may say it all, the film also features brief nudity, exposing clothing, and disturbing images, such as gruesome deaths of people and even an infant.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Mad Max: Fury Road exceeds expectations and will prove to be one of the best films of 2015. Fury Road combines the adrenaline high of Furious 7 with the impactive action of Captain America: The Winter Soldier; need I say more?"

","Mad Max: Fury Road makes every other action movie made in the 20th Century look amateurish in comparison. There was a jaw dropping moment at least every three minutes. The pace was utterly relentless and the level of invention topped anything since Avatar. It's a masterpiece of the genre that Kennedy himself created 35 years ago with The Road Warrior, the post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller.This is quite an accomplishment for a film with a powerful feminist driving force. Indeed, Miller may have created an entirely new genre: the post- apocalyptic sci-fi feminist thriller, although the term ""thriller"" doesn't really do this film justice. Maybe enthraller? Amazer?"

I am simply AMAZED at the masterpiece that is Mad Max: Fury Road.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer I gotta say I was quite excited, it looked like a relatively enjoyable post apocalyptic movie. And it had Tom Hardy in it, which was great, no complaints there. In no way was I prepared for it, though. Every scene was action packed, exploding chaos, and to sum it up it was pure brilliance. And the strong female characters portrayed in it are wonderful and it's very refreshing to see that in an action movie.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone, even if action movies/ post apocalyptic movies/ thriller movies aren't your thing, I still recommend it. I'm going to have to go see it at the very least, 5 more times.<br/><br/>If I could give it a higher rating then I would, but unfortunately I can't so 10/10 (but really should be 20/10, that's how good it is.)"

Goes down straight to business. Directing from George Miller was a work of art..Other action directors should take note. The cast and production were sublime. Tom Hardy was superb...again in a movie where he was given limited script, he shined with his ability to act without having to speak too much. I assure you he will be one of the greatest actors if not the greatest by the end of his career..such a versatile actor..Now people say Furiosa was the main character in the movie..It probably was a little more of her story but i felt the 2 characters were equally important and given their fair share of time on the screen.

I personally can't see 3D and I saw this movie on cable. The amount of stuff flying at you in this movie really took me out of the viewing experience. Seriously, everything was just coming at you (not in 3D, just on the screen), to the point where I kept saying to myself ""This sequence was shot just to be shown in 3D, there is no other point."" There is almost no plot or character development at all. It's all action, not substance. After a while it's like eating too much sugar, you just get sick of it. I was bored and annoyed the whole time. If I saw it in 3D and in the theater, I may have loved it, but honestly the true test of an actual movie is if you take those away, does it hold up, and sadly, I can say, this does not."

The acting isn't great, especially for Theron who usually is a great actress, perhaps the insipidity of her role discouraged her? So, there is blood, no scenario or story, driving, killing and voilà.

The mindless driving is all that there is.<br/><br/>WARNING: I'm spoiling the whole movie now! Mad Max: Fury Road lasts exactly 120 minutes, but it could have lasted as well 60 minutes, because the other half of the movie is an exact copy of the first half, only backwards.

The action scenes(whole movie)is amazing. I thought it would get dull to see always the same type of scenes, which were cars exploding. But it was so well organized and beautiful that you can only get amazed by then, never tired. The cars were crazy and awesome. The movie brings finally a great female character, which many do not try. Actually this brings me to my final point, and the only point I did not like. Mad Max(Tom Hardy) was definitely overshadowed by Furiosa(Charlize Theron). I am a big fan of Tom Hardy and I think that he was perfect for the character. Although I think that he did not give his best in this job, there was a lack of ""madness"" on him. I cannot blame only him for this, as it was impossible not to be overshadowed by Charlize Theron there. To sum up, the movie is an instant classic action movie, with amazing but a simple plot and great supporting actors and actress. I had to hold my self not to applaud the movie at the end and look stupid."

","I first saw this movie while at my boyfriend's grandparents house and since I didn't have the authority to simply get up and change the channel I had to suffer through this whole entire movie, and let me tell you, I suffered. Personally, I don't enjoy the genre of action movies as a whole for the most part. The whole car chase, explosions, and demolition concept gets very old, very fast. However, for this movie, that is literally all that happened. It was one gigantic car chase with no reasoning behind it, no character development, no plot, absolutely nothing. I can appreciate that these effects were somewhat hard to create, and I give props to the editors, but this was just overall absolutely horrendous. Sitting down for over an hour to watch this made me feel as if I had lost over half of my brain cells, and may as well have fallen over and started oozing out of my mouth by the time it was finished. Unless you're a person obsessed with watching stuff blow up, or someone who can somehow suffer through this movie even without any plot whatsoever, definitely skip this one; I promise, you will not be missing out on much of anything."

Filmed around beautiful desert landscapes with snapshots carefully planned by graphic designers. Feels like flipping a comics for teenagers or watching someone playing first person shooter or racing video game. As usual on IMDb the current high rating is due to flow of fans of the earlier movies (who would probably be disappointed), comics or games. I wouldn't recommend it to any serious SciFi lover. To fill the needed 10 lines: The only thing that is worth praise is the stunt team, some motorbike shots are excellent.

Usually, the actors make wonderful choices (Theron and Hardy) in roles but even they couldn't safe this one. I will say that a positive is the redemptive value women are afforded in this movie.

If the blood bag is so important, who put him in front of the fighter vehicle, which is the most vulnerable place? In addition, there is a guy playing guitar in the battlefield, which is ridiculous. And spraying the mouth with silver paint is just weird. Actually, the whole film is so ridiculous beyond description. I didn't like it at all."

","I don't know what I find more shocking - just how bad 'Fury Road' is, or the fact that it has an average rating of 8.1 on IMDb. If you want to spend two hours watching back to back action sequences, explosions and car chases without really caring for any sort of story or plot, then this is just for you.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like the other 'Mad Max' films, but I would watch any of them again over this. Literally NOTHING of significance happens during the entire duration of 'Fury Road'. Nothing. This is easily one of the most boring, pointless films I've ever seen in my life, and one of my least favourite. It has no redeeming qualities at all. Not one.<br/><br/>Unless you want to stare at repetitive action sequences and have you ear drums ruined by persistent noise for two hours, I suggest you avoid this pathetic excuse of a movie."

","If you're a fan of pure non-stop action flickers then you'd probably enjoy this one! It only comes up to breath a few times throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>It is a god awful film due to the incredibly thin storyline. I had no emotional attachment to ANY of the characters, and wasn't fully clued into what was actually happening to be honest with you. <br/><br/>To give it some credit, 90% of the stunts were genuine and the lack of CGI made the visuals, at times fairly impressive. Action junkies will enjoy the vast amount of explosions, enough there to entertain a 10 year old me for sure. <br/><br/>Granted, I haven't seen the previous Mad Max movies and it wasn't a remake, it was following the previous storyline. But I'm guessing for at least a few of the people that haven't watched the prequel it was a bit like watching a sequel to a movie you've never seen. (Not having a clue what is happening)<br/><br/>Overall, it was a very poor film. Easy to see why it did well in visuals, sound and wardrobe but also just as easy to see why it wasn't nominated for best picture."

","The first Mad Max had a few strong attractions. It was overtly Australian in a few dimensions which hit a niche of the familiar exotic. It was pure science fiction in that it abstracted our world into a future where only the tiniest fragment of what we know was carried over and amplified. That fragment revolved around one of our most peculiar social constructions, the wild motorcycle gang. It is peculiar in being largely a cinematic invention. (Paris being romantic is another.)<br/><br/>The notion of a motorcycle gang originated in California after WWII where returning GIs (mostly tattooed navy men who had served in the South Pacific) bought surplus army motorcycles. The notion of lawlessness unique to motorcycles is from Marlon Brando as copied by Sonny Barger. It is a wholly cinematic convention made real, like movie gangster talk as adopted by the Mafia. Mad Max joined this to an equally unique cinematic convention: the chase. <br/><br/>Now this. After decades, it is still the most pure of science fiction abstractions. It is still overly Australian, more about that in a moment. It still takes the chase very seriously. But it now employs a reverse irony on the motorcycle gang trope, moving it into Fast and Furious car territory, merged with comic heavy metal and pushed into humor. The trick with these is to exaggerate enough to make us laugh but not so much that we don't engage with it in its terms. <br/><br/>Among the Australian notions is a new one: architectural dust. Most of the stunts were practical, but all of the environments were artificial. This is the first time I know that a big film used the same effects shop (Melbourne-based Iloura) for both composites (the deserts and cliffs) and dust. Different technologies are required, but a similar notion of texture was used, and the two are combined in the dust storm near the beginning. <br/><br/>The result is an astonishing effect of surface become air. The cinematographer seems to have been aboard in the way he overexposes and undersaturates, especially during the 'night' scenes. I don't know of any other film save Derzu Uzala that attempts this, and all Kurosawa had was snow.<br/><br/>I hope other Australian productions adopt this technique, as it seems both very advanced cinematically and wholly Australian. When Michael Jackson advanced the art of using a spatial camera, we did see that become common very quickly, first through Hollywood's use of WETA, and then other shops.<br/><br/>And we did see the world quickly copy the motorcycle gang trope."

","Mad max is the most insane, yet perfectly executed movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is an add on to Goerge Millers Mad Max franchise. Goerge Miller also directed this film, and gave us one of the most insane, yet perfect movies...ever. The entire length of the film your eyes are glued to the screen, and your jaw is glued to the floor. The action sequences are brilliant, and over the top. This movie is practically all one action sequence. There isn't much plot, but there isn't a need for one. The action sequences are executed perfectly. The special affects were not only spectacular but also moving. Every angle, the atmosphere, the car chases, and then there is the storm. During a car chase a giant dust storm appears,and the action continues inside the storm. Lightning, explosions, and slow motion kills, make this one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie. <br/><br/>The characters are all awesome, and the acting is great. The nemesis is terrifying, and so are all the characters chasing after max. The soundtrack helped give the movie a dark and at the edge of your seat feel. <br/><br/>This movie is truly a milestone to the action film genre. The movie is a masterpiece. It is dark yet beautiful at the same time. Every other action movie pales in comparison to this film. This movie raises the bar for action films to come.

","Wow!!! Now that's a movie worthy of all the hype, a non stop roller coaster ride with no brakes. From the sounds, the visuals, the stunts, the costumes, the cars, the girls, Darth Vader's brother and finally to our two protagonists, everything just perfectly casted. Charlize casted as Imperator Furiosa was brilliant, I can't think of any other actress who could have played her part so vigorously and with so much passion she truly stole this film away from Max who wasn't shy to give away his last bullet. <br/><br/>Coming to Max who is played by a rising Tom Hardy, is a man seeking to survive in world that has lost all law and order, something once upon a time he was very familiar with, now just wandering the desert seeking to survive while being haunted by ghosts of his past is quickly thrown into chaos. Later Max must choose whether to ride off into the dessert sunset or like his co-partner Furiosa seek redemption. <br/><br/>Some people have discredited the film for a lack of character development and dialog, but when you having a horde of maniac destruction derby fanatics hunting you down the last thing you are going to do is stop for a break, sip down on some mother's milk while discussing your life story....yeah I wouldn't either. In terms of the film being too feminist who cares!!!

","Hugely disappointed. So Mad Max loses his car two minutes into the movie, and spends almost the rest of the movie driving around the wasteland inside or on top of a tanker with a bunch of supermodels with the lead lady looking like a boy, escaping from a bunch of morons, with the main freak looking like the predator from that Arnold movie?<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah... the effects are good - lots of CGI explosions and havoc - like in a Michael Bay movie, but since there's no real story here and Tom Hardy hardly utters a word throughout the movie, I am left to wonder:<br/><br/>How the .... did this get 8,5 rating on IMDb?<br/><br/>This movie suffers from really, really sloppy storytelling. We know that Max has a backstory because of his flashbacks, and that those flashbacks are a cause of his inner pain. But they are never explained. Who was the little girl that he keeps seeing in his dreams? And where did all the old women on bikes suddenly come from? We never get to learn about anyone in this roadkill, besides the Furiosa women.<br/><br/>Buuuh!"

This man has recaptured the magic of Mad Max and given us an updated version of the story that topples all of its predecessors. The fact that most of the action was filmed using practical effects just blows my mind even further! How?!?!<br/><br/>Charlize Theron dominates her role as Furiosa. This is truly her movie, and she is amazing in it. But hey, the Max is back. Tom Hardy is perfect has the road warrior, dealing with horrors from his past and being dragged along for an insane car chase through the middle of a post apocalyptic wasteland. These two have great chemistry and work well off of one another.<br/><br/>The overall scope of this film is just incredible. While it seems like an empty, hallow world, there are so many regions and places you can travel. The world George Miller created is nasty, gritty, and just plain disgusting at times. I was so sucked in to the world and all the characters involved with it. I can't wait for more of these. I just wanna go back.<br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max Fury Road is a breathtaking experience, filled with amazing action sequences and some of the best looking visual effects I have ever seen.

When Nux is the character with the most development, that should really speak about the movie. Max himself could have been left out of this whole movie and it would not have made a difference.

"C22Man","3","12","23","1 March 2016"," Loud and Weird for the sake of being Loud and Weird
","Seriously, what happened? Mad Max and The Road Warrior were gritty, uncompromising, atmospheric and above all character driven. They deserve their status as classic post-apocalyptic films. Fast-forward 30 odd years where we have Mad Max: Fury Road, minus Mel Gibson but George Miller still in the directors chair, and it is impossible to recognise that this is meant to be linked to the earlier films. Its a film that is about as subtle as a jackhammer to the head.<br/><br/>This is the story: Max and a load of women drive for days in one direction to escape a dictator who pursues them, then they turn around to drive back to where they came from. That is literally it. To say the film is thin on story would be a gross understatement. Not just that but the whole plot is a device in and of itself. They're making the journey to escape Immortal Joe and to reach Paradise, except it turns out that there is no such thing as Paradise anymore. They are in a post-apocalyptic world for heavens sake, I think its obvious that anywhere even remotely pleasant would have been long gone. To add to the insult Max is absolutely redundant in this film, for one I'm amazed he agreed to such an absurd idea to begin with (he's mad not stupid) and two its not his film. You could take him out, replace him with another girl and it would make virtually no difference to anything that happens. The characters are just weak as we learn nothing about any of them beyond a very simple motivation which is all we get, why should we care about any of these one-dimensional cardboard cutouts? <br/><br/>The action can be summed up in one word, Overkill. There is a reason that not many people try to make films that are literally 2 hours of action scenes, because it will eventually get tedious and boring, which is exactly what happens here. On about the third time the truck is attacked I completely lost interest because I knew none of the major players were going to be killed. For action to work you need to feel like the characters really are at threat and will lose something, which I never felt and as a result it simply didn't work. By the halfway mark I was seriously weary, because the action sequences just kept banging on. There are hardly any slow or character building moments, with those that appear literally lasting a minute before quickly moving on to more explosions and cars being flipped over. Most of the sequences being practical effects is impressive, but its nowhere near enough to use it to praise the film to death like so many have. <br/><br/>As stated, you'd be totally wrong if you thought we were going to get strong and interesting characters to make up for the other areas. Everyone said Charlize Theron gave a great performance, but I saw no evidence of that because she resembled an oak tree more often then not. All she did was brood or look angry, wow that's difficult to do. She handled the more emotional moments, if you would even go as far as to call them that, horribly and with an expression of total boredom. Tom Hardy (who is usually solid as a rock) is a horrid choice as Max. His expression never changes from confused neanderthal and he delivers the dialogue as if he'd just been kicked in the head by a mule. Not to mention he suffers badly from 'Russell Crowe in Robin Hood Syndrome' as his accent constantly swings from Good Day Bruce Aussie to vaguely Cockney to just incoherent mumbling. Everyone else is barely worth the mention. The girls who travel with them? Not one stood out or had any character beyond angry. Immortal Joe? Dull as dishwater. Even Nicholas Hoult is wasted as an extremely annoying rebel.<br/><br/>Visually the film is very creative and looks unique which is probably its best feature, the world created is colourful and grimy exactly when it needs to be. That said I don't think the directing is anything out of the box, its simply not as frenzied as other recent action films (looking at you Michael Bay) and some of the CGI is ropey when it pops up. The are also a few surprisingly funny moments (notably the fella with the flare) which are a welcomed release from most of the straight-faced nonsense taking place. I do think the film is too weird basically just to be weird. I mean Immortal Joe's gang have a guitarist whose guitar shoots fire, sure it looks cool but it makes no sense. Yes its a strange world, but does it have to be an impractical one too? <br/><br/>I'm really not sure why Fury Road is getting so much acclaim. Is it because it used practical effects in a time dominated by CGI? I actually think it is. Simply because it has nothing else going for it. The story? My last trip to the toilet had more of a plot. The characters? Calling them planks of wood would be an insult to planks of wood. The action? It's crash, bang, wallop for 2 hours non-stop. The whole thing of 'visual story-telling' is simply an excuse by brainless people to basically admit that when you think about it there is no story. Here's a tip to the creators. The two key things in a film are story and character, when your film severely lacks both then you're already in trouble."
"troyputland","10","19","40","27 May 2015"," Absolutely stunning cinema.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually stunning masterpiece by George Miller. It's been 30 years since Miller's last project: the last of the original Mad Max films, starring Mel Gibson. Comparisons cannot be made as I've yet to watch them. There are no excuses. Max's crazy adventure may not take him very far, but the world in which he resides is imaginative. The vast wasteland surrounding small territories show how bleak everything has become. Water is sparse and saved for the main cretin and his crew. Weird, cult-like followers, with their bald heads, white painted bodies and addiction to silvery substance, follow his orders. There's no sign of any nature, only a rumour of a place populated by trees and running water. Theron's barbaric-looking Furiosa, with her metal arm and gigantic tanker, thwarts her bosses' orders and steals that which is most precious to him. Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) gathers his whole force in pursuit. What emanates is a fantastically frenzied chase across the desert. MM:FR is full of insane car chases (the cars are a sight to behold in themselves), incredible explosions and well thought-out action. The 3D isn't necessary; only one part stands out in particular and the story is only strong enough to keep the action expressive. Max (Hardy), with his gruff voice and limited dialogue, is secondary to Furiosa. His serenity and coldness towards others makes him the perfect character to explore. Flashes of his family, from a world once known, haunt him constantly. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just creative and captivating to the very end, it sets up potential for expansion. After this ride, it'd be criminal for the film studio not to."

","In Apocalypseland, Max Rokatansky finds himself strapped to the front of a vehicle forming part of a convoy crossing the desert in pursuit of a bus which has hijacked the harem of some feudal overlord-type in a mask whose name I didn't catch (in fact, I didn't catch any name apart from Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa). Max escapes and, after some disagreement, ends up helping the ""brides."" <br/><br/>I was very excited about the original Mad Max, because I love post-apocalypse fiction. And the first film in the original series actually started by addressing the crumbling of civilisation, showing a bridge between familiarity and the new order. Hindsight shows that what creator/director George Miller really wanted to do was get, as soon as possible, to a place where Max is a lone proponent of traditional values in a world which appears to consist entirely of feral gangs, victims, and sand. Fair enough, but it's not post-Apocalypse, is it? It's an alternate reality. Fury Road is a continuation, not a reboot, in which an entire sub-civilisation has built up in a remarkably short period: Max, a cop before The Fall, is still a young man, but the feral youths here have their own mythology. And how come, in this bleak, arid world, has the petrol not all evaporated? How come people are happy to waste petrol and water, both of which have to be scarce resources? Max's world makes no sense within the context of its own origin: that's why the original series annoyed me, and this addition doesn't change that.<br/><br/>In terms of eye candy, it's certainly spectacular: there are some phenomenal stunts, the effects work is good, and the desert locations are dramatic. But the story – an extended chase for two hours - is no more than a hook to hang the visuals on, the characters are mostly uninteresting and undeveloped (not that it matters, because this film isn't about character at all) and Max is uncharismatic because Tom Hardy doesn't get to give an idea of what sort of person he actually is.<br/><br/>If you like the idea of spending time in the eye-catching interior of a biscuit tin and being violently shaken for a couple hours, then I suspect you're going to really enjoy this. As for me, it tickled my eyes, but I would have liked a bit of food for the brain, too. I have friends who rated it highly: I had hoped I would too, but I'm afraid I have to record overall disappointment. This is an empty, empty film, and I'm not in a hurry to see it again."

","Max is back and better than ever! I know ""The Road Warrior"" is a classic, but I'm saying that this is the best ""Mad Max"" film to date. The reboot is a whirlwind of a thrill ride and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats for the who two-hour run time (making it the longest film in the series.)<br/><br/>""Fury Road"" finds Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, a man burdened by glimpses of the past and a little girl he was unable to protect. He is a loner, a drifter, and a man of very few words. After being taken prisoner by a group of warriors who paint themselves white and believe they are working to make it to Valhalla, Max escapes during one of the many intense fuel-guzzling battles on the Fury Road and decides to help Furiosa (played wonderfully by Charlize Theron) and a group of young women who are attempting escape and freedom by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays- Byrne, who played the villain in the first installment as well), the evil leader of the citizens of the Citadel who uses the women as slaves to give birth to his children. <br/><br/>The performances in the film are nothing short of great and satisfying. Hardy doesn't say much as Max, and he doesn't have to. Every gesture and grunt he makes is good enough and he fills the shoes vacated by Mel Gibson very well. Theron gives us a strong, independent woman warrior in Furiosa, one of the best characters to appear in the franchise and on screen this year. Another wonderful addition is Nicholas Hoult, who plays a distraught and anxious warrior who switches to the good side after failing in the eyes of Immortan Joe. <br/><br/>The film lives for its action sequences, which is fantastic because director George Miller is the king of action. Also, this is what the series was practically built on, something that was forgotten in the very disappointing ""Beyond Thunderdome."" The audience is given the pleasing feeling we felt while watching ""The Road Warrior,"" and then we are given more..and more...and more until we are so filled with excitement that it is hard to sit still. The film has a good plot that the action enhances. <br/><br/>If anything, this film is a shout-out to the number of failed modern action films. While the first ""Mad Max"" revolutionized the action film in the late 1970s, this film sets the bar for modern films of the genre. I've heard that the film is eighty percent practical events instead of CGI, and that in itself in achievement. With this in mind, there were numerous times in the film where I wondered just how Miller did what he did. The seventy-year-old director has excelled where a number of young filmmakers have failed and has brought us what might be the best action film in years.<br/><br/>This seems to be a new start for the ""Mad Max"" franchise. The original trilogy was probably good enough, but if the upcoming films are this great, they can make as many as they want until George Miller is unable to continue. Keep the excellent Tom Hardy in the lead, and keep on amazing us with the unbelievable stunts and action sequences. It's about time we had an action/adventure franchise film like this.

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a non-stop action thrill ride, from start to finish, that doesn't sacrifice characters or story for the adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy as Max is spectacular and is definitely on par with Gibon's original portrayal of the character.

George Miller's vision of doing as much practical effects as he could in the film worked beautifully. Unlike most modern day action films (i.e. ""Transformers"") where the action starts to get tiresome by the end, the action in ""Fury Road"" is always inventive, always creative and always has your attention.<br/><br/>I will say, without exaggeration, that ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is, not only the best film of 2015 by far, but the best action movie of the 21st century. Miller mixes character moments with hard hitting and grotesque action scenes that may become iconic in the years to come. What a cinematic achievement.

"kodyaschafer","10","14","28","15 May 2015"," A steady-dose adrenaline I.V.
","When it comes to movies, I have many loves and few passions. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those passions, and even though I anticipated the film I was still completely blown away.<br/><br/>It didn't take long for me to become completely immersed by the film's atmosphere; in fact, you have little choice. With a world that is so striking and foreign, your only shot at escaping captivation is to walk out of the film.<br/><br/>Both the cinematography and sound are staggering. They take things you are familiar and turn them into something very alien, and viewers are much likened to explorers. At points, I was beside myself with how amazing the costumes and props were done. This film is as close as I've come to culture shock without buying a plane ticket.<br/><br/>The jump-cuts, while ample, are done well in a sense that they keep your brain for lingering too long on one shot and prevent you from predicting what exactly might happen next and when it will happen.<br/><br/>The story, while simple and nothing new, does not lack substance. Miller chooses to drive home narrative using a camera and visuals instead of long-winded speeches and explicit anecdotes. Rather, MM:FR has the viewer considering even the smallest details of the plot and how they might have come to fruition.<br/><br/>In short: there are few movies that left me as staggered and excited as this film did. If film is to be considered a pillar of entertainment and culture for society, this film is a foundation for those pillars. Its plot is nothing revolutionary, but it's simply some of the most fun I've had watching a movie."
"mohsenfilmz","10","14","28","15 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury road _(2015)_ Movie Review
","Imagine a great adventure thriller story told using Salvador Dali paintings for each frame, with background music by Beethoven if he was a Rockstar. Imagine a unique action scene that's so well shot, it looks animated, but you know there's barely any CGI used. Imagine a movie that doesn't need dialogue to drop atomic bombs of emotion you, and doesn't do fast cuts to thrill you, widen your eyes, and make your blood pump faster for a fight sequence.<br/><br/>That imaginary movie doesn't hold a candle light to George Miller's Fury Road. This film is far more crazy colorful than a dream. This film is far better than any other action movie in this generation.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays the new Mad Max, a character that had been shelved in George Miller's head for thirty years. Max is reduced to a single instinct as he so simply puts it himself in the opening monologue. Survival, not only from the crazy weirdos who are trying to kill him, but also from his own mind, which is haunted by his past. All those who he couldn't save. Max's path of survival, crosses with Imperator Furiosa. A Kickass woman who is looking to get her friends to a safe place, which happens to be where she grew up in before she was taken away. They share a crazy, awesome and surprisingly mad-max-fury-road-tom-hardy-george-miller-600x421emotional road to their goals. Which as different as they are, have plenty sparkles of similarities.<br/><br/>Every character, small or big, has motivations, seclusions, and destination. The characters are so well presented, that they seem real, in the insane world of Mad Max.<br/><br/>This is also one of the best looking movies I have seen. It's not just the color and the background and the light, although they are stunningly crucial! It's the non stop camera movement that manages to find its direction in a mind blowing way through each shot. The camera movements are not unnecessary too as they are in many of the other Hollywood ""Thrill rides!"" It can represent vulgarisms, change in situations and change in character's relations. The great thing; is that considering all the art, this is still one of the most action packed movies I have ever seen. Every scene is a climactic one. All of them wow you with their awesome thrilling fights, chases, explosions and the many more crazy stuff that you'll only see in a Mad Max movie. This film doesn't sleep. A beautiful looking non stopFURY ROAD volcanic eruption of spectacular action. George Miller certainly knows how to get the most he possibly can out of each frame. Your background tells a story, and the foreground moves the story foreword. This is an amazing visual fiesta for the eyes.<br/><br/>There's something very special about the feeling that swallows you whole while you're drowned in a great world created by an artist who knows how to make a great piece that will disconnect you from the earth that you're on. After all, that's all cinema is about.<br/><br/>Oh what a Kickass masterpiece!"
"carysherbert","10","14","28","14 May 2015"," Hate apocalyptic movies, loved Mad Max.
","I have never seen previous mad max movies before, so I had no idea what to expect going into the movie. I usually hate any movies that are even remotely apocalyptic, but I am glad to say this movie was purely amazing! The storyline was so vaguely explained throughout the film, and left just enough room for your own interpretation of it. They made the action sequences with a finesse, and connected you to all characters during the whole film, even during massive fight scenes. Tom Hardy was brilliant as always, I did not think that he would be able to pull off this type of movie, but as he has proved in past movies, he can! Charlize Theron played Furiosa beautifully, I have never seen her in any movies prior, but this was one fantastic role. Absolutely brilliant, 10 out of 10! Well done George Miller."

"robertnankin","5","20","43","18 May 2015"," Plan? There ain't no plan...
","I am a big Mad Max fan. I own the first three movies and have watched these films many times. I even truly liked Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, even knowing that many people did not. So, needless to say, I've been anticipating this new movie very much and had been following it's development and progress over the Internet for years. I was ramped up even more by all the wonderful reviews it got here and on rotten tomatoes.com. However....I got to say I was disappointed and rank this film 4th out of the 4 Mad Max films. The vehicles, effects and sound were awesome. The story? There wasn't one. The dialog, weak. The portrayal of Max by Tom Hardy, lacking. Remember the Great Humongous, Feral Boy and Master/Blaster? Great characters. Who will you remember from this film?"
"Justice68","6","16","33","10 August 2015"," Reboot or poor continuation of the series, neither seems to be properly addressed
","=======Potential Spoilers due to use of character names and the description of a few scenes with some level of detail.=======<br/><br/>Hollywood seems to have this fascination with rebooting or extending the longevity of a film franchise, because well there's money to be made and they are out of fresh ideas.<br/><br/>This iteration of Mad Max nonchalantly delivers all of the bad tripe that Hollywood drums up, and doesn't do anything to give us a sense of that movie going experience that used to excite us as young adults or children. <br/><br/>It's redundant and uses a worn out formula that needs to be broken.<br/><br/>I rated it a 6(generous)and that was only because of the wonderful scenery and some awesome attention to detail with costumes and vehicles/props.<br/><br/>1. It's great that they avoided CGI where possible. Though when they did use it, it was noticeable and rather amateurish looking. And it's not enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>You have to consider, if the main praise of a film is that 'it used real props,' then clearly the film wasn't that good.<br/><br/>2. Characters are uninteresting, unrelatable and entirely one dimensional. Max..totally uninspiring. Mel Gibson's Max was a badass, a man of honor in a world gone mad and a survivor. Tom Hardy's Max is just an invalid. Max himself is not only a mute for 3/4s of the film, he's also feeble - which seems to be a trait of Tom Hardy more than the character. It certainly wasn't the confident Max we were accustomed to.<br/><br/>3. Story was boring - if I wanted to watch a bunch of dimwitted women escaping into a fantasy land(whether real or mental), I'd just watch an episode of Orange is the New Black. That's all I need to get my nauseating fill of ridiculous femme monologues. And even if we buy that Max is a 'survivor' I don't call what he did really surviving. He just played wheel man for a bunch of idiotic mares.<br/><br/>4. Plot is amateur. Plot twists are obvious. Moments where bad guy is deterred or detoured by some character that I care nothing for, is obvious - such as the Splendid Angharad opening the door to block Immorten Joe from shooting Furiousa - like right at the perfect moment, exposing her belly and child with a smug grin on her face as if daring him to shoot her. Really? Who wrote this horesh*t?<br/><br/>5. Film starts out with one of the two regurgitated film openings with movies these days. Either you get a five minute 'this is what happened flashbacks, and now let's start the movie' or you get 'central protagonist/antagonist reflecting on life choices and some sort of mental/emotional anguish that drives or haunts their days.' In this film, it's the latter with the huge cop out that Max 'failed' some children and hears their screams taunting him.<br/><br/>6. Timing of scenes and dialogue is rough, badly edited and makes you wonder why they even paid known actors to deliver a handful of lines that aren't even convincing any ways. Why not let some new actors do it and pay them 1/4 the wage?<br/><br/>7. Whole parts of the film are irrelevant and only server to waste time. The intro to the film is inconsequential. We get a half hearted half minute monologue and voice over about some nonsense and then a few back and forth scenes about a capture and escape. <br/><br/>Then the film seems to properly start where it should have, with the introduction of Immortan Joe. They could have led in at the point where he's having this weird armor strapped to him and then he walks out to the people below. It not only curiously introduces the main villain but also shows a small example of what the world is like, when he releases the water and people began fighting over it. <br/><br/>The only thing in this film that interested me, was when Splendid Angharad got run over. A film is bad when the only pleasure I got from it, was watching an innocent character get killed by a monster truck buggy's tire. <br/><br/>Just goes to show how utterly sh*t the film was. <br/><br/>Frankly, they should be ashamed they bothered to reboot the series; or whatever you want to call it. People that like this are the same sheep that think the recent string of comic book films are good entertainment.<br/><br/>I call it simply crap."
"rupees","6","16","33","11 July 2015"," disappointing
","I can not understand the hype about this movie. The story is really boring and linear. They drive away and then they decide to drive back.... that's all. In my opinion: there is too much action and not enough deepness. For example: The reason why Furiora is acting the way she does is just superficial. The audience doesn't get much deeper in her story, just as well the story of Max. You just have to guess. The movie is also very brutal and at some points (in Game of Thrones-style) really disgusting. The women they want to save are really annoying characters and you just cant feel with them. All in all the movie reminds me of the new Riddick, where you also get disappointed in the middle of the movie about the extent of the story. Only the character design and the general style are awesome. In addition the actors Hardy and Theron are sympathetic."
"matija-curcic","6","16","33","25 June 2015"," review
","Mad Max: Fury road - first of all it is wrong title. main leading role Charlize Theron as Furiosa that supposed movie be named by first leading role. Theron is impressive as always as. tom hardy as supporting main character Max is not impressive. his mediocre acting and lethargic entry do not contribute to total scene. i was expecting someone sharp in action like Jason statham or splendid actor in recent scene good as Ryan Gosling at all. by the way i don't like storyline too, but action is good and constant. nux played by Nicolas hoult British actor is most controversial character. first he was orthodox religion fanatic fascinated by immortal Joe and vikings too. he believed in Valhalla(Nordic paradise) and then he turned his life views by 180° and became a member of running party of furiosa. furiosa is most stupidest female name for leading female role. i don't heard name stupid like that not even in Spain or Mexico. furiosa??? villains do not look scary like in original mad max 1 or 2. only action is constant but storyline is not impressive. furiosa stealing pregnant and virgins, than escaping. she leading to gasoline city but she dragging another tank with 300 gallons of fuel? then leading left to enemy territory. and 50 vehicles cant stop one truck? why they didn't simple shoot to thires? in that case film wouldn't be attractive or interesting. that no longer i must admit i am not impressed and i was expecting much more. mad max 1 and 2 are much better movies."
"jcox713","5","16","33","24 June 2015"," Could have been great, but they blew it
","The first half hour is excellent. I was on board and blown away. The costumes, set design - and those cars! - were truly amazing. Opening action sequence is incredible - until, they introduced the ultra-dramatic violins and sappy orchestra soundtrack. Absolutely ruined the movie for me. Soundtrack belonged in Pearl Harbor, not Mad Max. Should have been heavy metal or dub step electronic music, or even better, barely any music at all. It just made the movie so cheesy. Then add lack of plot, no character development and sub-par acting and you get a somewhat forgettable movie. Charlize Theron who is indeed an amazing actress, supposedly gives a stellar performance in this flick. I really don't know how that is determined. She basically says nothing and just scowls the entire time. I totally checked out mentally from this movie about 60% into it. I really wanted to leave, or start checking email on my phone."
"zyana-794-665424","3","16","33","30 May 2015"," They spent $150M making _that_ one-dimential piece of &&&&&& ???!!!
","Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of Mad Max. Even this movie had the best cinematography, choreography, though I'd argue some of the drama and humor to offset the seriousness of the chase scenes.<br/><br/>But the problem is they forgot to hire a *writer*! This is for testosterone junkies who enjoy what is basically a two hour chase scene where they get away an hour in to the movie (by which time I was still looking at my watch, waiting to see some real plot developments. No such luck.) Then they all change their minds and decide to go back to the place they escaped from and take it over (Which, implausible as it sounds, takes 30 seconds and is rather anti-climatic.)<br/><br/>I could list any of a number of bad movies who got lower rating from critics but had more substance to them than a cup of chicken bullion, which is where I would rate just this very movie. It didn't have more substance than a cup of chicken bullion when it came to a plot, story, character development, character development that affected the audience through it's unfolding, or anything other than wild costumes, a philosophy of life was said in less than 2 sentences, and then back to chases.<br/><br/>This movie is one thing that points out my very frustration with the Hollywood system as it is. 150M gets thrown at making this, while there are a lot of other writers put out much better scripts, but can't get noticed.<br/><br/>Just one more thing... I'm not writing this because I've got a screenplay that blows the one for this one away. (That's not hard to do with Mad Max IV.) I went to watch this Mad Max, honestly thinking it would be my grave as a writer. Instead, I come away feeling gypted and all the more aware of how much talent the Hollywood system throws away - and it's not just me.<br/><br/>Please improve your game, Hollywood. We're tired of watching comic books brought to the screen, then done all over again, this sort of stuff just because George Miller carries a good rep (now retire, please,) - and please pay attention to the real talent that you turn away from your door everyday. <br/><br/>But if you want to go watch a 2-hour, motorized chase scene, then by all means help yourself."

"mick_bythell","5","16","33","17 May 2015"," Mad Maxine (also starring mumbling Max)
","I thought long and hard before writing this review. I mean, the opinion of 99% of IMDb is against me, so everyone else must be right! right? Wrong!<br/><br/>So let's start with the obvious. The protagonist of the film is Furiosa, not Max, because women can be protagonists too. Okay.... let's tick that box...<br/><br/>So why call the movie Mad Max? Why not just set a random plot in a random dystopian future with strong female characters? OK, let's do it! No! wait! we can't! Because we're scared that the story can't stand alone on its own merits. We're scared to put out a stand-alone movie with no character continuity to the Mad Max films.<br/><br/>This film is a non-sequitur of a non-sequel assembled by the intellectually bankrupt purely to illustrate a misogynist, dystopian future where anything with a penis is to be held in contempt. But because it's by George Miller it must be a sequel to Mad Max?! Okay.... let's tick that box... (Did George Miller really create this - or did the studio just pay him to put his name to it?)<br/><br/>Plot summary: Mad Maxine (also starring mumbling Max). In the future, there are a lot of bad men. And they treat women as chattels and breeding stock.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a woman. A woman who can drive a truck. And shoot better than mumbling Max. And can kick mumbling Max's ass (with one hand). Maxine's a bad-ass - you can tell by the metal arm (prosthetics are still available in the future.) Maxine comes from a mythical green place. To free other women from bondage. And bring them back to the mythical green place where the sacred seeds are kept. Maxine and her friends have promised each other never to kill on this, most special, of road-trips. (Wounding and maiming is acceptable, however.) Oh, and a couple of guys happen to help her out, and one of them is called Max, and he had to be in the plot because of the title... Okay.... let's tick that box...<br/><br/>What's a synonym for mad? Furious! Hah! hah! I get it! That's about the level of wit in this entire unfunny, monotonous, stinker of a film.<br/><br/>The explosions were good, though. Okay.... let's tick that box..."
"MarcoLara","2","18","38","30 December 2015"," Crap Max: Fury on the spectator
","Understand first where I come from. I am a die hard fan of the Terminator saga, and particularly loved T2. I watched all previous Mad Max movies and I did like them. And I have seen pretty much every post-apocalyptic movie and TV show there is, because this is how I roll.<br/><br/>So when I come to see Mad Max 4 I know what to expect. I know it's going to be pretty much action everywhere, a bit of background story, and some character development to keep it all somehow together. I do not expect more, but I also don't expect less because that is what the Mad Max franchise has been giving us.<br/><br/>Then, before I get to see this movie, I read all sorts of great reviews from everywhere. I do not read spoilers, and I do not watch trailers, but I can feel from all these reviews that this Mad Max movie seems to have something going for it. It even ranked number 1 of 2015 in IMDb, the very site where I do all my movie reviews, so I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is what I've found: A Benny Hill-esque type of movie but without trying to be fun. Also without any character development, background story, or pretty much anything other than action that gets boring after the first five minutes of it.<br/><br/>And it's not like the story didn't have a change to fill those gaps: The main characters give us a hint, even sometimes a mysterious indication, of things that happened to them and things that they wanted. What happened to character X's past that are so present in the movie? What sort of accident happened to character Y? Why character Z became the big boss of that one tribe? Unfortunately there seem to be no time to answer any of these questions, or any question for that matter, nor time for any development or attachment whatsoever.<br/><br/>Speaking of time, you may argue that there was none for all the questions I had. Well, Mad Max 4 is a good 2 hours, so I tend to disagree with that. The movie could easily do without 20 minutes of meaningless vehicle chase and put that time for the audience to learn the bare minimum about the characters so we did not feel we where the audience of some sort of monster truck show.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the movie don't even have the minimum respect to fundamental physics. And nope, I am not splitting hairs here. I am not going to tell you that a vehicle cannot fly that high or anything like that. I am going to stick to the basis: Humans cannot run as fast as moving vehicles at high speed. Humans cannot run for miles without panting for at least a couple of minutes. Pregnant humans on their nine month of pregnancy cannot run as fast as non-pregnant humans. And of course, if going in a hurry from point A to point B takes X hours, going back in the exact same route with the same hurry should take more or less the same time. But not in the world of Mad Max 4. Here everything goes because, apparently, the audience will love the franchise so much that it will justify every single of the many errors of this movie.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that for a while it seemed to work. I went to watch it with someone not familiar with the franchise, and for a while I tried to forgive and explain the movie, as in ""well, maybe the vehicle looked like in a hurry but in reality was making 2 miles an hour"" but at the end my companion and I decided to laugh it off even though the laugh was on us because the investors of these movie were the ones pocketing our cash.<br/><br/>So my advice to you is the following: Do not bother. Wait until it goes for free on your TV, or you have a long flight and it's on. Or skip it all together. Watch again one of the old Mad Max movies and be done with it."

Please, do anything else but see it, you will never get those precious minutes back.<br/><br/>It starts badly and builds to the ridiculous. It is initially difficult to fathom why the actors are doing what they are, but eventually you gather what the intent is. <br/><br/>There is an attempt to follow a similar story line to Mad Max 2 in terms of an over all plot, but as a story it fails miserably to head in that direction at all.<br/><br/>There is no real story line, no real plot and there is little more than a string of poorly produced computer generated vehicle crashes, all joined together to fill in the time it should have taken to tell a story.<br/><br/>Mel should be very thankful he stayed away from this stinker."

The action sequences are so Long that either:<br/><br/>1-you forget how they started 2-you look away for 5 minutes and the same crap is still exploding on the screen<br/><br/>And then you wait for something, some kind of explanation as to why sh*t is Happening, and there is none.

","I had high expectations for this movie - seen Mad Max with Gibson just a few years back the first time and really enjoyed it. He was the main character however in this latest blockbuster, he is just a sidekick to Furiosa.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be the worst part, what really bothered me were the following things:<br/><br/>Inconsistent sound (e.g. low volume during the high actions scenes) but that could've been just by the setup in my particular theater.<br/><br/>Special effects were great, lots of practical effects and explosions but it was very obvious and it made it seem less real and plausible because of speeding the action up in post production. I get it, you can't really do certain scenes in 100km/h in sand having the main character strapped to the front of the car but it ruined the realism and CGI would probably look better and more believable. <br/><br/>Backstory - none. I did care very little about any of the characters though we learned about Furiosa and why she was doing what she was doing. As someone else mentioned, Michael Bay's movies have lot more story than this one and this one is praised and his movies are heavily criticized.<br/><br/>Max - inconsistent character. In the apocalyptic world with no rules and him being a master of his own life, not belonging to any gang/group - why he didn't kill the guy that used him as a 'blood bag'? Why he left him live even after getting them repeatedly into trouble? That seemed very incongruent with his character and name for that matter.<br/><br/>It was good fun nonetheless but current rating of 8.8 is highly overrated and I'm certain it'll go down as more people see it."

"blockparty50","4","15","31","14 June 2015"," Way overrated!!!
","I recently read a review by a guy who saw the movie 6 times,yes,6 times!!! The movie lacks in all major aspects of film making, including cinematography, dialogue, plot, character development, and originality. Please allow me to highlight several of the largest failures of the film:<br/><br/>Character development: The film contains exactly zero (0) character development, leading you to not give a s#$@ who lives and who dies because you don't know who they are in the first place. It simply starts immediately with an extended action scene and continues to jump from action scene to action scene without giving the characters personalities or even a legitimate cause. Dialogue: As noted above, the film doesn't allow for any character development; however, what's more is that the film lacks any dialogue of substance at all. The characters might say 250 words in total, although that is being generous. The dialogue that does exist is short and choppy with out-of-place camera shots and cheesy dramatic music that implies the audience should be caring about a certain character that they aren't familiar with (see above). Plot: Along with the lack of character development and dialogue, the plot is non-existent for the first 30 minutes of the movie, and the audience is left wondering what the hell is going on. After the initial cluelessness, the audience is left to cling to a plot that is weaker than limp spaghetti and less substantial than empty space, and it's got more holes than the novel. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a pathetic excuse to try and turn a combination of a monster truck race and a demolition derby into a Hollywood event. From the opening car chase to the closing credits, the audience is left feeling dazed, confused, and the initial excitement - bored from seeing the same chase/fight scene over and over and over again. The movie is predictable, unoriginal, and lacks any kind of depth. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I hope that you will save yourself the $ and 2 hours of your life and not see this abomination of a movie. Personally, I would rather be dragged naked over a cactus with my mouth over the tailpipe of a greyhound bus than sit through that again."

","It is the loud, crazy, insane, overwhelming, bizarre, grotesque and sickening ""quick cuts"" version of the original ""Road Warrior"" movie. ""Mad Max, Fury Road"" is the ""Road Warrior"" for the 21st Century. Will ""Mad Max"" be nominated for best picture of the year at Academy Awards time? I hope not. Look, if I was a pure action movie fan, I would give this movie at ""10"" out of ""10"" all the way. But I'm not. But you see, I also happen to be an up and coming writer myself (at least I think I am) and I just noticed something. There's no story! There's no plot! Only bizarre and nutty scenes being thrown at you at high speed in your face! Again and again! Isn't that great? Isn't that a movie? You know, ""Mad Max"" reminds me of another movie. What movie is that? DUNE! You know, that boring and nonsensical piece of trash directed by David Lynch! Oh, that one! I have concluded that ""Mad Max, Fury Road"" is the super high speed version of ""Dune"". Mad Max takes the weirdness and sickness of ""Dune"" and accelerates it to 200 miles an hour! ""Hooray!"" ""Isn't that a fantastic and original idea?"" You know, George Miller, the director of Mad Max, should redo ""Dune"" next. I would pay good money to see what George Miller would do to ""Dune"". Or has he done it already? Is ""Mad Max"" really ""Dune"" in disguise? I have to say, though, ""Mad Max"" was very entertaining. But that's it. Without a plot, without a story, all I got was a one dimensional roller coaster ride through hell. And is that what all these violent and crazy movies are good for? Are they just roller coaster rides now? It seems that they are."

Then I saw the guy playing guitar on a flaming rig. <br/><br/>The movie tries to be gritty but silly at the same time. It's too silly to be taken seriously, and too gritty to be fun. <br/><br/>There is little dialog and character interaction, mostly it's a big long chase. To me action gets old very quickly, especially when it's the same thing over and over again. Spoiler: guys on vehicles shoot at each other, people fall off, cars crash.<br/><br/>Mad max is a minor character. Furiosa just isn't that interesting. Nux is the only person with a real story. He's the only one with anything going on other than fleeing or fighting.

"j-velichkov","4","15","31","1 June 2015"," Highly overrated
","This is the modern interpretation of a hit-movie from a few decades ago when this sort of post-apocalyptic movies had their peak. Despite the presence of South African pearl Charlize Theron, the movie remains what it has always been - a B or even C movie with unconvincing and extremely poor characters. The dialogs are old fashioned, the look of the secondary and supernumerary characters is awful and the director's work is at the expected low level. The movie raises a bunch of questions, but gives answers to a very few of them. Tom Hardy is doing his best in the character of Max trying not to say a word until the end of the movie, but even his stoicism can not save the day. This is the deja-vu of an old and having lived his days movie, a tragical attempt to resurrect a long dead subject and the past glory of his creator."

You know how this story ends.<br/><br/>I'll say it now–Fury Road is the best film in at least 18 months, and the best summer blockbuster in five years. I delighted at George Miller's ""mastermind"" billing in the trailers, but it was absolutely justified. He draws on aspects of the original trilogy, from small touches (the little music box, for one) to primary themes–the damning social critique of Mad Max, the relentless brutality of The Road Warrior, and the post-apocalyptic grotesquerie of Beyond Thunderdome. Here, working with a budget far greater than the budgets of the originals combined, he has crafted a film which draws from and, in my opinion, exceeds them.<br/><br/>He, and an incredibly talented team, have made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Cinematography, editing, score, makeup, production design...all of the highest order.

I admire some of the creation in it (the guitar for example) and I commend it for all the effort but I was just bored to death whilst watching it and I was always waiting for the story to be introduced or a sudden plot turn but neither ever happened.

","I really, really struggled to even give this movie a rating of 3. I did so based solely on the belief that all films are artistic expressions of someone's idea(s) or vision and therefore all have merit to some degree.<br/><br/>With that being said, I believe that I may have lost a few IQ points from watching this movie. Without question, I certainly lost 2 hours of my life that I will never, ever be able to recover.<br/><br/>Although I could not stand this film's total lack of plot exposition and character development, my biggest gripe with this movie is the following: regardless of whether you believe mankind has been around for 6,000 years or 200,000 years, Mad Max: Fury Road encourages us, or leads us to believe that the majority of those that remain in this post apocalyptic future are no wiser from all that time mankind has spent on this earth...More simply put, in this story's version of a post apocalyptic future, mankind has essentially regressed back into Neanderthals.<br/><br/>Among a mind-numbing amount of grunts and groans from this movie's cast throughout the film, like the father or mother of a toddler, I repeatedly found myself constantly on the verge of saying, ""Use your words!"" Another thing I find telling (though not surprising) with the film Mad Max: Fury Road, is how the ratings seem to rise significantly as the age of its viewers decrease.<br/><br/>I could go further into detail regarding the plethora of reasons as to why I really didn't like this film, but quite frankly after already wasting approximately 2 hours of my life, I've chosen to stop the bleeding now rather than devoting any more of my time to something that's nowhere near worth sacrificing this world's all too valuable commodity.

"kluseba","4","18","39","12 June 2015"," Shallow action without any aesthetics, charm or depth
","On an objective level, both critics and fans don't seem to know what a good movie is anymore. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" may be filled with nearly two hours of breathtaking non-stop action sequences and a couple of great special effects, settings or locations and some solid camera and light techniques in the few calmer moments. <br/><br/>The problem is that there is literally nothing more than this in this reboot of another legendary series. There are no real intrigues going on and creativity is literally non- existent. There are almost no dialogues and the few that are there are quite weak. There are no surprising elements or twists and therefor no tension whatsoever in the whole flick. The plot is so shallow that even the increasingly bad ""Fast and Furious"" feel like intellectual masterpieces if compared to this laughable excuse of a story. <br/><br/>One gets introduced to an epic number of characters but none of them has any real depth. The biggest problem is the uncharismatic main actor Tom Hardy and his shallow character that doesn't create any antipathy or sympathy among viewers. I rarely cared less about a leading character in any movie than here. Another problem are the numerous villains that aren't fleshed out either. It feels as if the characters of the bad guys were randomly borrowed from some of the trashiest action flicks of the seventies and eighties. Sometimes, they appear pretty much out of nowhere and die as randomly a few minutes later. The only actress who did a decent job and managed to add some depth to its character is Academy Award winner Charlize Theron. I feel sad for her to be acting in such a disastrous movie.<br/><br/>Even two hours of non-stop action end up feeling boring and stretched if there are no truly stunning scenes or any degree of virtuosity in the high amount of exaggerated explosions and endless gunfights. Even as a homage to the original series or a worthless movie to switch your brains off and have some fun, this movie has nearly no merits. Apart of the few objective positive elements which are basically due to the impertinent budget and some obvious inspirations from the original cult movies and which barely justify my extremely generous rating, this film is extremely overrated and not recommendable for anyone."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","7","16","34","24 May 2015"," Insanely cool visuals, but nothing more, just madly overrated.
","I'm not the biggest fan of the Mad Max trilogy, but i love the films, and despite being the least liked, thunderdome is my favourite. Despite of its flaws, to me its the most complex and the one that comes out more as a film and has all the things that makes a film, more importantly the story. <br/><br/>So when the trailers for Fury Road came out, i was super hyped, and it was definitely one of my most hyped films to see in 2015, i couldn't stop thinking what Miller would do with 150 million and the trailers made it look like an epic non stop action film with classic visuals, just pure insane action like no other film. Then critics and audiences acclaimed it to the point of being an instant classic and is now an Oscar contender!, then the Score came out and i loved it so much i couldn't stop listening and it made my expectations even higher, so i went to IMAX with my expectations at an all time high and saw it....<br/><br/>And i was so disappointed! I couldn't stop thinking what was i missing since everyone loves it. Sure the visuals are insanely good, the stunts are breathtaking, the score is a killer, the performances are great, it has originality to spare, the production design is an Oscar winner, its so inventive, i mean the cars are insane and the costumes are brilliant, but all the rest pales in comparison.<br/><br/>I never went expecting a complex story or even much dialogue, but i was surprised that there was no story, and no dialogue, to the point i was a little bit bored one time or two. I couldn't stop thinking how this could be an Oscar contender with no story or dialogue, and how was the film moving along. But this wasn't my biggest disappointment at all, it was the action, because i really went for the action. And it was just OK, sure it was very realistic and all, but the production videos were a lot more realistic and exciting, the film had a mad look that was cool but takes a lot of the realism and excitement and feels weird.<br/><br/>I didn't like the choreography, it was just so simple and had a weird rhythm, there were parts where nothing happened, i couldn't find a single piece of action that i truly liked or was excited. Just things happening. And most of the problem was the edition, that mad look. Also Mad Max felt like a secondary character, just going along, that wouldn't be a problem if furiosa was a great character, but she wasn't, i couldn't relate to any character, because they had no story, no dialogue, they were just insane people with great looks, doing insane things.<br/><br/>Overall, i can't feel nothing but disappointment, and sure the technical parts are almost perfect, the cinematography, the sound, the production design, the visuals are insanely good, but all the rest pales in comparison, no story, nothing i could relate to, not even the action that is so blunt and simplistic, even with its real stunts and all. This is the weakest of all Mad Max films. This film is hugely overrated, and its another one i cant share the same opinion the world has, but since everyone loves it so much, i must be the problem, I'm not saying the film isn't good, i just cant agree with everyone, i just cant see what makes it so great. This was one of the most strangest experiences at the movies i ever had."

","A friend of mine is insisting that I'm the only one he knows who disliked this movie. I was gratified to come here and see the many reviews saying exactly what I feel. ""The Road Warrior"" is just about my favorite movie, and ""Fury Road"" is the antithesis of that movie--all CGI, no back story or characterization, and simply silly to boot. I wouldn't even call it a sci-fi flick, as it's more of an inane fantasy. The viewer is thrown into a plot which I would describe as ""a bunch of desert freaks throw crap in your face for two hours."" It made me think of the many RW rip-offs of the 80's and 90's, but with overused CGI and too much money to burn.<br/><br/>If you are a RW fan, I'd advise you not to bother with this. It won't sully your memory or future viewings of RW, but it will very likely disappoint. I managed to turn my wife (the farthest thing from a sci-fi geek) into a RW fan, and she too was bitterly disappointed with this and said we needed to watch RW again soon to expunge this abomination from our memories.<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: We only watched about 35-40 minutes before we couldn't take it anymore, but we both hated literally every moment we witnessed.)"

","Firstly this is not a Mad Max film. Max is utterly secondary to Charlize's character and the film should have been called Furious Furiosa. Mad Max is allegedly set in Australia but there's such a hodgepodge of accents here that you frankly wonder where it could possibly be set. If you can accept that the basic failing of this not being a Mad Max film you then hit a wall of other failures with this film.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no plot at all here. Now I regard a plot as an essential ingredient in any film. For me there absolutely has to be a point to what is happening. This film utterly rips up that notion and laughs at it. What you are left with is action only and it fails here too. CGI is a great tool for film makers but the instant you notice it it makes any action cartoon-like. CGI is very noticeable in many places here and it just destroys any semblance of reality when it appears. It's a shame because so many of the sequences have been filmed with great action only to have the CGI come along later and ruin them. CGI only works when you don't notice it.<br/><br/>There is almost no dialogue to the film and as such the characters are not developed in the slightest. You develop no feelings for any of them. They may as well have just hired stunt-men for the main parts for all the acting that was requested of them. The fertile Harem ladies are all supermodels. Why are only the beautiful ones fertile? Are beauty and fertility linked? Given that it's the strong who survive in this wasteland why is the chief bad guy a pensioner?<br/><br/>Omitting a plot seems to be a recurring Hollywood feature these days. Are there really so many people around who don't require one that this film could possibly be rated at 8.6? If people really lap this stuff up then we'll obviously be fed more. A depressing thought.<br/><br/>Only watch this if you can stand a pointless film with no plot and don't go to the cinema thinking you are seeing a Mad Max film. Better still find something else to watch."

","Tom Hardy manages to grunt his broody way through this; luckily he had his few lines written on the back of a postage stamp to help him remember. Being a canny lad with a few primo performances under his belt like 'Bronson' and 'The Drop' he realised that the over reliance on 3D effects would negate the need for him to act, so didn't. <br/><br/>I watched this in lowly 2D yet was still annoyed by all of the effects department's 'aren't we clever!?' 3D moments which came thick and fast to the point of saturation. The only real surprise is that no one stuck their finger or face right up to the camera lens. <br/><br/>The post apocalyptic 'Steam Punk' world has evolved faster than first portrayed in the originals, so the space time paradox starts. Either that or Max is getting younger every year as a result of radiation poisoning? How can a whole culture, including language, religion and aristocracy evolve in a decade or two? It makes no sense; not even East London changes cultures that quickly, and it's done Yiddish, Cypriot, Caribbean, Bangladeshi and ultra cool white media types in less than 60 years! <br/><br/>The 'Breeders', fresh out of modelling school and a beauty salon were the cherry on top. Bad man wants to breed warrior sons, yet chooses the skinniest, and ergo the weakest of all the females to do this? Surely he should have enslaved the butchest, toughest and strongest of the women for this purpose? It's no fun for either party when bonking a butch dike, but it will certainly produce 'warriors'; but reduce the possibility of appealing to hormone riddled teenagers and sex starved dads in the potential audience. No loss of 'ker-ching!' for the sake of believability here. Eye candy = mucho deniero, even in radiation blasted desert wastelands.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron's character had some charm and depth - hard for a 'one armed trucker with a gun' role, so she is forgiven. Although we didn't see her map reading or parallel parking skills, a legendary problem for all one armed road kings around the world, with or without a middle leg.<br/><br/>If you're new to 'Max' then this is an 'almost okay' good vs evil (half) road movie - why half? Because they change their minds and come back again. If you're a fan of the original 'Max' do yourself a favour, preserve your admiration for radical Australian cinema and don't watch this unless;<br/><br/>1.Drunk<br/><br/>2.High<br/><br/>3.Stupid<br/><br/>4.Currently being tortured in Guantanimo Bay and want the mental pain to seem less.........painful. Five minutes of this and you'll be begging the CIA goons to start up again with the white noise and black hood.<br/><br/>There's a tonne of reviews on here already so I don't think anyone will read this. I just had to let it out before the festering hate degenerates and I become a gun wielding nutter that kills his workmates on a whim one sunny day. Or maybe I could run them down with a barb wire festooned truck....................? Mmmmmmmmmm?"

","As per usual when a big blockbuster comes out, some hype part of its viewers scream this is the new ultimate masterpiece that is so good they don't understand why a new religion based on it shouldn't be started immediately.<br/><br/>Do not get fooled : George Miller has only done what was needed to make his movie ultra popular and in this, he has succeeded. But as a movie in whole, he fails and delivers a quite lame production.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the original Mad Max series. The 1st had its moments, the Thunderdome was a failure, but The Road Warrior was an excellent movie. I watched it again some months ago to show it to my 18 year old daughter and was still amazed by the quality of its production, its story, its multi-dimensional characters and its outrageous violence in relation to the era it was released. Foremost, it had a feel of reality that made its post-apocalyptic world totally believable ( the canned dog food scene, the fight for gasoline, the bad guys, the vehicles, etc... ).<br/><br/>Fury Road tries hard to revive this atmosphere... and fails.<br/><br/>Where Mel Gibson ( and others ) delivered a complex character, chaotic and selfish, Tom Hardy delivers nothing at all, as for the other characters that have only a few lines in stock. Thus, as it has been much said by other reviewers, it's hard to connect with them and in the end, we don't care if they live or die.<br/><br/>Where The Road Warrior provided a sense of reality in its everyday world, in Fury Road, the Gothic designs bring only stupidity and make things laughable ( in a world where everything is scarce, who would build a car with 2 decks one on top of the other, or who would be idiot enough to build a vehicle whose only purpose is to convey a mad metal guitarist and drummers ? ).<br/><br/>In ANY world, who would be stupid enough to warn anybody that being addicted to water is dangerous ? Must we remind Fury Road's villain that without water, even the baddest guy would die in a matter of 36 hours max ? What is left of Fury Road is the usual blockbuster parade : action, explosions, more action and more explosions. In that, the movies achieves what it was aimed for : mindless violence for the masses.<br/><br/>As for me, I got bored after the first 30 minutes and while I kept going, and despite a honorable realization and editing, I couldn't get back into the movie and waited for it to end as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Conclusion : watch to be able to say you've seen it ( and then have enough matter at hand to criticize it ), but when it's time to watch it again, stick to the Road Warrior."
"navyshark55","5","14","29","11 June 2015"," Over-hyped. OKAY BUT NOT EPIC.
","What can I say about Mad Max: Feminist Road. First, the film attempts to coast your attention with a two hour car chase. While the action is decently brutal, the plot has grand room for improvement. First and foremost, no-one tells Mad Max what to do. The idea of Mad Max is that he is the master of his own fate. This film degrades him to just another one-dimensional character like all the others. Again, action was decent but there was little to no incentive to care about the characters. <br/><br/>The plot is a loose string of feminist propaganda in the form of ""slavery"" to some post-apocalyptic barbarian king that no-one is incentivized to care about. I laughed as one of the female characters was run over because this movie was just a good action flick. Pay no attention to the half-brained monkeys that insinuate that this movie is an ""Epic"". It is not. The plot sucked. The characters were lame. The action was the only reason to watch this movie."
"svvaleroso","3","14","29","1 June 2015"," Disappointing
","As a cult follower of the original Mel Gibson series, I was really hoping this would just be a remake of the original Road Warrior movie (Fury Road is also post apocalyptic), however with the ability to add even greater effects on screen, and possibly a tune-up in writing, secondary casting, etc. I got most of that, but unlike the original version it had ZERO character building, and a story line that was so confusing, it took a third of the movie to figure out what the heck the plot (mission) was even about. <br/><br/>If you're familiar with the original Road Warrior movie, and you liked the chase scene at the end, you'll love this version. Within ten minutes, the movie is nothing more than a non-stop version of that SAME chase scene, except a grueling 120 minutes long. That's it. Nothing more."

"powermandan","1","6","10","12 February 2018"," Utterly Pointless & Severely Overrated!
","I totally love cinema's action genre, always going easy on it. When the latest Mad Max movie first came out, I was pretty disappointed in it. Then all the acclaim and awards started pouring in. Is film dead? Did I just have a bad day? I rewatched it and my initial thoughts have been reaffirmed. The 1/10 I'm giving this is just a bid for this overall rating to lower. Otherwise I'd be giving this 5/10.<br/><br/>It made sense for a Mad Max movie to be made now because of the massive upgrades in computer technology. That and it seemed like a nice cash grab. After all, the movie does have a better overall look than the three previous instalments. That's really about it in terms of what this movie has that's better than the others.<br/><br/>'Mad Max: Fury Road' is not about anything. The characters are flatter than paper and the story stays in one spot throughout the whole thing. All it is is people driving in the desert with occasional explosions. The audience is expected the care about these characters just because. With underdeveloped characters why should we care? It is super rare when we care about an underdeveloped character. In 'Saving Private Ryan,' Giovanni Ribisi's character was underdeveloped but we felt tremendous remorse upon his death. Nothing that smart ever happens in this.<br/><br/>For reader's sake, I will try to give a good summary of the plot. It is after the apocalypse (obviously), the human race is being enslaved (obviously) by the new leader (who is actually cool looking) who has many funny, half-naked Uncle Festers. Max (now played by Tom Hardy) is like a stuffed animal in front of a car and the Uncle Festers try to capture an escaped Charlize Theron. So that's it. There's really nothing more it it than that.<br/><br/>One good aspect of the film is the cool images. The Uncle Festers, although cornier than their 80s counterparts, actually do look cool. There's one Fester with a sewn chelsea grin that I liked. The lord guy is pretty awesome and the frequent use of the skull logo is pretty badass. But not all of these are perfect. There's a guitar player on the front of a car that plays and shoots fire while the battles happen. But there's no point in him other than to look cool. The fire that shoots out of his guitar don't do anything. Some cars have tons of spikes that look cool, but they all explode right away. There's no point in having these images other than to look cool.<br/><br/>There have been several analysis's about the movie's depiction of survival and feminism. Every movie ever made has themes! Fury Road's use of them are unoriginal and uninspired.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a subpar action movie that is NOT one of the best action films ever like so many people say. It is literally just driving with occasional explosions and shootings. I knew this would find an audience like early Chuck Norris and Van Damme films did, but the critical acclaim and commercial success this has received is horrible. Do yourself a favour and just skip this.<br/><br/>2/4"

","THE ROAD WARRIOR is easily the finest of the quartet; MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the worst. The reason: THE ROAD WARRIOR delved- however briefly- into the CHARACTER of Max the Mad; FURY ROAD deals more with high-octane, pedal-to-the-metal fx. Max himself is literally little more than a hood ornament for the first part of the film. (Is this supposed to be the same character from the first three films...?) His derring-do is undercut by the very CGI that saves him- at least THE ROAD WARRIOR (like, say, George Romero's KNIGHTRIDERS) featured some truly stunning stuntwork; in FURY ROAD there's never any doubt that he'll pull through (as long as programmers at computer terminals have got his back, anyway).

Why no just pour it out efficiently rather than wastefully? The action and fight scenes were cool, but the characters were super shallow, really, hardly anyone said anything.<br/><br/>Immortan was supposed to be some sort of Mohammed Prophet type clearly, but in various scenes he's treated more like an angry dad in front of the worshipers, how then could they be so passionate about him as they showed in the movie? A fun movie, but basically godless, annoyingly stupid, and a whoppingly disappointing end. There was no impression I could get that even if Furiosa even did make a speech to the people at the end when she ""won"" the city, that she would have had the strength, and she didn't, or have been able to say anything impressive, like, ""I and Max here have set you free from this monster who pretended to be God"", why not just a line like that, or why not Max saying, ""I truly do not know this woman, but she and I have slayed a monster for you impostering God, now seek true redemption, whatever that may be"", not even shouting it, but saying it in his low key way on a microphone, it didn't have to be dramatic, but at least something to end the movie well.

Just keep telling the story and let this film stand on it's own merits. Why all the CGI chaos? Jamming in too many characters and adding camp and completely ridiculous action seems like they were overly desperate to make this reboot relevant.

Now zoom into a character we don't care about and show them trying to give some kind of emotion.

","This movie is a good one to catch in theater, esp in 3D, but its not all its cracked up to be. Fortunately, its still better then the movies they've been putting out. At least its watchable! Lets start with the good: Its colorful, action packed, loud, full of explosions. The costuming and makeup is FABULOUS. It lets itself be quirky, which gives it that 80's movie twinkle that looks good on gritty action flicks. It could have been a movie without the shameless mad max branding. Now time for the bad: First off, the plot is weak and a serious rip off of the movie Phoenix the Warrior (1988) and then the scenes of the city are obviously ripping off Metropolis (1927)...Seriously guys? -Max and the 'wives' are weak...Poor character development and motivation. Unrecognizable as a Mad max, hes so unnecessary for the plot that one of the bad guys seems to be the good guy instead. The wives are offensively stereotyped, unrelateable, and poorly cast. The only good acting in the whole movie is from the older women. -There is no gore/splatter and surprisingly little blood or violence for an action flick, it all happens off screen. People survive car crashes that throw them from the vehicle etc without a scratch. At the same time things are stylized, giving the movie a childish, animated feel like they were seeking a PG13 rating. -Finally, technical stuff. The lighting on the CG is poor at best. The CG is weak when the movie is not in 3D (and its full of cringe worthy moments designed for 3D that don't hold up without). The audio of the voices and guns are too low compared to the music and sound effects. Its causes a lot of 'whats happening' moments, because you cant tell what someone said, or that someone shot a gun etc. It doesn't help that everyone is talking in awful put on WWE wrestling voices, calling each other 'brother' like hulk hogan and their accents keep changing. The dialog is TERRIBLE even for an action flick. You cant even understand what all the main characters names are they are so poorly presented."

","I am 34 so I have grown up with Mad Max movies. I went to cinema with loads of expectations. Unfortunately it was an standard Hollywood action movie. There was no Mad Max, there was only Charlize Theron. The accent and the way they speak of the wild savage people was better than today's Oxford University students which is ridiculous. Those people lives in a very hostile place without any education and you do not even expect them to speak at all. But they speak like theatre actors, this puts me off a lot. Script was extremely artificial and most of the the as amateur as very cheap TV movie. Everybody was giving speeches to other all the time. Maybe action wise it was a good movie but that is all, full of clichés.The guy who wrote the script should find a job somewhere else. All the time I felt like that the director has lots of money and wants to prove himself.<br/><br/>I gave six because of the Charlize Theron she was the only person who can act in the movie.<br/><br/>It is very sad to say it was like a theatre with a giant budget. I still feel like it is an insult to original Mad Max series.<br/><br/>Sorry."

It is sad to see these type of movie with no soul or good story line to follow or to get connected..., even gets attention and sells in box office. Even if it draws attention beside 3D... it only indicates there is no good movie to compare with... basically the monopoly of movie industry will end of making more movies like that and it kills people's taste in a long run! In general if you don't get connected from the beginning by an above average story line, you won't get much excited with the fast pace and excitement the director tries to implant in the viewer.

Cliché, violence without reason, so many unneseccary plans, excessive scenes e.t.c.. Only the photography tried to save the whole thing, but it wasn't enough. Tom Hardy can do a lot better than that (just remember Child 44, or Legend). Charlize Theron, was good, but still not enough. So, this can be a message to all those producers and directors.

I could hardly make out what he was saying. Maybe he though he was still Blain. <br/><br/>In the old mad max movies you really got a sense of the desperation, how everything was scarce, I this movie nothing seems scarce, fuel in abundance, weapons and ammo in abundance, cars with more gadgets than a Swiss Army knife, it just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>The plot itself is a joke, half the movie they are riding away being chased, the other half they return from where they came being chased again. I got no feeling for any of the characters , the plot is poor, the acting is poor , there is just no dialogue or depth what so ever.<br/><br/>This movie is just another example of Hollywood polishing up old franchises with special effects but adding no depth or story line to them what so ever."

","I was informed by my scholarly wife that this movie was analyzed/praise for its feminist themes. If that was the case it would explain the warped critical acclaim it received for any that did have anything to do with the visual appeal and sound of the movie. It is a beautiful looking film a la 300 in a different way. Neither of these visually stunning films are appealing as dramas. If they were to promote a film with a ""female/feminist"" led tone it should have been Inside Out. All the major characters in that film were female had depth and you cared about them. That is not the case in this film. And all the critics that gave this film such rave reviews did a major disservice to their readers. Batman vs Superman was decent compared to this and that movie sub-par at best. So much of this film does not make sense. From the rolling rock concert in the middle of a life and death battle to the motivation of the characters once their initial plan goes.

"PopcornLobotomy","5","8","15","21 March 2016"," Mad Max: Spurious Turd? Yah, sorry, I didn't get it.
","Note: This is a text version of my Popcorn Lobotomy Scathing Review video:<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmCBViDyn3w<br/><br/>(The video review is much more fun)<br/><br/>So while you're all salivating like Pavarotti's dogs (yeah, Pavarotti's dogs – I guess dogs drool when they hear the great tenors or something?) at the prospect of a Mad Max Fury Road sequel, I'm left scratching my head.<br/><br/>I mean, how exactly did this movie become such a fan favorite? And more to the point, how did it's popularity end up moving the cigar- chomping, top-hat-wearing out-of-touch stiffs at The Academy to vote for the damned thing?<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm just not into impractically pimped up vehicles, or people in wacky children's face-paint screaming all their lines, but I just didn't get much out of Mad Max Fury Road.<br/><br/>And I'm sorry, I know it's popular, I know this is probably going to tick you all off... but I just don't think one long car chase sequence deserves to be called a movie, no matter how well it's executed, and it CERTAINLY doesn't deserve to pick up anything but technical awards at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Now, obviously some of the action is cool and there are some pretty CGI backgrounds -- got you dazzled did it? -– but without the grounding of an post-2nd-grade-level story and characters I can vaguely relate to, it's all as pointless as pointing out that pointlessness is pointless itself. <br/><br/>Seriously, who cares if Tom Hardy gets hit with an exploding spear if we don't even know who he is or why he's driving recklessly around the desert like Dodi Fayed on a severe acid trip?<br/><br/>Yes, there's a basic functioning back-story where Max's wife and kid get their faces mushed at what appears to be a monster truck rally -- but you could count the screen time devoted to it in frames.<br/><br/>And of course, that's just Max. None of the other characters even get a few frames of flashback to explain their presence in the story or to motivate us to care about them.<br/><br/>So Mad Max paints a dystopic picture of a post-apocalyptic world where people seem be willing to go that extra mile to maximize the risk of losing an eye. <br/><br/>But despite all the sharp edges and hard surfaces, people drive around like maniacs, doing ridiculous stunts and taking really unnecessary risks in a chaotic effort to blow each other up for... I dunno... reasons.<br/><br/>Our hero, Max, spends much of his time chained up, gagged and mounted on the front of a car like some kind of glorified hood ornament. <br/><br/>And even when he finally manages to break free of his chains, he still opts to communicate in gestures and grunts, even when he's threatening to shotgun the tits off a bunch of innocent young girls who are just trying to engage in a little ""wet and wild"" titillation while in mortal danger of being killed or recaptured by the overweight asthmatic master and his cronies. <br/><br/>Of course it's all part of the film's decision to tell it's story is a purely visual fashion, right? Like the silent films of old? And hasn't THAT garnered respect from critics and audiences alike? Oh minimal dialog, how clever, wow, regale us some more George Miller you maestro!<br/><br/>Maybe while you're here, you could explain to me why a movie with minimal dialog makes time to include lines like ""now we bring home the booty"" and ""he's a crazy smeg who eats shlanger""?<br/><br/>And you know, I use the term ""story"" in the loosest of terms here, because Mad Max is a story about a bunch of people who go somewhere to find something, find it's not there and go back to where they started.<br/><br/>Along the way, the most vulnerable and innocent of them, including a pregnant girl and a nice old lady, are killed by a gang of pole vaulting mimes. Then again you could well argue that the pregnant girl didn't die because she was being chased by circus freaks, but that she slipped to her death because that prick Mad Max shot her in the leg earlier in the film.<br/><br/>Honestly, would you even know Max was the hero if his name wasn't 50% of the title?<br/><br/>So now, this piece of crap movie I just described has now won some Oscars. I guess you're all pretty pleased with yourselves, are ya? Changed the face of the Oscars and all that? Pushed through the typical movie snobbery of the Academy Award voters to get recognition for a fan favorite popcorn flick?<br/><br/>But think about it. What have you DONE? I hear a lot of people concerned that the Deadpool movie will spawn a whole bunch of R-Rated comic book movies with shoehorned violence, profanity and nudity. <br/><br/>But what about Mad Max? What types of movies will the cigar chomping Hollywood execs be emboldened to pursue as a result of it's success, huh?<br/><br/>Now it's 100% proved that movies don't need story, character or subtlety to win awards. All you need to do is hire a bunch of Olympic pole vaulters and Javelin-chuckers to bounce around like rejects while you blow stuff up and bring on the Oscar glory.<br/><br/>So get ready for a sting of inferior sequels and copycats, and don't come whining to me when you realize that films have become devoid of story, character or a coherent narrative in favor of flashy action and effects.<br/><br/>Because in this life, we reap what we sow."

","Hi and welcome to the big fix.  My top ten things wrong with film.  1. The support acting was so over the top it nearly made me turn it off  in the first 15 minutes.  2. The main cast script was so poor, they almost got lost. Not too sure  why the main actors took these roles.  3. The never ending chase, man did this seem to go on forever in a  world of fuel shortage.  4. Was there actually a story, alright the Mad Max genre never had much  of a story but i looked and looked but couldn't find any existence.  5. The old peoples home bikers, oh come on...  6. The one thing that i thought might be OK was the action but it  actually added to the nonsense rather than drag it out of its  mediocrity.  7. OK one of the real things that i found bugged me, was the lack of  inspiration in the costumes. it really appeared as if they had used the  previous Mad max costumes. Also the hair styles was..  8. The Cinematography set in Namibia, yes it was not even set in  Australia. Well what can i say, one minute it is plodding along the  next all the scenes are speed-ed up, why would you do that. It makes it  look like a scene from Benny Hill.  9. There must be some serious money behind a film this bad to  get so many good reviews, and then receive so many Oscar nominations.  It just shows the whole film business is contaminated.  10. Wrap up, i really would grade this movie as a 1 to counter balance  the 8.2, and sometimes i might do it on principle, but it does deserve  a 2. I would highly recommend people to never ever see this movie, and  to certainly not waste any money on it. If you have just watched the  Oscars and seen it win all those Oscars this is all just Money talking  and please do not be taken in by it. This really was one of the worst  films of the year."

"behzad-27861","2","8","15","25 January 2016"," For shame!
","Now, since my fellow Mad Max/action/dystopian/post-apocalyptic movie lovers pointed out clearly in their reviews, I'm not going to actually review this utter disappointment of a movie. What I will do, is pointing out the reasons why this shameful endeavor gets so high rankings and praises. The reasons are twofold:<br/><br/>1) Feminism<br/><br/>This movie is like a textbook of feminism/woman empowerment, wrapped up in explosions and car chases, and then marketed with a respectable name to hide this very fact. It's a manifesto, an agenda, fed to the masses in form of a movie. There's enough feminism imagery and symbolism in this very expensive piece of crap that calling it an action movie is laughable.<br/><br/>First we get the evil patriarch, ruling an almost all-male society with cruel control and an iron fist, complete with him wearing his symbol of power as a codpiece! Then we have the exploited, milk producing females, symbolizing male exploitation. This ""dad"" also comes with his own harem, whom he sees as mere objects, complete with a vault door and thorned chastity belts!!! He is ugly, he is dirty, he is evil, he is bad, he is a man. Much like almost every other male character in the movie.<br/><br/>On the opposite front, we have females; caring, model beautiful, clean and dashing for the entire movie, powerful and on the run from the evil ""man"". We also have the amazon woman only promised land of greenery and peace, apparently with tribes named after different parts of female genitals....real classy! To round it out, we even have the love interest of today's feminists: abortion! Yeah, take out that bad man's baby boy out of the sacred mother's body, as violently and as disgustingly as you can! <br/><br/>We get it. Men are ugly, bad, evil things, women are beautiful, good, goddesses. And that's why in a movie called Mad Max, a pair of bolt cutters get more screen time than the sidekick who strangely bears the name of the movie!!!<br/><br/>All this, is the major motivation as to why this movie gets so high ratings and nominations. A few critics are simply feminists, but the majority just wants to ride the band wagon, fearing if they not, they will be called sexists and their jobs and reputations, threatened. Every movie that has pro feminism/gay symbolism beneath an apparently completely different face theme, gets the same treatment. Fear of becoming ostracized has freedom of speech by they balls! For shame!<br/><br/>2) paid reviews<br/><br/>It's very simple. You don't even need to go out of your way. Just check the positive, 10/ 10, reviews here in IMDb. The user names, so orderly and genuine-like alone would give them away. They are not normal Internet users! And if that's not enough, the ala publicity style, back of the box style writings of these so-called reviews, should make it obvious enough that almost all of the perfect score reviews, here and elsewhere, are forgeries. Not done by simple movie-lovers, but paid for and done by professional marketing people. Viral marketing at it's best, and it's worst, to mislead and distract consumers. Dishonest and disgusting!<br/><br/>Again, for shame! For shame, for shame, and for shame!!!"
"bjarias","5","8","15","10 January 2016"," Very sad... unbelievably, this leads the Rotten Tomato list of the top 100 movies of 2015 !!
","So to date it's easily more than doubled the $150 million spent to make it.. and in addition looks like they might have found a replacement for Mel (who's still the best Max by far). So we can now all be sure we'll be seeing more of this very worn out series. Passing off two solid hours of pretty much nothing but constant, mind-numbing crashes and explosions is now what we all have to look forward to in the future. There was not much acting required for this production because there really was not much of any storyline to tell in this overly bland script. But maybe it will make some of the younger generation go back and look at several of the previous works. They might not have been as action packed as this monstrosity... but they were overall much more consistently interesting viewing."

","Disjointed, pointless story with generally poor acting (Max doesn't even say anything for half the film, and when he does, it is more of a superficial grunt. I'm afraid I think the male lead was weak). Female lead is decent, some interesting bad guys and some good fight scenes/special effects, but none of this is enough to elevate this film above the level of dire in my view. They did try to keep some of the charming madness from the original Mad Max, but ultimately, whilst they had some success, the film is let down by the very poor plot and script, and mediocre acting. Ultimately, whilst an action movie, you have to connect with and career about the characters, at least to some degree, but with this film, it simply wasn't possible. Avoid. 4 / 10."
"nathandm-75297","10","3","4","19 December 2019"," The best action film of the decade.
","It was clear to me that George Miller's intention with this soft reboot of Mad Max, was to make a 2-hour long action sequence that tells a story. And this movie accomplishes that ambitious task flawlessly. In this post-apocalyptic wasteland, our anti-hero Max Rockatansky, is captured by the ruthless war boys, who are under the command of the wasteland's dictator, Immortan Joe, who has power over the remaining lives on this deserted planet by controlling the only source of running water guarded by his lovely sons and his war boy army who are on the never ending quest for gasoline, weapons, and utter chaos with the hopes of arriving at the silver and chrome gates of Valhalla. In order to save what remains of the planet from total destruction and slavery, Imperial Furiosa, the badass one armed truck driver and expert sniper will need to team up with Max and the renegade war boy Nux in order to rescue the enslaved wives of Immortan Joe, and find the ""Green Place"" in order to save them selves and find hope in the never ending suffering of the wasteland. What separates an action film like Fury Road from movies directed by Michael Bay or any other boring mindless action film, is that the action in Fury Road means something. The constant fighting and amazingly choreographed chases our characters go through, they go through it because they'll find redemption not only in themselves but also in the post-apocalyptic nightmare in which they come from. The action has significant meaning to the overall theme of this movie which is hope. And on a technical level, this movie is breathtaking. The chases are real, the explosions are real, the vehicles ARE REAL, and because of that, George Miller has a made a film that will forever be timeless. This movie is amazing, I was literally sweating after seeing it in the theaters. It's about as visceral and compelling as an action film gets. 10/10."

While touching on the pressing topic of our world as we know it turning into a desert where water is a high commodity, the film has a lot of heart without verbally saying much. The acting from Theron, Hardy, and Hoult was deep. This film is very visual. From the cinematography, color grading, production design, special effects, and costuming, the film creates this amazing world filled with gold, red, and bright turquoise. It is an interesting combination of skull laden violence from the vehicles and warriors paired with the vast ethereal landscapes and white-clothed females. The combination works as these elements often go hand in hand. I enjoyed the cinematography in the film because it was very dynamic, and the edit worked great with the shots and furthering the story. Although there was minimal dialogue in the film, the soundscape and accompanying score took me into the world of the film. I enjoyed seeing the rock elements incorporated throughout the film."

"boxing-38801","9","3","4","25 January 2017"," For all audiences that love action
","9/10. It's action packed and well balanced with a story. I've never seen a movie that has so greatly balanced the cliché of damsels in distress (while not making it cliché in a way) and also evening it out with a story where women rise from actual oppression. I think this is for any audience type and can be looked at in any view whether it be a feminist perspective of ""the rise against the patriarchy"" or just another save the society from this dystopian nightmare. I went into this absolutely hating the style, the stupid guitar guy and drum people, the whole world's look, character's actions, and the slower start introducing Max and all, but I ended up really admiring it. This movie also does a survival story (@gravity) in the middle of nowhere and doesn't ruin anything when it has not that much dialogue. With barely any talking between the group, you sense the bond the have with all their actions, facial expressions, and etc. It's great movie even though I still have problems with the lack of some dialogue and all the flashbacks, the villain who wasn't even powerful (maybe that's the point ey), and society but either way it's a stunning movie."
"psyshark","5","3","4","23 October 2016"," 5 Stars in total , 10 stars for the special effects , but 1 star for the plot (is there plot at all?)? huge lack of story...
","The movie has no story and is boring so much. but the special effects and camera works are fantastic, so its very sad that they didn't have a story in the movie.<br/><br/>after 1 hour I started dozing off, so what I've done is skipping the rest of scenes quickly, I think that the next 1 hour of the movie I've reduced into 5-10 minutes because nothing changed in the movie, it was the same thing during 2 hours, a truck moving fast, here and there the team (few hot girls and the poor Max) were fixing it, while being chased by groups of amateur actors riding either motorcycles or childish vehicles. so don't expect a story at all. the only good thing which is very professional are the special effects and camera work, but rest of things are missing , no story, and some of actors seemed to be hobbyist rather than professionals (mainly the guys that were chasing the truck), but the hot girls in the truck including Max were acting fine, not bad comparing to other guys.<br/><br/>I've also noticed in some parts of movie a lip sync delay, and it bothers to see the unnatural mismatch of some words and lips moving, that's the first thing that catches my eyes, I believe that any movie must be watched many times in post-production process in order to avoid such a thing, because the production is really very good and very professional, I loved the coloring and composition of all the frames, and the special effects were WOW ! so those little mistakes of lip sync delay could be avoided, the good parts that it wasn't during all the movie, but only in some parts (I think in the first 10-20 minutes).<br/><br/>If the movie had a good story then I would rate it 10/10 stars ! in other words, I can say that that production (special effects, camera work, sound and music) all deserve 10/10 stars. but the plot only 1/10 stars, because there was no story.<br/><br/>One more thing, very important: As other reviewer said previously, the movie should be called Mad ""Furiosa"" instead of Mad Max, because it was focused on the character ""Furiosa"" (a woman), she was acting very good and most of the time majority of the focus was around her instead of Max that didn't look as hero at all. it seems like ""Furiosa"" was the Leading actor (Protagonist) and Max was only a Supporting actor.<br/><br/>So naming the movie Mad Max is misleading, because only some elements from the original Mad Max (from the 80's) were reused in this new movie, such as the vehicles in the desert.<br/><br/>Don't expect to see a MAD person called Max smashing the bad guys, no such a thing, the movie from the 80's with Mel Gibson was way better, were it deserved to be named ""Mad Max"".<br/><br/>Regarding music and sound: The music and sound were very good, the music is matching the style of movie, energetic combined with special effects, the sound design was professional, very clean and creative, but only one little was probably overused, and I don't know who is in charge for those ideas, the sound technician or the director or both, they used a lot of reverb for producing wet sound, which is good when its done properly but when overused then it might sound unnatural and artificial, for example, they were using this trick many time: blinding the sound that was produced from the actors with the music, for example when an actor was hitting a vehicle then the sound of hitting transitioned into music (hitting drums), the transition was done so smooth, but they have used like this trick many times, until it became a predictable, that's because recycling the idea over and over becomes something that the viewer isn't excited from, then it becomes boring, anyway, maybe not everyone notice this thing, it's not a disaster , but it's good point that other filmmakers should be aware of (don't reuse the same tricks many times in the same movie , surprise the viewer all the time).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: if you would like to see nice effects (blowing vehicles) for 2 hours then this is the movie for you, but if you are that type of person who must have a story in a movie, then beware, because you will be bored as hell and very angry for wasting your money."

","I very rarely write a review, usually just giving a rating as the minimum of 10 lines set by IMDb annoys me. However, as a big fan of the original Mad Max movies (the first and second ones, I thought the one with Tina Turner was rubbish), I felt the need to add my thoughts.<br/><br/>When I found the page for Fury Road, I expected an average score of around 6 and was flabbergasted to see such a high score. The plot is weak, there is no acting to speak of and there is way too much CGI. This is a movie for kids and easily impressed adults, consisting of fighting, shooting ad explosions. I'm amazed that George Miller had anything to do with it as it is completely lacking in imagination or vision. Give it a miss and watch the originals instead."

","I've been a hardcore fan of Mad Max since the 1979 film. The Road Warrior was probably one of THE greatest sequels ever. Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, was terribly cheesy in some respects, very campy, but at least stuck to its guns in portraying Max as a HUMAN BEING.<br/><br/>Now we have Mad Max: Fury Road. Oh, George Miller, how you disappoint me and countless other cult fans inspired by your earlier works.<br/><br/>Max in this movie is basically second fiddle to Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa. While they have pretty good synergy, Max doesn't display the kind of humanism which I so admired in the previous films. Hardy is a rather sterile, brutish Max, and though some might disagree I think Mel Gibson did a FAR better job in portraying this tortured soul whose loved ones were brutally slain by the Toecutter et al.<br/><br/>Disappointing, to say the least. Lots of action, sure, but the elements of sweet, sweet vengeance that Max exercised are completely absent from this tawdry action flick."
"Akira-36","9","12","25","6 June 2015"," A madly beautiful post-apocalyptic movie in ages
","Insane. Captivating. Frenetic. Visceral. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is a frenetic roller coaster ride unlike any other. It was written with minimalist dialogue, saturated colour palette and a visceral neck break speed. The smooth blend between practical VFX and CGI makes the movie believable, and yet feels so otherworldly. <br/><br/>Miller & co. directed his movie like fine arts maestros as if it were a motion painting - an artistic expression of art, visual, sound and motion.<br/><br/>In Fury Road, we find Max Rockatansky played by Tom Hardy, haunted by his past (with strobing flashes of characters from the first movie) traversing the bleak desert landscape of a future world where the Earth has become almost barren due to nuclear war. There he struggles to survive by driving his Interceptor car from place to place, avoiding marauding gangs and running away from the ghosts of his past.<br/><br/>We find Max's survival skills intact, wearing the same jacket from the Mel Gibson's days, complete with his cool Interceptor, knee harness and shotgun. I still miss his dog, and it is a pity that the Interceptor is destroyed so quickly in the beginning of the movie. I've read that the video game builds a back story where you control Max and trying to build his Interceptor.<br/><br/>The movie movie is set in a world where food and water are scarce. Nature and humans have mutated, and humanity is enslaved by its own survival instinct. In this chapter, we get a glimpse of a town ruled by Immortan Joe, a disfigured old tyrant, who lives atop a rocky cliff. In the caverns of his palace, he has adequate water, plants and slaves to do his bidding. <br/><br/>From time to time, he would send out his lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa, to retrieve oil from one of the last remaining oil rigs near his town. The movie's plot basically revolves around Furiosa's plot to safely elope with Immortan's wives to the Green Place, her childhood birthplace.<br/><br/>Almost the entire movie is a long string of car chase sequences, that needs to be experienced in the cinema. It's simply a tour de force of the car chase sub-genre. In a time when we have series like The Transporter, Fast Furious and well made post-apocalyptic features - it's amazing how Fury Road can stands on its own weight and deliver something fresh and unique.<br/><br/>I have to say that compared with Gibson's version, Hardy's Max is slightly mad and at times feels like he is just a passenger in Furiosa's story. The scenes with the guitarist, the custom cars and war rigs fights were thrilling and pure popcorn cinema. <br/><br/>Though the level of violence is not as brutal as Mad Max 1 & 2, Fury Road is still dark and unsettling in some places. My wife still finds the movie too violent, but nevertheless entertaining.<br/><br/>Go see it today, you owe yourself a speedy treat!"
"ComradeKubrick","9","12","25","30 May 2015"," A Wild Monstrosity of a Film!
","Few action films have ever displayed such vigorous, elegant, symphonic understanding of cinema. Mad Max: Fury Road is a true celebration of cinema, it is a work of art that is unimaginable in any other medium.<br/><br/>If the Academy knows anything about filmmaking, they should all be writing down George Miller in their bracket for best director, for the man has showed us what it would be like if Vivaldi was alive today, making Action films rather than composing music. The reason I mention Vivaldi is because George Miller's understanding of Action Cinema reminded me several times of Vivaldi's of music; Four Seasons comes to mind especially. While surely the crew around him have done their job expertly, the film really seems like a work of a man with a vision. Every edit, every movement (of either camera, character or vehicle) appear a part of a greater symphony. Several times does the film seemingly build towards climaxes before the conductor lowers his baton, letting the audience breathe before building all up again. The pauses for breathing are few, yet all feel perfectly placed and are just far enough apart that the film is allowed to keep a pace making it seem like the Usian Bolt of film.<br/><br/>The action is absolutely the highlight of this movie, extraordinary, visually spectacular and quite honestly unlike anything we have seen; ever. Yet it seems Miller has also managed to hit the jackpot in his writing (though reportedly there was no proper script while shooting). The movie never tries to hide what it is; the story is simple, sometimes distant, yet it is handled in a such a way that it creates a quite strong emotional connection with the protagonists. The character of Max is interesting enough in himself, and played with an impressively subtle vulnerability by Tom Hardy, yet it with Furiosa, played by Theron (expertly so), that the story truly lies. Her quest strangely enough manages to feel relevant to society today, with the (sadly) still-relevant fight for gender-equality.<br/><br/>The film has by some been described as feminist and rightly so. In having both male and female character fight together against the patriarchal system, it underlines the need for both genders to take part in this struggle that our society still faces. With a noble cause being portrayed in such a sympathetic way, it is made easy to root for the heroes, thus making the already spectacular action even better, by having stakes that feel as if they matter."

Having subjected myself to a painful couple of hours trying to find something in this movie that would give it some redemption, I gave up and went home very disappointed.<br/><br/>I loved the original mad max. I thought the sequel was OK but not in the same league. Beyond thunder dome was appalling and ought to have been the deathnell for the franchise, however Miller has taken all that made thunder dome a piece of Hollywood rubbish and extrapolated this to insult himself, as well as movie makers and movie goers alike. If someone says they have heard good things about this movie don't believe them. Find someone who has actually fallen victim to paying good money to see it and ask them what they thought.<br/><br/>This was the worst movie that I have paid to see by a long shot."
"Jamie_Wallace","5","12","25","22 May 2015"," Action film of the decade?....I think not.
","As a *huge* Mad Max fan, like many others, I've been eagerly awaiting the next offering from George Miller, and I've been excited about it for years.<br/><br/>I saw the first two films when I was very young, and being something of a petrol-head (along with my curious fascination for all things post-apocalyptic), I found them to be absolutely sensational, especially Mad Max 2 aka The Road Warrior. And back in the day, when we used to hire films on a video tape from a shop, I became very familiar with all the cheap, bargain-bucket low budget flicks from the 80's and 90's that Mad Max 2 clearly inspired, and that the various Directors of such films totally ripped off.<br/><br/>And that's the thing right there - Mad Max:Fury Road felt to me like one of those movies, but with a much bigger budget. It's almost like George Miller has created a pastiche of not just those B-movie 'Mad Max 2' copies, but also of a genre and style which he created.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm well aware that this is supposed to be a re-boot, but in many ways, it's 'Mad Max 2', without the realism or the plot. I also realise that part of the angle here, is storytelling with minimal dialogue and character development. But for me, it just didn't work at all. By the time I was halfway through the film, I really couldn't care less about them, or what was actually going to happen. Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult turned in a couple of great performances. However, Hugh Keays-Byrne, another fabulous actor, and brilliant as Toecutter in the original film, was, frankly, laughable, and more like a pantomime villain. How on earth his character was supposed to be a credible, brutal, post-apocalyptic warlord is absolutely beyond me. He looked like a fat, old man, with bits of vacuum cleaner stuck to his head. Christ, I find Barry Scott from the 'Cillet Bang' adverts far more intimidating. But worst of all, Tom Hardy was a major disappointment. He's one of my favourite actors, and fabulous in everything I've ever seen him in.....except this - and he's *not* Max. Again, it's like 'Wheels Of Fire' (1985) or 'Exterminators of the Year 3000' (1983), whereby someone is playing a 'Happy-Shopper', bargain bucket version of Max Rockatansky. Unfortunately for Mr. Hardy, he clearly had very little to work with, very little to do, really, and his performance was stifled somewhat. And on top of that, he was, to all intents and purposes, a secondary player.<br/><br/>It's a Mad Max film, that doesn't predominantly, and essentially, feature Max himself. And neither, does it feature any explanation, background structure, or plot development regarding Max's past, save for the odd weird 'flashback'/nightmare featuring his dead daughter (yet it was his infant *SON* who was killed along with his Wife in the original, but...fine - it's a 'reboot' - you've got carte blanche, Lord Millerumgous). But yeah, nice one, George - we're just automatically supposed to know what those flashbacks mean, aren't we, because we all saw the original film.....right?.... despite the fact that this is meant to be a 'reboot' (the lovably trendy word in the film industry, for recycling something that was great the first time around, and turning it into a disappointing pile of rubbish, whilst capitalising on the name and reputation of the film, to get the paying punters in.)<br/><br/>That's one of the biggest problems with this film - Max isn't the main character. This isn't a 'Mad Max' movie. Another crucial piece in the Mad Max world, is his 'Pursuit Special V8 Interceptor'. It's one of *the* defining things of the first two movies, that in this offering, barely means anything, barely gets used, or is a pivotal part of the film. I saw an interview with George Miller, who stated, regarding Max, that 'the Interceptor is back' and 'that's all he has'. Which is precisely how it was in MM2, and yet here, it barely gets a look in. What we *really* wanted to see, was, essentially, Mad Max 1.5 - we wanted to see the transition between the first and second films, as fans.<br/><br/>Now, as a very keen car/vehicle/machinery enthusiast, I can hugely appreciate the incredible time, effort, design, and execution of the vehicles in this film. To get that lot together working in one place, and choreographed in the action sequences is really quite something. But again, it's like a high-budget pastiche of the original idea. Regardless of how well they're designed and put together, the vehicles are just way over done, and utterly preposterous, frankly.<br/><br/>Like I said, this just *isn't* 'Mad Max', I'm afraid. What it *is*, is a film that Cirio H. Santiago and his coequals would have made, if they been given several hundred metric tonnes of cash and the chance to squander it. This film, could have any title, and different character names. There's practically *nothing* that defines it as a Mad Max film. I've watched the original 3 films quite literally, hundreds of times. I've seen this once - and have no desire to see it again. And thus, it's 5/10 from me, because it's average at best, and only the stunt work makes it scrape in, at that. <br/><br/>There's a saying in the UK, which is fairly self explanatory - 'All fur coat, and no knickers'. I think that perfectly sums it up.<br/><br/>I've read that Tom Hardy has signed up for another 3 MM films. Let's just hope that at least a couple of them will give the fans the sequels (or now, prequels) that they wanted in the first place. Because while this film may cause a new generation to salivate, it leaves the previous one needing a glass of irradiated water. Hey! What's wrong with a little fallout?"
"eobame47","6","12","25","17 May 2015"," Have the critics lost it? It's action without a story, or character development.
","Remember Kill Bill volume 1? Uma Thurman's The Bride/Black Mamba wakes up and starts killing people, but we don't know completely why because all the story and character development is in volume 2. <br/><br/>Remember James Bond: Quantum of Solace? There is a chase in the beginning, but we don't know why, who, or where, and it's never really made clear. I don't remember what happened in that movie.<br/><br/>That's Mad Max: Fury Road. A critic wrote that Action is Character. I disagree. Action is not a substitute for character development, or story-telling. I wanted to know who this new Mad Max was. He was a cop. He lost his wife and kid. That's all that's revealed. We already knew that from 1979's Mad Max, but again that's 1979.<br/><br/>There are decades separating Fury Road from Mad Max, and even Fury Road from Beyond Thunderdome. I don't think using 30 more minutes to establish the setting and the new characters would have hurt. <br/><br/>I wanted to know what brought about the apocalypse. It's never made clear.<br/><br/>I wanted to learn more about the villain, Joe--about the War Boys--about Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa--about the wives. I wanted more of their backstory. I wanted to see more of their emotions. Yet they are all one-dimensional. They are who they are. The movie is all about the action and the chase.<br/><br/>In Fury Road, we have a main character, Max, who doesn't say or express all that much, and Charlize Theron's character doesn't grow. I don't get why the critics loved it. <br/><br/>The cars and the action scenes were cool though."

Furry Road is easily THE most overrated garbage sci-fi to EVER reach the big screen.
False Flag critics thought it was going to win BIG Oscars as a strike against the man for Feminism (or some garbage) but all it ended up winning were sound and FX awards, nothing important (well not the big awards!).
I was actually offended by the terrible story, stodgy acting and dodgy script.
It is EASILY one of the worst reboots/remakes/sequels of ALL time, which is a scathing review in an era where more than 70% of films that open in cinemas (circa 2010-2020) fall into this category.
I have loved Theron in the past, but her hyper feminism is starting to turn my stomach, Hardy/Max is the title character (sort of...) and had no lines, and when you could make them out, they were corny as hell in really weird inconsistent accents???
I wouldn't force my worst enemy to watch this movie and certainly wouldn't chastise ANYONE who wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minutes.
Everything in the movie except the consistent color pallet crumbles under even the slightest scrutiny.

In fact, I think it is the worst action-movie I've ever watched!<br/><br/>Sure, it'll work as background noise while chatting on a day of severe hangover. But ... Nah, if you want to watch a proper movie with a story, where the characters actually speak, something unexpected happens, the characters evolve etc., any other movie will do."
"Tkbn3812","10","4","6","16 January 2018"," Definitely one of the best action flicks ever made
","Mad Max: Fury Road is, hands down, one of the best action movies I've ever seen. It doesn't take its own sweet time with exposition, with dialogue or with establishment, it's just raw action from start to finish. It takes viewers on what is literally a non-stop ride through the desert, racing all the way to the end.<br/><br/>I haven't watched any other Mad Max movies, but there's no need to watch the other three before watching Fury Road; everything still makes sense. The story follows Max (Tom Hardy) as he finds himself helping a driver of a war rig, Furiosa (Charlize Thereon) and her cargo of five women make their way through the desert. But there's a mob of in upwards of fifty vehicles behind them, hunting them down, led by the sinister Imortan Joe.<br/><br/>Action movies are often slowed down by exposition and dialogue, and it's here that Mad Max: Fury Road excels. It doesn't waste it's time on exposition, not one bit. What's Valhalla? Why do the half-childs need blood sacks? Mad Max doesn't waste its time trying to explain every little detail, and it doesn't need to; the viewers just accept the absurdity of what's going on, letting us focus on the action. And that's the thing; the absurdity of everything is just so genius. Why is there a man playing a guitar on a truck? Who cares, just enjoy the movie!<br/><br/>And the movie doesn't waste its time on dialogue either. This review is already longer than all the words Max says in the movie combined. It's just plain genius; Max is just this raw action hero, and we don't need his wild backstory, with him talking every second. We get to just watch this movie without the normal incessant dialogue of an action flick.<br/><br/>That's where this movie definitely cements itself as one of the best action movies of all time. Never before do I think I've seen a movie that just has such non-stop action from the start to the beginning. The film must have a grand total of three static scenes where the protagonists just talk with one another. Everything else is just raw action, unfolding so quickly. The trucks chasing the war rig down are always in the horizon, and we're reminded of it just enough to remember the imminent threat posed to Max, Furiosa and everyone on the war rig. The actual action itself is so good; there's just so much, and the combat methods of both the attackers and defenders is so unique.<br/><br/>The thing with Mad Max: Fury Road, is that it'll probably be the most unique action film you ever see. Right from the get-go the director throws us headfirst into a dystopian world, forcing us to just accept this and let the movie unfolds. And that's fine. Who cares how absurd everything might seem? Just enjoy the action!<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing action movie. I recommend it to just about anyone, and especially to action die-hards. You won't regret it."

","On a cow pie scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10. Non-stop action to stretch a thin (and ridiculous) plot line to 2 hrs. Early on, Hardy's acrobatics are not simply the stuff of MA fighting. They are childishly unrealistic. He meets Theron, and it's obvious they are both running from the same common enemy - yet both continue to think they are adversaries. Perhaps in the future, all will have forgotten the fundamental principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Gas is scarce, yet everyone's chasing them with souped-up racers that burn more fuel in an hour than most of us do in a month. Bullets are prized items, yet somehow everyone's got oddles to spare - enough for Hardy to fire warning shots at the girls.<br/><br/>As some have noted, the CG graphics are amateurish. Plot holes anyone? How about continuing to drive in a sand storm? Or supercharging your engine by pouring gas directly into the intake manifold. Uh, huh. Or on the return trip - presumably a few days later - the bad guys are still there, far from their base, waiting around for...what? Theron's acting is flat, perhaps more because of the script than her own limited range. Hardy is the better actor, but there's little for him to do with his wooden character. Probably more the writer's fault than the director's.<br/><br/>What really bothers me is that so many think this is a really neeto keeno film. It isn't. It's not even good escapism. Character development is minimal for the heroes, and nothing for everyone else; the plot is thin and unconvincing, even if we stretch our credulity to a reasonable limit. The high opinion speaks to the loss of aesthetic judgement so prevalent in this country - perhaps loss of judgement, period."

","""Who was more insane? Me, or every other person?"" In ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" Miller has pushed his Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone distraught to its sensible extraordinary. Never again are the general population of Max Rockatansky's reality just scroungers for oil or power; they have been changed into animals of condition, either left with one characterising need or left with no similarity of reason. ""Fury Road"" is a fierce film, yet the rough demonstrations in this world don't feel like subjective activity beats—they rise up out of an entire absence of different alternatives or a firm feeling of straight-up madness. Mill operator's new vision of Max isn't a warrior. Or maybe, he's a man driven by the recollections of past sins to do minimal more than survive. He strolls with the phantoms of those he couldn't spare, and his voyaging allies have pushed him to the edge of rational soundness. <br/><br/>While meandering at this edge, Max is abducted and changed into a strict blood sack for a non domesticated warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who serves the impulses of his twisted ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who additionally played the reprobate Toecutter in the first ""Mad Max""). From the begin, Miller gives you no opportunity to ""straightforwardness"" into this world or the story he needs to tell. The edge rate is quickened, the altering is hyperactive, the awful person talks through a veil that makes a large portion of his exchange garbled (shades of Hardy's Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises""), and the terrible dreams of Miller's turned future come quick and incensed. Immortan Joe is a scarcely alive irregularity of nature, continued breathing by tubes associated with his face and served by correspondingly distorted half-people with complete names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) and The People Eater (John Howard). <br/><br/>One of Joe's most striking warriors is an effective lady known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is driving an escort from Immortan Joe's fortification to the oil refinery Gastown when she digresses off kilter. Things being what they are Furiosa has captured Joe's ""reproducers,"" the ladies he keeps detainee with an end goal to make a male beneficiary. She's taking them to ""the green place,"" to well-being. Obviously, Joe sends his men after Furiosa—including Nux, to whom Max is still appended— and whatever is left of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" comprises of one since quite a while ago supported pursue over the unforgiving desert. Except for one centrepiece of discourse, the film happens altogether moving, speeding, pursuing, ricocheting, and detonating over Miller's seared scene. <br/><br/>As an impression of more edgy circumstances, Miller has redesigned the necessities of his future world from wares like oil to immaculate survival. Max has been rethought as a battling, driving machine, a man who ""discovers his own specific manner,"" pushing ahead trying to surpass his apparitions. Nux is a mentally conditioned goon, a man-animal who trusts that he will pass on and be renewed subsequent to relinquishing himself for an excursion to Valhalla. Max in the long run ventures into the part of the activity legend, at the same time, in one of his most brave moves, Miller gives the heaviness of the story to Furiosa, a lady who clutches the main thing that could give her trust in this vicious world—the people to come. Theron does apparently the best work of her vocation here, cunningly passing on the drive in Furiosa's spirit in a way that powers the whole film. She accomplishes more with a singing gaze or held jaw than most performers could with a page of discourse. Furthermore, one shouldn't underestimate the strengthening message at the heart of this film—Eve Ensler, creator of ""The Vagina Monologues"" counselled with Miller on the script—which proposes that ladies, as the makers of new life, will, intrinsically, dependably be the sexual orientation that holds hardest onto seek after what's to come. Furiosa takes a gander at the craziness of the male initiative around her and chooses that's the last straw. When one of Furiosa's wards starts giving birth and still safeguards herself and her yet-to-be-conceived youngster (subsequent to being shot no less), it's hard not to see ""Fury Road"" as a response to the macho jabber that so frequently characterises the activity class. <br/><br/>""FURY ROAD"" is the most amazing activity stunt you've found in years, you truly require just hold up a couple of minutes to see something better. This is a film where you continue imagining that its achieved its zenith and afterwards, mysteriously, that minute is abandoned in the tidy. Fury Road"" was destined to be sufficiently noteworthy as an unadulterated specialised achievement—a film that chuckles despite blockbuster CGI bashes with a portion of the best altering and sound plan the class has ever observed—but then Miller goes after an option that is more prominent than specialised ability. He holds high up the activity layout that he made with ""The Road Warrior"" and contends that Hollywood shouldn't have been replicating it for as long as three decades, they ought to have been expanding on it. ""Fury Road"" was a test to an entire era of activity producers, asking them to take after its nervy way into the class' future and, similar to Miller, attempt their hardest to make something new."
"amo_mdd","5","4","6","2 July 2016"," Lower than my expectations and a bit monotonous
","I think the title of my review sums up pretty well my feelings after watching this movie. I believe the Mad Max universe was a great setting and opportunity for something great, building upon the history of the previous Mad Max movies. Instead, there was minimal exploration and discovery of this post apocalyptic world and its societies which where there only as the background. The script was rather monotonous as for the most part this movie is about vehicle chases with fighting. Even if those scenes took half that much it would still be a bit more than needed. The acting was underwhelming to say the least. Not sure what I was expecting but really now, do Tom Hardy or Charlize Theron consider this as a high-mark of their acting careers? The special effects were really were made, with the most impressive probably being that huge storm part, but at some points it was so much that you just knew you were watching 90% post processing and little real camera work. Could it be that I'm looking at this through nostalgia-tinted glasses? It might be, but that doesn't make this movie more interesting or exciting because essentially this is what I feel at the end; that I would not spend 2 more hours watching Fury Road a second time or easily recommend it to anybody. Let's hope the next one is better!"

"jz3532","7","4","6","5 September 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road Review
","As I previously said in my Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior review, my expectations were set pretty high for Mad Max: Fury Road due to all of the praise surrounding it, and I would definitely say these expectations were met. This is probably one of the better recent action flicks, and it reminded me of movies like Speed where the action literally could not stop. While in my opinion it wasn't better than The Road Warrior this film was still very fun, and felt like it could proudly stand on its own, away from the trilogy.<br/><br/>The film follows Max and Furiosa as they try to steal a tanker from an evil dictator and bring his wives to a fantasy-like green place that Furiosa was born in. Unlike the more attached to civilization environments from the original trilogy, Fury Road replaces them with a barren wasteland of dust. I liked this choice for the movie because it makes the audience feel like there is no hope left at all, a theme the film seemed to be going for. To me this film was much more impressive on a technical level than anything else. While I was worried that the use of CGI would damage the film, I was glad to see that it wasn't over used, and when it was used, it was used very well. The lighting and color scheme was also great as the movie changed from the the bright orange day time to the light teal blue nighttime. While teal and orange is defiantly not an original color palette (look up teal and orange movie posters) I thought it was used very well in this film.<br/><br/>To me Mad Max: Fury Road did not feel like a Mad Max film, it felt like a post-apocalyptic action movie that was heavily inspired by the trilogy. They changed the character, the landscape, and the plot structure, and while this wasn't a bad choice, it made me leave the theater thinking I didn't just watch a Mad Max movie.<br/><br/>All in all, even though it had its flaws, the movie didn't take itself too seriously and was simply fun. Watch the trailer, and if you think it looks like fun, then you will like the movie. Also if you liked this film, I would definitely recommend The Road Warrior because in my opinion it is much better. Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, and the best action movie yet this year."

I just cannot believe that it has 8,2 on IMDb when it should be nowhere near that number. I don't know if the world has gone crazy or if the people are just stupid enough to find this piece of rubbish worthy of an Oscar nomination. The whole film seemed as a joke and like a prolonged video of nothing. I know that this is a bad Oscar year but to nominate this as best picture is beyond everything. There is nothing in this film, nothing... where is the art of filmmaking? What happened to telling the story, depth in characters, without black and white technique?

"hfeng-87221","3","10","20","29 November 2015"," A spectacular waste of time
","As a fan of the dystopic movies, I saw the Mad Max trilogy a couple years ago b/c I heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot. I came away amused but disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the over-the-top action sequences and the post-apocalyptic setting (the two sequels in particular). So you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel. But after hearing rave reviews from friends and critics alike, I decided to give the franchise another try, expecting somehow this time would be different.<br/><br/>Apparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasn't enough adrenaline. So he proceeded to make the same mediocre movie, but with everything turned up to 11. Instead of a mere waste time, Fury Road was a spectacular waste of time. I mean this in the literal sense: the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility; and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department. But those positives were rendered hollow by a script (one which I can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 year-old) that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as (spoiler) ""Guy and girl go from point A to point B and back to point A, kill bad guys along the way and save the day"". The chases, fights and explosions soon became trite and, after two exhausting hours, something to be tolerated rather than relished. The handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced, as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the near-constant industrial drumming that filled up most of the soundtrack. In the end, this movie offers neither hope (e.g. Children of Men) nor despair (Brazil), just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again -- at least until the next sequel comes along (which shouldn't be long as there is a 5th installment on the way).<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you're looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot, this is your flick. But if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, if you just want to watch Tom Hardy drive around the whole movie, you would find Locke a far superior alternative."

It was I should have rented one of the old Mad Max films and watched a real movie. Max never really said much. He mostly made guttural sounds and grunts.

"Uriah43","5","10","20","7 August 2015"," Extremely Inflated
","Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average."

","Mad Max in its debut was a terrifying psychological horror, deeply disturbing and with a lingering hurt. You would be drawn into characters, be with them and triumph and suffer with them. The experience was pretty complete, like the whole body and soul comes along on this devastating experience. And what a hero Max was. In his very own lane he was a new prototype anti-hero as far as I could tell...pulled into madness and you knew why. You seriously felt it.<br/><br/>Now what's this ridiculous spectacle of flinging money around like slapping the people in the face, who are most groomed to entertain themselves at that level. I don't mean that in a degrading way, because it's not their fault. If everyone just took a tiny breather, realized that he has easily 2 hours of spare time worth to check out the classics again, they'd know, too: THIS is nothing. Would I want this as a video game, I think...yeah, I could imagine that, but what a waste of resources and phenomenal actors and beautiful people, who could put a piece of dense memory for us onto the screen, yet, it's all but some decadent, mindless, insulting orgy of rating-sensitive soft-core brutality, like one should only expect from a game, really. I'm so not hungry for gore, but when that was essentially to the intensity of a movie, it should be featured properly, like in the original. Even the sequel had countless times the heart.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, my summery up there...well, I remember distinctly that people voiced their hatred over Thunderdome, while I just thought it was a silly ride that still offered enough fun to be well entertained. Sure, then already all depth was long lost, but the general outrage seemed to have drowned the franchise then. Oh, how we have fallen... 8P<br/><br/>I'm not even gonna start thinking about ratings and why the youngest possible ages already have to get dragged into viewing people as cannon fodder, if they don't know them...including some they know, I suppose.

The shots are great, the battle scenes quite intense and the special effects will blow your mind! Fury Road's depiction of the world is visually beautiful, bright and so special that can be surely characterized as pure art.<br/><br/>However Fury Road shouldn't be just that. It's not all about the action scenes and the special effects. All this tense failed to pass to a psychological level. Fury Road could pass a great range of messages but not even tried. The movie shows a post-apocalyptic world where the earth has been utterly destroyed and people have gone mad killing each other for water and fuel throughout a vast wasteland. And all this madness, all this vanity, pain and wretchedness fail to touch you and the acting alone couldn't just do the job. Despite the fact that acting was overly good, especially Charlize Theron is great as Furiosa, lacked emotion. Tom Hardy's dark past didn't seem to affect him as he remained neutral and cold throughout the whole movie. His reactions didn't correspond to the shocking images he kept seeing about the people he failed to save.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Fury Road is an exhilarating action movie with extraordinary artistic cinematography lacking depth.

","I was literally blown away by how disappointing this movie turned out to be. Granted this only happened due to the high expectations generated by ratings in places such as the present one.<br/><br/>I generally tend to find ratings in IMDb fairly in tune with my own, except when it comes to movies targeted to reach a more specific audience... and Mad Max Fury Road seems to fit precisely in that drawer; it is, come to think of it, a movie made for a specific audience to no less an extent than your regular ""chick flick"".<br/><br/>The movie itself is ""punk rock"" all the way through and I am sure this is what Miller intended to achieve so, well done, mate! It would have worked brilliantly for me 15 years ago, the problem is I started listening to other more intricate stuff in between and punk rock just doesn't cut it anymore. Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't bad, it's just been diminished to an overly simplified monotonous repetition of the same basic 2 chords disguised by epic keyboard overtones here and there. It's still punk in all its minimalistic rage and that's why songs last on average 2 minutes and not 2 hours.<br/><br/>I'm alluding here to the general lack of rhythm (for the less musical among you rhythm is not pace/cadence) in this movie, which is understandable since the characters have no context and no opportunity for developing it, they are but animals on a hellish treadmill going full speed sweating those clichÃ©s out like there is no tomorrow.<br/><br/>There is one thing that makes this movie shine bright, the depiction of this imaginary desert world is absolutely filled with artistic detail and its rendition is flawless. In this respect Mad Max Fury Road was an absolute delight. The steampunk and cyberpunk influences are clear and although one would expect them in a suburban environment it is this very juxtaposition that enriched the conceptual design of this world. Not surprisingly though, this universe had been presented before, more notably in Beyond Thunderdome (1985); only to reach full splendor in this 2015 iteration.<br/><br/>Much more could be said in favor and against, but ultimately it is what it is, the deliverance of a competent entertainment product, which seems to be the highest achievement attainable for the movie makers of our days. It could have been the defining cinematic opus of our generation... they almost made it, but they had to want it in the first place."

It is relentlessly breathtaking from the very moment the tail disappears down Max's throat.<br/><br/>The chase, pace and action make anything Fast and Furious have to offer feel positively slow and tedious (which they are anyway).<br/><br/>The characters' personalities doff their hats to the original, Hardy and Theron as dual leads are brilliant, as are the supporting cast. The acting style and visual feel leans towards Mad Max 2. Let's face it, Immortan Joe and his warriors are like Lord Humungus and his band of road warriors wannabes, pure and simple. But that's a good thing because Lord Humungus and his followers were a truly great moment in movie evil.<br/><br/>The 15 certificate for the UK is a joke, my 12 year old daughter (who was looking forward to this after seeing the trailer a dozen times) loved it start to finish. It most definitely is not gory, this movie uses The Evil Deads' style perfectly. Explosions, crashes, collisions, and violence are creatively, subtlety, but sufficiently over the top so as to not have movie goers becoming irked and repulsed by non-stop blood and guts. But fear not because a big chase and large cast make for plenty of ouchies!<br/><br/>With one follow on (at least) to come, the thing that makes this movie stands out is its' use of ""practical"" effects instead of rubbishy CGI and post production visual effects. There might be a big lesson for the movie industry to learn here! Have we moved too far in recent years from the real art of movie making? Definitely a yes when you see a plethora of unimaginative superhero drudgery and computerized dross being pumped out to a mass audience who are being force-fed CGI because their Nintendos and Playstations have long since lost their thrill.<br/><br/>10/10 I cannot fault this movie at all.

","After a few deceptively fluffy and kid-friendly outings, George Miller returns to the Mad Max universe, 30 years after Mel Gibson turned in the keys to the tune of Tina Turner's ""We Don't Need Another Hero"". The question on everyone's mind before the first trailer unleashed an internet frenzy was, in this age of needless reboots, has Miller sold out or has he used this opportunity to finally realize his full vision for the famous saga?<br/><br/>By now you will know that the latter is true, but you might not appreciate to what extent, and how little this implies that you are guaranteed to actually like the result. Miller hasn't just provided an update of Mad Max, or even a reboot. In fact this plays like just another episode in the wild life of his antihero, relegating back- story or origins to one or two short opening lines and brief flashes of past violence. It's also much more than a modernized take: it is early 21st century filmmaking taken to its furthest possible extreme.<br/><br/>Since most blockbusters today are at least partially bathed in Michael Bay's patented orange/teal palette, Fury Road pushes that beyond its aesthetic limits, to quasi-fluorescent territory, creating the impression of a very violent Tex Avery cartoon, or at least one viewed while doing some serious drugs. Plot-wise, it doesn't get any more streamlined than this, or economical, and what you're left with is a hellish landscape populated by astonishingly inventive grotesques, conflicted heroes (our protagonist Max is arguably not THE hero of his own film) and a sustained action sequence.<br/><br/>If this sounds like something you wouldn't enjoy, don't waste your time. If the trailer had you hyperventilating though, what awaits is pure nirvana. The action - most of it the result of practical effects and stunts - sets an unprecedented standard, as does the level of perverse originality in the baddies' physical and moral decrepitude: even in the hallowed company of other Mad Max entries, these are some weird freaks. Finally, the lead duo is pitch-perfect. Most of the attention has fallen on Charlize Theron's fearless Furiosa, but special mention should go to a very subdued Hardy, who beautifully anchors the film and gives it an almost calm, simmering center. Whether grumbling at sights of his stolen gear or fighting for his life in one of the meanest brawls in cinematic history, he makes us believe in this twisted universe, and feel the pain.<br/><br/>This is a journey through hell, Dante's inferno without the sanctimoniousness: distilled to its essence and spiked with cocaine. A wilder ride you will not find this year, perhaps even this decade."

","'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>George Miller's big-budget reboot to his immensely popular post-apocalyptic 'MAD MAX' trilogy (from the 70s and 80s). This one stars Tom Hardy, in the title role, replacing Mel Gibson (who played the role in all three previous films). It also stars Charlize Theron and costars Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne (who also played the villain in the original movie), Nathan Jones, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Josh Helman. Miller directed and co-produced the film, as well as co- wrote the screenplay; with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris (two first time film writers). The story revolves around Max teaming up with another rebellious survivor, named Furiosa, as they try to outrun a crazed cult leader, and his army, and make it across the desert to Furiosa's homeland, with the cult leader's five wives. It was made on a budget of $100 to $150 million, but it's full of impressive practical effects and old school stunts (and a small amount of CGI). It's the first installment in 30 years and although it takes place after the events of the original trilogy, it also reintroduces us to Max; and goes back over his origins, as well as the origins of the world he now lives in. The film has gotten nothing but rave reviews from critics, at an unprecedented level (for a genre action flick like this), and it could be a possible 'Best Picture' contender, come awards time (it should be). I absolutely love this movie!<br/><br/>The setting is, once again, that of a distant, chaotic future; after normal civilization has collapsed, and just about everyone has gone crazy. Max Rockatansky (Hardy) is still a loner survivalist, on the run from his past (and the ghosts of his dead family). He's kidnapped by cultists, called War Boys; an army under the leadership of a fascist dictator named Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne). When a beloved cultist commander, of Joe's, named Furiosa (Theron), goes rogue, and steals his five enslaved wives, Joe leads his whole army after them in pursuit. Furiosa is trying to lead the women to the place where she grew up, in hopes of a better life. She reluctantly teams up with Max, in order to do so.<br/><br/>I think seeing this film in the theater, was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life (and I plan on doing it again, really soon); I recommend to all true cinephiles, that they see it the same way! The visuals are breathtaking and the action is absolutely glorious, and non-stop; it also has an awesome score (by Junkie XL). It's full of extremely bizarre, and memorably quirky, characters too; and it even has a little heart, thrown in, as well. The movie feels like a throwback to the 80s; but it's also a groundbreaking milestone, in film and art (in general), in it's own right. Miller created an amazingly artistic, and disturbingly beautiful, world; of crazy characters and totally insane, and admirably captivating, chaos (as he did with 'THE ROAD WARRIOR', and to a lesser extent 'MAD MAX' and 'MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME'). The film is like 'THE ROAD WARRIOR' times ten though, and I'd rank it among the all-time greatest action movies ever (like 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'THE DARK KNIGHT' and 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'). It's more than an action film though; people call it a 'punk western (on wheels)', which I agree with, but it also celebrates uniqueness and being different (as well as not conforming to popular society). It shows how mental illness can be a good thing; how some of the biggest heroes, among us, are totally mad! Believe all the hype; it's a pure cinematic masterpiece!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0y3MxfaMM"

","A middle of the Road forgettable movie: The hype was too big, and I can see why Gibson turned the movie down years ago. What worked: Tom Hardy hits the mark as the silent, and tormented Max. The director creates a strong visual rock video feel for Fury Road. The first fifteen minutes grabs my attention. What did not work: Once on the road the pursuit chase scene is way too long. A tiresome visual display of C G I. I miss the Gone in 60 second real car stunts! The bad guy characters are cartoonish. Hard for the viewer to relate and hate characters which are similar to the Transformers. What saves Fury Road is the Max character we all know no matter how hardened Max has become there still is a heart of gold in the man. Six out of ten stars. Nothing special here."

I found myself half way through the movie with no words spoken from Tom hardy. I began to think the writers didn't actually write a script for this. Don't get me wrong I saw the first three and enjoyed them immensely, so I sort of knew what I was getting into.

","Mad Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) manage to come together after a massive chase sequence cumulating in them fighting for control. Eventually they start to see they have the same goal, achieve some sort of redemption for their past failures. <br/><br/>What Mad Max lacks in story it makes up for with pulsating action sequence in a constant chase. Fury Road is everything Waterworld wishes it was, except where there was water there is now only sand. A dry desolate world where people act like obedient zombies. The attachment to religion and blind followers is undeniable, taking swings at notions of a women's place is to breed, that an act of sacrifice will be reworded in the afterlife and that the preacher is the same as a god. <br/><br/>The action in the chase sequences is everything Fast and the Furious wishes it was, capturing the stark beauty that the Namib desert has to offer in the background. Golden landscapes and wispy sands. Empty. Hot. But at night it's cold, and saturated in the blue dark. ""Fury Road""really captured the ghostly Southern African desert superbly. And the extreme temperatures from day to night without any character making reference to it.<br/><br/>The traveling band is just awesome and needs a mention.<br/><br/>The oddest aspect would be Hugh Keays-Byrne's inability to act through the costume that resembled something similar to a mask Tom Hardy donned in Batman and blew the character out the water. swing and a miss for Hugh.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult brings a very unexpectedly tender performance to one of the henchmen, Nux.<br/><br/>The costumes are out of this world, not merely the choice in some of the amazing apocalyptic desert couture but the amount of it. The scope is epic and the cinematography captures the amount of depth in these massive shots flawlessly.<br/><br/>In spite of the lack of character development the action is so poised and beautiful to watch without becoming slow and empty.

While the casting of Tom Hardy is enticing, he spends nearly all of the first half of the film with a metal harness covering his face and the rest of his role is reduced down to grunting like a cave man.

And most importantly he was just ""cool"", like Clint Eastwood as The Man with No Name. In fact, a lot of comparisons could be made between the Dollars trilogy and the Max films, until now. Actually, FR feels more like an awful spin-off where the character you really want to see is put to side, out of everyone's way so the filmmakers could make us watch who the film is really about(See Red Sonja). One could still get away with this, if the other film you were using him to build up were any good, but it's not. Oh God, it's not.<br/><br/>It's strange to think the film's title is still Mad Max, almost like they have no confidence in their protagonist's appeal at all. Speaking of Furiosa (who happens to have a name derived from the film's title road), she's about as one-dimensional and uninteresting as the rest of the film. Fury Road really needed to pick a protagonist or at least let her and Max be foils for each other, so that we can get a little character development. There is NONE of that in Fury Road. The only memorable performance comes from Nicholas Hoult, who, strangely enough, seems to be the only one who understands what kind of movie he's in.<br/><br/>And for all those defenders of this film saying that the other Max films were never his story either, let me quell that bulls**t know-nothing argument right now. They were his stories, because he was always an integral part of them. The only one that's not really about him is Beyond Thunderdome, which is/was regarded as the worst of the series, and that's mostly because a bunch of kids hijack the film half way through. The other characters needed him, and though he was always a reluctant hero, he always came through.<br/><br/>Again, he didn't really need to be the focal point of this, but since he happens to go along for the entire runtime of this story, he should at least contribute something other than a random last minute change-of-heart. Otherwise, he's just taking up space, just like this film did in every dead brain cell the human head.<br/><br/>Most of the ideas in this are style over substance. For example: lots of weird spiky cars blowing up, a woman with a robotic arm, a strange breast-milking facility, a giant safe to keep concubine slaves.<br/><br/>They've compared this to The Road Warrior because supposedly both films are ""one long chase"". Apparently, nobody's seen The Road Warrior because while there are numerous chases in that film (done far better than FR's garbage effects by the way), the film is first and foremost a Western. The Lone Hero wanders into the weak but good-natured town and must reluctantly save them from various bandits and marauders lurking in the badlands. All the Mad Max films were Westerns where the old West was exchanged for a post-apocalyptic outback, and instead of horse rides and gunfights we were treated to high-octane car chases and makeshift guerrilla warfare. In short, it's not about how many cars you could crash, but how much you care about the memorable albeit simplistic characters of his very strange world.<br/><br/>Anybody who says this film has anything praiseworthy at all(even nearly all the critics we respect) has no idea what their talking about. Either this is a truly strange case of bandwagon fever gone tragically awry or the whole world truly has gone mad."

I respect the ambition that the director and the actors had in creating such a grandiose action movie. But behind the excellent visuals, it feels like a typical action film geared toward the male 15-35 demographic.<br/><br/>It's a male power fantasy full of guns, fire, explosions, chainsaws, motorbikes and armed trucks. The story is generic. The characters and world lack depth. For that reason, I'm not given much reason to care or understand either..

"bob the moo","Null","7","13","26 September 2015"," Admirable in its commitment and scale, but certainly not what the hype suggests
","It seemed to me that few people did not totally love this film, and I cannot think of any time on social media or reviews that I saw many negative words about it. So I was keen to see it once it came to being released for the home viewing. Undeniably the film is committed to what it is doing and it seems determined to make this world real simply by the force of its own will. As a result there does not seem any excess that is out of place, even if for me personally this also worked against the film. The simple plot allows the action to be the all, and in some ways it is enjoyably metallic – with impacts, grinding of parts, the smell of grease. However on the other side the sense of vaudeville that it has detracts from the actual feeling of tension and violence it should have. That it didn't manage to draw me into its creation meant that the constant action felt like a show rather than something with real consequence and risk.<br/><br/>That is not to say that it isn't enjoyable, because as a show it is often quite the show. I am not sure why this content-light blockbuster got so much praise versus any other blockbuster heavy on action but light on plot, but it did. Visually it is endlessly interesting; the crazy nonsense of the vehicles and the action sequences combine with some great cinematography – over-saturating everything and adding to that sense of otherworldly extremes. The cast do the same and have that 'committed' approach that the film has – whether their performances make sense or not. Theron is the most engaging of the piece, with a very strong and yet emotive character. Hardy is a good presence but surprisingly not particularly interesting as a title character. Hoult is better, and the female support characters see good turns from Huntington- Whiteley (I know – surprising), Kravitz, Eaton, and others.<br/><br/>It is a film that simply does what it sets out to do and doesn't seem to worry about whether it will work or not. In this way it does have strong forward motion, and never lack confidence. However the sense of performance and show to it does rob it of a hook to draw the viewer in, and as such it is always a blockbuster, even if the grimy metallic aspects suggest it is more 'proper' than other films doing much the same for a wider audience. Good for what it is, but certainly not worthy of the endless waves of praise hitting it this summer."
"maxastree","7","7","13","22 June 2015"," mindless violence with harsh, survivalist set design
","There's an issue of sorts among Australian (and to an extent New Zealand) males about what masculinity is, what is means to be 'tough', 'resilient', 'fearless' etc in these post-colonial countries, and the complex can't be more feverishly illustrated than in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"".<br/><br/>Also, I can't help but feel that the overwhelmingly positive newspaper reviews are more a reaction to the long-held discrimination of sexism in the US, as they insist over and over again that the film is 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', and 'must-see cinema', essentially because there's a bald-headed female warrior on the run from a tribe of barbarians, trying to protect females from a clan of deformed, repulsive mutants and skinhead freaks with guns.<br/><br/>Although, yes, that is a noble reason to retool an action franchise, it was also done in the mid 80s by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (back when the original Mad Max trilogy was circulating in video rental stores), and actually the chief antagonist in Fury Road notably resembles the Predator from 1987 if you squint a little.<br/><br/>So whats all the fuss about? Not sure really - MM:FR has a sense of black comedy to the essentially threatening undertones of the film, and some thoroughly awesome cinematography and production design regarding the vehicles, but it's essentially just a chase movie, and there's only so many ways you can frame a punch to the head, a wild leap from a moving vehicle or a screaming car crash until you realize the entire movies about trigger happy machismo (or whatever the femme equivalent of machismo is) and dangerously shot stunts - the film doesn't have any notable dialogue or character development at all.<br/><br/>Apparently, if this is the new 'gold standard' for hard boiled action escapism, I have to say that it's a much better film in 2D than 3D; also DVD versions of the release appear to have one or two gross details removed, not that it detracts from the non-stop tension and ambitious prop design throughout."

","Lots of action and cool vehicles and crazy post-apocalyptic freaks but flat, uninteresting characters, no good dialogue and a boring, simplistic story.<br/><br/>The fat-lipped inexpressive Tom Hardy has absolutely ZERO charisma compared to Gibson's Mad Max. Calling him Mad Max was basically pointless, as he was more of a supporting character to Furiosa and the film was not really about him. The Mad Max character could have been anyone. None of the other characters were very well developed except maybe Nux and Furiosa.<br/><br/>My theory is that Miller actually looks at this as a reboot with a FEMALE Mad Max, Imperator (Max) Furiosa (Mad). Imperator Furiosa in this film is far more like the familiar Mad Max character we know than Hardy's character. Miller pulled a real sneaky one here.<br/><br/>If you are an ADHD suffering video game junkie then I guess this is an amazing movie, but if you like stupid, useless boring old- fashioned stuff in movies like stories, fleshed out characters you can identify with and memorable dialogue you will probably be very disappointed.<br/><br/>Watching this was like playing a video game for two hours, or rather watching someone else play the game."

","I either watch a movie all the way through or decide its crap early and turn it off. However, this movie was so bad that I actually found myself watching it in stunned disbelief, unwilling to turn off in case I missed a bit of the (almost) entertaining dreadfulness. Where do I start? So, a group of randy 13-year-old nerds who, up to the time they were summoned, spent their lives playing violent computer games in their darkened bedrooms get called up by a major Hollywood studio to write and direct the new Mad Max movie. <br/><br/>So far so good, I guess. <br/><br/>Kids basically want to include three things: cool cars, gory death; and semi-naked babes (they are 13 remember; their vocab is limited) in situations where their clothes come off a lot. And all of this put to screeching death-metal soundtracks. Hollywood studio agrees. Car are designed that look like doodles done during an LSD trip. The most over-the-top death stunts are cooked up (and these kids have lived their lives playing Grand Theft, so they're good at this bit). A bunch of nubile models is recruited and then hosed down a few times to test if their clothes become see through. They do. Good to go. They're only 13, so now comes the tricky part, putting this great movie together. Nah, more fun to just throw it up in the air and see what comes down.<br/><br/>Ah, one nubile semi-clad female seems to have ended up playing the Mad Max role. Was that intended? Never mind. They plough on. Yikes. No one told us this was a world without water!!! We've got the bestest scene ever of a mountain-full of water being poured out into the sand! We want it kept in! And the nubile chicks! Their t-shirts need to be hosed down with water too! Ahhhh. Don't make us lose the wet T-shirt scene! Lose the rest (coherent plot, good acting, engaging dialogue, realistic setting, or emotional impact) but keep the wet T- shirts! <br/><br/>Hollywood studio wonders if recruiting 13-year-old to write their movies was such a good idea, but agree to the terms: plot out, wet T- shirts in. <br/><br/>Huh. <br/><br/>People are fooled. Money rolls in. So, onto the next big budget franchise movie... Anyone know any 10- year-olds?"

","This film contains so many scene references to the original it becomes annoying and boring after just 20 short minutes. If you loved the first three Mad Max films, the continual references to the highlights of the first three films become an awful and inescapable cliché. Combine that with an ending straight out of the lesser-known (and much better) 80s flick Solarbabies and you've got yourself essentially a high budget B movie.<br/><br/>There are also other huge deficiencies. Max has very little dialogue and is an extremely boring character. Max had a son in the original, not a daughter. Max's Dodge Interceptor was destroyed in the Road Warrior, and yet Max is driving it in the opening scene of this drivel. Every car in this film has a blower, not just Max's car. The little men running around covered in a white powder with black markings on their face? That's a straight ripoff of a character in Beyond Thunderdome. <br/><br/>Did not the writer have a single unique contribution to the series? Yes he did: Max has a psychic premonition in which his daughter saves his life. Now Mad Max has spirits and is a religious film? What a load of crap!<br/><br/>The continual road fighting is so exhausting, they should have named the film ""Mad Max: Two days on a truck"".<br/><br/>You know what would have made this film so much better?

","My expectations where high for this movie as I very much liked the originals and the trailer looked awesome, but unfortunately nothing in the movie lived up to my expectations. <br/><br/>Starting out with the casting of Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky. Perhaps it is me, but in the entire movie he's outplayed by both Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult. He doesn't show any of the charisma that Mel Gibson presented in the original series. The troubled background of Max is not shown or little referred too and the character is more following the events than creating them.<br/><br/>Nux (Nicholas Hoult), on the other hand, was a pleasant surprise and added some kick to an otherwise lame story. The same goes for Imperator Furiosa (whatever an Imperator may be) played by Charlize Theron. The other characters are more or less OK, but don't 'really' add to the story, including Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Concerning the story, it's the most lame of all Mad Max movies. No background, no timing and the story is limited to driving from point A to point B and back again. There is no information given whatsoever about the tribes and how they work and what their relation to one another is, nor about the hierarchy or the way of living. The hints throughout the movie leave you guessing too much.<br/><br/>An additional credit for the movie are the visual Fx. The driving into an upcoming sandstorm was cinematographically very nice.<br/><br/>The end verdict would be that it is a decent Friday night movie, but not something you want to spend too much cash on."

","Max has been captured and is being used as a human blood-bag when he is dragged along into a desert chase, to recapture women on the run with the one armed Furiosa.<br/><br/>I, like many, was blown away by the trailer of Mad Max: Fury Road. The chaotic zen of action symphony was something I made sure I wasn't going to miss when it hit theatres. Tom Hardy fills the role of Max, originally played by Mel Gibson. We get very little in terms of story and character development from him. The little we do get is in glimpses of a flashback that seems to haunt him. Someone or some people, he couldn't save from the horrors of this post- apocalyptic landscape. Despite the film barring his name for the title, it seems that Charlize Theron's Furiosa is more of a lead here. The one armed soldier has just as much, if not more screen time than Hardy. This is Theron's film, no doubt and she steals the show from Hardy. <br/><br/>Rounding out the rest of the cast is Nicholas Hoult, AKA Beast from the recent X-Men films, as one sick puppy determined to serve the antagonist till the day he dies. He's the demented one using Max as a blood-bag. He serves Immortan Joe, played by original Mad MAx baddie Hugh Keays-Byrne. He's a twisted villain who looks the part. Everyone looks the part, that's where this film excels at. The costume and make-up design for this film is astounding. I hope it receives some sort of recognition come awards season time. <br/><br/>Where else does this film excel at? Why the action of course. The choreography in this film is astounding. Miller has raised the bar here. I never once lost my place in the action. Miller always had something new up his sleeve and just when our heroes felt that they dealt with something, here comes something new. This two hour car chase was never dull, never repetitive and always on-point. I had a big goofy smile on my face the entire time. Right from the chaotic beginning to the climatic end. That's what I loved about this film, it doesn't take time to explain things to you with exposition. It immediately plunges you down into their world and dares you to keep up with it. <br/><br/>Mad Max is bold, thrilling, exciting, chaotic and so much damn fun. People want to complain about zero characterization. I beg to differ. The film gave just enough characterization for me to care. A lot of this film is ambiguous. Why things are the way they are, who people are and their intentions. I like it that way. The film is all about being in the moment. As for this moment...I want to go see it again."

"bayardhiler","3","27","69","15 May 2015"," What are people Thinking!
","Looking at all the praise 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has been getting, I am completely and utterly dumbfounded as to how so many people can be so blind. Me and a group of friends went to see this on the basis of so many people, including critics, praising it as a ""masterpiece"" or an awesome film. Instead, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a complete and utter disaster and certainly not worth the $12 me and my companions spent. Why you ask? Well, for starters, the film doesn't explain ANYTHINHG to the audience. Yes, obviously we know this takes place in post-apocalyptic world and there's a guy named Max (Tom Hardy) who's trying to help a tough as nails driver named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) get a group of pretty female slaves away from some bad guy with a skull mask, some sort of breathing apparatus and a deep voice. Sounds kind of cool, except the film does a terrible job explaining a few things, like who the hell is he (His name's Immortan Joe but we only know that from a few times his name is spoken), why are some of his henchmen ghost white, what's with them needing blood, and why should we ultimately care whether our characters prevail against him or not? The film has absolutely no character or story development what so ever and the movie moves so fast that almost nothing sinks in. <br/><br/>For example, other than Max and Furisoa, I don't think I knew any of the characters names in this film, much less develop any incentive to care whether they live or die. Me and my friends didn't feel any emotion from the characters predicament simply because there is no story or anything to care about. All they seem to do is drive around the desert and fight bad guys. That's it! Another fault is the fast-paced visions Max keeps seeing of his family, who apparently died but it's never explained how or why. After a while, the visions become annoying, ridiculous and fail to really add anything to the overall picture. It's possible that the death of his family was explained in the previous films but I only saw bits and pieces of the first one and that was years ago! The filmmakers seem to be operating on the assumption that everyone in the audience saw the previous films and that's an enormous mistake to make. If they wanted to reestablish the character Max, then actually do so by giving us a little background on him. Now, with all that said, the film did have some decent merits. Some of the car chases were pretty cool, admittedly, as were some of the vehicles themselves, many of them looking bad-ass. And the woman used as the models aren't bad to look at either.<br/><br/>As for acting, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron do a decent job acting wise, though Theron's character seems to dominate the screen more than Max does and the film is named after him, right? These are the only reasons why I'm not giving the film a completely awful rating. But flashy visuals and awesome explosions don't make a movie people. If that were the case, Michael Bay would be heralded as the greatest filmmaker of our time. Yes, I know it's an action film, and you shouldn't go in expecting to see ""Citizen Kane"". However, you need there to be some character development and plot, even if its an action film folks and especially if the movie takes place in a fantasy or futuristic world to explain what's going on. To really put things in perspective, even the big, cheesy 80's action films with guys like Schwarzenegger, Jean Claude Van Damme, or Steven Seagal had far more character and story development than this did! And I'd also like to state that not only did neither me or my companions like this, but almost no one in the theater did either. After the last scene cut, there was complete and utter silence and I certainly didn't hear anyone praising it as we stepped outside. In fact, I overheard one guy saying if he could turn his Regal card in for cash! Bottom line, I love action films but I can't give thumbs up to a movie that doesn't give us any incentive to care about its story. If you're looking for a decent film, look someplace else and as for all those who are praising it, just how much money did the studio pay you to say those things!"

I love the old franchise, I had a doubt this film could match the greatness and the tension of old franchise But when I saw the trailer, my old opinion definitely would be wrong, but I was afraid because usually when I have high expectation before I watch a movie, it'd be disappointed. But this movie is an exception, this movie's really exceed my expectation, I mean, It was a superb! Fury road definitely the best movie of the franchise and maybe the best action movie! it's the best cinematic experience I've seen since gravity. The visual effect, cinematography, sound, score and the design was incredible, maybe this movie can get some Oscar recognition for the effect. all the performance was very good to, but charlize theron's performance is the one who should get our thumbs! I'll be mad if charlize doesn't get an Oscar performance next year!(Although Oscar's never really about this kind of movie And george miller, what kind of human is he? How could a director made that amazing movie?!<br/><br/>very recommended for all people in the world who still live! If you haven't watch it, watch it now!!<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad English"
"subscripcion","10","13","29","16 May 2015"," Loved everything about this movie
","Charlize Theron was top-notch, her face expressions were so genuine it's scary. I loved Max, so vulnerable from the beginning of the movie, small talk, dark, sad past. Non-stop action, I can't imagine how somebody can pack so much action in a movie, this director is passed genius! Truly a movie worth every merit. Movies and directors will be measured based on this movie from now on. Mechanical effects marvel in every way, so many details, such clever invention and re-writing of common day life items and human life. The Matrix of this decade. So many little details are there for you to grab if you're curious enough. Oh what a movie, what a lovely movie!"

","First of all. If you don't like this type of post-apocalyptic action based movie genre you don't go to watch it just because everyone is talking about it. This is not some drama/triller or whatever with deep story.. This is pure dose of adrenaline. Action based movie with best 3D effects i have ever experienced in the cinema. Not a single boring minute. If you like stunt/monster truck shows, watching this is something like that. You have a feeling that you are watching best stunt performance ever with lots of action :D The design of vehicles, locations, characters and whole mad max world is just amazing.I like it a lot. I'm fan of this genre whole my life.<br/><br/>But of course something is missing. Tom Hardy was good but he is not Mel Gibson, i think whatever actor they choose it would be the same. It's not the same feeling like in old movies. Mel is just irreplaceable. And why to force it with a new version of mad max when you can build in this big post-apocalyptic world a new story with a new hero or heroine(my opinion). In that case i think in this part Max was just a background character because Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa kicked ass.. Definitely ruled the movie with amazing acting performance. I like her character. This will turn into classic! One of best movies eveeeer made :D"

","Q: What does Chinatown (1979) and On the Waterfront (1954) have in common with Mad Max:Fury Road (2015)?<br/><br/>A: They are all within several points each other on the IMDb top 250 list. <br/><br/>That's right, the wickedly brilliant film-noir classic and the famously acted and directed social drama of its time are both rated similarly to Mad Max. Where does one go from here?<br/><br/>On one hand, Mad Max, just might achieve a new standard for non-stop action & stunt work. Bravo. On the other hand, it is one of the most unbelievably juvenile written scripts I have ever encountered. Shameful.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, all the money and amazing craftsmanship cannot hide the fact that the emperor really is not wearing any clothes. I suspect, and truly hope, that after 10 years or so, when those praising this film as a masterpiece, see this film again, maybe even with their own children, their first comment after viewing it is , ""What was I thinking?"""
"RaisinHellRemmy","5","10","21","22 June 2015"," Crapfest
","Today I saw one of the worst Hollywood attempts at salvaging a dead franchise. Mad Max was the definitive mans-man who played second fiddle to no one be it male or female. There are so many things wrong with this movie, both storyline and defying the laws of physics and I don't know how to react. I shall give it a go. Starting off, being a die hard Mad Max fan from the early days I went into this movie ready to fall in love (even though Eve Ensler consulted on and changed a lot of the movie). All of Mad Maxs' traits, which made him the bad-ass I loved, were in fact given to Furiosa. She also took the reins and the movie then became ""Imperator Furiosa: Fury Road"" It was an ultra-progressive feminist crapfest surrounded with action and CGI to die for. The action and effects are the only reason I didn't give this movie a 1."
"paulortiz12","3","10","21","26 May 2015"," Blew its load way too early and had nothing else to offer
","I have to give this film some stars for the things I thought it did well; the vehicle design, some of the camera work, the scale of the environment (however bland it was); all very impressive. On a big TV, at home, with the guys and a few beers I'm sure it's fun.<br/><br/>With that said, after the first half an hour I realised that I'd seen everything this movie had to offer. Driving, shooting, exploding, and lots of sand. This wouldn't have been so bad had there been any meaningful dialogue to break up the frantic action sequences. But the film never settled down for more than a few minutes before the sound of distant engines and gunfire signalled yet another impending chase sequence.<br/><br/>I appreciate that for some people, that's a good thing. But not for me. As an action movie, yeah it's probably very good (setting aside the fact that the first and second half are basically the same, but mirrored). But with all of the praise being heaped upon it, you'd swear it was something more. It's really not. If Michael Bay had made this movie, it'd get trashed."
"gpreciat","6","10","21","23 May 2015"," It was so ridiculous that it was funny
","I am really amazed how many good reviews I am seeing on this site for this movie. Although I must admit it wasn't really bad, I would never called it good. A lot of people have pointed out, the photography, the music...all the technical things, and I must admit that indeed they are very well done. The main problem of this movie wasn't in that, it was in the casting and the plot. So the movie begins, and as almost it begins the action too, which as all of the people who watched, I too love my action, but in giving the ""action"" the audience wanted I understood nothing about the plot, because it was never developed. I never got what were those white humans, why were they white, and why did they capture people for the blood, and I must admit I have never watched Mel Gibson's movie or read the comics (I heard there were comics about it), but a movie shouldn't need the help of other mediums, specially when its not a sequel. So I didn't either understand why the wives were so important. The second problem was the casting, Charlize Theron stole the whole movie. Between the supposedly main character Max and the wives, it was like I was seeing a high school play instead of a movie, and as I said Charlize Theron didn't help matters by showing the great actress she is. The third thing that was an issue or maybe not was the ridiculousness of everything, starting with the guitarist playing the guitar while thousands of people were dying around him, every time I saw him, I laugh my head off. Then you have the medical stuff, the blood transfusion while not even caring the type of blood of the donor. And look, I do not have a problem with a little fantasy in my movies, but in a world that was stated that it came from ours, it was unbelievable. Then the funniest thing were the people flying on the poles (I loved the acrobatics) And I'm sure the movie wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but it ended up being that. Anyhow at the end of it, I suppose it was entertaining, even with its faults."

"Tweetienator","10","6","11","24 May 2017"," Superb Oldschool Action
","Well, I re-watched Mad Max: Fury Road again (5th or 6th time) and the movie stands the test of time - this is a hell of a trip and all those reviews who are negative don't understand one simple fact: this movie doesn't intend to be something else than it is - a postapocalyptic joyride on the wheels of hell. The story may not be the most sophisticated one (but tbh none of the movies of the Mad Max franchise are) but it gives what it promises: A trip on the fury road. A big bonus imo is especially all the ""analog"" done stunts - if I compare this with these Fast and Furios movies for example, where almost every action scene screams CGI, I am really happy to watch this ""traditional"" done action scenes, which are btw just stunning.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is just great and superb. I also like Tom Hardy as Mad Max (okay Mel I like more, but anyway) and Charlize Theron shows again that she can play all sorts/genres of movies and characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed and will enjoy this one greatly, and I am eager to see the next movie of the series. Imo we need some more - so we can binge watch this over a whole weekend. That's my future plan for living, an aim worth for staying alive ;) All thumbs up - well done, Mr. Miller!"

"thegitt","5","6","11","26 May 2016"," Wacky Races on steroids!
","I actually had quite high hopes for this film. I had heard good things from friends, from some critics and though a 6 time Oscar winner would be quite good. Oh how wrong was I! A film such as this was never going to have a fascist style dictator in a dystopian world emerge victorious, but a little bit of fight in them wouldn't have gone amiss. The fact that within the first thirty minutes of the film you knew they would escape with as little as a scratch infuriated me. The whole ""chase"" idea just turned into one long race, which was closer to Pod Racing in The Phantom Mence. The acting in the film was mild at best. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theorn are two very good actors who were reduced to little more than grunts and tepid dialogue for the whole two hours of pointlessness. The only thing that this film truly does get right though is the cinematography! A beautiful example of how CGI should be done."
"sbierly","6","6","11","6 March 2016"," Seriously questioning the integrity of the Oscars now...
","I don't get it. I placed this film on my watch list simply due to the Oscar attention, and wins, although I was seriously skeptical that a movie of this sort was really all that. I figured that beyond the way it looked in the trailers that I so easily dismissed, they must have really broken artistic ground, must have knocked the acting out of the park, the story, they must have really done something special here. Nope! The movie was worse than any low expectations I initially had.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, I watched this movie following a debate about the integrity of the Oscars--which I defended!--and then we watched this movie. Now I have my doubts, there is simply no rational explanation for the accolades bestowed upon this film beyond some ulterior motives, beyond somebody making money on this process.<br/><br/>The characters in this film were all caricatures of anything that made any sense, yet so amped-up and just silly that the it seemed everyone involved was on speed while writing, producing, and acting this out. Completely hollow characters, shallow and essentially empty plot, the film managed to be riveting only through non-stop action that as I look back feels a bit like a PTSD recollection of Clockwork Orange Alex watching it strapped down with eyes forced open.<br/><br/>The movie was indeed a visual wonder and spectacle, and I enjoyed watching it. If it was just there, adorned with low expectations, looking unloved, and I watched it without bias--then, perhaps, would I simply say ""wow, what a neat blockbuster extravaganza, typical Hollywood, shallow, but who cares, it was fun"". But for this movie to win all these awards, I feel completely sick about the entire Oscars enterprise. Between this, and the fiasco of the worst Oscars ceremony I've ever witnessed, they now have a long way to go before I pay as much attention to them as I once did. Too bad..."

","I haven't seen all of Mad Max movies the franchise is a remake of but I can tell you it wasn't as good as I thought the movie would be.When you see Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron in a cast,you expect a gritty story & great acting.Special effects in the movie are all right but story simply too simplistic & never really thrilling for me.Even violence quotient is nothing special.To me,best sequence of the movie was right at the start before they roll the starting credits..after that,it just goes downhill!The story started out with a promise of almost Schizophrenic episodes of Max but after that,highlight of the movie is character of Nux overshadowing everyone else.At the end ,it just fizzles out.Worth a one-time watch for it's VFX-laced action sequences though."

"Critomaton","8","6","11","17 May 2015"," Thunderdome Shmunderdome - This is landmark movie-making
","Wow! Mad Max: Fury Road lived up to the expectations set by its trailer. And I know I need to see it again. In fact, this movie was so intense that there were scenes I actually needed to see again while they were still ongoing. <br/><br/>But here's the weird part: As epic and spectacular as Fury Road is, I still think the first two are better films (and Fury Road certainly makes up for the letdown that was Beyond Thunderdome, even though it was a long time coming). Maybe it will become clearer why I think that by the end of the review. Maybe not. <br/><br/>I'm just gonna throw out some thoughts about the movie. After watching this I don't have the energy for an in-depth analysis.<br/><br/>See it in 3D in the largest, loudest format you can.<br/><br/>I like that there is a bit more backstory and humanizing dialog among what would otherwise appear to be minor villains. Even just basic chit-chat like ""Hey, where are we going?"" is refreshing compared to Wez's screaming.<br/><br/>There are a few surprisingly emotional scenes that add a level of complexity to Immortan Joe that is unusual for any Mad Max villain, but these were the exception, and overall he felt somewhat underdeveloped as a character.<br/><br/>I didn't expect it, but the weak link here is Tom Hardy. Early on, it seemed that he was trying very hard - and succeeding - to channel the desperation, mistrust, and ultimate survival skills of the Max Rockatansky we first met 36 years ago. But then it sort of falls apart and he settles for a weird hybrid British/Australian/American accent and an overall bland performance. This Max is no Bane. He's barely even the Scarecrow.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I blame Mel Gibson that this movie wasn't quite as good as it could have been. If not for the various misbehaviors that put him out of public favor, this could have been a great opportunity for him to reprise the role of Max. On the other hand, Fury Road is not so much about Max as it is about the story (which is super-basic, I can see why some people complain about lack of plot). <br/><br/>The action is practically non-stop. What seems like a bit of a lull in the middle is probably no more than 5 minutes long.<br/><br/>The score is big and bold, and fits the action in most cases, though it is a bit too orchestral and less frantic or desperate than the themes in Mad Max or Mad Max 2. *Edit* After multiple viewings, I retract the previous statement. The score, particularly during the motorcycle attack, is perfectly majestic and heroic and urgent and stirs exactly the right emotions.<br/><br/>In fact, that's another minor complaint. This movie is hyper-polished: Every scene is visually perfect. Every background sound is orchestrated. Not a piece of rust or a jagged spike is out of place. It's a dystopian utopia. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, I kind of wished they'd been consistent and used another Mack Truck for the war rig, but oh well, I guess the OshKosh or whatever military truck they used was heavier duty. And I have to say - the vehicles in this movie were insane - crazier than any Hot Wheels car I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Sure, there's a fair amount of ""Men are bad"" in this movie, but let's be real: most of the men in this movie are bad and men in real life are pretty bad a lot of the time too. I think real men ought to be able to handle this plot element without throwing a conniption. Besides, if George Miller was serious about the feminism angle he wouldn't have had one of the Vuvalini riding a Gold Wing in the post-apocalypse. <br/><br/>There are lots of really cool touches in the movie in the action sequences. Just to mention a few without spoiling them too much: The cowcatcher on the war rig is quite functional, and never siphon dragster fuel by mouth...<br/><br/>The ending works well. Sure, it's kind of a happy ending, but with only one really happy ending out of four movies, you can't complain that George Miller is trying to blow sunshine up your a**.<br/><br/>I'm sure I need to see this movie again, probably multiple times, just to absorb more of the stunt sequences. But I'm not necessarily sure I want to see it again as much as I did Mad Max or Mad Max 2. So in the end, Fury Road, with all its greatness, has made me appreciate even more the characterizations, tone, and gritty vision in the first 2 films. <br/><br/>Still, Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely a landmark in sequels/reboots/re-imaginings, and it puts George Miller in a rare league that not even George Lucas and Spielberg could enter with their weak reduxes of Star Wars and Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Here's my precise ratings of the series:<br/><br/>Mad Max: 8.625/10; Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior): 9/10; Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome: 6.8/10; Mad Max: Fury Road 8.5/10"

","Set thirty years after The Mad Max trilogy, this reboot of Mad Max brings more action and class to the already classic of a series (you don't have to see the previous movies to understand this reboot, only the characters and the idea of the not do distant dystopian future have been taken from the original trilogy.) arguably the best action movie of the year blends the fun of a popcorn-film and class of a cinema to give us a critical blockbuster which will stay with us beyond thunderdrome (the cinema hall).<br/><br/>The movie begins the action at the beginning which doesn't stop till the last minute of the movie the chases,the cars,the war-machines, the explosions, the collisions and what not, it has everything a action movie needs to rise your adrenaline levels through the roof. The movie is like a big chasing movie in which George Miller sneakily inserted a story to keep us engaged through out the movie. The perfectly timed explosions caused by exploding spears and the vehicles which which are still coming at you even after the big explosions, the villain (Immortan Joe) with never give up attitude going after the Max, Imperator Furiosa and her allies. The reason I am elaborating excessively is because there isn't a single aspect of this movie that I want to leave unattended.<br/><br/>Coming to the critical aspects of the movie. The use of color in this movie adds so much beauty to it that it's like cotton candy to your eyes. The story though not so complex but compelling to watch gives us another reason to relive this epic action movie once more time. The Music adds to more excitement to the action of this film, it isn't the best background in business but for an action movie it just fills your cup to the pinnacle. Tom Hardy (the future holder of ""one of the great actors of all time"". Atleat I think so.) give an amazing performance as a lonely, scared and a guy whose only instinct is to survive.<br/><br/>If your looking for an good action movie then look no further, this is it."

"LauraLeeWasHere","3","8","16","7 September 2015"," Visit to Wasteland Waste of Time and Money
","In a Theater this is nothing less than an assault on your senses, but on the smaller screen you need an actual story and this film doesn't have very much of one. <br/><br/>George Miller gives us several good ideas about what a Post- apocalyptic Australian future would look like, but he's had his entire life to think about it, so I would expect at least SOME good ideas after having decades to mull it over. But this is mainly a bag full of ""tricks"" to entice every teenage boy into the theater and out of his allowance: From loud cars, to loud thrash metal, to loud electric guitars (that shoot flames - one of the many, many Phallic symbols in this film) all the way to the group of bikini clad, nubile young models who are actually wetting themselves down. (Can anyone say: ""Wet T- Shirt Contest?"")<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is probably the best actor of this generation and all his talent is so wasted here. In fact, the character of Mad Max is superfluous to this entire film. He's only here as an excuse to get us back to this time and place. But Hardy still manages to get in some good acting licks. He has a way of bringing out the ""humor"" (yes, I said ""humor"") in the character of Max without trying to behave like Mel Gibson. The way Hardy runs around and the way he uses the file on the face mask is reminiscent of Max fighting in Thunderdome, without actually imitating Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>But this film is all about Charlize Theron (Kudos to her agent for getting her top billing at the beginning of the film). It makes me think maybe Miller had a crush on Charlize and constructed this entire film as an excuse just to hang around with her.<br/><br/>In a nut shell, if you're over the age of 14 and actually want a story to go along with all the ""cool cars"" and ""loud noise"", you're out of luck. This movie is a bunch of massive hype with the big ""selling"" point during the months of promotion being that ""a lot of the stunts were done in real life instead of CGI"". Uh. That is actually the way almost EVERY film made before the year 1990 was created too. So what's so great about that?<br/><br/>The actual ""trick"" of making a BIG film is to BALANCE it with enough INTIMATE moments that make you sympathize with the characters enough to care what happens to them. (A good example of this being done right is James Cameron's ""Titanic"") But in this film I don't care if all the characters die. Except for Nicolas Hoult, who used his few moments and lines to make me care about his character, Nux. This was no easy feat amid all the dust and noise, so I'm anxious to see what he can do in other films. But after watching this film 4 times (I wanted to give it a fair chance to win me over), I'm done. Mel Gibson was smart to give this one a skip. You should do the same. <br/><br/>As for Tom Hardy, your time is better spent watching one of his former films over again instead of wasting it here. Pick one of his films where you can actually see his face and hear his voice. This Max could have been portrayed by hand puppets and none of us would be the wiser. Who knows? Maybe it was?"

","To me that has seen the original Mad Max movies, this one is bad in many way. The story line is no good, CG is not good, and wrecks and jumps are so off. Meaning the landing could not be done the angles are wrong, one car you can see hit the cliff and falls behind, but next shoot he is pulling in front of truck like nothing happen. To me the worst part is the story line. The 1st Mad Max had a real story line, and the 2nd one, and 3rd one. For those who have not seen the original Mad Max I would suggest seeing them and you will see how much better they are. in every way. Well CG might not be but they really didn't need it."

Some exciting actions sequences in the last half of the movie. But the main character, who gave the previous films their heart and soul, is gone. There's no Mad Max here. I don't even know who the stand-in is, but he has no personality. Charlize Theron is physically imposing but doesn't get to do a lot of acting. The supporting actresses are just eye candy for hetero men, their flimsy desert wraps artfully placed to just barely cover the naughty bits. The plot is a well-worn scheme about a tyrannical ruler who uses control of resources and a bogus mythology to suppress the masses. I guess if you haven't seen very many movies this would seem original. If you are over 40 you have seen this all before. Somewhat enjoyable but not inspiring."

","Great action scenes with lots of special effects and sufficient creativity and variations on unexpected situations. Nice touches involving thoughtful details relating to the classic saga of the Mel Gibson trilogy. However there is a major flaw to this movie...Can you have a hero with zero or next to non existing personality? A major part of the movie is underway before Max utters an inconsequential monosyllable. The previous character played by Mel had strong emotional conflicts that force him to deal with external threats with decisive yet necessary violence. The Max zombie in this movie seems like a robot with no idea of where or what to do unless he is told. One expects that eventually he would wake up, but to no avail. Sorry but the Mad Max I and II had a very definite character that we learned to understand and love. Charlize is very good and credible and the movie should be named Mad Maxine, although the college of wives was a bit too much. Finally the ""abortion scene"" adds little and is in very questionable taste. Good picture to view once."

His mission is to help bring back Imortan's harem of beauties, rescued by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and now haring down the titular highway in a fuel tanker in search of the ""Green Place""; a location across the Australian desert that has special meaning for her.<br/><br/>Thus is set up a road-chase of epic proportions which will result in much loss of blood (not to say a driving licence ban if any cops caught them!).<br/><br/>It's difficult to describe in a review just what an adrenaline-fuelled and maniacal film this is. It starts at a breathless pace and you think ""OK – so far – so Michael Bay"". It's when Max catches up with the bevy of beauties and Furiosa (who seems 'armless enough, arf) and a thrilling and frantic cat/dog fight ensues for control of the tanker that you realise you have stepped into something of an entirely different class. Another reviewer aptly described it by saying that it ""begins at an eleven and finishes at a number not yet reached by mankind""! As Imortan's convoy of pursuing maniacs arrive, adding new and literal meaning to the phrase 'lead guitarist', all hell then breaks lose. Many of the stunts in the ensuing mayhem look to be very much 'real world', much to the film's credit: whilst there is undoubtedly some CGI in play, it is very understated and subtle.<br/><br/>I was pleased to have predicted in my review of last year's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" just how many of the Oscar's art categories that film would appear in, and I will similarly pin my early Oscar nomination colours to the mast on this film as follows:<br/><br/><ul><li>Film Editing (Margaret Sixel): for maintaining an outstandingly breathless pace throughout; </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Best Sound Editing/Mixing (Mark A. Mangini is supervising sound editor): an extraordinary mix of quiet and deafening and with some gloriously subtle effects. For example, when an explosion goes off next to Nux's head you briefly hear his ringing ears; </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematography (industry veteran John Seale (""The English Patient"")): at times this film reminded me strongly of ""Life of Pi"" in its imagery and beauty. There are pictures that stay with you long after the film has ended: an alien marshland with deformed humans on stilts; Furiosa kneeling in the desert and screaming to the skies; and gorgeous long shots of the Australian desert and the pursuing vehicles.</li></ul><br/><br/>Above all this is George Miller's masterpiece. Here is a director demonstrating real chutzpah. A director with the confidence to deafen and then – like Hitchcock often did – cut to total silence. A director not afraid to fade to black, setting the expectation for an awe-inspiring cinematographic reveal to start the next scene (which he normally delivers on). A director marshalling an army of film professionals to deliver a real treat.<br/><br/>It's not perfect: some of the frenetic editing could have been toned back a tad to allow the viewer to work out what is happening; a significant proportion of the dialogue is either gibberish or inaudible or both; and some of the bumps and scrapes (particularly those of Nux) seem unsurvivable – let alone coming out of without as much as a ""hurty elbow"".<br/><br/>But whilst this film is perhaps not for the 'Marigold Hotel crowd', I'd defy those with a love of cinema and/or ""Top Gear"" not to revel in the glorious chaos of this film. As Nux would say, it is very ""Shiny and Chrome"".<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version - with comedy captions! - at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

","All other films that think they can call themselves ""action blockbusters"" please step aside to make way for the only true blockbuster this summer, and for many more summers to come I'm sure, Mad Max: Fury Road. Oh. My. God. This movie right here. This explosive, obscene, grotesque, beautiful movie right here was everything I ever wanted it to be and more. George Miller, after thirty years, has returned to his legendary Mad Max series, and he's returned with the some serious firepower at his disposal. Firepower in the form of 150 million dollars and the limitless wonders of modern technology. Miller fires off this ammunition at full force to create the impossibly vast and intimately gritty world of Max Rockatansky in the grandiose way I think he envisioned it from the start. Upon seeing the first trailer for this film I said it looked like the Mad Max film Miller always wanted to make but didn't have the tech or the money to accomplish. Seeing the movie in its glorious two hour entirety affirms that statement.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road stands alone from its three predecessors with the titular character and his post apocalyptic scenery being the only thread that combines them. Fury Road presents a wholly original story taking place in the wasteland where we meet a water hungry colony ruthlessly ruled by Immortan Joe, the film's badass big bad. Despite having plenty of water, Immortan Joe hordes it to keep control of his colony while he impregnates his forced marriage wives, called Breeders, with the hopes of them bearing future warlord sons. The story gets going when Imperator Furiosa, played by an ass kicking Charlize Theron, betrays Immortan Joe (sick names right?) and steals the Breeders to get them to a land referred to as the ""Green Place."" Max, previously captured by Joe's War Boys, ends up getting mixed up in Furiosa's campaign and finds himself aiding them on their long treacherous trek through the desert wasteland, all the while being pursued by Joe and his allied gangs from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm. Did I mention I love all the names of everything in this damn movie?<br/><br/>My memory of the original Mad Max films is somewhat limited, especially when it comes to more specific elements of the world, so I might be wrong in saying that Fury Road has some of the most ingenious and in depth world building I've seen Miller accomplish. Even if I'm wrong about that, the post apocalyptic society Miller has constructed in Fury Road makes for an incredibly poignant and gloriously over the top statement on what humanity might devolve into after the apocalypse. He does a fantastic job of bringing Max into the modern era as well. Where gas was the most precious of all resources in the original trilogy, it now takes a second seat to water, the resource most craved by society. Being in California, this element hits frighteningly close to home. <br/><br/>Everything Miller does in Fury Road affirms and expands on everything that was so great about this series before it's budget had nine digits. As was the case with the previous Mad Max films, Fury Road isn't a story primarily about Max himself. The story really focuses on Furiosa and her own hero's journey across the desert as she quite literally drives the plot forward. She fuels a plot that ultimately has an awesome feminist angle by the end, breaking down gender barriers and making the women of the film the most exceedingly capable and overly wicked characters. I've already mentioned how awesome Theron is, and her accompanying group of supermodels...er... Breeders quickly transition from damsels in distress to a resourceful band of hot chicks who also kick a lot of ass. <br/><br/>So, I want to just come out and say this. This movie is a visual MASTERPIECE. I'm not exaggerating either. Yes, I saw this movie less than 24 hours ago and my testosterone levels are probably still spiking, but I will stand by that statement as long as I live. Mad Max: Fury Road is gorgeous. It delivers some of the most wildly imaginative action set pieces every conceived and some of the most creatively constructed chase sequences I've ever had the pleasure of watching play out on screen. I said a lot of things about The Avengers: Age of Ultron action scenes that I would repeat here about being clearly displayed and easy to follow, but where Fury Road surpasses this is by showing just how beautifully shot these scenes can be and what happens when you accomplish the capturing of the impossibly huge scope of the Australian outback setting. This desert wasteland is MASSIVE and the film constantly reminds us of that in wide shots that would make Kurosawa require a change of underwear. Yeah I said it. <br/><br/>Also, this is one of those incredibly rare moments in my film reviews where I would actually highly recommend the 3-D. It is one of the many many things expertly utilized in Fury Road. Miller expertly uses it as a tool to immerse you in his world, rather than a gimmick for a few mediocre sight gags. Fury Road is a film that traps you in its insane world for two solid hours of entertainment, and you come out on the other end in a haze full of sand, blood, and nerd tears. It's a transcendental experience, guys. You need to experience it. Seriously, you are doing yourself a major disservice if you don't go see this film, so drop everything your doing and get to the theater to see Mad Max: Fury Road."
"olivermjames","9","8","16","16 May 2015"," Masterpiece
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a Australian post-apocalyptic action film, starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult and is directed by George Miller.<br/><br/>This film is amazing! A true action film for the ages, and just like the trailers show, it's all action, it hardly slows down in its 2 hour running time, yet it also has a fun yet simple story, interesting characters and great world building.<br/><br/>In the stark desert wasteland populated by a broken humanity driven with survival and the unending ravage for gasoline, a loner named Max finds himself unwantedly caught in the middle of a chase while aiding the heroine Furiosa, and her female companions, she struggles to return to her homeland and escape the clutches of a ruthless dessert gang leader, Immortan Joe. With the harsh desert sands in front of them and marauders behind, only the maddest will prevail the storm.<br/><br/>I only just caught up with all of the previous Mad Max films and enjoyed them greatly, and i feel like this one fits right in with the previous ones. Tom Hardy has replaced Mel Gibson as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky and he is just as good as Gibson, Hardy is an amazing actor and he doesn't have a lot to say in the film, like the older films, but his physical acting makes up for his lack of lines, you also understand his mental condition more in this film than previous ones which i thought was interesting, in the older films i didn't really think that Max was crazy but in this film Hardy proves that he is. Nicolas Hoult plays Nux, a warboy, who is on the antagonist's side of the fight in the film, i thought that Nux was a really interesting character because in the older Max films, we saw all of these insane tribesmen fighting and don't really understand these crazy characters, Nux lets us into that kind of mind-frame which i found fascinating, Hoult played him very well, and is unrecognizable in the role, not just because he shaved all the hair off his body, because this is a side of the actor we have never seen before, and he has the best line in the film which has become the tag line for the film ""What a lovely day!"" Saving the best character for last, Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa, by far the most bad-ass character in the film and one of the strongest female characters that has been put on the big screen in quite a while, like Hoult, Theron also shaves her head and sinks into her role as Furiosa, she is arguably the main character in the film, having the best lines, great action and emotional scenes. While Max is just along for the ride in this film Furiosa is taking charge, looking after people and trying to save them which was nice to see. I thought it was interesting that while Max is a big part of the film and the namesake of it, Miller decided it doesn't need to only be about him.<br/><br/>The side characters are also interesting, Immortan Joe's wives are all strong women which each have their own thing to do and feel like real characters instead of just plot points which was nice to see, the main antagonist Immortan Joe was also good, played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the first Mad Max film, he was a intimidating, imposing character but not much more than that, we don't delve into his character like we do the others but i think that is okay because the film doesn't focus on him too much and knows that he isn't the most important thing in the film. The great thing about all of the side characters were their designs, they all looked so unique and interesting that they stood out even if they were not the most vital character, like Coma-Doof Warrior, who is a random character that plays a guitar that spouts fire and gets the enemy troops riled up, the character looks so cool that he is instantly a fan favourite. <br/><br/>Going back to the action scenes because that is the most important thing in the film, Director, George Miller does such a fantastic job of keeping all of the action scenes fun and exciting, the film is 2 hours long and i'd say there is about 1.5 hours of action yet it isn't boring and is always exciting to see. Filming in Australia again was a great idea, the locations in the film are amazing, long rocky roads and empty deserts really made you feel like this was a post-apocalyptic world that these character are living in.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie is one long action scene is a real big feat for me and it establishes the film as one of the greatest action films of the last decade. The actors are all great in their roles, i can't imagine any film being better than this, this summer.<br/><br/>4.6/5"
"ThomasDrufke","9","8","16","15 May 2015"," A Road of Redemption
","I really want to go back and watch Road Warrior now that I've seen Fury Road. The first Mad Max was a fantastic revenge story that also gave us some of the best low budget action we have ever had. Road Warrior to me fell short of the first and just didn't give me that visceral experience. But I'm definitely willing to give it another shot after seeing the insane Fury Road. Now, you don't necessarily have to see any of the first 3 to understand the world of Mad Max, but you will have a better appreciation for what exactly is going on in this post apocalyptic world. It's cleared up by Tom Hardy in the first few minutes of the movie, which shows flashbacks, or recreations rather, from the events of the first two films. Bottom line is to go see this movie in theaters. It's the best pure action film of the year and of quite some time.<br/><br/>We begin at the Citadel, when presumably the world and it's chaos is controlled by King Immortan Joe. He has 5 wives who were individually selected for breeding and carrying on his blood, who are held hostage at his place. Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, isn't thrilled and decides to steal all of his wives and bring them to her homeland, the Green Place. While in pursuit, she crosses paths with the once captured Mad Max, and they agree begrudgingly to help each other for their own greater good. What follows is an insane action film that barely takes time to breathe. 90% of the film is supposedly practical effects, which is absolutely mind-blowing. I love Avengers, but half of the film is green screen, and you can pretty much tell when it is. But here, watching the film, I couldn't really tell you what parts were real and what wasn't. And at 70 years old, George Miller did an unbelievable job, especially considering some of the development problems the film had. There are people jumping from vehicle to vehicle, riding their motorcycles on top of huge trucks, hanging onto the bottom of high speed car chases, and almost all of it was real. It gives you an extra layer of excitement while watching the film that you just don't get with CGI fest films.<br/><br/>With that being said, the action never becomes overpowering or distracting. It doesn't necessarily exhaust you, it just thrills you. Especially with Junkie XL's brilliant score playing in the background. Sure, I definitely would have liked to have seen more development from the characters, especially our main villain. Besides having several wives and controlling the water supply, we don't know much about him. Mad Max just gets stuck in the chaos, it's not even really his film. It's really Furiosa's film and wow is she an awesome bada** character or what? Side note: I would love to see some sort of team up between Furiosa and Rita Vrataski from Edge of Tomorrow (AKA Full Metal Bitc*). Charlize Theron strips down her glamorous Hollywood look for the role and gives a terrific performance. I found a lot of her back-story to be really touching and even heartbreaking. As much as it's a story of redemption for her, it's a redemption film for the Mad Max franchise, which will hopefully continue. This can easily be a new set of films with Hardy and the supporting roles, which it's worth mentioning how great and unrecognizable Nicholas Hoult was in the film. This film has so many great action scenes, with characters you root for and even some deeper themes about surviving madness and how you control chaos. Even though I loved the trailers, I was deeply surprised by Mad Max: Fury Road, and I hope to see more of these films.<br/><br/>+Furiosa is an awesome character <br/><br/>+Hardy is as good if not better than Gibson <br/><br/>+Insane action, how did they do it? <br/><br/>+Sets up a new set of films, but honors the ones before <br/><br/>+Unrecognizable Hoult <br/><br/>+Action doesn't get exhausting <br/><br/>+Junkie XL's score <br/><br/>-Character development <br/><br/>9.5/10"
"loulou1992","1","11","24","2 December 2015"," Not the masterpiece other lead you to believe
","It is not a mad max film, it should be called Furiosa Road. Thomas Hardy doesn't even do a good take on Max. There's only one and his name is Mel Gibson. The film is only for the new generation, this was meant to be a 80's throw back and it is nothing like a good old fashioned film at all. MasterPieceOfShit is all i can say. Terminator 5 may have flaws but at least it was entertaining and had its great star back Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger. That film was smashed for been bad and Mad Max gets the reviews like its epic, its not at all it's simply nothing like the masterpiece they lead you to believe. If you are a younger generation and into Hardy, the way of films now you will mostly love it but if you are a avid fan of the first 3 films you will hate it, if your a true fan anyway."

"AlexanderXMovie-LoverX","3","49","139","13 May 2015"," Worst Movie of the Year PS Don't waste your time
","Im going to be honest and say that this movie was a complete waste of time. Every so often I wanted to check my watch. I was left sitting there asking myself when is this movie going to be over? Unfortunately, the movie had very little plot, and was lacking in many features that are required for an entertaining movie. Mad Max was full of explosions, car chases, and thrilling graphics, however, that's all it had. With no story line, a confusing plot, and no character development, I highly recommend NOT seeing this movie. Honestly, please don't waste your money, even if you are a fan of the original Mad Max films. This is basically the entire plot line of the movie:<br/><br/>Explosions More explosions then car chase and one girl getting ran over while pregnant...by a monster truck actually wasn't even a monster truck more like a tonka toy. The best part of the entire movie was... THE END.<br/><br/>So don't tell ME!"
"grumpy-3","7","34","92","13 May 2015"," without story or characterisation equals no involvement
","The first big problem with mad max is that Tom Hardy really is not a star, he has very little charisma, he is no Mel Gibson, next the character as written and portrayed is a bumbling, shuffling fool. The first 20 minutes he is a captive, so does not do anything, Mad max of old would never have been in this position. the film is one long repetitive, action chase sequence, all done quite well but by the end you are just numbed. The supporting cast especially Charlize Theron are all excellent,in fact she is more Mad Max than him, for stretches of the film Max is almost an extra or a supporting character. Hardy never conveys any emotion or depth, most of the time he looks confused, at the start when he tries to escape, its filmed like a keystone cops comedy from the silent era. A loud overloaded but not with the right contents big big disappointment . Yet again most critics have become blind fan boys."
"jimsin","3","28","74","14 May 2015"," A mixed bag
","Being a big fan of the first two Mad Max films, I have been looking forward to Fury Road for years. Sadly as the end credits rolled, I only felt relief that it was over. The cinematography was beautiful, the action scenes well done, and everything had a glorious sense of momentum. Sadly these factors alone aren't enough to make a good film. Where things really fell apart for me was the poor dialogue & lack of any character building. The action was frantic, but without investing any time in the characters it was essentially meaningless. The few occasions where an attempt was made to create some emotion or character depth were woefully inept & even jarring at times. It soon became clear that the film could only be enjoyed in terms of action, but even that became too repetitive, like an overblown never ending repetition of the final chase scene from Mad Max 2.<br/><br/>The other really disappointing aspect was that Hardy didn't make a great Max. Mel Gibson played the part perfectly in the first two instalments & even when he was a 'burned out shell of a man' he had a certain charisma, & there were touching glimpses of his former warmth that was buried deep beneath the surface. Hardy on the other hand comes across as an unlikeable, clumsy fool & barely says or does anything at all till far into the film.<br/><br/>The one saving grace was Charlize Theron as Furiosa - somebody wrote in another review that she was more Max than Max. This is most definitely the case. She was the only character I cared remotely about & without her it would have been a real struggle to sit through the duration of the film. I would suggest that if any further Mad Max films are made, they should focus on her character because Hardy's portrayal of Max has killed off any interest I had in what might happen to him next."
"Eddy Hertens","5","12","27","26 November 2015"," A Glorious Humongous Piece of ....Crap
","Seeing most people either give this movie either a 1 or a 10 rating, I decided to give a more nuanced view. There is fun to be had with this movie, even if you are an adult spectator, providing.... 1) You watch this movie with some friends on a ""silly"" booze-filled night, preferably after ingesting some ""recreational"" mind-numbing, critical- thought impairing and illegal chemicals. 2) You want to show off your huge home theater setup, and feel the need to create a seismic event. 3) You have just watched a marathon of movies by Lars Von Trier, Darren AronovskyIngmar Bergman or the Dardenne brothers (I am Belgian)<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a dumb movie with over the top action, wooden acting (sorry Charlize!), one-dimensional characters and zero importance, unworthy of being called a Mad Max movie."
"josenrig","6","12","27","16 May 2015"," I don't know which is madness: The lack of story or the people that actually like this movie?
","Just got back from watching Mad Max: Fury Road, and I honestly don't understand how this movie is receiving such high approvals. Their's almost literally no story here, just a car chase that last 2 hours long filled with explosions, blood, fights and the typical Hollywood formula for all actions movies. The only thing worth mentioning is the cinematography which very good. anyway, this movie is a 7 at best because of visuals, but story wise it got pointless and sometimes boring after the first 30 minutes. Don't usually post anything in here, but just baffles me how people can put a film up there with some true gems the film industry has ever produced. If this movie stays around the 8.9 rating or higher, I'll never trust this site again or any critic whose praising this film. People need to stop being nostalgic about the 80's and the Mel Gibon's films and see this film for what it really is. I recommend people to save your money, don't get carry away about the hype, it's way overrated."
"Troy_Campbell","10","12","27","14 May 2015"," A grungy masterpiece
","It has been nearly 24 hours since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Gravity or Captain Phillips, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos.<br/><br/>There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big-budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. In short: it is a grungy masterpiece."

I watch Mad Max 1 & 2 on a fairly regular basis and I will be honest, i wasn't sure that George Miller could still deliver a movie worthy of Max. Not only did he deliver a movie that was worthy of Max, he delivered a movie that was so far beyond my expectations for this movie. Fury Road has to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen, the action sequences are just phenomenal and amazing in the fact that most of it was real and not CGI. The cars and characters are just amazing and as insane as they should be in the post apocalyptic world of Max and the scenery is both beautiful and cruel. Tom Hardy was a good choice as Max, Charlize Theron was amazing as Furiosa but for me the standout performance was from Nicholas Hoult as Nux. Mad Max Fury Road is a must see movie, a must see in a cinema movie."

Impossible stunts - poor graphics ineffectual characters and the worst thing is that I really wanted to like it. It made a bunch of money though and whilst crap makes money, crap's all we'll get. Why is a reboot or a sequel, made decades after the original, with a massively higher budget and more tech, generally worse than the original?

There are a few snobby critics that honestly, are a bit too critical, don't listen to them. If you love fire, blood, action, creepy creatures, guns, and gore, this is honestly the most amazing movie you'll ever see. Ever. I am a massive movie addict, and am pretty picky typically, but this movie is by far my favorite movie I've seen in years. I left the theater wanting more and more, and haven't stopped thinking about it since. Yes, there isn't an insane totally incredible ""storyline"" but I didn't even care. Yes, there are prolonged action scenes, pretty much the entire movie, but it's freaking AMAZING. I am a makeup artist and blogger, and have done a few ""Mad Max Fury Road"" inspired makeup looks! The crust punk, edgy, gory, gorgeous feel, is just astounding. Being artistic like myself, I was seriously baffled by how amazing the whole ""look"" and feel of the film was. The makeup was incredible, the cinematography was amazing, the colors were so dark yet vibrant, I thought the acting was awesome! Tom Hardy grunts a lot and doesn't talk too much, but I think that added to the whole effect! Nux is the craziest little awesome thing. Ever. The guitar playing thing? Most eerie, creepy, incredible thing ever. There's quite a lot of dark humor in this film, so if you aren't into dark, ""dry"" humor, creepy, frightening creature things, and you hate blood and crazy awesome action, then yeah, this won't be the film for you! But if you just enjoy a stinking amazing, Gory, creepy, kick butt movie from time to time, you NEED Mad Max in your life. Basically, I'm counting the days until the next one comes out because I'm OBSESSED. I actually think the term obsessed doesn't even express my love for this movie. Take a chance, see it yourself, because I highly doubt you'll regret it. I am a major superhero and scary movie fanatic, and this topped every movie I've seen in years. That says a LOT for me! My husband said the same thing, and he's quite the movie snob as well! I won't stop recommending this movie to people because I just think it's stinking amazing. See it, love it, and it'll be such a LOVELY day ;) just thank me later, babes."
"cyanopicacyana","6","9","19","24 May 2015"," Fast-paced, action-packed beautifully atmospheric lackluster story
","The movie is good, but I think it suffers from a couple of major problems.<br/><br/>One problem is that the main character is too weak. If there is anyone taking the lead, it is definitely Charlize Theron. Mad Max is completely shadowed by other characters, even secondary ones.<br/><br/>Another problem is the action is dull and repetitive, doing very little to carry the action forward. This is also the case in Fast and Furious, but in this case this is explicit and it is what the audience is expecting. The content of this Mad Max movie (including action that actually moves the story forward) would probably take no more than 30 min. All the rest is ""just"" show (though a beautiful one!).<br/><br/>The design and scenography are brilliant, no question about it. But I think that for example the design in Zack Snyder's 300 is more coherent and a better contribution to the overall experience. The story in 300 is clearer and simpler, and every element and action scene makes it move forward in a clear way. This is not the case here. Characters in this Mad Max are empty shells, simple stereotypes with little content, mere puppets in a grandiose artsy atmosphere, with no inner life.<br/><br/>Most of the action is completely reactive, with the characters in pure survival mode very rarely demonstrating anything of their inner self and their back story. I am all for not being spoon fed the back story, and against ""talking heads"" describing their background in lengthy dialogs. But this movie suffers from the opposite problem. Only very rarely did Mad Max suffered from flashes (quite literally) from his previous life, but it felt really completely out of touch with anything.<br/><br/>In the end, I didn't regret watching the movie (specially in the cinema), but it really felt a bit short. At home, I don't think I would recommend, unless you watch in a very large TV."
"alexanderstromer","7","9","19","22 May 2015"," What is Mad Max doing in this movie?
","OK, I went into this movie because of the crazy high rating of the movie and the ""masterpiece"" reviews, but it turned out to be far from any piece a master would craft. Was the crew paying critics to leave good reviews? This whole ""tricked by IMDb rating and checking out a movie"" leads me now to distrust the ratings here altogether for new launches.<br/><br/>There are many good things in this movie and these are things like action sequences, makeup, vehicles, stunts, acting. But after 10 minutes of watching this gasoline/adrenaline junkie trip you are asking yourself ""what is this all for, this does not make any sense"", which is the main issue I have with this movie and I am simply perplexed about so many ""critics"" overlook this obvious issue. This is far from a masterpiece as it does not ask or answer any questions which are somewhat related to real life. The first sentence you will hear in this movie will be the whole story element. After that you get just one action sequence after another with minor pauses. And last but not least, why is Max even in this movie because he just does some minor jobs and the real hero here is Imperator Furiosa. This should be the name of the movie, by the way.<br/><br/>This movie does not justify the high rating it has been given now."

Cant really give much away in terms as spoilers as nothing much really happened.. There was a chase, for two hours, lot's of explosions, no real suspense, no twists, no character development.. they defeat their pursuers and get to where they're going and the movie ends.<br/><br/>Go see if if you want something stunning to look at, but if you need some brain candy I'd maybe give it a miss.."
"vistheindian","10","9","19","17 May 2015"," What a movie! What a lovely movie!
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>The world as we know it no longer exists, turned into an endless scorching desert where every drop of water and fuel is precious enough to kill for. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) rebels against the oppression of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by aiding in the escape of his wives. She comes across Max (Tom Hardy), a mystery man who needs Furiosa just as much as she needs him in their quest for survival. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the most mind-blowing, insane action movies in recent years. By relying on mostly practical stunts there is a real sense of danger, tension, excitement, and awe with every explosion, flip, and wreck of the cars. More surprisingly there is heart behind the action, thanks to the well-developed characters. Mad Max's beautiful chaos is a sight to behold and must be experienced on the big screen.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I have never seen the original Mad Max movies, I just never got around to watching them. Since this was a reboot of sorts there is no need to watch them, and I wanted to go into the movie fresh. So this review comes from someone with no prior knowledge of the franchise. Short of it, I loved it!<br/><br/>The thing that people will be talking about after the movie ends is the action. This is action like you have never seen before. CGI is only used when it is absolutely needed and the other 90% of the time it is real cars crashing and flipping in every way they can. The chase scenes are breath taking and heart pounding, and I mean that literally. After the first action sequence ended I had to remind myself to exhale because I felt like I was holding my breath in awe for the entire scene. When another sequence ended I checked my pulse, I don't know the exact beats per minute but it felt like I just came off the treadmill after 15mins of running. Like I said Mad Max is beautiful chaos but because of the great shot composition there is sense in the chaos. I never felt lost, I always knew what was going on despite the frantic nature of the scenes. That is why you will fully appreciate all the effort put into filming this movie.<br/><br/>One of the things I was most nervous about from the trailers was the world of Mad Max. I feared that everything would be so crazy, like the flame-thrower guitarist on a truck, that it'd be too distracting. However, the world is so well-conceived and well realised by director George Miller that even the most insane things make sense in that context. Yes, that includes the flame-thrower guitarist, he was awesome! Additionally the cinematography and soundtrack brought a much grander scale to an otherwise simple story.<br/><br/>Behind all the visuals though there is a level of depth to the movie that I did not anticipate. The best character of the movie by far is Charlize Theron's Furiosa. Even with her disability she is incredibly strong willed and determined to finish her mission. After all, she carries a lot of the emotional consequences if she were to fail and so I was really invested in her story. In a genre dominated by male actors it is refreshing to see a compelling female character such as Furiosa, and we need more of them in Hollywood. Then there is also Nicholas Hoult as Nux who had a great story arc. I was surprised how much I empathised with his character. You might be wondering why I haven't talked about Max yet in a movie called Mad Max, well that's simply because he is not really the central character. Don't get me wrong, he has a major role in the movie and Tom Hardy plays a convincing hardened hero. Nevertheless, this is mostly a Furiosa centric story. That may be a complaint for some that Max should've been the focus, and I can see their reasoning. The way I understood it was that this film is one of many stories or legends in this world, where a mystery man (Max) plays an important part in helping our heroes succeed. In that sense the way Max's character was handled was fitting.<br/><br/>We are only half way through this decade and already I'll call it: Mad Max is the best action movie of this decade, the very least top 5. I have a strong feeling that Mad Max Fury Road will be a classic decades from now. I cannot stress this enough, you absolutely have to watch this on the big screen, IMAX if possible. You are robbing yourself of a truly unique visceral experience if you miss this one. The only person I wouldn't recommend this movie to is someone with a heart condition, because it might get too intense.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"d3jean","3","19","48","16 May 2015"," Overrated Mediocrity. What a Disappointment.
","What a shame!!! That's all i could say as I left the cinema Thursday night, after attending the first showing. Before i start my review for this film, I'd like to share my thoughts on the first three as they were an integral part of my childhood and hold some nostalgic reverence for me as an adult. Mad Max is a film i don't particularly care for as I find it a bit too downbeat and low budget for my taste. It's also visually different from the other three films as it takes place in a vast country wasteland, where as the others take place in dessert locals that give off a more grand scope, that's severely lacking in the first film. The first film also lacks any iconic action scenes or a memorable villain that would become a trademark in the later films. The Road Warrior is a film I enjoy immensely and don't really have much else to add that hasn't already been said by everyone over the last 34 years. Beyond Thunderdome is a film I find disjointed. The one hand all the scenes directed by George Miller are amazing and well done, the thunderdome fight (still one of the greatest in cinema history), and the end chase sequence are exciting and hint at the great film it could have been had he directed the whole movie. The rest of the film however featuring the lost children and anything to do with the people of Bartertown and their politics is just annoying and slow's the movie down to a crawl. The Tina Turner song ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" however, is classic and one of my favorite songs of all time. So now we come to Fury Road a film I've been looking forward too ever since I saw the first trailer that premiered at Comic Con last summer. The trailer made the film look epic and visually stunning, featuring things we had never seen before on film. Months I waited for it's release and with each day drawing closer and closer, my anticipation grew. Cut to earlier this week as the reviews from many professional film critic outlets came pouring in. They were declaring this film to be a masterpiece and one of the greatest action movies of all time. I couldn't believe what i was hearing and waited with baited breath to see it on Thursday night. Skip to 2 hours and change later and even now as i type this several days later, ""WHAT THE HELL IS EVERYBODY RAVING ABOUT!!!!!!"". Seriously, I'm as perplexed by all this as other negative reviewers are. This solidifies my thinking that film critics are irrelevant and don't know what they're talking about. Same goes for Rotten Tomatoes a site I won't ever be going on again, they're a joke. Back to the film though, I'm still trying to figure out how something that looked so groundbreaking and revolutionary from the marketing, become so boring and uninvolving as you sit down and watch it in the theater. The answer, the story sucks. Oh wait, I forgot there was no story, just a bunch of chasing and then more chasing, followed by more chasing, before we take a detour in the second act, where our characters literally do nothing but sit around at night, contemplating about the situation they're in and how they intend to get out of it for 30 straight minutes. This section slows the movie down to a Terence Malick sized crawl as we the audience become restless hoping for something to happen soon and happen quick. The cast is also disappointing with Tom Hardy being a poor imitator of Mel Gibson. It's not entirely his fault though as he isn't really the main character. That's right, Max hardly does anything in this movie. Yes, he beats some people up and gets involved in some of the action, however he's merely taking orders from Charlize Theron's character and just seems completely uninterested in everything that goes on around him. Theron is fine in the movie but again is given little to work with. As for the other females, they're not even worth talking about as they barely leave an impression on the audience and are not developed in the slightest. The villain was cool to look at but again underutilized and nonthreatening. The movies looks nice and is fairly well directed by George Miller but has a feeling of a been there done that feel that indicated that George Miller was only interested in creating cool visuals to distract us from his shitty script. Movies need more than pretty pictures to keep us engaged, we need strong characters and story to make us wanna come back and watch a film over and over, which this film fails to do. So in ending this review, I want to say to all the masses out there praising this to the heavens, that you really should ask for more from your movies because if this is what we accept now as good films than cinema is dead my friends. In closing I thought this film was pretty disappointing and now has made me sworn off from seeing anymore Mad Max films in the future. So no I don't recommend this film if u half to see it wait for redbox and watch the first 30 minutes which admittedly are great but be forewarned it all goes downhill after that. Thanks for reading my review."

","This is a classic example of peaceniks propaganda in collaboration with Feminists, Political-environmentalists and Pseudo-seculars. Who could imagine Max to be a henpecked second fiddle to a gun- wielding, man hunting amputee - Furiosa. What waste of a great actor like Tom Hardy, who can stand out in every shot if cast as the leading nemesis. Alas, in this latest installment of Mad Max of the days of yore, Tom Hardy is a mere drone to the intrepid war-queen Furiosa (Charlize Theron). As far as I am concerned the very idea of Tribal-Women-Warriors is distasteful and pernicious. It hardly leaves much to imagination whom the ""War Boys"" are modeled after. They are post-apocalypse Fidayeen, indoctrinated quite like the Islamists of our times, with promises of Heaven after death, a place they scream out as ""Valhalla"" (the name surely has an Arabic sound to it). A kind touch on the forehead by a ""pure"" and ""perfect"" (not ""pious"" for a change) ""creature"" transforms the War Boy. This is such subliminal moral swashbuckling, aimed at non-Muslims, who need to be ""told"" that Fidayeens can be made friends with display of sympathy (called largesse, in the context of realpolitik). Have they not read of what India had to endure when a certain bald and dhoti-clad Mahatma used the same idea to mollycoddle Islamists ? Or has Pakistan been transformed despite America's freebies and bail-outs for years ? And if the pacifistic messaging was not enough, they went boldly Feminist on us. Women are the real warriors - NOT only can they beat the dead-crap out of men but also are the only hope for life and for the restoration of all that was valuable before the holocaust. We already have single women buying ""seed"" from sperm-banks and ""making IVF babies"" in India, proving they do not need men even to make men. Such unbelievable misandry and our law permits it. They can perhaps show humans as hermaphrodites with tits in the next installment of Mad Max. As if Indian and world mainstream Media have not been inimical enough to men and to qafirs, we now have main stream movie producers jumping on the bandwagon. What next ? They might start selling Mad- Max punching bags at Decathlon with ""Men"" and ""Qafirs"" painted on those. It is a global hit and enjoys an obscenely high rating of 8.4 on IMDb. This does not portend well for the future."

","I can NOT hide my disappointment after watching the ""re-boot"" of the classic Mad Max. Compared to the first original is miles away, compared with Road Warrior (pt.2)it's kind of in a different league. It's on par with ""thunderdome"". Road Warrior had an amazing story, a goal, a redemption, boomerang scene,fantastic twist, Wez the crazy character and Humungus. Fury Road is lacking all this. Heck, Max is like a co-main actor with Furiosa?! And the story, drive there, drive back, one way through the canyon, U-turn, I mean what's the point I asked myself? Hardy as Max is OK, but this role is owned by Gibson. After watching Mad Max 2 in 1982 I almost died on my bicycle, I was so pumped up.

","I love the summer Blockbuster. They are movies that I look forward to years in advance and I anticipate each opening with excitement. Same goes for Mad Max:Fury Road... unfortunately, that excitement didn't last long. True, the action was top notch and the scope was epic... but there were a few key ingredients lacking.<br/><br/>As you can tell from my first sentence, I have seen my fair share of Michael Bay movies and although I do like his movies, I understand some of the beef that goes along with them. But what I don't understand is how his movies get criticized so heavily for lack of story or plot, or character development, or for having too many explosions, etc etc when quite frankly, Mad Max:Fury Road had far less story than any Michael Bay movie and far less character development as well. The explosions... well, they were just as abundant and epic as any Transformers movie. Yet everyone seems to praise Mad Max: Fury Road.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie should've been called Furious Furiosa: Furiosa Road. She was clearly the main character and quite frankly, the only character in the movie that was worth routing for because she was the only character that had a purpose and a direction and somewhat of a back-story. Max was non-existent mostly and when he was needed, failed to impress.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult was very good as Nux but still, his character's motivation wasn't clear and his lack of back-story or development made me not care if he lived or died, or if he joined the good guys or not.<br/><br/>The villains were pretty cool but there were some instances that made it seem like the different groups would be against each other but then were teaming up without any reason given.<br/><br/>There were some memorable scenes, like the sandstorm scene, and the guitar player was awesome. <br/><br/>All in all this movie was average at best and a lot of hype for a story that was one long literal u-turn. If you like minimal plot and character development, explosions and dirty people being chased by even dirtier people than this movie is for you... maybe. I am not too proud to admit that I like movies with minimal plot and character development and explosions myself, but I still couldn't get into this movie. Perhaps the hype surrounding it ruined it for me, as I did see this on Sunday and many people already showered it with praises (someone close to me even said it was better than Avengers AoU) so I guess my expectations may have been a little too high. Set your expectations to a reasonable degree before sitting through two hours of one long chase scene."

","Two of my favourite screen stars in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron have really disappointed me in being involved in this film. I loved the earlier Mad Max movies and was so looking forward to seeing this. It is beautifully filmed and the design is awesome but ultimately has nothing of substance about it. The first hour or so is almost all action which after the first 10 minutes start to bore the viewer no matter how stylishly it has been staged. Though there is little dialogue what there is is difficult to understand as everyone seems to be shouting as loud as they can to be heard over the machines. All style and no real substance. How and why on earth would anyone play a guitar in a war chase for goodness sake?"

It was a great movie as post apocalyptic movies go. It WAS NOT a Mad Max movie. The acting by Tom Hardy was pitiful and his character was a waste of air time, He probably spoke less than 50 words throughout the whole movie and then was hard to understand. The most he spoke was at the beginning before the credits rolled in. Charlize Theron on the other hand was excellent and she should have had Top Billing (seriously the movie should have been called Mad Maxine) The Character NUX played by Nicholas Hoult was fantastic and I loved it. Hugh Keays-Byrne also did an impressive job as Immortan Joe. Overall it was a good movie but not the genre of Mad Max. I give it 4 out of 10 as a Mad Max movie, BUT, as far as a post apocalyptic action movie I would give it an 8 out of 10 if they removed Tom Hardy and called it Mad Maxine"

So please forgive me if I missed anything important, but after 3 original Mad Max movies, this one was big disappointment! No conversation, just action, demolition and car chase. No story behind the plot, no background, no connection with characters, just u bunch of special effects (which were amazing, I must admit). I am a big fan of original Mad Max movies and went to see this piece hoping it will live up to its predecessors but, like I said, I left after 45 minutes! The role Charlize played could have been played by any actress, nothing special, and Tom Hardy had a mask on its face, again. This reminds me of Betman, another role of him that anyone else could play. Anyway, a very dark film. I will avoid any future films of this director."

","What has happened to the ""Blockbusters"" of the recent decade? There is no doubt that above all other options, the audience should be entertained; but to what extent is it worth to provide absurd entertainment aimlessly and without any story? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is as frivolous as 1920's ""Slapstick"" comedies; except that these comedies are assessed justifiable as they have been made at the emergence of cinema. However, such idiot-ism that hitting and banging the whole 2 hours is strange in 2015. ""Mad Max"" is story-less and there is no plan to involve the audience in events by drama. Too amateur illustrations that are tried to seem professional and rigorous! So what is the role of mis-en-scene? On what basis has it been arranged that do not help the story promote? ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" does not have necessary standards for being a movie at all; and this is the outcome of ""Cinephilia"" attitude that grabs ""Cine- academia"" aspects of the movie and presents inane scenes. Scenes that stems in illiteracy of the movie maker. The movie characters are infirm and unproductive. When a newcomer who has not meet previous versions of ""Mad Max"" watch this one, asks who is ""Max""?, Why does not he talk in order to help the back-story enhance the narration? Who is the ""Bad Man"" of the movie? What has changed him into such a blood-thirsty monster? What is the purpose of the story? What is the relationship between ""Water poverty"" and the movie narration? And more important: Has George Miller thought of anything other than burning, shooting and Rock music? ""Cinema"" is a medium to ""state"" through scenes. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" may gross a lot and receive many awards, but it is a pre-movie and a disaster and if it is placed in 10-best-movies list of many critics is because of the discreet charm of ""Cinephilia""."

"Quinoa1984","10","11","25","23 May 2015"," pure cinema - about time, but worth the wait
","What do I mean by saying that Mad Max: Fury Road, a heavy metal action movie about a group of women led by Imperator Furiosa (and that other guy, Max his name) trying to find safe haven away from the barbarians (especially a Darth Vader-style slave-master) of the post apocalyptic wastelands, by saying 'pure cinema'? It might be unfair to filmmakers who may just love to hear their characters talk. and dialog-driven films can be made cinematic in the right hands. But what I mean to say is that George Miller really would have been perfectly at home working during the silent era, when all you needed to show were images of things happening, frenetically with the occasional dialog, to get your point across. I've seen Fury Road twice in a week and I have to wonder if Miller really wanted to be Buster Keaton or Abel Gance when he was going to the movies. Not to say westerns don't figure plenty in the framework - they have since the original film, and certainly the Road Warrior is nothing without the Cowboys vs Indians aesthetic.<br/><br/>But Miller eschews a ton of exposition at the start and puts the characters right into the thick of the story: Furiosa goes to get the gasoline for Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, formerly Toecutter oddly enough in Mad Max 1) and goes her own path - she wants to get to the Green Place with ladies that are ""property"" of Joes, and she will stop at nothing to get there. Max is along for the ride, one of those great, wild visual touches has him strapped to the front of a vehicle with a grated mask over his face - and is once again the reluctant hero for this journey.<br/><br/>We find out all of this along the way really, which shows how economical Miller is in his storytelling. He doesn't waste any time, and all that matters is keeping this bad motherf**** of a movie on a roll. The first major action sequence, a chase of the war parties against Furiosa, would be the climax of any other film. For Miller, it's just the start, and even when character try to take a rest (certainly in the first half) there's still tension and suspense going on. And when I mean by pure cinema, take the moment where Max first confronts Furiosa and the women by the truck. He has a gun on them, we know it's loaded from an incident we just saw, but they don't, so there's a level of tension for them but not so much for us. Then the gun gets wrestled away, a fight ensues (a manic fight, but cut beautifully), and yet the chase is still technically underway with the vehicles off in the distance.<br/><br/>Very little of that, and other scenes in the film, need any dialog, though characters do still speak (Max, going back to the Road Warrior, was Miller's Man With No Name, the Ronin, the dude who says little but is a big man of action). When characters do talk, there is humanity given, even some dark humor (Nicholas Hoult's character is a good example of that). But what's so mesmerizing and awesome about Fury Road is Miller pushing the envelope even further and, in a way, correcting some things that he went with in Beyond Thunderdome. <br/><br/>The movie is bleak but not hopeless for the characters, and there's barely a moment where the stakes aren't super high. Even a moment that is relatively calm like, yes, trying to pull the tanker out muddy sand with another vehicle a ways behind firing a machine gun this way and that (the driver's got blood in his eyes, woops), is kinetic and sensational.<br/><br/>And throughout we see two things here that are refreshing: a style of direction and editing where you can always tell what's going on, which vehicle is in relation to the others even/especially during these bug-f*** crazy chases, and this seems to be a welcome thing during an era where action movies are cut too fast and shot too close. Miller has a method of controlled mayhem and fiasco, and so it's a film with about 3,000+ shots and barely a one is wasted. The other one is Charlize Theron. It's really her story - kind of like Eli Wallach in Good/Bad/Ugly, with Max as Clint Eastwood - and her performance is rough, powerful, sometimes stoic but also sometimes incredibly emotional, and she's not afraid in the slightest to show vulnerability just as much as the courage and bad-ass-ery. It's one of those woman action heroes and performances that'll be up there with the greats.<br/><br/>Miller started in Ozsploitation with the first movie, and as the Maxs have gotten bigger in size and budget he hasn't lost the spirit of making things madcap, from the gnarled vehicles and character designs to a man who plays guitar that shoots out flames while on top of a rig (and drummers on the back). Why does this guy keep doing this? Well... he loves it, that's why! If you can dig the idea of seeing that, then you should dig seeing the whole thing: it delivers compelling heroes, nasty villains, an unforgiving landscape, and details that'll make you want to come back to see what you missed. <br/><br/>At 2 hours it almost feels like 'that's it'? And last but not least, Hardy is a fine new Max, making his own of the role that previously got Mel Gibson his career kick-started. He may not have the same level of charisma as Gibson perhaps, but the devilish fun and cunning is still there, the wild gunslinger who will kill you if he has to but would (deep down) rather not, is there in Hardy, and I can't wait to see more of what he does with the role in future films."

","Man, this movie really sucks. The reviews this movie gets are really from an other world. You might enjoy this IF and only IF you truly love car chases, otherwise it's a real stinker. No story. No character development. No logic. Only lots and lots of chasing cars. Fury Road is just a long meaningless chase toped with plenty of stupid action scenes. Although I do admit that the CGIs are great, and you gotta love the never-sleep-crazy- guitar-guy. And Charlize is as beautiful and excellent as usual. But a two hour movie really needs some kind of a interesting story. Mad Max, Fury Road lacks any kind of story. I give it 3/10, mostly 'cause I Love Charlize."

","First of all, to put into context, this Mad Max doesn't have much to do with the Mel Gibson ones. Like those 3 were different and can stand alone, this one is no exception. I saw ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" just the night before seeing ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Just general things in common, nothing too specific.<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw the trailers and they looked amazing, but to be honest, nothing can prepare you for the movie itself. You know those ""Avengers"" trailers where all the good jokes and dialogs are in the trailer? This is not the case. Yes, it is an action movie, but an action movie like I never saw. The human side is as important as the action.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road it's over the top, makes you cringe sometimes (especially when you see some of the characters), it's absurd, it's insane and ... it's pure movie experience.<br/><br/>This movie is not based on reality, does not want to feel real. It does want to feel over the top, fantasy like. For me it works, because when I go to the movies, I want to see art, not a documentary like movie, so just ""Thank you, Mr. Miller."""

","First ""unbelievable"" - it is that Mad Max franchise could be SO wasted. I am slowly (or even quickly) getting used to the lowering of quality in almost all sequels: they get worse and worse, year after year. But nothing prepared me for the Fury Road. It was almost uni-vocally acclaimed by the critics - it is the second ""unbelievable"". HOW could anyone like it? What can be possibly liked in that disastrous, pathetic movie? <br/><br/>First - Mad Max himself. Where is Mad Max in this movie? There is just some pathetic loser who has no... Well, he has nothing. No charisma, no strength, no brain, no ideas, no mission - nothing. The rest of the characters - not better than Mad Max. The worst part is a bunch of the supermodels who apparently have just had their hair done, nails polished, facial and full makeup applied, in a world of dirty, ragged, ape-like cavemen. Where did they come from? They just doesn't fit. It hurts eyes and brain. The ""special care"" for them is not plausible (they would have to produce lipsticks, creams, powders, eyeliners and so on). <br/><br/>The story - plain stupid. A ""Mad Max"" movie doesn't need to be very deep, it is action-oriented. But here nobody knows what and why she/he does, the decisions are random. We can not feel the story, it simply doesn't look real. We are not in this world, we don't experience it. We just sit in the cinema, watching something boring. By the way: it is Mad Max. But the lead character is some chick. I know nowadays girls MUST be the main characters in the movies (or a girl and a man). But if it is really necessary, why just not do a ""Mad Princess Maximme""? Why to do a laughable Mad Max? <br/><br/>In all of the Mad Max ""old"" parts there was action, blood, violence, AND something deeper. Here is only action (violence is on a naive, kindergarten level). And it may sound paradoxically, but action is boring."

","I was told that Mad Max: Fury Road has had excellent reviews although an early one that I saw gave it only two stars. I can see why. Its a vast empty road with a desert at its heart. When the end credits rolled the wacky names of characters hinted at a more enjoyable movie but, like The 300 and other heavily stylized action movies, I was just left with a headache. And the frenetic editing makes 'Crank II' look like The Bridges of Madison County.<br/><br/>There's plenty to watch on screen and some sly nods to Star Wars, Dark Crystal (of all things) and The Cars That Ate Paris. But Mad Max barely emerges as a character (in this version he really does have mental health problems) and is hardly heroic. As for the rest of the cast, their appearance has to do much of the work of characterization as this is a film where punches, hackings and gun fire serve instead of dialogue. Explosions are the new social network.<br/><br/>An early shot lines up pursuing cars as if they were entrants in that old cartoon series Wacky Races but there's nothing as fun as that here. The post apocalyptic desert world is well realized but even in the future Aborigines have been marginalized. I got the impression that White Australian audiences just don't want to have to look at them, or perhaps hope nuclear war will resolve any lingering problems from colonialism.<br/><br/>Unbelievably (actually all too believably) a blogger has ranted that Mad Max: Fury Road is a leftist feminist plot on behalf of Hollywood. The blogger burbles ""This is the Trojan Horse feminists and Hollywood leftists will use to (vainly) insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things, including physique, strength, and logic. And this is the subterfuge they will use to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity, further ruining women for men, and men for women.""<br/><br/>I can barely understand the reasoning here: women and men only exist for each other? Equality ruins men and women? But the fact is that Fury Road's depiction of women conforms to number of established types and rarely strays from soft porn imagery of virginal hotties, gun toting babes and nurturing mothers. The audience laughed at an amusing scene where Max looks up from the dusty desert floor to see a group of young scantly clad women hosing themselves down. It is all very knowing, but is knowing sexism any different from actual sexism? Anyway, the women are needed here because, like the female gladiators in Gladiator, they stop the whole film becoming madly homoerotic.<br/><br/>The film is excellently designed drawing on top Brit pop cartoonist Brendan McCarthy who produced a brilliant run of covers for Shade: The Changing Man and the fably mad Rogan Ghosh a dimension spanning Hindu deity cum Jerry Cornelius figure who exuberantly captured sci- fi's new wave for the Nineties in a way the current craze for Steam Punk doesn't.<br/><br/>The trouble is Fury Road is so highly stylized, so frenetic, it just left me cold .Frankly two stars seems just about right, but I'll give it three just to be generous."

"hailhydra86","8","5","9","21 May 2015"," Fury Road is an extravaganza non-stop action fuel injection.
","Oh what a day! What a lovely day! I am a Mad Max fan, having seen the three mad Max films at age of eleven. I adored the films in all their weird and action-packed glory and they have only gotten better with age. George Miller was very clever in not doing the ""reboot"" a remake of Mad Max, revealing how Max Rockantasky became The Road Warrior, George Miller decided that the reboot will take place in the post- apocalyptic Australia, years after the new Max lost his family, because he did not wish to do a remake or retell the story that had already been told and had wanted to update the universe and the wasteland and wanted new movie goers to remember Max as a man with nothing to lose after losing his family. I see Fury Road as a pseudo sequel to Road Warrior and it has the quality of such. Over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets, the action and production design is easily among the top. Using that visual frame of reference, Miller is able to use the action, not just to have cool moments and move the story forward, but also add to the great character work done within the action scenes. The characters are defined, informed and developed by the actions that they take without having the need to announce what they learn or spell out how they feel to the audience. It's all in what Miller is able to capture on camera with the help of cinematographer, John Seale, delivering Oscar-calibre work. People is calling the film ""Mad Maxine: Femmy Road"" (aka feminist utterly trash) That is a load of rubbish. Charlize Theron is perfect as Furiosa. Mad Max always had powerful females: In Mad Max we have an old women holds up an entire gang with a shotgun, in Road Warrior the warrior woman stabbing blocks and killing them all day long and in Beyond Thunderdome Tina Turner took control of an entire town and created the thunder dome. Get familiar with the old movies before freaking out about the new one. I dislike Tom Hardy but his excellent as Max. Hugh Keays-Byrne (Toecutter in Mad Max) as Immortan Joe is perfect. He was brilliant. His voice was extremely menacing, and was portrayed as godlike. What I mean by that is he is worshipped by all as a God. What made him even more menacing is that if he caught up to Max only your imagination could describe what he would of done."
"The-Social-Introvert","8","5","9","21 May 2015"," The Maddest of the Mad
","After about a decade of will it/won't it production, we've finally been given another Mad Max movie. Is it a sequel or a reboot? Well, kind of both really. It's the same universe but everything feels fresher and updated. There are inconsistencies in the timeline regarding previous films but this isn't really anything new for the franchise. Everyone who had seen it before I did told me that I wouldn't have to see the previous films to 'get' it. But as soon as the revs of V8 engines start roaring when the film starts and Max immediately is thrust into a world of poop, I feel that the movie assumes you know who Max is and are familiar with his mythology. So if you haven't seen the original trilogy and want to watch Fury Road, I suggest you catch up first. If not for the sake of familiarising yourself with the Mad world of Max, then watch them simply for the fact that they are undeniably awesome. Wellthe first two, at least.<br/><br/>Yes, Miller has finally returned after his famous post-apocalypse world, after some oddly-varied projects (such as Babe: Pig in the City andum, two Happy Feet flicks) This time, however, Mel Gibson stays at home. His replacement Tom Hardy is one of my favourite actors of the current generation so I waited eagerly to see how he would fare as Max Rockatansky. After seeing the movie once in the cinema, I can say that he does a satisfactory job. Hardy wasn't great, but he wasn't bad either. At times he looked unsure of himself and didn't seem to nail down a consistent accent, instead bringing along a variation of his Bane and Jack Bondurant. And he often had a blank – sometimes comical – confused look on his face during the quieter scenes in Fury Road. Oh, well – not everyone's as charismatic as Mel. I think the best thing that can happen for Hardy in regards to the franchise is more sequels so we can adjust to him playing the iconic role.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that this action film is directed by a 70 year old. It has a hyper-kinetic energy and thrillingly outlandish pace to it that never lets go until the credits starts rolling. Miller has steamrolled his way into the 21st century and he's put most of the other films within this genre to shame. If there's anyone who thinks that movies like The Dark Knight Rises and Fast and Furious 7 have brilliant action scenes Fury Road is an obligatory watch.<br/><br/>Fury Road isn't like made in the same style as the previous films. The colour palate is very vivid which make the action scenes (80% of which were practical, you know) look very bright, in contrast to the bleak look of most post-apocalypse films. It's also the first Mad Max movie to be shot digitally. But that's not as doom and gloom as it sounds – some of the shots in this (like a particularly outstanding one of the camera moves down to the ground from a horizontal position as a speeding car runs over it) would not have been achieved had the movie been made with film cameras.<br/><br/>After a quick opening chase (with a V8 Interceptor cameo), Max is captured and taken to the Citadel to become a bloodbag – A delightfully disgusting invention by Miller and co. which involves the 'bloodbag' being caged and strung up upside own, with his blood being squeezed out through a tube and being provided to a 'half- life' war boy called Nux, who is suffering from some sort of cancer inflicted by the harsh environment. The Citadel is run my now- favourite 'baddie' of the Mad Max universe Immortan Joe, a ruthless and hideous masked dictator who holds a tight grip over the natural resources (mainly water) that are available. In doing so he maintains a tight grip over the ill and diseased-ridden population of the Citadel, and has assured those who follow him with enter Valhalla, the Promised Land. During the course of Max's imprisonment, Furiosa (played by Charlize Theorn), a rig-driver-of- Joe's-turned-rogue-for-reasons-not-entirely-explained-but-then- again-not-really-nessecary kidnaps Immortan Joe's ""wives"", who are implied to be sex slaves. Long story short – they run, he chases, Nux follows (with Max strapped to the front of his car), Max escapes, teams up with Furiosa, and what follows is a glorious feature-length crash bang wallop vehicle chase. And that's the story in Balamory."
"lucasversantvoort","8","5","9","20 May 2015"," Wonderfully over-the-top action
","Having never laid my eyes on a Mad Max film before, watching Fury Road was something of a new experience for sure. Looking at the trailer, I got the feeling that beautifully choreographed action and car chases were what I should expect...and that's precisely what I got. It's inherently over-the-top and the attempts at serious storytelling come across as afterthoughts, but the action more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>We're immediately introduced to Mad Max standing on a cliff overlooking an endless wasteland. Through some wonderfully rapid-fire editing we get that he's constantly confronted with flashbacks from his tragic past, a past in which he failed to protect his family. He tells us he's become a man reduced to a single instinct: survive. He's captured by Immortan Joe's forces, who controls the local water supply and therefore controls the local population. When he's strapped onto a car of a group of Joe's forces preparing to raid a neighboring village for gasoline, Imperator Furiosa is one of the drivers. She has plans of her own, however. She's taken Joe's daughters, who were very much willing to go with her mind you, and stuffed them in her truck. She plans to go to her hometown. Before you know it, she and Max have formed an unlikely pair, each seeking redemption in their own way.<br/><br/>Like I said, the story's quite basic and this is something director/writer Miller's fully aware of as well, labeling it simply a 'western on wheels'. Max, having failed to protect his family, now finds an opportunity to protect Furiosa and company and in so doing, find peace of mind. Furiosa seeks peace of mind as well, believing she'll find it in her hometown all the way across the desert. Max and Furiosa's leap from unwilling team to brothers-in-arms is well done, but some of the attempts at drama are a bit overdone. After one plot twist, the music swells as Furiosa drops to her knees and yells at the sky. All that's missing is her defiantly raising her arms aloft à la Platoon and shouting 'Nooo'. I get that complaining about a mad max film being over the top is a bit redundant, but I can't help but admit that these attempts at drama just don't make the impact they're supposed to. However, I did like Max's flashbacks. They were well edited, the imagery coming at you at a hundred miles per hour. They weren't just visually pleasing, but they took little time away from the film's main attraction: action.<br/><br/>Needless to say, action is where Fury Road truly shines. Most of it takes place on the open road. Thankfully, much of it looks--and feels--incredibly realistic, even when guys are using long poles to leap from one car to the next...and that's a tame stunt by Fury Road's standards. The film also injects plenty of well-placed humor into the proceedings as well and I'm not talking about any of those ridiculous 'I didn't sign up for this' comments made by passersby and so on. I'm talking a truck that has countless speakers strapped on to them, including a man rocking out on his electric guitar like there's no tomorrow. I'm talking countless cars crashing into each other and having the aforementioned guitar flying towards the camera in slo- mo; the list goes on.<br/><br/>Even though fans have had to wait roughly three decades for the fourth entry in the franchise, it definitely seems like the wait was worth it. Some of the drama doesn't resonate at all, but with action this entertaining, who even cares?"

","I have watched all the Mad Max films from the start. The first was low budget, but compelling, with a young Mel Gibson at his best. The second and third took the idea to another level with a big budget, and a softer crossover into the Sci-fi/Western mainstream. A reboot seemed like a good idea with no need for Mel Gibson to reprise his earlier eponymous role. But what seemed like a good idea, with George Miller directing turns out to be a bad idea. The budget is massive. The landscapes are panoramic, the retro-futuristic war wagons a delight. The plot and script is a disaster. <br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy it. The second twoinstalments were apocalyptic fantasies, but laced with a sense of humour, and charm. This is charmless. Fury Road's opening scene is a chaotic tour de force featuring the capture, then escape of Mad Max. Only as the opening draws to an end do the doubts start, his ability to defy the hoards becomes a little preposterous. Still we have the first road chase to entertain us. But as it unfolds the truth dawns- that is all there is. One long chase.<br/><br/>Instead of the myriad possibilities that a dystopian future offers, we are instead funnelled into the confines of the car chase, a poor man's Fast and Furious.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is fine as Mad Max, co- star Charlize Theron is de-glammed as rebel Imperator Furiosa. Glamour is provided , bizarrely, by a small cohort of white robed vestal concubines. However as the chase unfolds, repetition creeps in, and disaster strikes an action film, I became bored. There is only so much you can do with a car chase, and those possibilities do not cover a 120 minute running time. Shooting airborne BMX'ers is a good joke, but after a while isn't.<br/><br/>All this is a shame. Some of the detail is good. Oxygen masks with wolfs' teeth, a battle party led by a rock guitarist shooting flame from his axe, the spectacular sets, shot in Nabibia. But it isn't enough. The established vision is reheated with no new direction, and the interminable running time just leaves you asking ""why?"" I can't really comment on the acting as there is none, the characters just perform the storyboard. Such a waste of money and resource. The idea of Mad Max remains a good one- but a new director is needed to realise its potential.<br/><br/>A budget of half and a running time of ninety minutes would have concentrated minds. Instead of allowing ours to wander."
"thecamillocienfuegos","6","8","17","3 June 2015"," Mad Max: Through the Hollywood Meatgrinder
","Ever since the Mad Max aesthetic was immortalised in the ""California Love"" music video, a Hollywood remake was an inevitability. The result is in many ways what is becoming the standard Hollywood homage formula - outrageous action sequences strung together by a plot and script that seem to have been cooked up on the back of a napkin at the last minute.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film has some crazy chases and is continually entertaining in a kind of operatic way. If you want a couple of hours of action-packed silliness, punctuated by the occasional out- of- place bit of brutality and peppered with amusing feminist overtones that will have male rights activists tearing their hair out, then this is for you.<br/><br/>But, being a Mad Max film, Fury Road invites comparison to its predecessors. And, being a film, it also invites criticism as a film. The results are not positive. The plot manages to be both simplistic and ridiculous, suffering badly from being set in a very weird and unconvincing post-apocalyptic environment. Gone are the dogfood dinners, obsession with oil, and lack of everything that characterised Road Warrior. Gone, too, is the historically-based contrast between peaceful town-dwellers and feral bands of nomadic psychos who periodically show up to rob and kill them. Instead we have a strange white-boy tyranny (that's not racism, watch the film and you'll see what i mean) with a semi-divine ruler (his devotees apparently all being on something like crack), so plentifully supplied with water that they can literally shoot it out of giant pipes onto the sandy ground and let people try to catch it in their hats.<br/><br/>The chalky crackheads do all the suicidal driving, and there is also a large population who do... what exactly? Just hang out being thirsty apparently, since the big boss man only opens the giant water pipes for five seconds every day to make sure they don't get a taste for the stuff. The set up is so facile and nonsensical, the revolutionary implications so glaringly obvious, I thought the film wanted me to suspend my disbelief and just accept that the people were whipped. And sure enough, nobody mentioned the political fragility of the made-up mini-society throughout. But they had to have their cake and eat it, didn't they? In the end the film was neatly stitched up with a sixty-second revolution in which the body of the king was presented, the thirsty people chanted a bit, and the few remaining crackheads folded faster than superman on laundry day.<br/><br/>The premise of rescuing the models (yeah you heard me) was weak on so many levels there is no point even going into it. The old ladies in the desert deserves mention for being very nuts. What were they living on? Sand? Some of what they said left the impression that they had lived by shooting poor passers by and taking their stuff, just like the crazies of the original movies, but this is just dismissed as a kind of rustic charm - ""oh I always shoot everyone in the head, hahaha!"". And this is at the heart of my beef with the film - no psychology, nothing human. At no point do you really believe that the characters have been psychologically shaped by a brutal environment characterized by resource scarcity and and abundance of senseless violence. A man raised from birth to be a kamikaze crackhead is converted by a single insanely out-of-place line about 'manifest destiny' (Yep, the post-apocalypse education system is apparently in pretty good shape!)<br/><br/>Then there is Charlize Theron's escape plan. So the plan is, you escape to your hometown, somewhere that is about three days drive away. And you take with you something so valuable that hundreds of bad guys are guaranteed to follow you there. In broad daylight. Oh and did I mention that Charlize was traumatized when bad guys showed up at her home town and abducted her as a child? That's right, and now she is leading hundreds of badguys back to that very place. Lucky for her when she gets there it's just a big wasteland. Just stop me when this starts making sense. Each one of the many gaping holes in the plot are dismissed in a throwaway line, and the motivations of the characters are given equally short shrift. The sad fact is that there just isn't the time to say anything that doesn't drive the threadbare plot forward.<br/><br/>Like I said, the feminist overtones are fun in their own way, but I have to say on balance I would regard this as a 'femsploitation' flick. The central character is a pretty convincing tough woman, but the coterie of models who accompany her are cardboard cutouts that betray the box-ticking commercialist logic underlying the whole fiasco. In the end the film has ended up more like the video for 'California Love' than a serious attempt to deliver an interesting plot, a social commentary or an enduring vision of a post- apocalyptic world."

","Wanted to like this.<br/><br/>Heard about all the great reviews.<br/><br/>Found the dialogue a bit clunky, despite being happy to give post apocalyptic films a wide birth on new and strange ideas/sayings they might have.<br/><br/>I also felt Max was too much of a supporting character. I had no problems with the amount of female characters, and thought the strongest character was Furiosa, but was left wondering why the title character wasn't the most important character in the movie.<br/><br/>The use of religion as a tool to control people was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The action was well shot, well edited, and seemed to go on forever. There was some reasonable character development happening, during this action, but the overall feeling leaving the cinemas this wasn't what I had hoped for."
"Shcmaylor","6","8","17","27 May 2015"," Am I missing something?
","When I think of a cinematic masterpiece, Mad Max: Fury Road is not the first thing that comes to mind. I can't say I had very high expectations going into the theater, and when I asked what to expect, my friend said ""It's a masterpiece in the same way 300 is."" I can't actually pick apart this movie and tell someone what was good about it, because I was honestly very bored throughout it. The movie is severely lacking in any substance, as it follows the stories of very 2D characters who drive around in the dust fighting pale metalheads. Aesthetically, sure, it had some value, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the repetitive action and dull story. Mind you, I'm not the type of person to get entertained by monster truck arenas, so perhaps that's a factor. Either way, I really don't see what all the fuss is about. It was a rather boring movie with boring characters and the action scenes might as well just be the same one played on a loop. It takes a certain lack of intelligence to be entertained by a guy jumping from trucks for 2 hours."

","It is, as if, George Miller really wanted to prove, that he can still produce the best vehicle chase scenes in a movie. The film moves along, for the most part, at break neck speed, leaving little time for a breather. For those who aren't familiar with the original trilogy, a brief explanation from Max, about himself, starts the film. For any fan of the originals, the way it was executed will of been a disappointment. <br/><br/>Max feels less important in this film. His character is not the centre of the story, but more a part of it. Perhaps this is a good thing however. Tom Hardy's version of Max Rockatansky feels more trying. Mel Gibson made that character his own. It was pulled off naturally, without any need to be macho or overtly crazy. Tom Hardy's portrayal looks and sounds more akin to some of his previous efforts, (see 'Bronson').<br/><br/>But that was always going to be the inevitable disappointment for fans of the originals, trying to enjoy a new Mad Max with a different actor filling in the shoes of such an iconic character.<br/><br/>The film as a whole, wears all the expected fabric of a post apoc' world, but only this time it is worn by a new breed. Theirs plenty to see in this revamped vision, for fans of the old films to enjoy. The insane characters and their surroundings wouldn't look out of place in Road Warrior or Beyond Thunderdome. <br/><br/>The pace of the film is very different, and for some part, feels too much, too rushed, like a sugar rush. This was however, Miller's intention. To make a film, that comes at you like a steam train on fire, driven by a load of lunatics.<br/><br/>If you treat the original trilogy like a family, then they would all be siblings, born of the same parents; Byron Kennedy (RIP) & George Miller. Fury Road then, feels more like a step brother. Related, but different from the rest.<br/><br/>For the younger generation, or just those that have never seen the other three, this new entry, will either introduce them to the original trilogy, or end up being just another action flick.<br/><br/>I personally will find it very hard not to stamp my biased opinion on this review, being that the first movie from (1979) is one of my all time favourites. I find Fury Road, without heart. And to me, that was always my connection with the central character 'Max'. Even when he is the burnt out shell of a man, in Road Warrior.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson just seemed to own that character. Every little nuance of expression, and he sells it so naturally. The chaotic pace of Fury Road, like a trailer to a modern video game, never gives Hardy the chance to really take over the role and do it justice. Instead we are mainly treated to grunts and scowls. <br/><br/>To me, the movie as a whole, is typical of what Hollywood are dishing out. It seems to cater for the below average attention span.<br/><br/>Its popcorn fodder, with plenty of crash, bang, wallops! But no substance, and hardly an excuse to even call this a 'Mad Max' movie. Instead, it should be re-named; 'Furiosa', the name of Charlize Theron's character."
"captainmike-michael","9","8","17","16 May 2015"," Max Roars Insanely After 30 Years!
","This 30 years old franchise has eventually roared its way returning to the big screen with a greater filming technology and a bigger budget, though the same director after so many years, George Miller still succeeds in bringing another great entertaining sequel that is worth waiting for its epic action sequences and spectacular visual effects. Setting in future, the plot's apocalyptic society and sexual politics are pretty straightforward; combining the insanity, hyper- accelerating and exhilarating actions without repetition of styles, all are presented in a creative way which is rarely seen in recent films. While it's not necessary anyway, the film does not have much of characters development but both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, as well as the presence of Nicholas Hoult have a great screen time of heroic performances. Meanwhile, musics by Junkie XL sound loud, tremendous and powerful (likely influenced by Hans Zimmer's style) surprisingly suit the film well, including the cool and classic cinematography by John Seale, Miller is able to deliver more than what audiences might be expecting, even with overdose f action scenes, it is still effectively balanced with emotional moments and inspiring messages."
"t-krause","9","8","17","16 May 2015"," Brilliant Orgy of Chaos & Destruction
","More than 30 years passed since George Miller created the iconic postapocalyptic-road carnage crazy Mad Max universe. I was in doubt if he could do his magic with Fury Road – but, boy, he did.<br/><br/>Fury Road is an unrelenting action fest from beginning to end. I cannot remember any recent action movie that made me watch in awe, unbelieving what I saw. The amount of practical stunts, the production design, the camera-work, the scope of this whole thing is beyond anything we got used to in modern blockbuster action movies. In short, this is 100 percent George Millerness and just forget everything about the Babe/Happy Feet flicks.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes the baton from Mel Gibson as Max and he gets the job well done. Talking with an odd dialect, haunted by visions of the past, muttering to himself and barking half-beast-like to others in his few lines of dialogue we get the impression that something cracked in his mind beyond repair. However, Max is a survivalist machine with a spark of humanity left and, like in the old movies, gets plunged right into the s*** when things get messy.<br/><br/>Max teams up with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the most kickass female movie character since Ellen Ripley. A weird prosthetic arm, mascara obviously made of oil, oh, Charlizewill you marry me? Theron easily steals this movie by giving us a thin-lipped but still emotional image of Furiosa which may be her best performance of her career so far.<br/><br/>The antagonist is scary Immortan Joe aptly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne (yes, the Toecutter) who wants towhatever. Undeniably, the whole plot is paper-thin but, hey, this is a Mad Max movie, not an elaborate and sophisticated shakespearian drama, right?<br/><br/>Hardy and Theron are labelled as starring but the real star of Fury Road is George Miller. It is appalling how much effort, passion and audacity Mr. Miller packed into this film. When I heard that the concept of Fury Road was a 2-hour chase I was afraid that the movie turned out to be a boom-bang action flick which gets boring after one hour. The opposite is true. There are plenty action sequences but Miller gives us few, but powerful oases of calm scenes to flesh out the characters – and give us a moment to catch breath before the cinematic onslaught continues.<br/><br/>And an onslaught it is. Crazy vehicles, skulls, madmen on spikes, a motorized stage with a guitarist as battle-enforcer (with a flamethrower-guitar!), blades, guns, souped-up cars, exploding spears, you name it. It has to be seen to be believed. George Miller has the grandeur of an old veteran knight stepping into the throne room and slapping the gauntlet into all the upstarts' faces who think they are so high and mighty (Michael Bay, anyone?) Honestly, Fury Road blasts so much CGI-action boredom to pieces that even Avengers: Age of Ultron looks cheap and lazy.<br/><br/>The movie is almost perfect but there are some drawbacks. It is kind of awkward that Fury Road is more of a buddy movie (Max/Furiosa). In the old movies (albeit the first one) Max was the man who made the difference and helped the desperate ones to turn the tide. Today he seems to have lost his almost saviour antics and is just an able and skilled post-apocalypse fighter. Secondly, there is the supporting female cast which has very little to do except to motivate Immortan Joe's chase and look hot. They are culprit for just being there to be eyecandy for the presumed male audience.<br/><br/>In all honesty: I want George Miller to win the Acadamy Award for best director. Fury Road is MASSIVE and if you have the slightest affection for action movies, go and watch it in the theatre on a big screen or you will regret it for the rest of your life. If there is a deeper revelation in Fury Road, it has to be that a Mad Max movie can work without Mel Gibsonbut not without George Miller.<br/><br/>It was worth the 30-years wait and it is, indeed, a lovely day."
"ninadnaik2002","9","8","17","16 May 2015"," Oh what a day, what a lovely day!
","That's what I said after watching this one! And what an experience. To be frank I have been urging people around me to go watch this one, as I was blown off by all the trailers itself. These days the movie marketing team is smart enough to make trailers worth while and all movies look good in the trailers, but very few live up to the expectations. This one is definitely one of them!<br/><br/>To start with, the post apocalyptic world is shown truly beautiful. What if humanity was reduced to fight for basic survival instincts and basic resources like oil or water! Can you imagine what the world would be, cruel and mad that's what it will be! So all the dirt in the movie does really makes sense when industrialization in future world is extinct!<br/><br/>The story is simple, our protégé who is more of a sidekick, is on the run from the bad guys, that's it! How beautiful is this concept, but it only becomes beautiful when it is executed properly. The last that I remember of such beautiful concept brought on screen was from our original Max (Mel Gibson in Apacalypto!). At times you never know what's gonna happen next and the adrenaline during the entire run of the movie of all audiences could be felt! All were in for a ride and kind of a race, probably felt heart! One can feel for Max and Furiosa reduced on single instinct of survival!<br/><br/>From the start, the movie is breath taking, be not mistaken this movie is not made for laptops, LED TV's but has to be experienced only on big screen. That's because of its cinematography! Its breath taking and the deserts of Namibia (Or Australia?) is so candidly captured on frame. I will be surprised if this movie doesn't win the Oscars this year in the cinematography section. I never knew the desert would be that beautiful during day time, even better so in moonlight!<br/><br/>This movie is for an action buff, don't look for performances here (although Charlize Theron clearly steals the show, her emotional outburst in the desert and the way it was captured was just awesome) This is the art of direction in an action movie which scores over acting... George Miller is the real star here!<br/><br/>The direction and art work is also wonderful, and kudos to the mind behind George Miller who captured his imagination and painted on screen with magical moments during the chase, from guys hanging on a pole during the chase to a rock star with his electric guitar with n no of speakers behind him. Action 10/10, Cinematography 10/10 and the music! What can I say, the background score heard in the trailer, sounds even better in the movie!<br/><br/>If James Cameron scores in best art movie direction with CGI effects for Avatar, then George Miller steals the show here with original stunts choreographed without CGI. <br/><br/>P.S. Do experience this in IMAX/3D , it's really worth it!"

This is not better than Aliens, Terminator 2, Die Hard, Predator, and even The Matrix. The most positive thing that I can say is the first hour was amazing, but the movie dies after that. Each character is underdeveloped and a waste, all of the actors are wasted except for Charlize Theron. The cinematography is also great, but THAT'S IT.<br/><br/>This is one of the most overrated action films that I've seen in years, this will never stand the test of time like the ones mentioned before, it will be forgotten years later."
"croetoan","4","9","20","20 May 2015"," An unpleasant viewing experience
","The not-too-revealing-synopsis: This is an addition to the Mad Max series that is set in a desert world where order and scientific progress have ceased. Mankind, still dependent upon fuel to power engines built in the productive times past, scavenges and fights for whatever gasoline can be found. Organized bands of highway robbers are the closest approximation to society and those still with traces of humanity and civility can only survive on the periphery of savagery.<br/><br/>The not-too-revealing-review: It has a good story. There are great action scenes. The created world itself is thoughtful and detailed, full of wonder and surprise. It is full of memorable characters, and Charlize Theron was perfect. How, then, did it go so terribly wrong?.... Imagine a talented painter who spends months on a piece. He creatively employs the appropriate techniques: lighting, texture, perspective, etc. Then the artists hands a random stranger a Sharpie and asks them to overlay the painting with a stick figure mural which offers the stranger's interpretation of the artist's work. In the end result, one can still glimpse the beauty of what is underneath, but the final product is irreparably marred. This was Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller had created a fantastic world. And then, for reasons I cannot fathom, decided to ask Tom Hardy to reprise his role as Forrest Bondurant from the movie Lawless. Hardy is a great actor with versatility, and you ask him to do this? Why would you so extensively (or at all for that matter) rely on double-film speed to make the action scenes seem faster? That wasn't actually that cool in the 1970s, and it is just bizarre today. And why would you edit the scenes so that they were choppy and seeming to purposefully stifle continuity and development. It was almost as if the director wanted to regress to the graphic novel format. Somewhere in the vaults of the studio there lies the unedited footage for this movie. If that could be put together in a less choppy, slower pace film that more reflected mainstream films today, this could have been a truly enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>This was truly an unpleasant viewing experience. For those wanting a comparison, think Crank (2006) merged with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014). I suppose that if you liked Crank and/or Sin City, however, this might be just the thing you are looking for."
"CherryBlossomBoy","5","9","20","17 May 2015"," Mad Max IV: Beyond Pointless
","I'm coming here not as a fan of the ""original trilogy"" but as a fan of the one and only, original ""Mad Max"" from 1979, the only one that made a real impact, the only one that was filmed with guts and something to say. The installments ""II"" and ""III"" had very little in common with the first film, amounting to not much more than 80's extravaganza of bad costumes and poor imagining of the future, and reducing the main character, a man of deep suffering and in quest for retaliation, to some sort of survivalist in a futuristic world.<br/><br/>The trend continues here with this fourth installment. There's even less connections with predecessors and it's a ""Mad Max"" film in name only. They invoked some (mostly bad) motives from ""II"" and ""III"" and upgraded them for modern day, but that's not enough in my view. Obviously, there is no Mel Gibson and Tom Hardy does what he can in his shoes but without the charisma. He, at best, comes across as Russel Crowe impersonating Gibson, and at worst - as a wuss. The character of Max is further reduced from a lone survivalist to a sidekick to Charlize Theron's character and the film should really be called ""Furiosa"". Then the verdict on its merits wouldn't be this hard. At one point Max utters something to himself in what would best be described as breaking the fourth wall. Truly a bottom for an iconic character. Of other iconic memorabilia - gone is the car, gone is the sawed off shotgun and gone is the Australian scenery. I don't really remember, maybe the savanna was gone in earlier movies already, but here there is really nothing but sand, sand and more sand - of Namibia!<br/><br/>When I think of it, gone is also the connection to this Earthly world altogether. Plot-wise, nothing in the film could make me care for a world that is nothing but a sandy planet, where people don't even need water to survive - it's been presented here more as a sought-after commodity, along with ""mother's milk"" and blood, rather than a bare necessity. The world that is filled with various creatures, some with only loose semblance to humans. Not much exposition is made to this world and screenwriters rely too heavily on viewer's knowledge of ""Mad Max"" universe. Some past thermonuclear ""skirmishes"", as well as oil and water shortages, are mentioned to explain it all, but they amount to nothing but a footnote. The problem is - they were a footnote in previous installments as well.<br/><br/>What remains is the chase. The chase was the basis of the first and the second ""Mad Max"", and it was what held both films together even if you didn't care about the backdrop. The chase in ""Fury Road"" is truly and utterly spectacular. It's lavishly produced, it's what the director George Miller does best and it's almost 80 percent live action. It seems that the filmmakers decided to use the whole plot as a mere excuse to cram in as much explosions, car crashes, motorcycle jumps and other stunts as they possibly could and that they took it a little too far. Or way too far. And it's unfortunate. It's pure, relentless, wall-to-wall action, alright, but it never stops. Ever. From the first to the last minute it's chase and fighting, with a couple of breathers chipped in every now and then. It feels like a one long trailer and, instead of lifting the film, the action kills it. After a while, you don't know who's who, what's going on or why - and you find yourself not caring.<br/><br/>The whole impression might best be described in the words of its very director, Miller. He exclaimed that he wanted to give the audience ""a circus"". And he is absolutely right. It is a circus in both a good and a bad way. It's a non-stop action which at times resembles a long cheesy Meatloaf video, with freaks, fireballs and even a guitarist! It's lavishly produced, beautifully filmed, cheesily acted and as dumb as any recent action flick I can think of. If you like that sort of thing, by all means - go for it! And brace yourselves for sequels! However, to call it ""Mad Max"" is pointless. The ""franchise"" was already creatively spent thirty years ago and Max, as everybody knew him, is dead and gone. To paraphrase a character from this film - we have just ""witnessed him going to Valhalla"". And he's never coming back."
"kylerynicki","4","23","63","15 May 2015"," HUGE Disappointment
","I am an enormous fan of the Mad Max series. I grew up on The Road Warrior and have watched it countless times. Screened the new Fury Road film last night and felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. I couldn't believe how cartoonish this film looked. After all of the talk about how much practical work went into this film and with George Miller saying in an interview that he views it as an ""analog film"" I was very much looking forward to him revisiting the world that he created.<br/><br/>It couldn't be further from the truth folks. Yes, there are some really impressive practical stunts at work here. However, they are intercut with some of the phoniest looking green screen work I've seen. Practically every motorcycle jump crash or tumble would start off practical and then would be interrupted two seconds later by the same guy in front of a green screen, to highlight the middle moment of the stunt.<br/><br/>Another important note is that a majority of the interior moments of the car chase are all green screen and are all badly done to a very distracting degree. Why this was done, I do not know. Usually it's done for continuity purposes and to save time. However, they're in the middle of the desert and the scenes inside the vehicles where this terrible green screen was taking place were at times of calm reflection where nothing was happening and only a few words were spoken... Very bizarre choice in direction.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, here's the breakdown of the good and the bad to be aware of when going into this film, in order to adjust expectations for die-hard fans of the Mad Max trilogy.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/><ul><li>Costuming looks great. Wonderful attention to detail. - The ""war boys"" are wonderfully performed and developed as characters. - Obviously the vehicles look great. - The music during the intense moments of battle is appropriately powerful. - The conceptualization of the various characters is very compelling.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/><ul><li>I didn't care for and wasn't rooting for any of the characters except for the ""war boys"" as they are the only even remotely developed characters in the story. And I'm not looking for heaps of background, but there was practically nothing divulged on anyone else that was worth a spit. - Furiosa's CGI arm/stump is not done well. It just doesn't look real at all when her robotic arm is not in place. - The only moments that attempt any kind of feeling are painfully saccharin, exposition heavy and accompanied by very melodramatic musical queues. - HUGE amounts of distracting green screen. - Very poorly done dubbing of all of the characters throughout the entire film. Don't know why this was done, but it was distracting and was sound mixed so that no matter how far anyone was from the camera, everyone sounded like they were two feet away from you at any given point. Very bizarre choice in direction. - Tom Hardy was lifeless in the role. He didn't carry any of the charisma or charm that the original character had. - An almost constant barrage of flashbacks for the Max character. Terribly cheesy and supremely invasive flashes of Max's daughter asking Max why he let her die. Ugh! Just super-cheesy bad. - Too many of those terribly corny shots where the exploded debris is perfectly and digitally choreographed so that important pieces of scrap metal fly right into the middle of the screen.</li></ul><br/><br/>Ultimately, I found myself crushed beneath the weight of a joyless movie experience that I would liken to the fallout of watching Prometheus and the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>If you pretend that the other films don't exist and if you're OK with all of the bad points I pulled out above, then you'll be at the very least entertained. The film wasn't boring, just not half as well executed as the trailers would have one believing and hoping for."

","30 years in the making. Numerous production halts, it looked like Fury Road was never going to be made, until now. 2015 has arrived, and in it the golden package that is the beautiful, spectacular, absolutely barmy and outrageously entertaining ""Mad Max Fury Road"", an action masterpiece so overwhelmingly explosive and jaw dropping your face will feel like its been melted, or that you've been awakened in Valhalla alongside the war boys. <br/><br/>Max Rockatansky roams the wasteland alone, haunted by his dark past. Attacked by scavengers, he is taken to a citadel ruled by the Immortan Joe, a tyrannical overlord. When his five wives, his healthy breeding studs, are taken by rogue Imperator Furiosa, he and his army of War Boys set out on a mission leading to an all out road war to get them back. This is a pure chase movie, yet it's filled with emotional heft, superbly developed characters and the finest looking action sequences. George Miller is the man of action, nerd tears will ensue and your inner child will be unleashed.<br/><br/>My expectations were sky high, they've been met. This movie is a royal treat, even the opening Warner Brothers title has the sound of a big, throaty engine igniting, the fuel may be igniting but so will your blood. Then, Max begins to speak. ""My world is fire and blood"", ""A man reduced to a single instinct - survive"", undeniably the finest, grittiest and most exciting narration to open a film ever. Immediately, you are treated to a gorgeous wide shot of chaos, which sees Max drive off into the distance, followed by marauders who trash his car and kidnap him.<br/><br/>Fury Road is visceral and bold, you are thrown into the deep end immediately. When your mouth is agape throughout the majority of a whole film you know it's good. Junkie XL's soundtrack is like having a napalm bomb go off in your face, forced to take the full pelt of gigantic cinematic horns, eye-watering strings and war like drums. A moment of pure beauty is the soundtrack accompanying the scene where the War Rig is attacked by half a dozen motorcycles, its just perfect. There is no other movie like this, this has to be the hardest review I've written due to the sheer amount of insanity that takes place here. The explosions are without a doubt some of the best on-screen, nothing gets the heart beating faster than seeing Max pole vault from car to car whilst a fuel tanker goes up in epic flames behind him. The stunts are the awe-inspiring, there needs to be an Oscar category for the the stunt men and women.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is Max, he is the road warrior. His line delivery is so gritty and delightfully croaky. He starts off like a wild animal escaping from captivity, then gradually retains mild normality but his eyes are always filled with a hint of craziness. Hardy's mannerisms, quips and neat little movements all add up, leading to one of the best performances of 2015. The minute Charlize Theron appeared, it hit me once again why she remains one of my all time favourite actresses. Head shaven, one arm, the other operating a mechanic arm with her head smeared in oil, she looks the part and means business. Theron displays conviction, desperation, anxiety, care and dedication throughout, every single line she has is totally bad-ass, best of all ""You wanna get through this? Pick up what you can and run!"". Best performance from an actress this year so far, it will be tough to beat, as will the film. Then, bring on the coolest looking, scariest sounding antagonist ever: Immortan Joe. Hugh Keays-Byrne gives a terrifically terrifying performance, a screen dominating character with authority amplified by those who worship him. His voice is so epic and eerie, as he speaks to his people and battle cries desperately chasing to get his wives back. All the make-up, costume design and vehicle designs are awards worthy, they add commentary on how the people in this world live and in their condition in this dying world.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult is unrecognisable as Nux, a dying war-boy who is given a chance to prove himself by feeding Max's blood into his system on his way to the gates of Valhalla. His performance alone is the mad in the title, and easily boasts the best line this year ""Oh what a day! What a lovely day!"" as he rides into a storm. There's outstanding support from Nathan Jones, Josh Helman and Angus Sampson as Immortan Joe's followers, each offering brute force, balls-to-the-wall behaviour and epic acts of violence. Then there's the Fives Wives, brilliantly acted by all. British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley again proves herself a fine actress, line delivery perfect with raw emotion and providing one of the most shocking scenes in the film. Australian models Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are tremendous, coating their scenes with innocence and vulnerability, as well as Riley Keough who has the least lines of the five but performs with stunning expression. Zoe Kravitz is a total bad-ass and the lone wolf in her pack, I cannot fault these actress they all did a fine job. It's great to see Megan Gale make an appearance as Valkyrie, Furiosa's contact whose appearance reveals a dramatic twist that completely turns the tide for ALL these characters. <br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is breathless entertainment, I'm dying to see it again. It is perfect, which is a big statement to make but no film is going to reach the heights of raw insanity here, nor the carnage and beautiful camera-work filled with many crash zooms. In 3D, Fury Road comes to life with a heightened sense of depth and hard hitting pop out effects that knock you dead on. The critical acclaim and buzz is worthy. 2015 is at its high point."
"magjerd2","4","15","38","15 May 2015"," This is just about as amazing as a movie can be without any signs of a good story.
","I was actually quite hooked the first 10-15 minutes, the cinematography was surprisingly sublime for what I thought to be an ordinary action film. The colours, sounds and everything visual was just extraordinary.. at first. But you need more than just that to carry a movie all the way to the end, and this movie had absolutely nothing else to offer. Guns, grenades and explosions? Cool. Fast cars, trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other? Cool. But when at least 80% of this movie is exclusively cars, trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other while shooting and throwing speargrenades in high speed, things get real boring at one point. You sit and wait for a sorely needed turning point, and when you think it has finally come, you realize that it's not a turning point in its common sense, it's a literal turning point! After having followed the film's unbelievably lucky main characters crossing the desert in a truck whilst fighting for about an hour, they stop, and do a damn U-turn to do the same thing all over again.. And the action scenes are nothing short of repetitive. How many times do we have to see Charlize Theron make a determined expression and then bang into the cars following her, how many times do we have to see some white warboy throw an explosive spear? Cool for 20 minutes, but for an hour and a half? No. Long action scenes work only when combined with good screen writing and a good underlying story. No amount of beautiful cinematography, authentic explosions and whatnot can make up for the lack this movie has of the basics; a good story and interesting characters. If this film stays among the top films on the top250 list, I will be ashamed to be an IMDb-user. In terms of cinematography and orginality, this movie is an achievement. If you like movies that don't give a damn about screen writing, this is the movie for you! If you prefer a film with substance, save your money and your time."

","This movie will bore adults who are over 40 years old. They have seen this type of video game before. I could not understand their words, rarely, because of their accents. But I knew and saw of the 2nd ""Road Warrior"" with Mel Gibson. I liked that movie a lot. It had style; it took me to an odd end of the world idea I had never contemplated.<br/><br/>This movie is similar to ""The Temple of Doom"". It seems that mountains need to be carved up with skull symbols. What a lot of work for a people who are trying to survive on nothing: Carving up mountains with skull symbols.<br/><br/>The problem here is that the hero is immediately made into a slave. Whereas Mel Gibson had that cool sawed off shotgun to tuck into his belt, this hero has nothing so symbolic.<br/><br/>I will get right down to it. I was bored 1/2 way through. I started to fall asleep in the middle of one of the latter chase scenes. This was because I did not expect to see anything new.<br/><br/>The color of the sands was saturated by photo shop. This gave it an unreal look. So, I felt it was more of an alien planet. But no, this was Earth. I could not understand the plot. They were trying to save a water truck or something.<br/><br/>If you are bored reading this review; just think how bored I was trying to figure out what was going on in this movie. Lots of action to get across the desert. I could see that in spades. But I could not understand why many of the people had white as an egg skin color. They looked like aliens. But this was earth. I could not understand why the cars had to be so layered with do dads. It looked fake.<br/><br/>The first Road Warrior, actually the second film in this series I loved. They have added polish and paint, and do dads, and weird skin paint and wrecked this line of movies.<br/><br/>The one film critic, Mick La Salle gave this movie a ""50"" out of 100 points. I think I agree with him and with none of the others.<br/><br/>This movie is for kids. It is for people who have only seen a few movies in their lifetime."

","The bar is so low currently for movies that schlock like this gets an 8.2? Let's make a movie that has no characters we want to root for, no character build up and no story. Let's decorate the vehicles with skulls and scary stuff and also tattoo people with this stuff and have a guy who wears a scary oxygen mask. This will not make the movie frightening, but ""oh well"". Let's not explain why people are searching for a place with water, yet seem to be thriving and in good enough health to wage battles and have plenty of gasoline when they are out in the middle of a desert. This movie is just a bunch of violent vignettes of vehicles racing down roads and the occupants fighting each other. I was so bored, but because so many critics and web sites seem to rate it so highly, I stuck with it. I'll admit I fell asleep for part of it. There is no suspense whatsoever and the character Mad Max is lame. I just watched the first Mad Max with Mel Gibson and although it was a little choppy, it had heart and it was way more suspenseful and exciting than this one, especially considering how long ago it was made. I enjoyed that one. This one cannot compare. I plan on watching the second Mad Max movie with Mel which is rated even higher than the first one. I think the problem is that the person who wrote the screen plays for the first two Mad Max movies so many years ago, used stories written by other people and just translated the stories into screen plays. I believe he wrote the original story for this one and it stinks! Perhaps he's past his prime. I really don't understand the hype unless it's because of the stars or sentiment for the director/screen writer. In my opinion, Charlize took a big step down in her career with this. I love action and thrillers and post-apocalyptic movies that are well done. This is not. To be honest, the first and last halves of this movie were just the same old same old, so falling asleep really didn't matter. Nothing changed. This is one of the worst movies, I've seen this year."

What can one say: gratuitous violence. A long car chase. A display of military hardware that would fuel any terrorist's dreams. And then, it's a mug's game: a 21 century retelling in the outback of HG Wells 'Time machine'--the gentle or not so gentle Eloi against the repulsive Morlocks. Tom Hardy plays to type. And Charlize Theron doesn't. And saying that, even with crank-oil grease on her face her natural beauty surfaces without a blemish. Even with an arm lopped off, and so well sliced that it wound doesn't bleed, she manages to carry on stiff upper lipped.

The best things Mad Max: Fury Road has to offer are the multitude of intense, epic action sequences and the visually stunning landscapes and images that the film captures. Besides these traits, Mad Max fails to offer much more.<br/><br/>While the film overall is still pretty enjoyable, its major flaw is that it fails to develop any real connection with the viewer. None of the characters are developed that well and none of their conflicts and goals are truly explored. The problem with this is that some of the scenes that are meant to be more emotional aren't very impacting. <br/><br/>As mentioned, there isn't much else that is great about Mad Max. The acting is fine but nothing impressive, the story isn't all that interesting, the script isn't anything special, and in general, the movie fails to catch the viewer's attention except for when the action sequences occur. In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is still a fun ride but just not with very much to offer."
"jantoniou","7","6","12","24 May 2015"," Over the top insanity, mayhem, and violence... and that's just OK
","There's always been something a bit... quirky... about George Miller's film making sensibilities. Call it ""Australian"" if you will or perhaps it's just a comic book feel but from my admittedly American perspective, all the ""Mad Max"" series felt a bit different than the traditional uber-violent, slick high-action popcorn flicks. The ""Die Hards,"" ""Terminators,"" and so on.<br/><br/>This has been its - and Miller's - big strengths. He's got a feel for a strange back story and somewhat absurdist characterization and a deranged aesthetic that drew me to the Mad Max series originally.<br/><br/>""The Road Warrior"" was undoubtedly the high point of this series. Though always a lone-wolf anti-hero, Mel Gibson's Max was far more interesting and likable and the central action set pieces brilliantly and tightly executed. Miller was at the top of his game back then. <br/><br/>""Fury Road"" has given Miller a much wider brush to execute the strange and quirky sensibility and that feels like its key fault to me. It's the ""too much budget"" syndrome and it's afflicted many a movie that was great precisely because it didn't have a massive budget. 30+ years and $150M+ to spend hasn't exactly been kind to this series.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is scarcely registering a pulse as Max. Does he utter more than 12 barely intelligible words throughout the film? In a film with ""Mad Max"" in the title I can hardly tell that Mad Max was even there. He could have been replaced by almost any other character in the movie. Nicholas Hoult's Nux - a vastly more interesting character - for example. Or Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiousa, who may have more screen time than Tom Hardy. <br/><br/>Over-the-top violence and excess is a trademark of this series. To not go in expecting this is absurd. The problem is that the violence feels like an intentionally garish suit that Miller has put on. The absurd audio-visual assault of the first 5-10 minutes of the film, for example, feels precisely this way. What's Miller going for here? What part of the plot and story is he trying to lay out and advance, exactly? Nothing, really, I'd argue. It's there purely to prepare your mind for the ensuing craziness, sort of like a shock treatment.<br/><br/>I was very excited when I first saw the ""Fury Road"" trailers. YES! Another Mad Max movie, finally. But Miller over-sold his story and vision in the end. He had way, way too much money to spend. I would have bought it more if he and Hardy hadn't decided to make Max this very distant, almost mute character. Max is NOT a traditional hero, to be sure, but he has a moral center most of us can attach to. I won't say this center was entirely lost here but I felt little emotion toward Max at the end. That likability was there throughout the series - from the first Mad Max to the Road Warrior to Thunderdome. <br/><br/>It's sadly missing here."

Honestly I find it creative, telling a story with decent details using only fighting scenes and explosions, but what good is it if the story you are telling is so lame? All of the loud rock music and slow motion scenes proves my point, they want to show us how creatively they can blow up cars and set up chase scenes, they added a small story between the lines so they can wrap up a long sequence of chasing scenes into a movie. CGI doesn't determine how good a movie is because each movie is made with the latest PC software at its time. Certainly not artistic unless you like paintings of sand. Plus a package of useless scenes that doesn't add anything to the plot or the action. 6/10 may be a compliment for the director's effort in this."

I saw a tram with the movie poster on it, and the tagline the future belongs to the mad, caught my attention. I mulled over it and a desire to watch the movie was awoken.
Ladies and gentlemen. This has been the one of the best movies I've watched this year.
2 hours of sheer madness. MADNESS.<br/><br/>Witness me blood bag
What a lovely day
I die, and I live again <br/><br/>The best quotes were made by the guy I was wondering why he was not killed.
Favourite hilarious scenes were of the guy playing a flame throwing guitar with massive speakers atop a moving vehicle. Sheer madness.
I don't know what nay sayers are expecting in a mad movie.
I wanted entertainment, and I got extreme mad entertainment. Acting was the way it was supposed to be mad. Action sequences were the way they were supposed to be mad, intense, extended, and hilarious.

","Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) sadly MMFR could have been a great movie (with a plot) rather than a fair movie centered around car chases on steroids. I watched MMFR a few times to make sure I was not missing what others said was a great movie but my opinion keeps dropping the more I watch. I do believe there really was a substantial plot originally planned for MMFR from subtle hints and limited scenes between speeding and crash scenes but this plot was edited out or glossed over. Rather than nitpick on what is, I suggest IMMHO, a few additional character developments and scenes to bring out the deeper plot that was submerged yet still leave all the crash/bang stuff for the kiddies.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) <br/><br/>Extra Character Development: <br/><br/>Immortan Joe: Make him simi-immortal. Before the war IJ was an aging researcher of life extension in big phama and during the war he injected a crude rejuvenation treatment to survive the nuclear fallout but it was only partially successful thus the need for all the Plexiglas body shell, breathing equipment, and blood transfusions. Basically he's an ageless biological mess but as the last gasp of the old school, he will extract, purify, and hammer civilization from the mutated remains as his parting gift.<br/><br/>Rictus Erectus: IJ's only surviving son from using a primitive cloning technique years ago when IJ had some remaining equipment. RE is less of a biological mess but still sterile like IJ. RE is the heir apparent (or apparent error). RE and IF will eventually rule the city if IJ ever dies.<br/><br/>Max Rockatansky: The youngest son of a police officer and a teacher who luckily was in the deep outback during the war and his small town survived several years before it withered and died. MR learned his ""police"" profession after the war from his father while protecting the town. MR is in ""good shape"" and somewhat educated so IJ plans to use Max for his rebuilding plans, breeding stock, and his blood.<br/><br/>Imperator Furiosa: Was to be just a breeder but failed. Because of her brains IJ raised her to operate the hodgepodge technology (loss of arm). IJ's left hand man ;-). Seeing the fate she avoided (breeder) and the dystopian society being built IF rebels against IJ after listening to MR.<br/><br/>The Wretched: Useless older pre-war, post-war, mutants, and moron offspring. Used for slave labor and expendable. True believers of ""survival of the fittest"".<br/><br/>War Boys: Mostly failed low IQ offspring of IJ breeding program but still usable as tradesmen, workers, cannon fodder, and warriors. True believers of IJ and the false religion IJ created.<br/><br/>The Elite: The few pre-war, post-war, and well-bred offspring of IJ ""perfect society"" who live in the upper levels and WILL be the future catalyst of the resurrected lost civilization or else. True believers of the old ways and IJ's new ways.<br/><br/>Additional Scenes: <br/><br/>Adding the expected villain's monologue by IJ to MR. IJ offers MR a bright future in the Elite (i.e. breeder, roving talent scout, and future manager of War Boys and transportation equipment) to help build the new society. Under IJ's master plan, a ""modern"" city for the Elites will rise in forty years from the extracted labor of mutants and War Boys who will regrettably not be around by then for the rebirth of society. IJ explains the social structure of his little ""utopian"" project to save the world (forced rapid breeding of the Elite, i.e. human milk farm) and why the entire Punk/death decor for the rabble (Bread and Circuses) to save everything for the Elites who need it for the real work to be done. MR being the noble savage throws a hairball so IJ throws MR into the Elite's guest suite (jail) to be processed as needed. MR, IF, breeders, and a few Elites make a break for it to escape IJ's dystopian playpen and make it to the rumored greener pastures to live normal lives. Sadly the escapees realize IJ will not let them escape and decide to turn around and take over the city thus overthrowing IJ who now is locked out of his own city. Gasping and weak IJ and a few sycophants are told to take a hike or die. IJ rises, starts the drums, and the ""I am your God"" Speech and all the War Boys Start to Chant to let IJ in. IF quietly says ""If you want the past, then join it"" and aims a sniper rifle then vaporizes IJ's upper head and after a few breaths IJ falls forward. The chanting stops and all the sycophant turn and run. Later MR leaves IF in charge of the city and returns to wandering the wastelands for survivors.<br/><br/>The End."
"mattiasflgrtll6","6","4","7","2 October 2015"," Well-made action setpieces, but lacks in everything else
","It took forever, but I finally saw it. Mad Max: Fury Road was probably the most hyped up movie since Gravity. Everyone was talking about it. Some people even saw it more than once. But when I heard about the movie being pretty much 98% car chase and 2% story & characters, I knew it wasn't really going to be my kind of movie.<br/><br/>First, let's get to the positives. The production values are incredible. When I watched the movie, I really felt that all the vehicles, costume designs, make-up and even the (mostly) practical special effects just had a lot of heart put into it. There was an incredible attention to detail. And that's what I admire about the movie. These people wanted to make a REAL movie, not just have actors in front of a green-screen and fix the rest with a computer.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also excellent, a real visual treat to watch. Another thing the movie does right, putting some actual effort into the photographic outlook.<br/><br/>There were also some decent comical elements, like the guitar player mascot, some goofy and odd-looking villains and some sporadic hilariously out-of-place lines.<br/><br/>So what did the movie do wrong? Well, the biggest problem is that the characters are just not that developed. There are some brief glimpses of possible character development, like Max having flashes from leaving people behind and also Furiosa in general. I was thirsty for knowing more about her, but it never went beyond her badass-surface. Pretty much all of the girls Furiosa had with her (Which she kept locked up, what the hell??) had zero characteristics at all. The closest we get to character development there is a woman being worried about her baby. Okay, note down:<br/><br/>Character trait: Worried about baby<br/><br/>Got it. Let's move on. What is most disappointing with this movie is, unfortunately, Mad Max himself. He just didn't have a personality. Furiosa wasn't developed much, but at least she resembled somewhat of a character and I could root for her. But Max is just... a regular guy. Not the Bruce Willis-type of regular guy, but simply regular. Tom Hardy is a pretty good actor, but he got way too little to work with. He oddly enough had pretty much the fewest lines in the whole movie, not to mention that when he had a line, it wasn't very memorable. You don't give your main character quotable lines??? Whazzamatterwithyou? A letdown and waste of Tom Hardy's talent.<br/><br/>The story itself was also... Oh who am I kidding? The only story I got here was that people need water and a villain is hell-bent on having someone's baby. Speaking of it, what did he need the baby for? And where do the weird girls come from? What purpose do they serve? And who did Max leave behind? Was it his daughter? Someone else's daughter? Jesus, this movie leaves more questions than it answers.<br/><br/>Does it work as passable Friday entertainment? To some extent. But it's definitely not a brilliant movie. I dunno, maybe I was just the wrong crowd. I just want flesh AND bones to my movies, not just bones."

","Before watching Mad Max, i had the sense of excitement due to the uproar surrounding it. The first 15 or so minutes were energetic and intriguing to say the least, unfortunately, there after, all expectations were not reached. Yes, for an action film the intensity was constant, graphics incredible and scenery immaculate, leading me to understand that those who love action genre must have been quaking in their chairs. However, i don't wish to be demeaning, but for those of you who are rating this above a 9 scale must have never watched a truly incredible film. We grow no connection with either Furiosa and Max. Tom Hardy, one of my favorite actors, was given very little to do, speaking about 10 lines overall. Having achieved a connection with the audience in most of his other films such as lawless and Batman, makes me believe that it must have been George Millers fault that we don't grow this link with him. The wives of Immortan Joe begin to annoy me, resulting in little sympathy and Nux, well, hes just there. The People Eater and The Bullet Farmer appear from no where and have no relevancy and the guitarist was painfully embarrassing, almost making me squint every time he came on screen. I am not saying this is a horrific film, it isn't, but please, for goodness sake, IMDb users, do not rate this a 9 or 10!"

","I've been super excited for this since I saw the trailer. I was more excited about this than I was about Avengers: Age of Ultron. Did it live up expectations? Hell yeah it did! This movie is freaking awesome. It kicks all the ass. Is it the most thought provoking film ever? No. Does it have an amazingly original story line with super complex and deep characters? No. When you get down to it, it's a 2 hour chase scene. But that doesn't matter with this movie. It wanted to be fun and it achieved that. What sets this apart from other movies that try to be nothing more than ""fun is the fact that it doesn't waste time on a story that doesn't matter anyway. Lets use the Transformers franchise as an example. Overall, pretty terrible franchise. Why? Well a lot of reasons, but the one I care about here is that each movie wastes time on pointless crap that doesn't matter. It's a Transformers movie, I want to see Transformers fight. I don't want to watch humans argue in a Transformers movie. Those movies can't be fun if they keep wasting time on stupid stuff. Mad Max doesn't do that. It lays out the basics, so it makes some amount of sense, then they get straight to the action and it doesn't really stop. We get two glorious hours of exceptionally directed action scenes with no crap in between. This really is one of the better action movies I've seen in recent years and I really hope they make more. Go see it."

Tom Hardy has about 20 lines in this movie ( 30 of them are extremely stupid ) and mourns all the time like he's trying to cosplay Yoda from Star Wars .

"nicholas-02241","3","8","18","27 May 2015"," Good message, bad movie
","First, I really appreciate the feminist message presented in Fury Road. More movies with this message need to happen. In the beginning, I was excited to see the women coming out on top time and again. Also, the shift in focus from gasoline to water was a nice nod to modern global issues.<br/><br/>However, Fury Road suffers from an unfortunate execution. Fury Road was simply a beginning, one very long chase scene, and an end. It was that bad. I miss the variety of previous Mad Max movies of which the chase scenes were a treasured component. Fury Road lacked character development and plot to complement the chase scenes. They needed to stop somewhere, meet the villagers, solve a problem -- or at least provide some events away from the vehicles to break up the chase scene.<br/><br/>All in all, Fury Road was tedious and I felt like leaving halfway through the movie."
"soneil12","8","8","18","27 May 2015"," Good but lacking something
","I quite liked this movie but perhaps not as much as I expected. I'm generally pretty cynical when it comes to sequels these days because there are so many (and a lot of them are terrible). I was genuinely expecting this one to be good though. I did enjoy it but it just seemed to be lacking a certain something. I'm not sure exactly what. The action scenes were every bit as good as what we've seen in previous Mad Max films. The look and feel were consistent with previous films so it definitely 'felt' like a Mad Max film (using plenty of Aussie actors like in the originals helped). The story was a bit light but honestly I think the same could be said about the other Mad Max films. I thought the acting was pretty good. Theron was superb as always. Tom Hardy had some very big shoes to fill as Max. I thought he was good but he somehow seemed to lack Mel Gibson's presence in the role and faded quite a bit in comparison to other main characters. The villains I found a bit underwhelming. There was the main villain of course but I think that perhaps there were far too many lesser villains and it got to the point where you almost lose track of who the good guys are actually up against."
"stanrogersmith","4","8","18","24 May 2015"," Good and Disappointing at the same time
","I've just returned from seeing Mad Max Fury Road, and on the ride home I was reflecting upon what I just watched. I'll start with the pros - non-stop action start to finish if your thing is watching crazy make-shift vehicles chase down a tanker truck and fire bomb, harpoon, and shoot it up. It seems like this was just one long chase. the cons - and here is where I'm disappointed - I'm a big Tom Hardy fan, but he doesn't get the opportunity to shine here. Why not? Its like the third Hobbit movie, where the main character Bilbo is reduced to a support character. That's what happens to Max in this movie. I won't even refer to him as MAD Max, because there's no backstory to let us know WHY Max should be MAD. Plus, the dialogue, as in WHAT dialogue?? They gave Hardy like 30 words total to say. How the hell is the guy supposed to build a character on that? More time was given to Charlize, which is OK because she is such a great actress, but how about letting her look a little better instead of the concentration camp haircut and the Terminator forearm. The special effects were great, plenty of action, but at the end when the kid overturns the rig, wouldn't it have been more fitting to have an explosion THEN??? And another thing, in this post apocalyptic world, I guess there is just an endless supply of water in a desert, huh? I mean so much that with the flip of a switch gallons upon gallons can simply be wasted??? Oh, and another thing - how the hell did those old women survive out in the desert for like 7000+ days (according to Theron's character) WITHOUT ANY WATER? And why would they have simply stuck around there anyhow if, by their own admission, the muddy area that the truck was getting stuck in had become a toxic site years before anyhow? Did George Miller consider any of this when he was reviewing the storyline, or did he simply take his gazillion dollar check to the bank, made sure it cleared, then said ""OK, lets do whatever the hell we want now""? Finally, one last rant, if I may - who the hell are the morons giving 10 star reviews? I mean, seriously??? Overall, I'm really more disappointed than anything else in this. I think I would have enjoyed Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 better."

"billygoat1071","Null","8","18","21 May 2015"," Joyous Madness
","Director George Miller revisits his classic that recognized himself and star Mel Gibson, Mad Max, by bringing the mythos to this new generation of filmmaking, with larger possibilities to expand its universe and even its insanity. And Mad Max: Fury Road is just as simple as that; it just goes nuts on everything along the road. The momentum is unending, the visual inventiveness is relentless, and it doesn't stop there. It also instantly establishes its own world wonderfully (even though it's already been known before,) but even to the newcomers, you can already see what kind of larger-than-life world this is. This is the kind of utterly enjoyable experience that a true action blockbuster should be.<br/><br/>Even with a larger budget and much riveting spectacles, the direction surprisingly stays loyal to its original style. The pacing is brisk, the possibilities of honest craziness is endless and they still shine on screen. There is a bigger arc from its characters that relies more dialogue compared to the mostly silent Road Warrior, but even so, the story is still majorly told by the action. The entire movie is a grand escape from a ragtag enemies of punks and cults chasing after the mostly sane heroes on a truck. It's a truly magnificent kind of action that rarely halts its totally straightforward mission.<br/><br/>And people brag about how George Miller takes a break from this franchise for the likes of Happy Feet, but to be honest, his achievement there does benefit for this film's visuals. The exteriors look great; example is the sandstorm that lead to an ultimate visual wonder that no other director might have thought about its genuine ridiculousness, and even the transition following after that scene is terrific. It may sound overly hyperbolic at this point, but really, Miller has always been top- notch in this area, but it gets better with larger special effects where the imagination is limitless. But that doesn't exactly defined the Mad Max movies at all. It's all about the characters and their designs and their expressiveness, and of course, the cars!!! The characters are just a variety of weirdness that each of them are immediately established by every detail of their looks and their attitude, and their vehicles happen to be made out of scraps from various models, which is totally fascinating. Worth mentioning is the ride that brings an entire band with a lead flamethrowing guitarist that is called Doof Warrior who steals every moment of his presence.<br/><br/>But the action isn't a totally mindless smokescreen of destruction and explosions, either. There is real action happening on screen that is truly gripping, with the heroes helping each other, briefly yet clearly explaining each of their plights, having hand-in-hand combat, surviving from some stunt, and even a competition (if that's what they call it) of spitting fuel into the motors of their vehicles faster. Generic blockbusters would normally just throw away the spectacles, but here, these fast moving scenes are the story. The acting is stellar. Tom Hardy is solid as Max, and the physicality alone buys what coolness this actor could bring to the character, but the real star here is apparently Charlize Theron since her role gets more character-work among, and she carries the film terrifically.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of the greatest blockbusters in years. Big budget blockbusters' concern today usually tend to pick either light or dark, smart or dumb, deep or shallow, or whatever, but here, it doesn't even bother. It just sticks to its own spirit, except of course, with heavier effects and heightened insanity. These qualities have often turned us off due to its losing of imagination and staleness, but this film gives us a reason to love it again. It makes us less cynical that big films can be as fun as the dumb B-movies we suddenly found as our personal guilty pleasure. It's just lively, relentlessly fun, while the story is simple, it already provides too much of an excitement for one day and you'll be hungry for more."
"theeawesomeone","4","11","27","18 May 2015"," Seriously, how the hell are people saying this film was good......
","Mad Max: Fury Road is absolutely God awful. There literally isn't even a story there, it tells you nothing what so ever. I was practically begging for the film to end so I could leave. Throughout the entire film myself and everyone else in the screening with me had no idea what the hell was going on. For a good 20 minutes or so into the film you don't know anything, you are told nothing and a clear storyline is not present. You learn nothing about the characters, the only person's name I knew by the end was Max. And what the hell was with that relationship between one of those albino guys and that hot chick. They spoke for like 2 minutes and they are suddenly in loving relationship. That's also a good point, why the hell are there hundreds of albinos that isn't explained,why do they believe in Valhalla and shiz, also not explained. A lot of other things are left unexplained but I can't remember off the top of my head because i'm trying to forget I even went to see this film. Also am I supposed to know who these boss guy's are and what there goals are, because I have no idea. The only redeeming quality of this film that I can think of is the action.......oh, and that guitar albino. That is all. The biggest shock of all though is why so many people are giving this film good reviews and comments. I mean do you even know what a good film is people!"

","George Miller is back stronger than ever!!! The new ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was nothing less than a perfection and it even outshines the previous movies. It gets you hooked from the first minute until the very end, without letting you take a breath out of the action. It's a thrilling, non-stopping action movie with amazing visual effects and great actors.<br/><br/>The 2 lead characters are played by Tom Hardy (Max) and Charlize Theron (Furiosa) and if anyone wonders how well Tom Hardy did as Mad Max, he was simply amazing portraying him. He fits really well in the shoes left by Mel Gibson. Then we have Charlize Theron who plays Furiosa and can I just say how glad I am that George decided to create such a strong female character who is the most badass girl I've seen in movies for a while. Her character was pure joy for the eyes. She makes you feel what she's been through the movie and all of that while fighting and killing dozens of bad guys. We really need more badass chicks like her in future movies.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of the best (if not the best) action movies in the last 10 years or so. Hopefully the movie will have huge success and we'll see more movies in the Mad Max universe sooner rather than later. Hopefully my next review will be for ""Mad Max: Furiosa"" and it will be for another awesome movie. If you still haven't seen the masterpiece - ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" in the cinema I highly recommend that you do, it's worth every single penny and it has a high rewatchability."
"mfjr-inc","10","9","21","14 May 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road
","Mad Max Fury Road finally hit the screens around the world and let me tell you, the thirty years gap was well worth the wait. The technical achievement is beyond anything we see these days because it combines the best of modern technology with good old school cinema. CGI is definitely used as little as possible while stunts and special effects are put forward in this slice of madness tainted of nightmarish visions inspired by paintings of Dali and Goya. The colors, sounds, costumes design and characters development are amazing and the film turns out to be something completely unique, a savvy mix of action, adventure and visual madness. Probably the only film after El Topo that has had such an impact on me. Huge fan of the original trilogy, this film manages to respect the old style but pumps up the adrenaline and push the pedal full throttle into 21st century. What surprised me was the fact that mastermind George Miller, now in his 70's has managed to direct a film of an incredible modernity while younger directors today are incapable of doing something as fresh or as original as this film. Clearly a modern masterpiece filled with so much depth and visual elements referencing; the stolen generation, the gender issue, themes of slavery , servitude, redemption and human greed. Shot like a huge chase across the gorgeously photographed Namibian desert, the cinematography from John Seale, who came out of retirement especially for this film, is beyond anything I have ever seen. Every shot is filled with so much elements, so rich of details, I think I just took the biggest slap of my life at the movies. I highly encourage the audience to watch it in IMAX 3D because this film seems to have been invented especially for this technology... I assure you, films like this come only once in a lifetime and I feel blessed to witness the rebirth of the lone 'Samurai' and anti hero Mad Max Rockatansky. One little regret, Mel Gibson would have been a better choice than Tom Hardy who does an OK job but lacks the charisma and the natural flashing madness so unique and perceptible in the eyes of mister Gibson. Thankfully Charlyze Theron is impressive with her shaved head and mechanical arm, inhabited by a rare determination and burning the screen with her raw intensity, she will surprises a lot of people. Thoroughly thought and built this film is simply the modern achievement we needed for the rebirth of the action/ adventure genre in all its glory. One can only hope Mad Max Fury Road will destroy everything at the box office this summer so Miller will start work on his Mad Max Furiosa.... <br/><br/>When the V8 roars at the start, you will feel chills going down your spine and return to the state of a twelve year old witnessing the beginning of a new cult classic piece of cinema like we too rarely see these days... As a screen legend said once ... fasten your seat-belt...it's going to be a bumpy ride! and a mad one...."
"wow3","4","20","56","14 May 2015"," Crude replica of Mad Max 2
","Firstly I must point out I like Mad Max 2 Roadwarrior quite a bit. This one? First thing that come to mind is that some fan of the original movie took good parts from that movie and blew them way out of proportions. That's pretty much Fury Road in short. Musical score didn't go with the movie at all. It was good but didn't fit the movie. I didn't like the opening act and in my opinion it didn't offer anything that couldn't be done with a monologue. I also didn't like that the movie was one big chase scene. There was too much cgi for a movie like this. Some scenes took me completely out of the movie by how cheesy they were.<br/><br/>My viewing experience was probably hindered by wanting to see a movie done in in old fashion and contain a story. This movie also in hindsight seemed to be done with ""tongue in cheek"" -style with ""lots"" of comedic elements. Surely the Roadwarrior had those moments too but they were done with bit more class. Fury Road with its cars felt like a comic-book movie in a Marvel style and maybe it is best viewed as such. To me...they should have had some other title to this. Now it's just something to bring in the fans of the originals, who will feel disappointed.<br/><br/>There were some quiet and almost awkward bits where characters were tried to build but they were interrupted by another loud fast paced action scenes.<br/><br/>This movie certainly doesn't hold more than 1 viewing. Maybe to fast forward to some action bits but once they are done the movie is done."

","""Mad Max Fury Road"" was a complete letdown and a complete crap fest of a movie. I thought this was going to be the highlight of the summer movie season, a movie season drowning in mediocre superhero flicks and resurrected dino-crap...yes I'm looking at you ""Age Of Ultron"" and ""Jurasic World"".<br/><br/>I was soo looking forward to Miller's newest take on the Mad Max franchise. It is not even close to the first two movies and even weaker and worse than ""Beyond Thunderdome"". A crummy and unnecessary 3D conversion, badly edited, terrible script, idiotic plot and meaningless storyline...and just an incoherent cacophony of sights and sounds desperately grasping at some kind of nostalgic replay..which doesn't succeed in the least. <br/><br/>The original trilogy is miles ahead (pun intended). People are just soo underwhelmed by the yoke of Marvel continuously spewing their mindless drivel, that they are trying desperately to latch on to any movie that seems, or pretends to be different. But ""Fury Road"" is not different from its spandex clad cinematic brethren. <br/><br/>The relentless nature and frenetic pacing are meant to convey the wild and crazy imagination of George Miller. But if Miller was a visionary, as all the promo captions loudly proclaim, that was in the past, 30 years ago. Now the most vision he has is what brand of adult diapers he will choose to buy...because this movie has nothing ""visionary"" about it! It is just pretentious hogwash, supported by audience members and critics who desperately need to convince themselves that this movie is the Second Coming! Anyone who thinks or says different....is to be shunned and exiled to the Wasteland...only in the case of ""Fury Road"" that was Namibia and not the actual Australian Outback.<br/><br/>This movie is supposedly rated R/14A, but I never got that feeling all throughout the movie. There is more violence, gore and mature themes in a single episode of ""The Walking Dead"" or ""Game Of Thrones""! And also more quality.<br/><br/>When Tom Hardy (an excellent actor) as Max, turns out to be second fiddle to Charlize Theron's (an over-hyped and overrated actress if I ever saw one) Imperatora Furiosa, the movie takes a sharp dive. When they parade the Victoria Secret models, aka the wives of the villain whose name is...whatever...because he is irrelevant, as the raison d'etre of the movie...then it becomes bad. When the resolution of the movie is to return from where they started out, after being chased for almost the entire movie in the opposite direction, then ""Fury Road"" crashes, burns...and finally becomes...crap! <br/><br/>The original Mad Max trilogy, well at least the first two movies, were a big-punk-rock-counterculture middle finger to mainstream society and the socio-political and economic environment of the late 70's and early 80's.<br/><br/>The current incarnation is but a pale shadow! ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is a conformist, corporate driven, empty spectacle pretending to be something it is not...original and visionary. It is a by-the-numbers, test-audience dictated exercise in mediocrity.<br/><br/>Boy this will be a looooong summer at the movies...and not in a good way!"

I've seen it about eight times because I keep recommending it to people and then sitting down and watching it with them, but I'm still not tired of it. In this movie, Max takes a bit of a backseat to an indomitable amputee and her companions, women from the harem of the local creepy old warlord. Furiosa is not the only powerful one either—none of these women are helpless or one-dimensional. Tom Hardy delivers a stoic yet truly impressive Max with something like 43 lines. The world is what I love most, though. George Miller creates several utterly unique, colorful, fully-formed cultures, and he doesn't waste the viewer's time with backstory—he assumes we're intelligent enough to figure out relevant details and the rest is up to our fully piqued imaginations. Though the action is non-stop, it never gets boring and drives the plot rather than distracting from it.

","I really liked Max Mad: The Road Warrior. So I was looking forward to watching Fury Road, especially with all the critical praise it has received. After watching it I am left extremely disappointed and can conclude that IMDb rating system has some serious faults.<br/><br/>Visually, this film looked spectacular. But underneath its beautiful surface there lies no depth whatsoever. I found it extremely boring and was looking at my watch regularly. The plot was so simple that a complete idiot could have written it. It still had plenty of plot holes so perhaps a complete idiot did write it! Afterwards I read about how this film was in ""development hell"" for years (maybe it never left). Let's be serious, if it took you years to write that script, then you should feel deeply ashamed. Then again, neither Hollywood nor the paying public will penalise you for not having any original thoughts or creative ideas, especially when it comes to big budget action sequels.<br/><br/>Most of the illogical events concern Nicholas Hoult's character. He's a ""warboy"" who's totally devoted to sacrificing himself for the bad guy's causeuntil he fails, has a cry, then a conversation with one of the wives, and then decides to join their cause instead. When he's stowed away at the back of their tanker, the wife sees him, and instead of throwing him off their tanker (again), she falls in love with him after a brief conversation, despite the fact he had previously been trying to kill her and her friends. Maybe she has amnesia and has a thing for pasty bald guys with silver teeth? Or maybe I'm thinking about this film too much. ""Too much"" being ""thinking about it at all"". Because if you're happy to turn your brain off and zone out for 2 hours, then it would be more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The primary reason for everything shown in the film is because it looks good. Many other reviewers have pointed out that in a world with scarce resources, it's impractical to transport a flame throwing guitarist and his huge amplifiers around on a truck. Like most things in this film, it's never explained why in the wastelands it's important to have a mobile stadium-level rock concert but it looks good though. It's never explained why Charlize Theron paints the top half of her head? The next time I drive to work I'll smear some grease across my forehead. I might get in a bit sooner, there maybe something in it. And it's never explained how she lost her arm, or what purpose it brought to the movie. Disabled lead character? Tick another box in the diversity checklist!<br/><br/>So if you have an insatiable demand for watching cars flipping over and exploding, then this is the film for you. And if you don't mind a completely uncharismatic lead who mainly grunts, nor a bunch of things happening that make no sense, then you'll have no problems here!"

","With such high ratings and some good reviews, i figured to give the movie a try. I went in with high expectations but I was seriously disappointed. Awfully long and boring with no reasonable plot. Movie starts out with Immortan Joe ruling over the post apocalyptic city because he's got all the water and gasoline. Feriosa apparently betrays him and takes his girls with her to an unknown destination, he chases after her with his gang to claim them back(gang includes a vehicle solely for the rock artist playing a flame guitar for no apparent reason). After hours of endless driving and shooting, Feriosa, Max and the girls manage to escape only to pick up some old women and return back to exactly where they left. Dialogue is weak, Characters are poor, I couldn't even tell what the role of Max was in the movie. In summary, the movie is basically two hours of mediocre car chase and senseless shooting. I am only rating the movie 6 because of the visuals (pretty good). Save your time and watch the trailer because that as much fun as you would get."

","I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all."

","The story is formulaic. The character development is shallow, weak and trite. The plot is more biased than the original series, which were more dynamic of a story as it had one side being bullied but it ended up with the man in the middle of both sides who were jockeying for power as they are both exposed for their partaking of greed and pillaging while in the seat of power; this film is very one dimensional and has one side evil and the other side all great and noble. Instead of focusing on one man's motivations of intense survival and/or revenge, as the originals, it instead played more into the act of a social tribalism with everyone just coming together, pretty much instantly, because they like each other for being beautiful. With one side evil and ugly and the other side beautiful and very great. Even the crying and weeping scenes with the violins playing in the background probably have most experienced people thinking, ""gimme a break"", as it feels contrived and unnatural.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, the only thing really since it takes up pretty much the entire movie, are the vehicle chase scenes and contraptions. The rest is pretty much same ol same ol. I would only rent it if it's through a ""free"" coupon or on TV."

","This film has an 8.5 currently which it in no way deserves considering the lack of any kind of original or interesting storyline.<br/><br/>Yes there is loads of action, it is beautifully shot and everything you could want from a post apocalyptic, desert survivor scenario as far as they way it looks. I'm sure it cost a load of money.<br/><br/>But what was great about the original, low budget films was the angst of Max torn between the good and evil within himself; Hardy is a great actor but we don't see much of his talent and what we do see is too sketchy to really get a feel for his character. Theron is great too but once again there is really not much going on. The other guy is quite good and the rest mediocre at best - with such stock, stereotypical characters they did not have much to work with.<br/><br/>So, if you would like to see a two hour car crash set in an apocalyptic, spaghetti western future without the cowboys this if the film for you; if you want something to think about, don't bother."

","Bald morons spraying their mouth with... something, for some reason. Stuff blows up and people scream, and IMDb community comes running with about 60,000 10/10 reviews. What has the world come to? <br/><br/>The entire cast may have said about 20 words combined, and none of them can speak clearly. They all mumble in really loud cars, pretty sure they couldn't hear each other at all cause I couldn't understand much. But doesn't matter anyway... all you need to know is BOOM!<br/><br/>em that nobody makes that stuff anymore? Pretty sure these guys couldn't have survived at all... especially the main guy who apparently has some weird illness that might have made sense if they tried to you know, tell a story. Instead they're just like, he needs some weird creepy stuff to make him bad!<br/><br/>As soon as I saw Tom Hardy eat a lizard I bowed my head in shame and immediately regretted setting foot into the theater. I find it hard to believe that the original director had anything to do with this garbage, unless he has gone completely stupid or needed a lot of money or something. I don't know, but I'm sure he had hardly anything to do with this. If he is of sound mind, he should be ashamed and happy with all the money he's getting from this sell out. <br/><br/>Here's a list of all the problems in this movie: <br/><br/>No character development, couldn't care about anybody No story, no back story, no side story, no explanation of anything. No suspense, no drama, no acting, bodies move No plot twist (unless you count going back to the place they were getting away from, which is really dumb) No memorable scenes, no memorable dialog No relatable characters, or anything to relate to at all Filmed in a boring desert (they couldn't find a city in ruins? for people running out of water, they sure chose a really retarded place to camp) This was poorly named... it's not a Mad Max movie, it's a Charlize Theron movie. <br/><br/>Here's a list of things to like: Sound/music, explosions, prop designs on a grand scale for post apocalypse. Very cool in that regard. So that earns it... 3 stars. <br/><br/>Here's a list of things they didn't explain: Who is Mad Max? I mean we're talking 30 years later Who is Theron? I don't even remember her name Who is the bad guy? I don't even remember his name, I don't remember anyones name Who are the women, and why are they breeding? Can't they just breed with anyone? Why are they dumping water on a bunch of people from a giant rock? Why would they build that in a desert, and where is the water coming from? Why are all these people here in this guys dump with him? I mean what does he do that's so special that got everybody praising him and worshiping him? How in the hell did Theron get these special breeders out of their amazing fortress in a giant rock?? That's a lot of bodies to fit in a small compartment in a semi too... man, they must have some kind of stealth! Why is everyone a complete dumb ass except Theron? Why is Theron the main character in a movie titled Mad Max? Why... when they went all that way to the place Theron wanted to go to, did Max tell them there's no point in going on, they need to go back? He's the one who ran away from these dudes in the first place!! He didn't even know about Therons place, but now he's like... I gotta go back to the place they captured me?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?!?! I could list a bunch more stuff, like how are people on stilts surviving in the middle of nowhere? But I just don't want to waste any more time on this movie. <br/><br/>I've got the feeling that they spend a few million on paying people to review the movie with 10 stars on IMDb. Ugh. I can't believe the mindlessness of people these days. There is barely anything interesting in this movie, it was 1hour 40 minutes too long... extremely boring. I wanted to walk out, but paying 15$ for this I kind of had to stay didn't I?

"Coventry","10","10","25","28 May 2015"," Oh it's such a lovely day! I'm glad I spent it with Max!!
","I am honestly not that generous with my 10/10 ratings, I assure you, and yet this is the third film (out of four) in the ""Mad Max"" franchise that I awarded with a well-deserved 10/10 rating! Next to the low-budgeted but tense and progressive 1979 original and the phenomenal 1981 ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the third bona fide & unhinged masterpiece in the series. Only ""Mad Max beyond Thunderdome"" I rated a little bit lower, due to a weaker second half, but even that one was highly enjoyable. All this makes ""Mad Max"" one of the greatest – perhaps even THE greatest – movie franchises in history. It doesn't matter that this fourth installment only reaches us nearly three decades after the others, and it doesn't even matter that a new lead actor depicts the legendary titular character George Miller's dystopian post- apocalyptic world perspective is still 100% perplexing, adrenalin- rushing and mind-blowing! From start to finish, ""Fury Road"" is a high-octane (pun intended) Sci-Fi/thriller adventure with nightmarish characters, dazzling stunt work, incredibly insane plot situations and – guaranteed – the most grotesquely imaginative set designs (vehicles, base camps, death traps) ever created. And you know what is the best part of this all? Almost everything in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is real! By that I mean real stunt work with manually manufactured vehicles that are driven by real tough guys – and gals – in authentic desert locations, instead of computer engineered effects or cast members stupidly miming in front green screens. Lone drifter Max Rockatansky roams around in an uncivilized wasteland, regularly haunted by hallucinations featuring the restless spirits of his deceased wife and child, and gets captured by the minions of the tyrannical self-declared demigod Immortan Joe. This creepy dictator is about to be double-crossed by the rough gal Furiosa, who secretly hid Immortan Joe's beautiful ""breeding"" girls in her massive fuel truck and plans to take them to the green oasis where she was born. Joe sends his War Boys after them, an army of sickly albino freaks that practically orgasm whenever Immortan Joe even looks at them. The most ambitious War Boy is Nux and he chases Furiosa with Max attached to him as a living blood bag! There are many sub plots, twists, turns and bizarre escalations, but they are all worth discovering. The most fantastic thing about ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are the downright marvelous vehicle-designs. I swear, the people who thought up and created the cars and trucks for this film are real geniuses for sure! There are trucks with the coachwork of Volkswagen Beetles, Monster trucks with old Mercedes coachwork processed into them, pick-ups with caterpillars, sand buggies covered with metal spikes and many, many more. Perhaps the craziest gimmick of them all is a War Boy with a rock guitar that is attached to a truck, and his only reason of existence is to incite the rest of the troops. The almighty George Miller also penned down some of the most nightmarish yet intriguing supportive characters, like Corpus Colossus (the deformed midget son of Immortan Joe), The People Eater (a creep that constantly rubs his own nibbles) and The Bullet Farmer. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is cinema in its purest form. See it! And don't just wait for the DVD or for the film to appear on Netflix or whatever. This is a film you have to experience at the cinema, on a gigantic screen with the best possible sound effects. Sheer brilliance"
"GeorgeRoots","10","10","25","14 May 2015"," Oh Max Where Have You Been? You've Been Sorely Missed.
","2015 is gearing up to be an interesting year for Hollywood. A couple of anticipated comic book movies as usual, a few remakes and reboots of course and finally the next instalment of the ""Mad Max"" franchise after 30 years of absence. We've all been anticipating it for too long, as a fourth in the series was to be released 8 years ago with Mel Gibson returning as the titular character. Unfortunately 9/11 happened and the Australian dollar collapsed, the Iraq War caused problems via travelling to Namibia and Gibson lost interest. After series creator George Miller finished the ""Happy Feet"" series, he finally returned to the project with five storyboard artists producing 3,500 art panels, a $150 million budget and then co-writing a script with 2000AD comic writer Brenan McCarthy, and Australian actor Nico Lathouris. <br/><br/>The world is an Apocalyptic wasteland, desert for miles and miles. Max (Tom Hardy) experiences lucid hallucinations of a troubling past, and is soon captured by a pale skinned cult ruled by the tyrannical leader King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the lead villain ""Toecutter"" in the original 1979 ""Mad Max""). While off on a usual gasoline run, Joe's right hand woman Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), drives off course holding certain cargo that leads Joe and his assembled army to go after her with Max strapped on the hood of a car along for the ride. An epic chase ensues, with all the traps of the land and various gangs not so far behind.<br/><br/>What sets this apart from every other movie at the moment? Miller took particular influence from silent movies, 85% of the stunts are ALL practical and 480 hours of filmed footage has resulted in a 2 hour spectacle that delivered way beyond what I ever expected. For all the trailers we've seen with Giuseppe Verdi's music blaring out loud, the level of Punk in this movie is far beyond anything Hollywood has produced in years and surprisingly more violent than your average 15 rated feature (Even when it's off camera). It was like a mix between an old John Waters and Alejandro Jodorowsky picture, and recent Japanese extreme cinema was the only modern comparison I can think of (Something Miller wanted to somewhat approach).<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is our new Max and does fine work as always, though he somewhat plays a supporting character rather than a leading role this time. Max to me has always sort of represented the everyman rising to the situation, and I'm already enthusiastic should Tom return to the character again. Charlize Theron somewhat stole the show for me (Which has led to some hilarious Anti-feminist responses from ""men""), and really was every bit as strong as they made her character out to be. Nicholas Hoult's character was surprisingly charming, and no other actor or actress turned in a bad performance. The criticism I would have is that while Hugh Keays-Byrne turned in a good performance, the villain wasn't particularly imposing, memorable or even felt threatening (A discount ""Lord Humungous"" from Mad Max 2, if you will).<br/><br/>I admit to having a weakness when it comes to the ""Mad Max"" franchise, because I have surprisingly enjoyed all of them but never really experienced them for the acting or even the cars. I simply am a lover of Punk, and I adore the outlandish style over substance Miller has crafted and exaggerated as time goes on. While ""Fury Road"" has made improvements over the predecessors, I still only saw a movie of style over substance. The blue-orange colour scheme was gorgeous, music by Junkie XL was suitable and the stunt work was so phenomenal it made me remember why I loved these movies so much. Miller stated in an interview that ""Fury Road"" contains 2,700 cuts over two hours (Apparently that's 22.5 cuts per minute), and while it all adds to this movies fast one of a kind style, some of the clarity in the stunt work is sacrificed as a result (Studio movies gotta look like a studio movie).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done, Mad Max came back with a large budget and I fell in love with it all over again instantly. While ""The Road Warrior"" remains my favourite of the bunch, this certainly ain't your daddy's Mad Max. Gone are the desires for gas and bullets, this one somewhat deals with human trafficking and surprisingly remained refreshing, new and somewhat nostalgic. Loud and furious, when the credits rolled I wanted to stay in the seat and watch it again and again. ""What a lovely day"" indeed. 10/10."

","I needed some time to process what I've just witnessed. I was very skeptical about this movie. But having Miller behind it with Hardy and Theron in the lead, it showed some promise. However, since the first trailer, which I must seen have a dozen times, I was sold. I was hyped. Usually, a movie can't meet those kind of expectations. Fury Road blew those expectations out of the water. <br/><br/>This is Miller's magnum opus. A labor of love, crafted into perfection. The story is simple, dialog is almost none existent and still everything is told visually. The devil is in the details. With brilliant simplicity the movie manages to motivate ever character without the need to spell it out for you. You just get it. You understand these people and where they come from and what drives them.<br/><br/>The world itself is completely mad. But however crazy it gets, nothing feels out of place. The action is spectacular and non stop. But unlike, say Transformers, it's not deafening and tiresome. It's well crafted and real with the minimal use of CGI. It's believable no matter how crazy it gets. But most of all, it's perfectly captured. You see what's going on it all it's glory. <br/><br/>These 2 hours flew by and left me thirsty for more. It's one of the best action movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot. It's also rare to see a movie put so well together. I can't remember the last time a movie made it into my top 5.

Somehow they managed to have this ""remake"" have NOTHING to do with the original trilogy! Suddenly ammo and fuel are in abundance and all they do the whole movie is 2 hours of only driving and shooting everything they come across. It starts off with max fleeing the big evil city, saving some hot chicks from abusers. Then halfway through the movie they somehow reach like relatives of one of the women and then decide yeah we should probably go back to that city though... So then its another hour of driving back the same way, of course again getting shot at and shooting in every direction imaginable. add in some really badly done CCG crashes and you have this horrible remake.<br/><br/>TL;DR: 2 hours of only driving and shooting, having nothing to do with the original trilogy"

Each review is to have at least 10 lines of text. This movies doesn't deserve ten-line review. that's too bad, as I mentioned. Mel Max had a reason to fight, that is, his wife and child were murdered by the local motorcycle gang. The movie is pitifully derivative, For example, the bad guy is a takeoff of Darth Vader. How original. The one good thing I saw was the location in Africa; that was wild with crazy table lands. Theron was terrific but in a meh role.

","I guess I'm the living proof Fury Road is an action masterpiece, as I never particularly cared for the post-apocalyptic setting and I'm usually bored by car chases, and yet this movie blew me away. <br/><br/>Set-pieces are varied and exciting, pacing is phenomenal. Hardy, Hoult and especially Theron are excellent. In fact, Charlize's Furiosa is arguably the main character and one of the greatest action heroines in years, whereas Hardy's Max is more like a Man With No Name archetype who gets involved in a pre-existing conflict and rolls along with it. <br/><br/>Storytelling is brilliantly sparse and economical: in a cinematic age heavy with exposition and talking heads, writer/director Miller keeps everything focused, leaving minor details to the viewer's imagination. The War Boys spray some silver stuff in their mouths before attacking... what is it? We can guess it's some kind of drug used as part of their kamikaze ritual, but the movie (smartly) doesn't stop to explain. A secondary villain is named The People Eater... why? Another blockbuster would have dished out his backstory, but here we can only imagine it, as it's not relevant to the plot. The same goes for The Bullett Farmer, for the mysterious stilt walkers inhabiting the swamp, an so on. <br/><br/>Even in terms of themes, the movie has much to say about environment and gender politics, but seamlessly weaves it into plot and characterization.<br/><br/>And that's why Fury Road MOVES like no other action film in years.<br/><br/>9/10"

","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is directed by George Miller and stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and is the fourth installment of the 'Mad Max' franchise. In this film, Max Rockatansky is captured by a warlord's henchmen and is taken to their fortress and is held captive. Once he escapes, he forms an unlikely partnership with former lieutenant, Furiosa, who is attempting to protect a group of people she cares for and return to her homeland. The action is superbly shot with no shaky-cam at all, it consists of wide-shots of chaos and anarchy throughout. This film is filled with relentless action and intense moments which are incredible. George Miller directs this film beautifully and with precision, so much so that I believe this film to be the best directed film of the year. The acting is excellent, especially that of Charlize Theron who portrays the persistent character of Furiosa. Tom Hardy is also great as the troubled character of Max who was previously played by Mel Gibson. The film is a non-stop action thrill ride but it also has a significant amount of feeling and emotion to it, especially scenes with Furiosa. Some scenes get really emotionally powerful later in the film. The film has an intimidating villain, a layered main character with intriguing side characters and amazing stunts. I well and truly loved this film. It is undoubtedly the best film I've seen this year and is easily one of the best action films I've ever seen."
"spincrus","10","6","13","23 May 2015"," A movie about the wasteland, and not trying to be anything more than that!
","Never mind the linear story telling; it's mostly void of the ingenious plot twists that's expected from movies with such high acclaim nowadays. George Miller proves with this flick that amazing story telling isn't confined within the (now classic) Nolanesque formula; the plot definitely isn't a psyche-driven, non- linear, intricate and obsessive- compulsive piece of narration.<br/><br/>It is FAR simpler than that. It's as simple and textbook as it can get: the brides, who are simply MacGuffin elements, are being liberated by Furiosa (Theron) on their demand, which causes a ruthless warlord named Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne), along with his troops and allied warlords, to chase these renegades down. Max, on the other hand, just stumbles upon the whole thing. This time, it's not a personal vendetta nor a quest, but just a mad, grunting man of a few words' sheer will to survive. He just tags along. <br/><br/>In a way, he is what Kalidor (aka. Conan) was to Red Sonja (1985). Essentialy it's the female protagonist's main story, but a previously featured strong protagonist takes on the supporting role in favor of a new one. A plot-centric standpoint would call this movie Imperator Furiosa instead of Mad Max, but it would just be wrong. What would otherwise sound like a bitter critique of the plot that I have written up until now is actually COMPLETELY okay when it comes to this movie, because it works! It just WORKS!<br/><br/>The movie is ALL ABOUT creating a setting, a realm, a reality, and conveying the story through that reality. It's all about storytelling through world building. It's the small, minute details that have been sprinkled here and there within the movie that complete this setting and constantly feed the lore, and that's all that matters. The name ""Mad Max"" at this point is not much different from putting the Cthulhu label on any Lovecraft short story from the 1920's. ""Mad Max"" is just a brand name to remind the viewer that this post-apocalyptic flick is not any other, but it's that of the Mad Max universe.<br/><br/>It's a documentary in that sense. An immense setting is being conveyed not through footage that runs hours on end, but through a selection of events, to give an impression and depth to the setting in the short run-time of a standard movie. Documentaries about the savanna would feature clips of a cheetah chasing a gazelle, rather than 500 hours of idle footage, or repeated failures of the cheetah to catch its pray. This movie has 480 hours of footage, most of it comprising of probably not so impressive chase scenes and failed stunt attempts.<br/><br/>The amount of details adding to the universe conveyed throughout the movie is immense. There are hints of a more ""globalized"" setting to this post-apocalyptic wasteland compared to the prior movies, for instance, truly radiating the feeling that the world has decayed even further than before; the Buzzard tribe, in their spiked vehicles, appear to speak Russian among each other for instance. Immortan Joe's car and the The War Rig are both left-hand drives. Finally, the ""salt flats"" are probably parts of the ocean dried up (and over time flattened), possibly creating a land bridge to Asia.<br/><br/>The collective madness experienced at this point of the earth's decay is successfully demonstrated: The ""open-mouth screaming scene"" of Immortan Joe while holding a semi-crooked body of Angharad gave me chills, and while I was trying to wrap my head around it, a premature cesarean section dead-birth scene hit me like a brick. By the time I was watching the ""swamp people"" walking on sticks as if from a Dali painting, I had completely accepted the distribution of water (extremely valuable resource) among the common people through the most wasteful and inefficient method ever.<br/><br/>Then there was the Doof Warrior, which defied every logic (the resources used to bring that monstrous vehicle along), but was an ""in your face"" approach in presenting the constructed cultures of the setting. The different clothing choices among the tribes, the whole ""witness me!"" ordeal; whoever came up with these elements, kudos, you deserved every single penny you've earned off this film."

How about for a reboot to entirely stand on it's own? As of a week ago, I could think of two (""Casino Royale"" and ""The Dark Knight""). <br/><br/>And out from the bare and beautiful desert rides film ""mastermind"" (that is what they call him in the trailer) George Miller, revving his armed, armored, nitro-spitting vehicle of a film ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" which I can safely call the best action movie of the decade, possibly this century. Here Miller employs a refreshingly streamlined narrative as the foundation of some of the craziest practical combat sequences, entirely inventive set, machine and sound design, and surprisingly deep performances, all combined to rewrite the rules of action filmmaking. <br/><br/>The plot never takes any ambitious twists and turns, but it never really needs to, especially considering how much storytelling is executed through non-verbal means. The sand-soaked horizon, the off-road vehicles that look as if they were taken apart and put back together again with bigger engines and more spikes, and the primitive, one tracked nature of each character provides everything that needs to be known about the environment. Miller implies countless stories about each character with little to no exposition, and because the main characters of Max and Furiosa have been assembled and presented with such care, the performances, especially Theron's, become much more powerful. It is almost as if the atmosphere around the characters has eroded them so much that they have lost any use for speech, and seeing such a beautiful thing lost to a world man has inflicted upon himself really hurts on a level that no dialogue could possibly explain. <br/><br/>For the first time since I-have-no-idea-when, we have practical effects on the big screen. The entire movie was filmed on location in the Namib Desert of Southern Africa, and all of the automobiles were entirely functional. Because these sequences are filmed in real time with actors performing highly dangerous stunts such as vaulting from one moving car to the next on 30 foot poles, they have an energy and risk surrounding them with twice the thrills of a film largely shot in a green screened room that will be saturated in CGI when post production approaches. Even scenes that have to be computer generated, such as a blood red sandstorm that the warboys fearlessly enter exclaiming ""What a Lovely Day!"" in insanity stricken jubilee are believable because cast and crew fully commit to Miller's vision, refusing to let such a monumental concept ever feel cheap. The cinematography captures the action in all its colorful glory, never masking any loose ends of stunt work or pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film travels quickly while still retaining a shape and a core. For all of its explosions and heavy metal guitar players rocking out on top of a roaring armored car with a flamethrower attached to the guitar's neck, the movie has dynamics. When a sequence ends, it gracefully fades out into quiet, allowing time to contemplate over the destruction and the endless desert ahead, as well as a moment to study the complex predicament that Max, Furiosa and the wives face. When the camera sweeps through Immorten Joe's armada, individual motors and warboys fade in and out of the mix according to the camera's position. When gunfire pierces brief tranquility, it does not oppress the movie from each direction, but rather it occurs in one corner of the theater and crescendos into the movie's next event. A filmmaker's job is to make use of light and sound to create art, and Miller's new film is crafted in those terms to the absolute highest caliber. <br/><br/>Some may call ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" a dumb Hollywood action flick. They may call it one giant action scene. But even if it does not require heavy brain activity to enjoy, even if it has extensive expertly crafted combat sequences, it certainly has a purpose. ""Fury Road"" is hope in the midst of hopelessness, a world where battered individuals will travel for hundreds of days to reach a land that might not even be there at the end of the journey. In many ways George Miller's struggles with this film's production, which went on for sixteen years, parallels Max and Furiosa's journey to the Green Place. Miller had no idea whether or not his efforts to make this film would ever pay off, let alone if the movie would ever finish production. Fortunately for him and moviegoers alike, ""Fury Road"" pays off in every definition of the term. It is classic movie-making at its best, and an unforgettable film going experience. <br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","Imagine this: you're in a theater, but instead of simply watching a film, you're grabbed by the shoulders and violently shaken for 2 hours; THAT'S the fantastic experience of MM:FR. It's less an adrenaline rush than a direct I.V.-shot of caffeine into your bloodstream. Faster and more furious than the most recent car-based movie, it's kinetic action in the style of a fever dream. A punk-rock, post-apocalyptic nightmare that's a feast for the senses, benefiting from director Miller's visionary and fearless eye. Pure, unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed. Miller's main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity. With the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie, MM:FR is unlike anything you'll see in theatres this year. Hardy as the new Max continues the characters reactive-style heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes, and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction. However, all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic. Through grimy, herky-jerky visuals, Miller gives us practical-effects-filled action sequences that are masterpiece level. This isn't to say there isn't something deeper going on. On top of being of a feminist manifesto, a study of religious extremism, and an argument that capitalism leads to death, it's ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation. Haven't seen the Mel Gibson originals? That's okay. Don't let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years."

","I've always liked Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and would often recommend it to friends, but Mad Max: Fury Road (the fourth movie of the series) made me extraordinarily satisfied to a supreme and fanatical level, satisfaction beyond belief, like no other moment in my life. It is hands down a nuclear bomb in the world of cinema even if you have never seen any of the last three Mad Max movies. George Miller will surely be remembered as a giant of the movie industry because of this. Every single person walking out of the cinema could be heard praising the movie as a masterpiece, similarly to people's reaction to the Star Wars movies back in the days. This was on a level of epicness that can barely be described. The vast majority of people told me they were physically tired after seeing this movie because they burnt all their energy trying to mentally capture and remember every-single moment of the movie. The characters were amazing, the level of detail was mind blowing, the Mad Max universe stimulated me, the quality of the shots were perfect, the stunts were gigantic and impressive beyond imagination and the amount of stunts was insane. The whole movie is almost one non-stop adrenaline rush of beautiful shots. I didn't know it was even possible to make a movie on this level."
"The-Sarkologist","7","6","13","20 May 2015"," Get ready for a massive car chase
","Well, it has certainly been a real long time between drinks for the Mad Max franchise, and I must that that this latest release – or should I use the term 'power up' (the term director George Miller used to describe this latest reincarnation) – pretty much gives every Mad Max fan what they would have wanted. There is probably only one thing that anybody familiar with the original movies would expect, and that is basically massive car chase in some really hotted up post-apocalyptic vehicles. Okay, the original didn't actually have anything along those lines, but when you get to the second and third movies that is what you end up in the climax.<br/><br/>It seems that this time Miller has pretty much ditched the plot – well, there actually is a plot, but you don't go to a Mad Max film for a detailed and absorbing plot – simply for the car chase. Basically the movie has Max captured by a group known as the Warboys and when one of their drivers, Furiousa suddenly changes directions and heads off into the desert, they all grab their vehicles and go chasing after it. So, for about a third of the movie we have this massive car chase, during which Max escapes and joins Furiousa. They then manage to outrun the Warboys and reach their destination, only to discover that there is basically nothing there, so they decide to turn around to go back, which, due to the Warboys still chasing them, results in the rest of the movie being a massive car chase. As I suggested, this isn't some ordinary Hollywood car-chase, this is a Mad Max car chase where you have all of these hotted up cars that look like works of post-apocalyptic art in and of themselves.<br/><br/>The funny thing about this film is that there are a number of posts about how this film seems to emasculate men. Okay, I didn't actually read them but I thought that it was quite amusing to see criticisms of this kind laid against the film. Still, it doesn't seem to have affected its earnings all that much, or the reviews. In fact most of the reviews that I have read use words along the lines of 'insane'. Okay, the thin strand called a plot that holds this film together is about how the renegade Furiousa is helping the wives of the Warboy boss escape his harem, and Furiousa's former tribe was a tribe of women, who after being reunited turn and declare war against the Warboys. Despite that I would hardly suggest that this plot serves to emasculate men (unless of course those men who are complaining of this have problems with their masculinity). We need to remember that this is the world of Mad Max where the strong rule and the weak are turned to slaves. What Max does is that he overturns this order and gives power back to the weak.<br/><br/>Mad Max is also a world of shattered dreams. Like the previous film Beyond Thunder Dome the characters have this dream of reaching a green and verdant land – a paradise, but this paradise does not exist. In the end it turns out that the only paradise of any meaning is already being ruled by the gangs. As such it comes down to a wrestle where the strong fight the strong, it is just that one of the belligerents, Mad Max, is using his strength to empower the weak.<br/><br/>It is also interesting that Miller has created a much more psychological aspect to Max's character, something which we never saw in the previous films. Max, as we discover, is forever haunted by the death of his wife and family, having been killed by gangs during the time when civilisation was in the process of collapsing. Now he is just a road warrior that travels the desert, reluctantly helping those in need. While he is a loner, he knows how to fight and he shows his enemies no mercy. However, just like the lone ranger that his character represents, at the end of the film, he turns and walks back into the desert."

","This is a wonderful movie full of action that gives you everything you need plus more. If your looking for a great action movie with a believable star and Co Star this is it. They don't over use CGI, and they don't try to give you a little bit of everything they just stick with what they do great. Some of the scenes in this movie non action scene were amazing. (Very Artful)<br/><br/>Those of you complaining about lack of story and lack of character progression... stop whining and see a movie that fits your needs if that is what your looking for. You have to judge a movie based of what it is and what it is supposed to be. This fell short no where. If you want a story see a drama. Or watch another crappy action movie try to give both at the same time and end up with a half assed story and bad action sequences. In all fairness given the situation the characters are in, how else could they even progress which they did a great deal, you just were probably upset because it didn't go down the typical road.

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","9","8","19","13 June 2015"," ""Oh what a day! What a lovely day!""
","It has been a long and troubled road to bring Mad Max back to the big screen - but it looks like all the behind-the-scenes drama was worth it as Fury Road is the best action movie of the year and, I would argue, one of the best to come along in years. What makes it work is the lack of CGI and the reliance on a lot of amazing stunt work as well as the impressive turn from Charlize Theron who raises the bar for action heroines.<br/><br/>Despite being titled ""Mad Max"" Tom Hardy really plays a supporting role. The film opens with Max, who has survived the harsh future, where gas has become the hottest commodity, but not without sacrifice. He has lost his family, friends and has earned his nickname wondering if he is mad or if it's everyone else. He is captured by a group of bandits run by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) - who is hooked up to a machine to keep him breathing (along with suffering from some nasty skin lesions) but none-the-less controls his piece of the world thanks to controlling a source of water. He keeps a harem of women ""breeders"" as well as an army of half-life warriors (so named due to the radiation that shortens life spans). One of his high-ranking warriors, Imperator Furiosa (Theron) is going on a run to Gas Town and Bullet Town (not the most original of names) for a supply run - but soon after makes a detour.<br/><br/>Soon enough, Joe finds out she has taken his prize breeding women and summons all the forces at hand to go after her. This includes warrior Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who brings his ""bloodbag"" along with him (wouldn't you know it - Mad Max) so he can drive. Thus begins what is arguably one the longest, and most impressive, car chases in film history. Mad Max was filmed in Nambia, across vast deserts and canyons and about 80% of the effects are practical - stunts, makeup, sets and the like - and I think this greatly enhances the tone and impact of the film.<br/><br/>The film is very visceral - you feel the action, the explosions, gunshots, crashes - it's all very in- your-face and unrelenting. Despite that, unlike, say, Transformers, the action is also much easier to follow. It's intense, and often over-the-top, but it never feels fake or cheesy. And the characters - man, if you want female empowerment in action, look no further. If Theron could kill you with a look - she would have taken out entire armies with the dagger stares she throws out in Fury Road. She cranks things up to 11 and never lets down on the gas. And she is surrounded by a supporting cast - Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Megan Gale, Melissa Jaffer, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton - that gives women everywhere a reason to cheer. From toting sniper rifles and explosive spears to shotguns, handguns and even knives - thought they may appear to be fragile and scared, these women know how to fight.<br/><br/>The men in the films (given names like Rictus Erectus, Slit, The People Eater, The Organic Mechanic and The Doof Warrior) are all either twisted, unhinged or insane - yes, even Max himself isn't exactly ""hero"" material. The characters all seem to suffer from some malignant sickness (likely due to the radiation) or mutilation. They are mean, ugly and ruthless. When someone gets their face blown off or is crushed under the wheels of a vehicle, you don't feel bad. Mad Max doesn't exactly glorify its brutal violence, but neither does it shy away from it.<br/><br/>For pure action, you're not likely to find another film that delivers in such a way as Fury Road. It never hides what it is but, surprisingly, for all this action it does have a good plot, one that provides a nice commentary on how we view and treat women, and the dangers of following the wrong man (or even the right one, sometimes). Enjoy the action, sure, but know there are layers under all that grit that make a lot more sense than all the mindless movies Hollywood tends to throw at us."

","Mad Max 4ury road is one heck of a movie. While not as good as ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" this film manages to breath new life into the Max Mythos, and has me very excited for any future sequels. Enjoyed this one thoroughly. Tom ""For You"" Hardy Kills it as Max, and Theron is a total unrepentant BadA**. This is what action movies are all about. God, it's so cool. it's just....a really cool movie. I can't stress that enough. The main plot involves Max teaming up with Theron's Furiosa, begrudgingly at first, but slowly gaining each other's trust, to steal a Warlord's prized collection of wives, and deliver them to safety. The simplicity of the plot allows for some beautifully well crafted action sequences, set against an intensely colorful and gorgeous background. This is just a well made, well acted, well written, and downright entertaining addition to the Mad Max Saga. It's a ten from me."
"Old_Man_From_Scene_24","9","7","16","26 May 2015"," It's good, but it's not The Road Warrior
","Spoilers, ye be here.<br/><br/>I went to see this with high hopes, and that's always a bad idea. The action was solid, the acting decent and the plot interesting. None of those three things was outstanding, though the cinematography for every action sequence was quite enthralling. What we have here is a spiritual successor to the original trilogy (can we please just forget the third film?) that works well, setting the tone perfectly for future installments, but which still needs work as a stand-alone production. I, for one, would like to know how Furiosa found and escaped with Joe's brides, unnoticed, how she came to be in charge of a rig in what's supposed to be a predominantly male society (I have no problems with this, but given the world structure it NEEDS explaining), how Joe and his disturbingly- malformed cronies came to be in charge in the first place, and how Max lost his family. I suppose a run-down of Furiosa being taken as a child would be a good inclusion too.<br/><br/>We're given hints of these important points, but no outright explanations, which makes the movie feel like an out-and-out popcorn flick that is amazingly rated on this site. My only major complaint is that the five wives were just there. They existed only to serve the plot and added very little as individual characters. And I have no interest in getting into the supposed feminist message here. It's actually anti-slavery and little else. <br/><br/>Overall, nothing is 'outstanding', but nothing is terrible either. This is a solid movie that should, and will, do well at the box office, that will captivate audiences and that will ensure Mad Max is reborn as a long-time series once again. <br/><br/>I live, I die, I live again."
"bjorn-erik-johansen","6","7","16","24 May 2015"," Boring entertainment. Decent movie, but overrated.
","First off, Mad Max: Fury Road is no bad movie by any means. The movie takes the viewers on a crazy ride that does not stop. Although the action is close to flawless, it will never cover the obvious weaknesses in the plot.<br/><br/>I will say the acting for the most part is up to par, and Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron does a great job. And i found Nicholas Hoult especially good. What makes the acting no better than it is, is the bad writing. The three actors have few lines, and the ones they do have are not exactly hard to pull off. ¨<br/><br/>Further on, as previously mentioned, the action featured in this movie is very good, however the action is pretty much all the same throughout the movie. We get a lot of explosions, blood and fighting, but what you will realize after a while is that it is the exact same explosion, the exact same blood and the exact same fighting. The only difference being everyone driving one way, then the exact opposite way. This is what makes the entertainment turn boring . It gets stale. <br/><br/>As for the plot, i have already touched on it. They go one way, then they go the other way, while defeating the bad guy. As weak as it gets. <br/><br/>Basically what you are getting from the movie is what the trailer is giving you. Action on vehicles. I was entertained to a extent while watching the movie, but had nothing left when it was done. I have not watched the earlier Mad Max films, and this installment has not tickled my curiosity. If you are looking for action and crazy, this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a film with even a touch of meaning, this is not for you. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 6/10"

","To quote a different old Mel Gibson action flick, maybe ""I'm getting too old for this spit."" (TV censored version) I honestly don't understand the seemingly universal praise of this effort. I hesitate to even call it a movie because in reality it's a two hour chase scene. It certainly has its moments and I can appreciate the impressive real world stunts and explosions. I also give it high marks for being exactly what it advertised itself to be a balls-to-the-walls insane action romp pivoting off the original films. For me, that romp played out like watching an insane person's nightmares over and over and over. The first two acts grew tedious and became something to endure rather than enjoy. Then, the third act hit and the last 20 minutes were amazing. You almost come to care about characters even though none of them were bothered to be developed along the way. Almost."

The scripts were about characters.<br/><br/>That said, I must explain why I gave this part such a high vote (7). The action part of the movie is really great.

"BrentHankins","9","7","16","14 May 2015"," Brilliantly directed and strikingly original.
","""I f**king loved it.""<br/><br/>That was my initial reaction after walking out of the theater following the screening of Mad Max: Fury Road, and 24 hours later I feel exactly the same. Trapped in a state of perpetual forward motion and absolutely relentless in its pacing, it's a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, mind-blowing experience that sets a new standard for what audiences should expect from action filmmaking.<br/><br/>From the first shot of Max (Tom Hardy) surveying the wasteland, the film shifts into high gear and never looks back. It's nearly a full 30 minutes before you'll have a chance to catch your breath, and even that respite lasts mere moments before the engines are roaring, the bullets are flying, and the characters are pressing ever onward.<br/><br/>Along the way, we encounter the major players in this post- apocalyptic tale: there's Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a dictator who controls the only source of clean water and breeds a constantly supply of his ""war boys"" to keep himself in power; Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's most trusted lieutenants and driver of the massive War Rig; and Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a war boy with a surprising connection to Max, who yearns to prove himself on the battlefield.<br/><br/>And then there are the Breeders (Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton), smuggled away in the cargo hold of the War Rig, racing cross the desert in a desperate attempt to free themselves of Joe's tyranny. Furiosa's decision to defy her master and smuggle his wives away to her childhood homeland is the spark which ignites the fires of war, and it's not long before Joe and his entire army - not to mention the surrounding clans - are bearing down on Furiosa and Max.<br/><br/>But these women are no damsels in distress - quite the contrary, in fact. Furiosa is every bit the warrior that Max is, proving her mettle time and again throughout the never-ending chaos, and the wives are smart and strong-willed, resolute in their decision to no longer be seen as objects, but rather as people. Each character is given ample time in the spotlight, and if anything, it's Max that winds up getting a little short-changed here.<br/><br/>The final chase scene during the third act of The Road Warrior has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed, so it's only fitting that it should finally be dethroned by the same director. Mad Max: Fury Road feels like George Miller set out to film a two-hour version of that same sequence, only with bigger cars, bigger guns, bigger explosions and of course, a bigger budget. Everything about this film is big, and that's exactly how it should be seen: on the biggest screen, with the biggest speakers, and surrounded by the biggest audience you can find.<br/><br/>If that sounds exhausting, you're not wrong - but it's exhausting in the absolute best way possible. I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like this released by a major motion picture studio, and Warner Bros. deserves all the credit in the world for allowing Miller to bring his vision to life on such an impossibly enormous scale. Mad Max: Fury Road is a brilliantly-directed, strikingly original film, extending a defiant leather-clad middle finger to a genre that is all too often flooded with mediocrity, and daring the rest of Hollywood to elevate their game."
"Anton_Klink","9","3","5","17 April 2020"," I thought they didn't make action movies like this anymore...
","I am your atypical action movie fan, as I usually fall half asleep during chase scenes, since I really don't care for the usually accompanying shoddy shaky-cam camerawork plus I find cars and speeding utterly boring to begin with. For me, car chases are the low point of any action movie and half of the time, I am tempted fast-forward to the ""good parts"". Sounds like I'd be in for a most disappointing movie experience with this movie, since Fury Road is more or less a two hour car chase. Boy was I wrong. I can't recall when was the last time I was so enthralled with the relentless on-screen action. What I especially like about the movie, is that while battle fatigue is always a concern with heavier action movies and could easily set in even within a few minutes in lesser movies, but not this time, as George Miller manages to keep things constantly fresh, interesting and exciting throughout this relentless two hour chase. Not only that, but he also manages to rev up the engine ever so slightly throughout the movie, that even though the action already starts on high speed, it just keeps gathering more speed right until the very end. As for the the car chase, apparently most other action movies just don't know how to do a proper car chase but finally someone has done it right. While other movies have iconic action scenes, this movie is just one colossal action scene from start to finish. An absolutely towering achievement in the genre of action movies, I hope this movie will shine a path for many like-minded movies to come."

I give it 6/10 because it's mildly entertaining and fast moving, plus the sets, cinematography, action sequences, costumes and sound design are all great. But the characters and the story left no mark on me whatsoever.

I didn't just forget Lord of the Rings, 12 Angry Men, Back to the Future, Toy Story, The Shining, even Frozen for god's sake! - actual memorable stories<br/><br/>What the hell happens in Mad Max: Fury Road?!
There's a cliché evil bad guy with absolutely zero depth. There's a 1 armed women who is the main character and there's a guy called Max who says nothing, we know pretty much nothing about and does nothing to care about. And the same goes for all other characters we're supposed to root for. Why do we even care where they're going? The characters themselves don't even know or care where they're going, as evidenced by the fact: they just go through a bunch of desert car chases in the desert then get to somewhere quiet in the desert, meet some old ladies who have no depth, then they drive back so they can do some car chases again. Oh yeah and the evil dictator has a big stash of drinking water. Okay let's kill him and release all the drinking water onto the floor. Yay, now we're the rulers! The end.<br/><br/>What happened in our generation to gain critical appreciation for this mindless crap? Yes it's got explosions and great vehicles and spikes to look at, but where's the soul?<br/><br/>I wonder if an older film with actual soul like... 12 Angry Men... would still hold up to this generation, maybe it's just lost like tears in the rain...."

","Whilst there were a couple of good things about this film, I ultimately found Fury Road very disappointing, and my Suspension of Disbelief was trashed by all the unbelievable garbage this film contains. Tom Hardy wasn't bad as the new Max and Charlize Theron's Furiosa was a strong female character in the tradition of the franchise. I am a fan of both of these actors, but the screenplay was just awful; cheesy, lame dialogue, so bad it was vomit inducing: ""Why are you hurting those people?"" - ""It's the oil stupid."" - ""Mankind has gone rogue, terrorising itself."" The Fury Road prologue was badly written trash compared to the poetic prologue of The Road Warrior. ""Do not my friends, become addicted to water, it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence."" WTF? Who wrote this moronic tripe? Fury Road broke the cardinal rule of film-making - Show, Don't Tell. Fury Road showed us nothing (except car chases and stunts) and Told us Everything (very badly). Fury Road introduced some interesting concepts and then failed to explore any of them adequately, and subsequently the expositional info dumps were totally unbelievable. A good sequel should expand on the original, and show us something new along with the familiar elements. Apart from the pathetic Granny Biker Gang, Fury Road showed us exactly what we had seen before except it was ten times more over the top. Even the awful Beyond Thunderdome showed us something new.<br/><br/>It was way too over the top and didn't fit the gritty, more realistic tone of the earlier films. It was a comic-book version with embarrassingly bad dialogue and bad acting, (that Bullet-Farmer guy has to be the worst actor I've ever seen). In The Road Warrior it was established that projectile weapons were rare and ammunition even rarer and carefully hoarded, but in Fury Road they fire off thousands of rounds. Fuel was even rarer yet in Fury Road there are enormous amounts of fuel wasted: that idiot with the Guitar/Flamethrower was ridiculous, in the post-apocalypse wasteland fuel would be a resource strictly rationed not shot out of guitars (even though we're TOLD there's a place called ""Gas Town"" it still doesn't make sense to waste it like that, oil deposits do dry up). As the dude sitting in front of us rightly stated ""What a load of bullcrap"". EXACTLY.<br/><br/>The biggest WTF? moment in Fury Road was the ludicrous idea that you could carry enough extra fuel on motorbikes to travel for one hundred and sixty days, not to mention the fact that even from the east coast to the west coast of Australia, the trip would only take four or five days tops. After sixteen days riding in a straight line you'd be somewhere in the middle of the ocean. Utter trash.<br/><br/>With The Road Warrior George Miller struck gold and he has been repeating himself ever since, trying and failing to recapture what made the Road Warrior a worldwide hit by plagiarising himself. Fury Road rips off scenes from the first three films:<br/><br/>The Film Going out Of Focus as Max crawls away from the wreckage of the Interceptor: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>A Thieving Pilot is Redeemed at The End: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.<br/><br/>Max Wears a Mis-Matched Pair of Boots - Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>The Wind-up Music Box - The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>Max Pulls Out A Hundred Concealed Guns: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>Someone Plays a Saxophone Solo: Mad Max. Beyond Thunderdome.<br/><br/>The White Painted Guy: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>The Feral Kid: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.<br/><br/>Granny with a Shotgun: Mad Max. Fury Road.<br/><br/>Max's Shotgun Misfires: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>People Tied To The Front Of Vehicles: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>Max Buried In The Sand: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>The Antagonist Dies in a Head-On Collision with a Truck: Mad Max. The Road Warrior.<br/><br/>The Interceptor is Trashed: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>Max Gets a Haircut and Kids Collect the Discarded Hair: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>A Massive Dust Storm: Beyond Thunderdome. Fury Road.<br/><br/>The Good Guys Escape Leaving Max Behind: The Road Warrior. Beyond Thunderdome.<br/><br/>A Character Finds Redemption Inspired By Love: The Road Warrior. Fury Road.<br/><br/>The Road Battle: Fury Road is just a feature length remake of The Road Warrior's climactic road battle.<br/><br/>After reading interviews with George Miller I have realised that he really doesn't have a clue:<br/><br/>""The previous three films exist in no clear chronology, because they were all conceived as different films."" WTF? The first three films are in strict chronological order.<br/><br/>1. Mad Max: Civilisation exists, there is Government, Law and Order and infrastructure. The Interceptor is brand new. This film is Dystopian.<br/><br/>2. The Road Warrior: The Interceptor is dirty, dented and it's modified. There's been a nuclear holocaust. Civilisation is gone. The Interceptor is trashed and blown up.<br/><br/>3. Beyond Thunderdome: Max no longer has the Interceptor. He's grown a wicked mullet, has new transport and a small arsenal of weaponry. Primitive forms of trade and civilisation are emerging. We see the nuked ruins of Sydney. Water sellers are selling water contaminated with radiation.<br/><br/>That's clear indication of these films all being in strict chronological order, there's no other way they could fit together. Beyond Thunderdome can't be set before Road Warrior or Mad Max, Mad Max can't take place after Road Warrior or Beyond Thunderdome, Road Warrior can't be set before Mad Max. That's a fact, the logic is indisputable.<br/><br/>George Miller may be able to write and direct cool action sequences (though unlike the first two films, these are heavily powered by Hollywood Action Movie PhysicsTM) but he sucks at writing character and dialogue as Fury Road proved without a doubt. If you are a Mad Max fan and have not yet seen Fury Road, watch The Road Warrior instead, it's fifty times better than this mega-budget, over the top, badly written crud."

","Mad Max is back in this thrilling and action packed adventure through a desert wasteland. The actor who played Max did a good job. He's not great like Mel Gibson was, but he is good. Charlize Theron is the best, her character is a real badass. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. The villain is solid, I liked him and understood him. The film is shot beautifully. The look of the desert along with the characters cars and trucks getting torn to pieces in the action sequences, it was an incredible sight. It is a movie where I really cared about the characters. The director George Miller did a fantastic job. I remember watching this movie in the cinema. It was one hell of a ride. I hope there is a sequel to this movie. I want to see more films like this."

","I have seen all Mad Max movies which focus on little story and full action. Those Mad max movies (actually 3 parts) released on 1980's where Mel Gibson takes the lead. All those movies have intense action at that time but when we see them now we are not satisfied due to the current special effects used in movies and we grow by seeing them. But this Mad Max:Fury Road is the complete action package for all action lovers. It reminds me the Mad Max 2nd part actually where the chasing scenes and trucks/vehicles used in the film are nearly same. this movie has a story just for a name sake and it is completely filled with mind blowing action sequence from start to finish.

Anyway, to the good part, the movie is visually astounding and it is amazingly well done. The few effects, the cars, the gritty dark feeling.

","Well I'm an Aussie and I find most Aussie films childish,empty and devoid of any intelligence. This one was no different. I expected MUCH more as I thoroughly enjoyed and loved the original Max films, which is saying something for me! I like to be entertained or,at least,shocked, when I go to the movies and this did neither. I totally agree with the other negative reviewers and thank God someone ELSE didn't like it. Yes, it was visually stunning but that's the beginning and end. I don't understand all the hype and incredible praise for this movie. What is it about people that they are quite content to sit and watch 2 hours of mayhem,noise and confusion with no story,no script and no intelligence. Was there a plot? I think so. WHO is Mad Max and WHY is he mad? HOW do we know if we haven't seen the originals? There's a whole generation who haven't even HEARD of Mad Max (Mel Gibson? who's that?) <br/><br/>At least it was a bit better than Wolf Creek, the WORST movie of all time."
"danchees","5","18","53","15 May 2015"," Mad Maxina
","This will be hard to properly score. Is it a good movie? Definitely. Is it a good Mad Max movie? Well, that is a tougher call.<br/><br/>I feel that Tom Hardy was horribly miscast. I trust that George Miller, having directed all four movies, knows what he is doing. But even if we accept that this was an intended shift in Max's personality, I do not feel it's for the better. 30 years is a long time since we last saw Max on screen, but I am not convinced that his modernization"" went the right way. We went from witty and visceral portrayal by Mel Gibson to pretty clueless and almost contemplative version, as acted by Tom Hardy. On top of this, his madness"" is unconvincing, told through flashes/flashbacks without context and in borderline cheesy manner. With over 400 hours of footage, if these were the best expressions or reactions that editors could find, then I guess the actor simply does not fit. I could see someone like Travis Fimmel as much better Max – where madness would be apparent instead of implied or spelled out. This all just gives way to everything that is great about the movie. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron is stunning. Maybe for more experience, maybe for greater charisma, but this is much more her character's (Furiosa) movie then Mad Max – hence my title above. She exists in stark contrast to Tom Hardy, conveying believable emotion, and more importantly motivation. On-screen, she handles all emotional consequences and is the projection of all resolutions. Is Charlize the new ideal for cold blooded action heroine? Possibly. I would very much like to see more such roles for her, especially since she now proved that what she did in Prometheus was just bad directing/script, not her lack of talent. Great job, the best I saw from her since Devil's advocate. I disagree that other characters are undeveloped. What characters? This is Mad Max universe – a playground for key protagonists with everyone else relegated to little more than props.<br/><br/>Some people are already displeased by script, but let's take a step back and see it in context of entire series. Now, this IS a Mad Max script – a story about ride from point A to point B and back to point A. Nothing more, nothing less then what first three movies were all about. I was happy to see that it avoided some obvious clichés – nobody is truly selfless and nobody goes out of his way to sacrifice his life. And the best thing, there are zero deus-ex-machina moments, a true surprise nowadays. My only issue is that Nux was an obvious red shirt and I'd love if he survived. Cannot have it all.<br/><br/>Setting is executed to near perfection. Wasteland universe is not heavily used in commercial fiction. We have just a few computer games and even fewer movies (Book of Eli ugh). But Miller's rendition of post apocalyptic tribal culture is solid with great integration of contemporary symbolism into fictional future expression (we'll be McDining in Valhalla""). And movie is visually stunning. I watched Jupiter ascending"" the night before, which tries to be rich in style, and while this is not similar in execution, it tries to achieve the same effect. And it blows anything seen this year out of the water. Mad Max raises the bar far above where it lingered for quite some time and it will be interesting to see if anything comes even close soon. No sense to talk more about the visuals – go see it, if only to see it in action.<br/><br/>For me, it is 5/10. It deserves more. I would love to give it more. It is an outstanding achievement. But sadly, my disappointment with (intended) main protagonist makes me down-score the movie possibly more than it deserves."

","Tremendous. It's a nonstop thrill-ride with interesting, though quickly drawn, characters and some of the most economical storytelling I've ever seen. It makes all other Hollywood action movies look like they're in kindergarten. Every minute brings a new indelible image. It has a strong female presence, with Charlize Theron as almost a co-lead to Tom Hardy's Max. Both Theron and Hardy are wonderful, with Hardy giving Max a very different flavor from Mel Gibson. I loved Nicholas Hoult, as well, and Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the Toecutter in the original Mad Max, has a powerful presence as the major villain. A masterpiece of its genre. I loved it so much I saw it twice this week in the theater."

It would have been very refreshing if the director's vision included the striking presence of Lupita Nyongo and Michelle Rodriquez. In fact, either of them would have made for a much more interesting actress to work opposite Hardy. However, US film makers prefer to maintain a lilly white version of the present and future humanity even though whites will soon be a minority in this country.

"tieman64","Null","8","20","28 May 2015"," 70 year old doctor teaches world how to make action movie. Jaws drop.
","George Miller gave up a medical career to direct ""Mad Max"" in 1979. His directorial debut, the film starred Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, an Australian police officer haunted by the death of his family. An excuse for car crashes and chase sequences, the film was heavily influenced by the countless American road movies of the era (""Duel"", ""Two-Lane Blacktop"", ""The Driver"", ""Vanishing Point"" etc). Thanks to clever editing, kinetic camera work and a cut re-dubbed by American voice actors, it would become one of the most profitable movies of all time.<br/><br/>""Mad Max"" is said to take place in a ""post-apocalyptic world"", but a better term might be ""pre-apocalyptic"". Miller's heroes have normal jobs, normal family lives, civilisation has yet to fully collapse and oil shortages are only now beginning to warp society. Dystopia's on the horizon, but not yet here.<br/><br/>By the time we arrive at ""The Road Warrior"", Miller's 1981 sequel, our world has fully descended into anarchy. Feral gangs abound, nuclear war has killed millions and survivors have sequestered themselves in make-shift fortresses. Meanwhile, the madness that caused this calamity – a global economic network reliant upon incessant oil – has led to an almost religious obsession with petroleum. In ""Road Warrior"", oil is life. Oil is survival. And everyone's desperate to get their share.<br/><br/>""Warrior"", like George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", which similarly expanded upon a low-budget debut, made an overnight superstar of Miller. Essentially a giant chase movie, the film delivered audacious stunts and jaw-dropping choreography. But more interesting was the comic-book world Miller created, with its grime smeared denizens, warrior kings, bizarre names (Lord Humungus!) and imaginative decor. We'd seen post-apocalyptic worlds before, but nothing quite like this. ""Road Warrior"" was edgy, but also camp, homo-erotic, and aware of its silliness. The film mocked the very machismo which fuelled its apocalypse, even as it bathed in testosterone.<br/><br/>Next came ""Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985), the franchise's third instalment. It found mankind having fallen further, society drenched in nuclear radiation and sprouting tumours. The character of Max had himself devolved into an archetypal loner, rarely speaking, always brooding. As it was only co-directed by Miller, ""Thunderdome"" suffers in comparison to its siblings. It's the most watered-down, most conventionally shot picture in the franchise. And whilst the first two instalments embraced their exploitation/B-movie roots, ""Thunderdome"" reeked of Hollywood.<br/><br/>""Thunderdome"" was a lousy way to end a franchise. Released in 2015, ""Fury Road"" resurrects and reinvigorates Miller's franchise like Lazarus on steroids. Directed by Miller himself, now a 70 year old grandpa, the film opens with Max (Tom Hardy) being captured by the War Boys, the henchmen of a warlord known as Immortan Joe. Max is then dragged to The Citadel, a giant fortress in which Joe lords over thousands of inhabitants. Early sequences, brisk but brilliant, sketch the workings of this society, with its class hierarchies, its exploitation of men and women, its milk pumps, its food/water shortages, its battles with cancer and blood poisoning, its militancy, its psychotic obsession with oil, honour and warfare and its quasi-religious devotion to all things Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>While Max attempts to escape Joe's prisons, another character plots a similar escape. She's Imperator Furiosa (the immaculately chiselled Charlize Theron), a one-armed woman who attempts to flee The Citadel in the War Rig, an 18-wheeled oil tanker. With Furiosa are sex slaves who are tired of being treated as baby factories. Joe wants his slaves back and so gives chase. What follows is essentially another giant chase movie.<br/><br/>In terms of conceptual design, nothing in ""Fury Road"" has quite been done before. The film's vehicles bristle with gun turrets, armoured plating and hidden compartments. Some resemble hedgehogs, others are outfitted with bungee chords, poles, ramps, harpoons, spikes, and manic, morale-boosting drummers, sub-woofers and guitarists. Most of these vehicles are crewed by the War Boys, brainwashed footsoldiers who foam at the mouth and spew ecstatic war cries. When the Boys aren't using exploding spears to slay cars like wild buffalo, they're worshipping chrome and dreaming of Valhalla.<br/><br/>""Fury's"" first act ends with Furiosa and Max joining forces to evade Joe. Riding The War Rig hard, they head deeper into Australia's churning deserts. Joe gives chase with a mighty convoy of vehicles. Throughout these sequences, Max largely plays second fiddle to Furiosa, a woman hell-bent on survival. Max is just along for her ride. For now.<br/><br/>""Fury's"" final third begins with Max convincing Furiosa that Home exists not out in the desert, but back at The Citadel. One's responsibility, Max implies, is not to run and restart, but to reclaim and repair. Unlike recent eco-thrillers (""Interstellar"", ""Colony"", ""Pandorum"", ""Snowpiercer"" etc), ""Road Fury"" thus espouses revolution, not relocation. And so with plant seeds and suggestively named feminists (The Vuvalinis) in tow, Max and Furiosa head back to The Citadel. Much patriarchy-crushing carnage ensues. Fittingly, it's only now that Max begins to blossom into the protective hero we're familiar with.<br/><br/>An instant genre masterpiece, ""Fury's"" awash with deep reds and cool blues. Sophisticated trash, the film's aesthetic collides 1980s kitsch with 1970s comic-books and grindhouse. Its script - minimalist, yet rich in detail – only occasionally missteps. Miller's third act is far too frenetic, for example, his ""revolution"" wholly clichéd (see instead ""Land of the Dead"") and he unwisely rushes through his film's beautiful moments of downtime, like sequences in which Furiosa does running repairs on the War Rig, or gazes wistfully up at night skies. Intelligently shot, composed and choreographed, ""Fury Road's"" almost too classy for action movie fans, who are likely to miss the film's finer points, or dismiss Miller's formal control and madcap idiosyncrasies. Though a better actor, a miscast Tom Hardy lacks Mel Gibson's mad aura. Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult are excellent, at times even soulful.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – See ""Lorenzo's Oil"" and ""Judge Roy Bean"" (1972)."
"luceruc","5","8","20","18 May 2015"," Parody of Errors
","Tom Hardy as Mad Max, in for a treat I thought. Charlize Theron, well if anyone can match Tom Hardy playing Mad Max - I thought - then Charlize can. As for the storyline, with such a legacy, and a bit of dosh, how can you go wrong (I thought). <br/><br/>Opening scene, Tom Max munches up a two-headed lizard, alive. Hehe, funnnneeeyyy, good start I thought. After that, the whole thing goes tits up. You hardly notice it at first, because you're just sitting there, sucking on your smuggled popcorn, waiting to see some serious action wrapped up in great acting wrapped up in a riveting narrative. And there certainly is plenty of action in Mad Max: Fury Zzzz, but it's of the wrong, grossly overdone, silly kind. The acting is stilted, like everyone's been dubbed over, in body as well as voice. The storyline's cheap and nasty, with a dialogue to match. <br/><br/>Good points? Music score, definitely. Can't think of anything else.Have considered giving it 1 star, as a punishment for wasting such huge resources - and 2 hours of my vida - on this surreal parody of errors wannabe, but settled on 5 because of the soft spot I have for Hardy, on account of just having watched-loved him in Child 44, and because Theron's buffness has fresh inspired me to drop yoga and take on some army training.<br/><br/>In other words: move along, folks, nothing to see here."
"Ziya90","10","7","17","14 June 2015"," It is not as remarkable as the original trilogy, but amazingly perfect as a separate Mad Max movie
","Yes, this new Mad Max is a non stop chase movie without a real story which some people complained about, but this doesn't mean that the movie is disappointing. The other way round, I really felt a film after years! What the action movies are lack of these days is heart and soul and this movie got it right! Most of the new generation blockbusters have lots of action, digital effects, high technology, maybe magnificence but without emotion and spark. Hollow movies... This Mad Max movie is not a bluster movie. Somehow, there is a drama in the background. There are chases, but not for the sake of it. We care about the characters. As for Mad Max criticism as he was not the hero or star of the movie, it didn't frustrate me. While I was watching The Dark Knight Rises, I was always asking ""where is the Batman? where is the Batman? because Batman was like a cameo in the movie. Mad Max is different. Max is there, waiting for you! I mean it works here somehow. Everything works well in the movie. The story is (if there is one) is plain and simple, but somehow it works perfectly. Story development is not powerful, but the movie doesn't need that. Maybe, only flaw of the movie is the underestimated villains. The master director George Miller doesn't do justice to the great villains of the film. A great villain is another thing that new generation action movies are lack of. We rarely see the main bad guy and his henchmen, especially his muscled son are not effectively used in the film. The villains are intimidating and haunting but mostly, they were more like pawns in the desert. However, this is not a big problem. Everything is done as it should be. As for Tom Hardy, as a fan of him, it was a pleasure to watch him again, but I couldn't see him as Max, he was more like the son of the mad max than our old, original character. However, I liked him as a character. Mel Gibson could have joined the cast as a cameo, but it seems that he didn't want to do it. What about Furiosa hype that has shaken the world? Well, Charlize Theron was remarkable, but don't expect the most legendary character of all time in movie history or something! Not unforgettable, but a very gritty character portrait. The girls were charming and their story was sad, but maybe their surreal existence was out of place in the movie. The opening scene of the movie was disappointing for me, but then the movie turned into a breathtaking, non stop journey, an amazing freak show with fuel, machines, fire and blood! The action scenes were an example of incredible technical craftsmanship. I just want to congratulate all the cast and crew for this hard work. In comparison with the original, old trilogy, a powerful story with a development is missing here, but as a separate film, my favorite film of the year so far. There is tears, there is fun, there is fuel and there is blood!"
"fickmann","7","7","17","6 June 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road Warrior
","I saw this movie twice for the first time it was awesome. As an action movie it works great. I don't know if anything I have seen in this movie makes any sense but the setting is crazy enough that you don't need to bother asking why they are doing what they are doing.<br/><br/>How ever as a Mad Max movie, and thats where the !!SPOILERS!! start, I'm not quiet sure what to think about it. First of all its basically the 2nd Mad Max minus much of its story. The Interceptor gets wasted, some people with an alternative lifestyle try to flee from some kind of Humungus kind of guy on a huge truck, lots of things get blown up and max decides to go its own way. <br/><br/>I liked the idea that the people in the Citadel are separated into castes like the Warboys or the Mothers but I it could have gone deeper and shown some more.I also wonder how the Bulletfarmers and the Gastown Boys are related to all that, they just unite their force at some point and chase the tanker so there really should have been a tad more background story to fully understand that. <br/><br/>I'd say a 7 is appropriate because the chase in this setting is just fun and the 2 hours feel really really short but as a Mad Max movie I'd say its somewhere behind Beyond Thunderdome in terms of atmosphere it also does not feel as dark and hopeless. They don't seem to suffer from any kind of shortage like in Road Warrior where the lack of fuel is all present. The differences in the story is that in one movie they flee from forces from the outside and in the other one they escape and try not to brought back. Both movies got a super sized villain but the originals Humungus was more suitable plus his sidekick Wez was more badass an Inmortan's whole crew combined. <br/><br/>tl:dr Great nonstop action that should be watched without thinking to much about the other Mad Max movies. If they added that his family had been killed (they didn't right?) it would perfectly work for its own."

","The action is spectacular! The cinematography is gorgeous!<br/><br/>But, the characters are too flat. That mainly is the fault of the writing. Plus, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are pretty subdued throughout. I know that Mel Gibson has had his problems. But, his electric presence would have been better than what Hardy does. It's one of those things where, it doesn't matter if Max is supposed to be two decades younger than Gibson is now, they should have still had Gibson in the lead.<br/><br/>It becomes tough to care about most of the characters, for the most part, except for Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of the villain's drivers. He, at least, has a story to tell, and it is more interesting than everyone else's.<br/><br/>The villain is Immortan Joe, played by no one other than Hugh Keays-Byrne. Don't recognize him with the whole mask and getup here? He was the lead villain in the original ""Mad Max."" Yes, The Toecutter himself! It's super cool that he's back as another villain here, but he's unrecognizable, which cuts down the impact.<br/><br/>The film score is by Tom Holkenborg, a.k.a. Junkie XL. He does have some good moments here, especially some ethereal synth-driven moments, along with percussion-driven ones. But, the rest of it is fairly straight-forward action-movie stuff. Of course, probably nothing could come close to Brian May's first two ""Mad Max"" scores!<br/><br/>There are many fun touches here and there, mainly the guitar player guy, whose sole assignment is to play power chords while chained to the front of a massive vehicle that is basically a mammoth speaker stack!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, except for the main compound where the vast society lives, lorded over by Immortan Joe, there is little world building, even with a budget over 10 times what ""Thunderdome"" cost, and over 30 times what the far-superior ""Road Warrior"" cost.<br/><br/>Even though George Miller proves he is a much better director than whipper-snappers a third his age, the story is a bit too thin, and the characters don't have the emotional punch they could have had.<br/><br/>******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)"
"RNDorrell","9","7","17","19 May 2015"," An action explosion with an actual brain, and no regard for gonads
","This re-imagined Mad Max film is deserving of every positive review it has received. It's one of those most rare things: a major Hollywood action film with a meaningful plot, an emotional soul and very important points to make about politics, despotism, gender roles and ecology. Yes, it's extremely violent (it's a Mad Max film), but the story assumes that modern society has fallen, and brute force rules in the resulting scramble for resources. You don't tell that story by filming folks engaged in diplomacy.<br/><br/>Director George Miller pulls very few punches here. Humans are set against each other as enemies in furious vehicular battles, and are shown using each other as fodder, as shields, as meat targeted in their cross hairs. It's not for the squeamish. Sam Peckinpah might have flinched a couple of times.<br/><br/>The film carries some cautionary aspects: there's only one person of color in any primary role, and women are shown endangered and exploited. Yet the core of the film is Imperator Furiosa, a female warrior played with grim ferocity by Charlize Theron. She seeks redemption for the bad things she has done, and is willing to chance all in a risky, hurtling plunge to escape her living hell. She and Max, as played with brooding taciturn energy by Tom Hardy, form the tautest of action duos, a partnership driven at first by accident, then murderous animosity, then edgy distrust, and later by mutual respect. Max is only reluctantly saddled with the role of knight errant. He's a battered, cynical, doubtful vagabond pressed into helping Furiosa through a gradual escalation of increasingly bad craziness.<br/><br/>The plot follows Furiosa's rebellion against one of the more fundamentally brutal despots committed to film, a warlord named Immortan Joe, who holds absolute sway over a teeming cluster of humans because he controls the only dependable fresh water supply for thousands of square miles, doling it out from a cliff top keep called the Citadel. His body is racked by radiation deformities, he breathes through a mask styled as a death grin, and his progeny suffer from chronic birth defects. He essentially holds enslaved a captive harem of women whom he calls wives, but the women have no choice in the matter. Furiosa, a trusted mercenary fighter for Joe, launches her long-plotted revolt by smuggling five young concubines out of the Citadel in a tanker truck war rig, a vehicle with such a rugged, beastly aspect that it becomes a character in its own right, the air intakes on its supercharger breathing in the desert air lustily as the behemoth thunders forward like a mechanical dinosaur.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe is extremely angered by all of this. He brooks no interference with his expansive lordship and absolute power. ""Do not become addicted to water,"" he admonishes his vassals, ""It will take hold of you and you will resent its absence."" (Joe is played with psychotic relish by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played the bad guy, Toecutter, in the very first Mad Max film.) Joe froths and seethes with malignant furor. Discovering Furiosa's betrayal, he unleashes his dogs of desert hard-scape war, a cadre of true believing fanatic War Boys, who ride a gloriously outlandish collection of vehicles styled after glossy but mutilated classic cars. The mayhem begins.<br/><br/>Two other similarly antisocial warlords join Joe's trek for revenge upon Furiosa. The People Eater is the ruler of Gastown, a refining enclave to the south. He has a deformed foot and a disdain for Joe's family problems. And then there's a reckless firebrand known as the Bullet Farmer, a man who still has the ability to manufacture ammunition, who lacks patience for Joe's tactics, which he considers far too gentle. So, water, gasoline and bullets form the power triumvirate in this twisted pseudo-society.<br/><br/>Tensely allied now with Max, Furiosa's party runs, fights, hides. A stray skinny War Boy, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), realizes the error of his thinking and joins the group, but before that change he is an imprint of the personality cult Immortan Joe has created. As his lone vehicle continues to trail the fleeing war tanker into a dangerously violent electrical storm, he exclaims, in rapture, ""Oh, what a day, what a Lovely Day!""<br/><br/>During the last third of the film, the tanker meets a band of deep desert survivors, women called the Vuvalini, and we learn of Furiosa's tragic background. It's at this point her despair finally inspires Max into a pragmatic suggestion. The tactic Max suggests is a calculation which equally weighs their options, the risks, and the ethical demands of the situation.<br/><br/>Now, I must say I find utterly ridiculous the criticisms leveled at the film by various ""men's rights"" groups, who decry it as a deliberate attempt by Hollywood to ""trick"" men into going to see a seemingly masculine action flick, only to discover to their distaste that it's really an extended piece of ""feminist propaganda."" One oft-quoted post bitterly complains: ""NOBODY barks orders at Mad Max."" That's a mindset not only ludicrous, but seriously lacking in testicular fortitude, a hugely ironic fault in such a misogynistic argument.<br/><br/>With this reboot, George Miller has hit a grand slam home run clear out of the park of typically low Hollywood action expectations. This one sets a new bar, just as ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for war films in 1998. ""Fury Road"" isn't just a great action film, it's a great piece of social commentary, full of sound, fury, swirling red dust, crashing vehicles, explosions and enough little bits of petty madness to fill several typical action mill flicks. ""Fury Road"" delivers the bang, and does so without being brain-dead. On the contrary, the heart and thought embedded here are strong enough to inspire some heated debate, and a long list of critical plaudits. When's the last time you recall an action movie doing that?"
"jonruff108","9","7","17","17 May 2015"," Oh my *beep* god. George Miller, what have you done??
","Let me but this as bluntly as I can: This is the best action film ever made in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Forget that the action is all done with mind-blowing practical effects (my friend couldn't believe me when I told him that after the film was over) but the actual storytelling was excellent! The story was pretty thin but it's the way that it was told that made it so amazing. Even the characters themselves have a lot of subtle and great development that bring a human touch to a world so full of insanity.<br/><br/>But the action scenes. One review put it perfectly: ""The first car chase in MM: FR is the best in movie history but the worst one of the film."" That pretty much sums up the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the opening shot to the film is the best opening shot to a movie this year, without question. It isn't grandiose like the Avenger's opening tracking shot but it's so gorgeous too look at I wanted to pause it in the theater just to admire it.<br/><br/>9.0/10 Action movies are slowly making a come back...first John Wick, then Kingsman, and now this.

But, it wasn't dumb action there was a strong plot backed up by strong and compelling characters. Aside from this movie being pure action it is packed with strong performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Tom hardy kills it in this role and he only says like 5 lines.

"philipposx-12290","9","4","8","23 July 2018"," One of the most beautiful movies ever made.
","Yes, beautiful.<br/><br/>Maybe that's not the word someone would use to describe George Millers modern masterpiece, but I will.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road shows us that all the choreographed and handcrafted action can take place in a moving rhythm. Anyone who accuses this film of being just a battle of material or a glorification of gigantomania has not understood something. In refusing a superficial story, Mad Max stands out from the other blockbusters. <br/><br/>Fury Road is loud, very loud, but the movie doesn't numb you. The whole is an overall composition of sound, image and cut of crystalline beauty. Yes, beauty. <br/><br/>This film is a poetic experience that is both direct and completely abstract. We are directly affected by the pictures and basses, but at the same time everything remains abstract, since we cannot identify directly with any person.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road provides us with answers to questions we have never asked. Formally speaking, we are actually similar to the characters in the film. How they wander around without any direction, but with a smile on their face? They move from point A to point B and when they are at point B, they go back to point A. This directionlessness also drives us humans through the area, but also keeps us in motion.<br/><br/>The Greek philosopher Heraclitus was the thinker of opposites. Land and sea, day and night and so on. All opposites form a unity. The most important message is that the way back and forth is one and the same way. Doesn't this make the entire chase obsolete?<br/><br/>George Miller uses this unity of opposites. In sound design we have both fortissimo and pianissimo interludes and nothing in between. Many post-apocalyptic films show an order into which chaos slowly enters. Fury Road now shows how an order is forming in chaos. But does it make any difference?"
"allstarrunner","10","4","8","6 July 2018"," A great film
","One of the things that stands out about this film is how Miller manager to develop the character of Max without even using words or dialog - a truly great example in storytelling of "" show, don't tell"". The pacing of the movie is great - it is slower paced, but yet you're never bored and it never *feels* slow. Miller does a superb job of bringing to life the world he has created.<br/><br/>Another great thing I love about this film is that Miller doesn't go crazy with CGI - in a day and age when it seems nearly every movie uses way too much of it - this movie feels very organic and it looks amazing because of it. This movie will hold up for a very long time. I can't wait for a sequel to come out! (hopefully one does!)"
"theresamgill","9","4","8","12 June 2018"," Pure Adrenaline-Filled Awesome
","Perhaps the blood rushing constantly doesn't allow you to fully process what you actually just saw, but after checking out the bonus features, you have to realize that besides digitally removing certain things and enhancing colors, every stunt you see was actually performed-- and usually at top speed. I'm talking about blowing up huge trucks, flipping cars, motorists jumping over vehicles, and so much more. Easily my favorite are the pole-rider guys; you may remember them from the trailer on these huge poles to swing from one vehicle to another. Yeah, guys trained for weeks to be able to do that. And I might as well say, kids, no matter how cool it looks, I only give you permission to attempt these stunts as long as you capture it on video so that I can laugh at you later.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now I can go on and on about these epic stunts and explosions and kills and action and fighting, but even that doesn't give the movie full justice, for it is one of the most fully-realized movies ever. George Miller had this brilliant vision, and the product is a story told with hardly any lines spoken by the main character-- or other characters for that matter. The women are given strong roles to emphasize their importance, not feed on weakness, and the message Miller gave his unit was loud and clear and wonderful: Even though this is a post-apocalyptic world, that doesn't mean it has to be bleak and lifeless and bland. This movie is vibrant and beautiful. To put focus on how humans would actually scramble to find remnants of beauty in a forsaken world is a great twist that enhances the story and the experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now let's talk about the Oscars. And there's a lot to talk about. This film won 6, all these very technical awards including his wife winning for editing, and nominated for 4 others. Not only did Fury Road win these Oscars, but it had to beat The Revenant to do so. Granted, that masterpiece beat it in directing and cinematography, but that's rightfully so. I think a lot of people were questioning why an action flick was winning all these awards from an academy that is known for excluding action, superhero, and blockbuster flicks. I am so glad it was recognized that this high-octane movie had such a vision that came together like nothing else. It's so hard to compare it to the other Oscar nominated films, but it is also really hard to compare it to action films in general. Generally, you have the opening action sequence, background of characters, perhaps a twist halfway through, then a balance of action scenes and talking scenes with a huge climax. And that is not Fury Road. My favorite vehicle from the armada is the huge cargo truck hybrid with drummers beating on the back and a guitarist suspended with strings jamming out and unleashing flames (it's an actual flamethrower guitar). That to me embodies the movie. A weird, weird world full of rocking characters on a chase set to a score with an equal amount of pounding drums and quick guitar jams. It's so cool, but still so intricate with the suicidal half-lives who follow Immortan Joe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This film changes the game. The progressively more intense sequences keep piling up for some of the most fun you'll ever have at a movie. Will other movies follow suit? And more importantly, how does George Miller create a respectable sequel after this?<br/><br/>You can check this review and dozens of others out at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com"

","As many movies, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" threw one straight into action. In the beginning, the opening scene often can seems to be out of place and throughout the movie you start to realize its meaning. However unlike other movies, Mad Max never came to that realization. For 1 hour and 55 minutes I lived in the false expectation that the movie would turn and the guys would stop driving their cars in a Coachella-like environment. When only five minutes of the movie was left I understood the mistake I had make by not pausing the movie when I first sensed something was odd. Do not loose time and temper by making the same mistake as I did."
"CinemaCocoa","10","4","8","13 April 2017"," A one hundred and twenty minute adrenaline shot
","A one hundred and twenty minute adrenaline shot; absolute carnage in the desert and all shot with awesome grungy, violent and most importantly, physical, action.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe, a tyrant of a blasted and wasted desert after Earth suffers a nuclear apocalypse, controls all supply of water for his downtrodden citizens. He also holds sway over his Five Wives, imprisoned in his citadel. But when one of his subordinates attempts to rescue these women, he is led on a gasoline fueled chase across the open desert, while amongst all of this, a traumatised loner named Max gets pulled into the fray.<br/><br/>Back in 1983, Australian director George Miller redefined the action genre with his sequel ""The Road Warrior"" to the 1979 Mad Max, a film with so much vehicular chaos and destruction it was praised for its physical stunt work and world building. Now in 2015 we get Miller returning for a reboot/re-envisioning of the same story. But fear not, this is Miller's baby, and it is in good hands. Fury Road is exactly the film it should be. Like 2012's Dredd, it is a one trick pony but the ace up its sleeve is undeniably astounding. Capturing the pre-computer generated age of the 80s and 90s, the film is a visceral and eye-popping spectacle of carnage of the highest caliber, made even more so by the current over-saturation of action films.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes on the titular role as Max, a man haunted by the death of his family (shown exclusively through jarring, nightmarish flashbacks) beside him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, the warrior woman with a bionic arm who defies a tyrant to free his slave wives. Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the part of the villain Toecutter in Miller's 1979 Mad Max. All of the acting, asides perhaps the anger-fueled Immortan, is downplayed but not forgotten here. The film shows rather than tells with Hardy barely speaking at all outside of an opening narration, Theron's Furiosa very well steals the show as the character with the most to lose. A worthy note should be given to Nicolas Hoult (X-Men Days of Future Past) who disappears into the role of one of Immortan Joe's pasty pale War Boys. People argue that there's a lack of ""characterisation"" here, when in fact there is plenty to progress the story and make you understand their motives. What this film lacks is unnecessary quips, one-liners and exposition dumps, all which can bog a film down.<br/><br/>But the action takes centre stage here, and the budget delivered towards the vehicle, costume and character design and construction. Near everything is practical effects, you cannot watch it and not appreciate how everything looks, my eyes were on stalks just taking everything in.<br/><br/>I actually can't think of anything ""wrong"" with it. It is a grisly film, a visceral film with such an astounding visual style that has been long forgotten about.<br/><br/>There's a truck in this film covered in massive drums, amps, and on top a blindfolded dude suspended in bungee chords with a double- necked guitar that shoots flames! How how can you NOT like that??"
"sesarp101","2","4","8","8 March 2017"," Everything bad about modern movies rolled into one film!
","Firstly, like most big budget films nowadays, this film is going back to an old franchise to guarantee interest. Secondly, hey, lets make a woman the dominant, powerful character, that's a very ""original"" spin nowadays. And lets just pack the film with so much action, noise and explosions that no one will get bored. That should guarantee a great film, eh? <br/><br/>Wrong. People are sick of remakes and films retreading old ground. Men (who tend to be more into action films than women) are getting pretty sick of being force-fed feminist agendas all the time. Make films where women are somehow physically more powerful than men if you want, by why do it with a film called Mad Max? And as for the story, well, like most action films nowadays, it leaves me cold. Back in the 80s/90s, good actions films were stories with action thrown in. They were involving, adrenaline pumping, exciting and they had likable, memorable or charismatic characters that you cared about. This film fails on all counts."

Head slapping special affects. Silly action sequences. An idiotic plot every young male fantasizes to live vicariously through. Carefully crafted 2D caricatures, not characters. Intentionally laughable villains. But, because the movie understood what it was and did not try to be anything else, it was humorous and an enjoyable 96 minutes.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Road Fury, is essentially a Frogtown remake, but with all the common sense decisions of Frogtown left out. The movie is one giant action scene, loaded with expensive and pointless special effects whose sole purpose is to distract the audience from the complete lack of plot. Hollow characters without any personality and almost no dialog. Unlike Frogtown, the villains here are unintentionally laughable. But most tragic, in the failed and misplaced attempt to force a genre-incongruous theme (feminism), all the humor of Frogtown is lost, and with it all the adolescent charm of its predecessor."

","I watched Mad Max having not seen the older films since I was young and without reading any reviews or any preconceptions about what it would be like.<br/><br/>Most people will know it's an action film, but it really is just that. I found it difficult to get absorbed into the movie because it was very CGI driven and, whilst technology has moved on, it was still too obvious that many scenes were graphical. The (very few) lines of speech in the story were all very cheesy and poorly acted. Max had only a handful of lines but they were not done well - I would argue he wasn't even the main character! There was no attachment to any of the characters and no concern about their fate - even when there should have been!<br/><br/>The story could have been written on an A4 sheet of paper and the rest of the film was all about action shots... in vehicles... in the desert. Followed closely by more of the same. Just when you think you might see something interesting, it just sends you right back from where you came. More vehicles, more desert, more fighting.<br/><br/>This is a pure, mindless action film, but it's mostly the same kind of action all the way through. There is barely any story or character development. It is a blockbuster in terms of the scale of action, but that isn't enough to give it more than a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>How this has 8.3 on IMDb at the moment is crazy. Mindless action lovers giving it 10/10 and those who loved the original enjoying more of the same. When it comes down to it... most high budget films are worth the watch for the spectacle and I do enjoy most of them even if they're not technically great films.

Parts of it I found really exhilarating, primal. Caught myself clinching a fist during an action sequence more than once.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>Overall, the character of Max Rockatansky, felt extremely shallow to me. I tried to take ""this"" Max at face value...in no way relating him to Mel Gibson's Max. Just couldn't do it. There simply isn't enough there. We know as much about Max Rockatansky (the guy the film is named for) as we do Coma the Doof Warrior--shredding out on his flame throwing guitar. Had Coma been given real, hardcore solos in his scenes (something really musical as opposed to just straight shredding)and some crazy/wild back story I think he would have actually stolen the entire damn movie out from under Theron and Hardy. <br/><br/>Mad Max had actual cities and towns. The Road Warrior had the Refinery and the bandit camp. Thunderdome had Barter Town and the Kid Oasis. Foundations to help hold the ""moving"" story up. Fury Road has what..? A whoping 4-5 minutes of Citadel. We hear mention of Gas Town and The Bullet Farm but, we don't see them. We never get to understand why the bandits attacked Furiosa in the War Rig for being on their ""patch."" It just happens. Things in this movie continually just happen. If you're lucky you catch a tiny shred of back story to them. In the end, this is one long, giant car chase. ""Bout what it boils down to.<br/><br/>One thing this movie almost gets completely right: The war Boys. They hands down own this movie. Some flashback scenes showing insane indoctrination and drive training would have totally fleshed them out and made them the undeniable stars. Absolute insanity on wheels. Insanity on foot. Insanity in the way they speak. They are awesome as enemies. Maybe something to build on in the future..? ""War Boys : High Octane Insanity!""<br/><br/>The stunts, as usual: fantastic. Cinematography: wonderful. Music: A+. <br/><br/>But, even after watching this movie twice on the big screen, I still feel it only deserves third place in the long line of Mad Maxes: Mad Max; The Road Warrior; Fury Road; Thunderdome.

","Let me start by saying, I loved Mad Max as a kid. And Gibson was half the appeal of Mad Max. He truly melted into the character and made it his own. I'll start with the good. Truly epic effects; which is what I went in knowing I'd see. The explosions, the cars, the scenery. It oozed with Road Warrior goodness. Truly beautiful and breathtaking. Never an overkill; especially not for this movie. It felt like a roller-coaster ride from hell. I NEVER do IMAX, but wish I did for this film. Sadly, I will not re-watch it.<br/><br/>The somewhat bad; Tom Hardy is a very talented actor. In this movie, I just had a hard time seeing it. It being Max. Throughout the movie he is given a handful of dialogue, and most of it is very quietly spoken. Somewhat like the Max from Thunderdome. However, other than the intro, I found Hardy's Max boring and one dimensional. Even his accent was bland and completely unlike Mel Gibson's Max. There was his first line in the beginning of the film where it was super scruffy and hoarse voiced Australian Max. And the rest of it felt like Bane without lines. The location of this story is Australia. The people should probably be somewhat..... Australian sounding. I was quite upset about Hardy because I know what an amazing actor he is, especially when given a great piece of writing. This was not it though.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron.... As I said before, this movie was centered around Furiosa and the pregnant girls. She played her character well, and I think that's because Theron always does exactly what directors tell her. And I can respect that. I don't think Charlize Theron is majorly talented, but she does what she's asked of in respect to direction. Which is a commodity in Hollywood. And a blessing for directors. <br/><br/>Eve Ensler..... When I heard this, I dropped the movie by a star. Why was this movie partially written by the chick who developed The Vagina Monologues? This is Mad Max for effs sake. Are you kidding me? I feel her input took away from the realistic scenery of a post-apocalyptic world. 130 lb Charlize Theron in a fist fight with 240 lb Tom Hardy... riiiiight. Women all placed in sexually appealing clothing and somewhat exposed.... So the message is, all the men are disgusting, vile evil people. And ALL the women in the movie are sexy, beautiful model types that can do no wrong. Riiiiight. <br/><br/>I learned that apparently George Miller is a feminist. And I lost a lot of respect for him. Although I don't believe in feminism; his opinion would not keep me from respecting his craft or watching his films. I lost respect simply because I don't care for political messages forced into any movies that I'm unaware of prior to entering into. <br/><br/>And whether or not you want to believe this movie was politically charged, doesn't matter. This movie was NOT about Mad Max. I just pray that the next installment actually includes him in his own movie. <br/><br/>And what was with the guitar guy....?? I really could've done without that. I mean, I get it, these people are crazy, and sadistic... But the guitar dude strapped to amps seemed kind of..... lame. Maybe it was a cool scene in IMAX."
"lionschellererfilms","8","4","8","15 May 2015"," ≈ The Most Insane Movie Of All Time ≈
","In the best possible way.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I feared that all the hype might be too high. An all out action movie receiving a staggering 99% on RT is very rare. However, I can assure you, the hype is met. In fact, this film exceeded most of my expectations.<br/><br/>First off, I have to talk about the cinematography. Simply put, its staggeringly beautiful. The camera moves around these wild car chases in such a fluid way, its almost poetic. The colors of the barren desert are eye popping and every grain of sand on the ground is captured in such detail. <br/><br/>Now, the action. It is just insane (yes, I had to use that word again). And the best part about the action is the rawness and grit of it. My hat goes off to George Miller, who at his age, has achieved sometime outstanding. The direction of the action is what makes it amazing. Beautiful, wide, long takes mixed with quick pace editing. It is something to be witnessed on the big screen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also perfectly fitting. Harsh, unforgiving, intense. When a moment of tension arrives, it is enhanced by a subtle yet prominent soundtrack, which gives it that extra edge. In the climax moments of the film, the soundtrack begins to rise in tone and give the car chases and absolutely epic feel. Another great aspect of the film.<br/><br/>One of the only tiny, mini, little gripes I had with this film, is the acting. Yes, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are excellent as the two leaders of the film. However, the supporting cast, especially 'The Wives' had some moments of awkward and forced dialog; it didn't seem natural. Even Nicholas Hoult had some slight moments that took me out of the movie, and seemed like an actor playing a part. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I absolutely loved this film. This is the reason I love movies. It is the ultimate form of escapism. You go into the theater, sit down and just get lost and have a great time for 2 hours. It is the purest form of entertainment; exactly what this movie was supposed to do. <br/><br/>I believe this film is a milestone of action filming, and shall be remembered that way for a long time."

","This movie is getting so much hype and buzz that people would have you believe it's Oscar-worthy. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. I was bored after the first half hour. Zero character development, the barest minimum of backstory, a silly plot that is essentially one big U-turn, and no acting to speak of. All the bad guys are faceless and nameless, and the good guys aren't much better. It's like playing a shoot 'em up video game where you just go through scores and scores of identical bad guys, blow up lots of things, face off with the big boss, and rescue the princess(es) by the end. It takes summer blockbuster to a new low -- I mean, the special effect action movies tend to at least have some likable characters and a little bit of humour and maybe some decent one-liners, but this has none of the above. Unless you like watching two hours straight of things exploding, this isn't for you. Two stars for the beautiful Namibia scenery and one star for Charlize Theron, but that's it."

Should this film be lauded by the Academy with any awards other than the odd technical nod - then they could be doing themselves an injustice. It could be just another nail in the societies coffin, a pointing to it's being a consumers 'club' for self promotion. And then there's this talk of Direction, is this truly anymore than a big screen version of a CGI computer game?. A non-stop repetitive exercise in senseless blood letting, come chase-fest. <br/><br/>The most honest (and intelligent) credit among an endless list, is the one requested by the D.T.I. It tellingly reads: ""Produced with the assistance of the Department Of Trade And Industry South Africa. Who Does Not Accept Any Liability For The Content, and Does Not Necessarily Support Such Content""! (they at least had the good sense to see the inherent danger...)<br/><br/>Isis see the West (Africa and the full non Muslim World) as rubbish to be annihilated and this crude but expensive tosh sets out to prove it!. Problem is, it will 'entertain' them and convince them to continue their pursuit (don't kid yourself it won't). This probably brings us to another target audience: Bikie gangs and hoodlums of every persuasion. Movie makers seem to pander to every want of the world's thugs (yes, even the sophisticated variety) knowing they will invest in tickets (and more) for the cause. Enter yet another very likely target group, the Ice Crazies, addicted to non-stop grotesque computer games (try working in a physiologist's clinic or hospital these days!) <br/><br/>This ugly, moronic outing helps signify the end of intelligent 'entertainment' and hints 'Mr Miller' could be reaching that stage all once were good movie makers come to and sadly don't see the writing on the wall till it all falls over. George once helped audiences grow up, now it's all for the quick buck. Yes, you will make money from those that go because of the hype and noisy violence, but take a close look at the follow up ""word of mouth"". So many most revealing reviews posted from the folk that matter most, the audience. Seems a sad fall from the grace that was once yours....<br/><br/>PS: Loved the review from the viewer who wrote words to the effect: 'If this is where award winning movie making is going, then stop the world I want to get off!

There could have been at least one change of scenery. American movies are continuing the trend downwards, boring with lacklustre endings as usual. 'Im trying to think of something good to write' oh yeah the acting was OK, the vehicles were real gone, the makeup and masks etc were great and my wife is asleep and doesn't know the dishes aren't done yet. On another note its good to see a movie that doesn't have a sex scene in, so the kids can watch it.

"parky_16-1","6","6","14","23 May 2015"," Not a patch on the originals!!
","Having waited in anticipation for this modern remake for quite some time, ever since the rumours first originated, I have to say that I was a little disappointed. It was a pretty standard attempt to recreate a cult classic which I guess you could say is ""Typical of Hollywood"". Not to mention, the opening line of the movie; "" My name is Max, my world is fire and blood"" is just...well, cheesy.<br/><br/>The cinematography on the other hand was unique, with some exceptionally vibrant graphics, colours, scenery and action, yet this wasn't enough in my eyes to rescue the movie from the sheer lack of suspense, storyline and any opportunity to express any level of talent or emotion from the characters. The complete opposite of the likes of say Game of Thrones. It seems the focus these days is more about all out action, hype and special effects rather than substance.<br/><br/>Although this movie seems to be based on Mad Max 2, which is understandable considering the first Mad Max really just set the scene, there was no introduction to the history of Max, how the world was in the sorry state that it was in or any real agenda. The entire focus of the movie was built around one concept, which was a singular, action - chase scene from start to finish. This is such a discredit to the original trilogy and such a shame, considering the $150,000,000 budget spent. Everything was in place for this to be a master piece, right down to every outstanding little detail in costume and scenery.<br/><br/>If you genuinely want to know what Mad Max and the media spread hype is all about, watch the original Mad Max 2 and 3. If all you care about is all out action e.g. if you are 12-15 years old, watch the remake.<br/><br/>(Not to offend anyone, but the 12-15 year old comment was a joke. I grew up watching the Mad Max originals countless times when I was younger, which may explain my biased review. Never the less, I believe it would be an injustice for anyone to base their opinion without having watched the originals.)"

And this movie delivers: the plot line is super thin but gives you what you want: a 2 hour car chase through the desert with absolutely stunning stunts, beautiful shots and crazy crazy CRAZY characters, designs and action. Furiosa / Charlize Theron was a surprising choice but works quite well and is the main character of the movie.

","I don't know why people are complaining about this movie. All of them are saying that this movie is disappointing, but I was actually impressed! Seriously, who wrote this movie.<br/><br/>An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is an originality. Once again, some crazy people wrote this movie. Just look at some scenes, some characters. Seriously, where the hell did they found that dude that looks like a baby and is fed with baby milk.<br/><br/>Also, some people are complaining about Tom Hardy starring Max. I was really happy with it. No, I'm impressed again. I really like his hallucinations of his past. Charlize Theron starring Furiosa did crazy as well. Her hope for better tomorrow was done well. These mothers are done good as well.<br/><br/>I also really like visual effects. That effect of sandstorm is amazing. Seriously, my jaw drops after sometime. Sound effects and soundtracks are done good as well. I really like that dude that is playing some crazy looking guitar at the front of the car. <br/><br/>There is not much dialog, which I really like. This movie is concentrates on action, not on the story telling (also well made). When I first saw the trailer, I was like:""Another Mad Max movie? But I didn't watched the first trilogy."" But what I really like is that this movie is not connected with other Mad Max movies (you don't have to watch other movies). I think I watched the third Mad Max movie, but I didn't like it much. You know, cars and stuff (not a fan of race movies or games).<br/><br/>The action scenes are awesome. I was creeping out while watching those scenes (I don't know why, but I was). I really like their spear with a bomb on the top. Don't know where that came from.<br/><br/>At the end, I think this movie is the best movie released this year (sharing first place with Kingsman: The Secret Service). I have to say, if you already didn't, go watch this movie!"

","The opening to Mad Max may well be the most attention-grabbing I've seen, gluing me to the edge of my seat eager to see how the movie unfolds. The energy and visuals continue to amaze throughout, though the early world-building was the best storytelling in the film. The vision of the desolate post-apocalyptic world was so well realized, I was a bit disappointed when I realized the movie was pretty much exclusively going to be a big long car chase. The opening 20 minutes or so, when we see Max chased and caught, meet the ruler and get a sense of how the world works, and meet Furiosa and get a sense of her plan, are near perfect filmmaking and great set up for the characters and world. We do learn more about the girls and crucially more about the people working for the ruler through Nux, a stowaway turned traitor, but the movie is light on character development, dialogue, and plot. That's not all bad - Miller is committed to making a thrilling visual action movie, and he undeniably nails that. The action is so well shot it makes similar action sequences feel fresh and exciting. There is some relevance to contemplate as we see Furiosa certain that there is a green place where she grew up, only to realize it was an illusion in her mind and that her only real hope is realizing the potential of where she has been living and taking control there. I admire Miller's commitment to making a great action movie and not forcing a bunch of dialogue or romance in, but while I marvel at the craft and visuals of the action, especially early, the other elements are good but not great, and even the greatest action scenes repeated for 2 hours can't maintain that same level of awe."

"KidWithOpinions","9","2","3","19 November 2018"," The Most Bad Ass Best Picture nominee since forever!
","Mad Max:Fury Road is George Miller's latest installment to the Mad Max franchise. I would give it an A, for how entertaining it was, and how well the story was made.
Mad Max: Fury Road is the most bad-ass Best Picture nominee since Martin Scorsese's 2006 crime movie, The Departed. When I watched Fury Road the first time, I had no idea that it was nominated for Best Picture. This movie was nominated for Best Picture! That is insane, I mean out of all the movies they nominated, that was one of them. I am not mad, in fact, I love the fact that George Miller gets another shot at an Academy Award. This is the best Mad Max movie, according to everyone in the general population, and to myself.
What I think is nice about the Academy nominating Fury Road, is that if you are anything like me and your goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees, then you know that all you are watching are super depressing dramas, and every now and then a dramedy ( but remember that a dramedy is still a drama). So it is nice to take a one movie break and watch a movie that is filled with violence and gore, and scenes of intense action. So when they nominate a war film ( that is rated R) it is nice because half the time it is just people killing other people. It is entertaining.
There was nothing in Mad Max: Fury Road that I really hated. The acting in it is good, it is well done, and it is entertaining as hell. What is there not to like. I will say that there is not excessive amounts of violence in it, so if you go in expecting that you will be disappointed. But all the violence in it is bad enough that parents wouldn't take the family to it, I will tell you it is nothing like Beyond Thunderdome.
Fury Road reminds me of literally every Fast and Furious movie, and I think you can understand why. It also reminds me of 2017s crime drama action movie, Baby Driver, I think you can see why ( yet again).
To recap, I think this is the most bad-ass Best Picture since ever. I give Mad Max: Fury Road an A, for how it was entertaining as hell, and how well done the story was."

The scenes where the image is sharp is better looking in B&C edition, while the rest of the movie looks better in color because the image is softer. I think the softer images are the product of using software to artificially reduce the shaking. This isn't noticeable in the regular edition because of high contrast color. On the other hand, instances where the images are sharp don't look as good in color because the extremely sharp images with high contrast are distracting -- this isn't a problem in B&C edition."

","I was hearing critics talk amazing stuff about this film: that it was the definition of fun, that it was one of the best action movies of all time, that it was a masterpiece, and so forth.<br/><br/>I watched this movie twice, but not because I've enjoyed it, but because I wanted to find why this movie got so much love. And I failed, I was disappointed by this film.<br/><br/>What's the plot of the movie? I don't know, it has a very loose plot. Is basically moving from point A to point B... and point A again?. Is really underwhelming. The characters: I don't care about them. There's only 2 characters that get development and have an arc: Furiosa and that guy with painted mouth with silver that played beast on the recent X-men movies. And there are parts of this film I just don't get. Like for instance, there are several parts were Max gets visions of people calling for help... were did this come from? were did it go?. The bad guy on this film (I don't even remember it's name, that's how forgettable this movie is) is so over the top and annoying I wanted to kill him. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film is the action, and admittedly it is very well done. Very impressive camera-work and stunt work, some welcome practical effects and creative set pieces. The problem is that this movie is 2 hours of cars chasing through the dessert, and after a while, I got bored. Also, the over-reliance of practical effects make the moments when CGI is used very noticeable, and that's not a good sign on a film. On top of that, there are some pieces that, as impressive as they may be, they are just tough to buy. Like fighting on top of a truck at full speed? that's really hard to believe. <br/><br/>And other parts did bothered me as well. The soundtrack is very mediocre, that guy with the guitar I thought was REALLY stupid, the overall costume design I didn't like, and there are scenes that could have reached it's full potential. Like when Furiosa discovers her family/group/clan/whatever was murdered, she takes her mechanical arm off and screams at the top of her lungs. If she took her arm off and slowly walked away to be by herself, it would have been a lot more powerful. <br/><br/>I could go on and on but I'm wrapping this off. Overall, this movie disappointed me. It isn't terrible, it has some good, and even great parts, and it had a lot of effort put into it, which I appreciate, but if the story and characters were better, I might have found that amazing film that everyone was making it up to be.<br/><br/>5/10."

"BeneCumb","7","2","3","3 February 2016"," Visual over-sophistication, waste of good actors
","The initial Mad Max movies were crazy and odd enough, but they had a solid plot with character dynamism and a lot of lines, but the one in question is a constant and rough chasing, with vague characters performed by celebrities (Hardy, Theron, Hoult - all distinct actors otherwise), model-type ladies (performing doubtful roles as heavily pregnant women handling heavy machinery and ""kicking butt""), and ""unseen"" actors (faces with warpaint/masks). True, there are some silent and pensive scenes in the middle, but they seem out of context, as a pause for audience to catch breath before uproar starts again. Just back and forth on the same deserted landscape, with even explosions and shots not influencing some characters' exterior.<br/><br/>The only personage I liked somehow was Nux (skilfully performed by Nicholas Hoult), but his change of sides remained mystery to me... <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is like a protracted Manowar video or a road movie inside out, but the conceptual element regards visuality only. The rest is rather mediocre, at times annoying, meaning that visual effects might be a supporting component of plot only (e.g. Tarantino's movies), not the substitution of activities / logic of events."

","I thought Mad Max was suppose to be the main character in a Mad Max film. This film focused on Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and her struggles to find her home land a little more than it did Mad Max (Tom Hardy), in my opinion, not that I'm complaining because it's still a great film. This film is set in an apocalyptic era, of course, which causes it to be a breeding ground for a lot of action and to me that's what made this film so great. Almost from beginning to end there's enough nonstop action to keep any action film fan satisfied. The story line that involves the two main characters were simple but the action completely made up for that. Overall it's a good film, not what I expected it to be but still good."

","Max swings in front of the camera, holding for dear life to a pole, while vehicles that would even look out of place at a monster truck derby blow up behind him, like an orgasm after one of the many action sequences that make this movie. The scene reminded me of the one with the ladders and trains in The Lone Ranger, another recent film to get action right.<br/><br/>However, unlike LR, Mad Max Fury Road does just what its title promises : it races straight on, leaves you next to no time to breathe or look at your watch. In a way, the movie made me think of an opera. Grandiose almost to the verge of ridicule, but epic enough to sweep you along for the ride. Characterisation and plot are there and something rare happens, the story actually continues to unfold as the action goes pedal to the metal, instead of taking a break while you look at all the beautiful explosions. What about the action? you ask. Well, forget your shaky cams and frantic editing to make up for the lack of actual skill involved. The set pieces are fast and all over the place, but you never once wonder where you are, what's happening, and where the protagonists are in all this mess. After such a magnificent love letter to action thrillers, one can only hope some of them action-makers take a notepad with them when they go watch this one."

","After my third viewing of Mad Max: Fury Road, I decided that it's only fair that I give it a written review. I don't often watch a movie multiple times like that. And when I do, I am often disappointed at how the emotions or the spectacles lose their edge a little bit. But with this movie, I still got goosebumps watching those precarious, mad action sequences in the beautiful barren desert landscape.<br/><br/>Every single aspect in Mad Mad: Fury Road is screwed in so tight that the tension never drops from scene 1. The story is simple but compelling with lots of high stakes. The characters are also simple but the nuanced acting, especially from Charlize Theron's Furiosa, keep them from being standard cookie cutter action heroes. These action scenes seem to have been written with each characters' personalities in mind, and that's why they are so memorable.<br/><br/>For example Furiosa is the ingenious one who comes up with plans and coordinates things. I can't imagine Max doing the set pieces that she does. He's the one who fights in close range with raw power, and the scenes for him are truly meant only for him. In this way, the action scenes can illustrate character and advance the narrative, instead of just being cool filler in between plot points. That's how a non-stop guzzoline fueled rampaging with metal music can be sustainable for 2 hours.<br/><br/>This movie might be one of those rare ones that are just infinitely rewatchable. It's like a visual roller coaster. I can come back to it year after year and still expect it to be thrilling and fun. No other spectacle can match the physicality of the actual stunts with actual cars."

We are far into the future, a place of unnatural worship and invention; a desolate place characterised by its wild people, their eccentric personalities, and their creative attention to costume and vehicle design.<br/><br/>Everything is manic, and it embraces the insanity to wonderful effect. Whether its a guitar-flamethrower hybrid that sublimely fits into the blistering score, or the chrome spray that sends Warboys into a high in their final moments, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has an astonishing amount of world-building that is as bizarre as it is engrossing.<br/><br/>There's enough narrative heft to bulk the frame of this action film, but its the carnage that is the true highlight. Coming in waves and lasting for lengthy periods, George Miller masterfully directs every set-piece that meticulously guides your eye through each frame. Every second is deliberately and expertly crafted to create tension as the action unfolds. And the carnage is full of breathtaking stunts and vehicular explosions that are all edited for maximum entertainment, with time slowing to afford the time to witness vehicles crash and splinter in a whirlwind of chrome and rust.<br/><br/>Packed with well-choreographed set-pieces, impressive world-building and a delirious sense of unrestrained fun, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a fully realised post-apocalyptic blockbuster that is one of the greatest action films of all time."

I will be forever in debt to the deftness with which Miller's addition to the Mad Max corpus honors every aspect of the satire genre -- completely coloring within the lines of vapid meme rehash, endless regurgitation of thematic tropes to cue audience to his earlier work, while at the same time cheapening and satirizing the Mad Max arc to a degree to which pales in comparison to Lucas's utter destruction and posthumous capitalistic Disney rape of the the past two installments of the Star Wars franchise.<br/><br/>Just stunning."

If you want to understand it better, watch the movie on DVD with it set for dialog for those who are hard of seeing and hearing. Anyway, there is a lot lacking in the plot and characters, and the baby birth scene was sort of uncalled for in my view. And what happened to the baby????

If it were not for their involvement then this would be yet another movie that would be relegated to the echelons of ""so bad it's good"" movie-making, alongside the likes of Hobo with a shotgun, Spun and Tank Girl.<br/><br/>Despite the slick cinematography and editing, I am left baffled how this movie could be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards."

","Mad Max: Fury Road feels like a breath of fresh air after so many crappy Hollywood/Bollywood action flicks. This is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. Those who have seen the original ""Mad Max trilogy"" will love it, those who haven't, might love it or hate it because there is no or very thin plot.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy does justice to his role. He doesn't speak much, but his eyes do all the talking. You can feel his pain, he is broken by his guilt and grief. But it is Charlize Theron who steals the show here. She is exceptional as Furiosa. This might be the best performance of her career. Sometimes I wondered why the movie was named after Max when it was more about Furiosa.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous (I liked the blue tint in the night scenes), the screenplay is excellent, the background score is amazing and direction is brilliant. George Miller, who is 70 years old, is at the top of his game here. He doesn't give you the time to feel ""comfortable"". He puts you straight into the action, right from the beginning. He wants you to feel the perils of living in a post- apocalyptic world where anything can happen.<br/><br/>The editing is â€“ excellent with frame rates going high when you need it (works like an adrenaline rush) but the action doesn't get lost. George Miller shows you everything that's happening. You know where the different cars are unlike other action films. Miller shows you everything with the help of some perfectly angled shots. Whenever there is an explosion, you will know the reason behind it.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this, George manages to add some humor. There is a blind guy who keeps playing Thrash Metal riffs on his flamethrower guitar during the whole chase sequence.<br/><br/>The villain is really good and He sounds a lot like Bane. He has controlled the water supply and acts as the master of other people.<br/><br/>One more thing that I loved about this movie was that there was no unnecessary romance which often ruins great movies.<br/><br/>Now, this could have been a 6/10 movie because it is really easy to make such a movie with CGI but it deserves no less than 10..why? The acting, direction, cinematography, editing, music, screenplay are awesome and the movie is 10% CGI and 90% practical effects. So almost everything you see on screen, is happening for real. Cars are being thrown here and there, the explosions are real, people are fighting for real and all the stunts you see in the end are real. Imagine the efforts they have put into making this movie. That's the best thing about it.<br/><br/>So if you are familiar with Mad Max then go and watch this movie ASAP and if you aren't then decide for yourself. But if you miss this flick, you will miss some of the best practical action scenes ever done on screen."

","I'm sorry, but this movie really lacks heart. Tom was awful. CGI was bad. Plot was simple. Not very realistic in parts of the movie. This movie needed Mel Gibson for his acting and direction. No classic in my book. Stick to MM1 and MM2. Just as George Lucas tried to relive the past and failed, so does George Miller sadly. No Mel No Good. I tried so hard to love this movie and gave it a fair go. I felt emotions with Furiosa and the girls at times, but from the beginning it left a foul taste in my mouth when we see Max eat a lizard. How ridiculous was that. Lizard skins are way to tough to chew and even if Max had a beer, he would still choke. I quickly dismissed that scene as to not let it affect my overall judgement, but there was so much more unrealistic crap that it was hard to really love it. I may watch it one more time on Blu-ray at home in 6 months, but unlike MM1 and 2 which I've seen over 50 times, it won't be part of my classic collection. Shame."

","(Warning spoilers)<br/><br/>No mel Gibson. Bearing in mind that an ageing mad max flick could seem comparable to the last indiana jones, so good choice.<br/><br/>However, tom hardy as mad max was terrible. I am not one for character development and i understand max over a period of time has became colder, however he felt like Christian bale as batman. <br/><br/>He really didn't do much in the movie, an empowered charlize was there to do most (if not all the work). Actually the title for this movie should have been 'Mad charlize' with a supported role by mad max. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is there is very little about mad max (considering the title is named after him). He seems to be small part of a parallel story line that clashes with the main story of the film. To finish up as there is not much to analyse about tom hardy's acting in this movie. I think just about anyone could have done equal if not a greater job.<br/><br/>charlize acting was OK, not terrible but it seemed like her role should have been mad max's role. Charlize appears in the movie with a short haircut and looking similar to a man. She even has a mechanical arm and almost dies saving the main cast, were tom hardy nurses her back to health.<br/><br/>After writing this paragraph it has dawned on me that maybe the writers changed the roles to be more pc, however that is only an assumption. <br/><br/>Now for the movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is very high in action, has similar wacky car ideas and innovated ways to destroy a large moving object, but it is only a variation on the 2nd (a big truck) and the third (a train) storyline. Max goes somewhere, saves some people and stuffs up the bad guys. With a slight variation in this one, max goes somewhere (captured), doesn't really do much and leaves at the end, leaving charlize to play the role of maf max.<br/><br/>My rant.<br/><br/>before I start, I know this is a fictional story but the premise of mad max is this situation could happen (two men enter one man leave and angry Anderson aside)<br/><br/>Whose idea was it to put in biker grannies, not cool and illogical for an apocalyptic movie (pc?).<br/><br/>What was with that angus young guy constantly shredding on top of that moving vehicle? No need.<br/><br/>What was with that guy saying not to get addicted to water? Water is an element of life<br/><br/>How the hell where there so many people in the desert. The only deserts are in the interior. The majority of people live in the coastal areas?<br/><br/>Again what was with those biker grannies, I know 60-70 yo's. Cant see that one happening.<br/><br/>What was with that bold guy with mad max?<br/><br/>Who in Australia would believe in Valhalla?<br/><br/>How did everyone in the citadel get access to white face paint all the time, in the Australian outback?<br/><br/>How could that citadel be created in the Australian outback?<br/><br/>What was with that main bad guy? <br/><br/>Again, I know this is a fictional movie but if you live in Australia you would recognize the first one. Thats how Australia really looks.<br/><br/>To conclude I give it a 5. Watch it if you are a fan who must see it. If you don't want to be disappointed, stick clear of this one.<br/><br/>actually just stick clear! The anger you will feel afterwards is not worth it."
"lesleyharris30","9","6","15","20 May 2015"," A Truly Magnificent Cinema Experience,
","Mad Max: Fury Road is an outstanding movie with an extremely well developed plot and a terrific cast. There is no other movie truly like it, it may be the fourth film in the Mad Max series, but it is very different to the Mel Gibson versions. It's significantly weirder, filled with tons of action that keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is beautifully directed by George Miller in what is without a doubt his greatest work to date. <br/><br/>I think the film definitely needed to develop Max a bit more. I understand it was taking a different approach to telling the characters story, but for an audience who have not seen the previous movies, it is not very clear that Max is the way he is because of the murder of his wife and daughter, they should seriously consider focusing on this more in the sequel.<br/><br/>The cast are all superb here, Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult all play characters that start off not being particularly likable, and as the film progresses you really care for them all and want them to succeed in their journey. Only complicated, somewhat anti-heroic characters like these can only gain support when actors as talented as good as these are portraying them. <br/><br/>It is a wild ride from start to finish that always kept me entertained and never slowed down. Action packed, truly unique and well acted, I would recommend Mad Max: Fury Road to all moviegoers. <br/><br/>In an apocalyptic wasteland, two rebels team up with the hopes of restoring order. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Hardy"

","Insane action packed, two hour road rage movie, that more or less sums up this crazy film, George Miller still got it, coming back after 30 years and making this in just the right spirit and with all it entails is amazing.<br/><br/>This film is an instant classic, even though a film where they drive around for two hours sounds like something that gets boring, it just introduces new strange characters, one more crazy then the next all the time and keeps the action and tempo at a very high gear. I was entertained from the beginning all the way to the end and there was enough to see and think about on the way, caught myself sitting with open mouth and a big grin on my face many times.<br/><br/>The acting is not deep, but there are many characters, one more crazy and strange until the next one shows up, how did they find all these crazy people and drag them out into the deserted lands miles from civilization. Well actually there isn't much acting for most parts or not in matter of lines, the only one that really pulls through on this is Charlize Theron, she delivers a good performance, is a tough girl and still keeps the glimpse in her eye. Tom Hardy on the other hand more or less grunts through the first half and gets a few more lines through the rest, but he does deliver a good performance as the main male character, crazy, mad or driven to insanity of sorts, Max is his name :) The young Nux played by Nicholas Hoult also does a great job, we see the world through different perspectives through his eyes, first as the mechanic that wants to be accepted into Valhalla and later he finds that there is other ways.<br/><br/>Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe, don't know if he is the only one, but he was also in the first Mad Max movie from 1979, I think it was missing a Camio from Mel Gibson or Tina Turner, that would have been a fun surprise.<br/><br/>All in all bang for the buck, really nicely topped of with visuals and music that just fits perfect into this desolate wasteland and crazy character scenario, two thumbs up from me and a big happy smile."

This movie was something else. There's no other post-apocalyptic movie like it - even no action like it. Mel Gibson / George Miller had a really unique and flawless chemistry there, the movie really freaked me out when I was a kid (aaah 80's!).

It's way better than soo overrated Dark Knight movies. It's better than zillions of action movies... but this is nowhere near Road Warrior. Tom Hardy is NOT Mad Max.

"BA_Harrison","9","9","26","14 May 2015"," Welcome back, Max.
","It's been thirty years since I left the cinema feeling more than a little let down by the kiddie friendly, Hollywood-ised action of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome; could this long-awaited reboot from the series' original creator George Miller make up for three decades of disappointment? You betcha!<br/><br/>One certainly can't accuse Miller of playing it safe with his fourth Mad Max outing: Fury Road is an exercise in absolute excess from start to finish. The outrageous plot opens with Max (Tom Hardy, taking over the iconic role from Mad Mel) being captured by a clan of desert warriors ruled over by ruthless tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from the original Mad Max), who keeps order in his citadel by controlling its supply of water (and breast milk!). The helpless Max is used as a 'blood bank' by sickly war-boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), before finding himself strapped to the front of Nux's vehicle, part of the huge convoy that takes off in pursuit after rebellious one-armed rig-driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has betrayed Joe by making off with several of his wives, having promised to escort them to a promised land of green.<br/><br/>After the chase enters a massive electrical sandstorm, during which Nux crashes his car, Max finds himself free once again; teaming up with Furiosa, he helps to drive the rig to safety, but on reaching their destination, Max and Furiosa realise that their only hope for survival is to turn back and face the enemy head on. Up to this point, the action had been impressive, but what follows is absolutely breath-taking—a mind-boggling mêlée of sheer madness and mayhem, with more mashed metal and massive explosions than all three previous Mad Max films put together, times ten. Quite how Miller managed to capture some of the scenes of car-nage without killing anyone in the process is hard to imagine, such is the incredible level of vehicular destruction on display.<br/><br/>The previous Mad Max movies—even Thunderdome—excelled when it came to production design, and Fury Road is the most imaginative yet, with its wonderful citadel full of man-powered machinery, and, of course, its cavalcade of absurd post-apocalyptic vehicles (love, love, love the The Cars That Ate Paris-inspired buggies covered in metal spikes). The attention to detail here is superb, with far too much to take in in just one viewing (I've only just finished watching it and I already want to see it again). The insane characters also go a long way to making this film the hugely entertaining experience that it is: Slit, a war-boy with a Joker-style smile; Rictus Erectus, the dim musclebound son of Immortan Joe; The Doof Warrior, a guitar playing gimp stood astride a bank of loudspeakers on wheels; and a strange deformed dwarf, another of Joe's sons, who watches the world through a telescope from the safety of the citadel.<br/><br/>Finally, the 3D: usually, I can take or leave the gimmick of a third dimension, but here it really added to my enjoyment, Miller milking the process for all its worth. I suggest watching Fury Road in 3D if only for the shot of the steering wheel flying into the foreground: I felt like I could reach out and catch it—a lasting souvenir from one of the most spectacular movies of the millennium so far."

"autisticreviewers","10","5","12","10 November 2015"," Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.
","When a few years back, Australian director George Miller announced a new Mad Max film would be in the works but sadly it would have taken over 25 years for the project to fly off the development stages (as there was issues with production, locations and even script development over the years) but this year was the year audiences would finally see it on the screen in this final completed work. The question is for all fans was; would it be worth the wait all these years to happen, and would it be worthy as its original trilogy? The following summary below pretty much sums up the wait and anticipation had really paid off for both the fans and the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Fury Road is a worthy wild action ride that packs punch, value and high quality into the trilogy that was established previously, it can be considered both a reboot and a sequel but this enables Miller to expand the wasteland universe and to further the life of the 'Road Warrior' Max. Having seen the trilogy countless times, we are immediately aware of the production value it should carry, but with the film having the biggest budget to use (beating the trilogy's separate budget values), Miller crafts not only an epic film in action and storytelling, but in terms of value, concept and direction he gives us a shining feature that stands strongly and respectively for the fans of the franchise.<br/><br/>Casting in the film was great, in particular marks the first time that a different actor has filled in the shoes and duty of portraying Max and that actor was Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Lokie, Bronson and Inception). At the time when it was announced of his role, fans both agreed or disagreed with this casting choice as he was of British decent and it was Mel Gibson that defined the role as iconic for both him and the franchise. With Hardy, he gives a solid performance that makes us feel that Max has still strong after so many years past since Thunderdome, and pulls it off without no flaws that makes him solid like Gibson. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron plays as Furiosa, a character that seems to take the leading action role as much as Hardy but there has been criticism from various anti-feminist groups that she is more dominate and more action-oriented than Hardy's character on screen and thus making fans feel that Max is a secondary character. From my perspective, this is a false fact as Max does play a major role throughout the story; as he's assisting with Furiosa's journey of redemption to bring the women into a safer world, without Max's assistance she may not have survived Joe's ambush and violent attacks to stop her.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes the talents of Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Warm Bodies), Hugh Keays-Byrne (From the original Mad Max), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Nathan Jones and Megan Gale to name some, in which all play great performances in their roles. From my eye, Hoult makes homage to the Gyro Captain (from Mad Max 2) that's in the form of his wild boy character Nux while Byrne's Immortan Joe is dominate as the villain and bares the similar voice with Bane (played by Hardy ) with tension and pure bad buy quality (there's barely any bad dialogue from him or any of the characters).<br/><br/>In terms of action, Fury Road is indeed a major contender for action quality that matches not only the quality from the previous films but takes it further in terms of stunts, practical effects and choreography work. From explosive crashes, high-wired acrobats, jumping and moving along moving vehicles and fist fights on top of tankers, the film does it with amazing eye for detail and realism using practical effects and stunt people whilst using minimal CGI to assist the action or landscape. The fast and clear camera work and editing makes the action sequences seem so beautiful, brutal and flat out insane that it leaves the recent Fast and Furious films in the dirt and in shame.<br/><br/>Cinematography, sound mixing, editing and practical effects are all top notch throughout the film, Miller and his crew give the action, story, its characters and its deserted environment a style that has been missing from the genre for sometime (though a few today have occurred to be solid examples such as The Raid 2, Furious 7, Kingsman and even some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films) but Miller reignites both the genre and his style of filmmaking that make it seem possible for the film to get Oscar worthy consideration in 2016; which would be nominated for best cinematography, sound mixing/editing, visual effects and possibly direction. The amazing cars featured (including the signature Interceptor) are all real, detailed and seemed so based from the minds of Miller and his design team and it's a true fact that 350 vehicles were used in the film, but who knows how many of them were destroyed during the making of the film (I hope the future home entertainment release will feature a behind the scenes look into this and the production values).<br/><br/>Overall, Fury Road is an epic action ride that delivers solid entertainment for both action fans and fans of the original trilogy, Miller has taken so many years to get this franchise back on the screen and the results we see are the best we've seen in filmmaking and the genre itself. This is perhaps my favourite film I've seen alongside Age of Ultron, CHAPPiE, Kingsman: The Secret Service and Birdman but this film stands at the first position and earns itself an 'Seal of Approval' for quality entertainment.<br/><br/>5/5 - Nick"

","This movie absolutely blew me away when I first saw it, and I've now seen it probably 20+ times after purchasing it on Amazon instant video. I'm normally an indie film lover, but I just appreciate a story well told. Die Hard and The Dark Knight <br/><br/>I totally and unequivocally disagree with any reviewer who says this is typical Hollywood action fare. This is art that benefited from tasteful CGI and special effects, not the other way around. <br/><br/>I loved the airtight script. Some people wanted back story, but I loved that the story unfolded the way it did. I feel it would've been typical and distracting to delve into needless exposition. For the emotional experience, we didn't really need to know why Furiosa decided to rebel, how the wives came to hate Immortan Joe, or why Max wanted redemption. I personally cared deeply about all these people, and I was easily able to suspend disbelief. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD****<br/><br/>The action was so perfect too. What do you know-characters being in ACTUAL danger works! I don't want cookie cutter stories like The Avengers, With crap like the Avengers/Transformers/Superhero CRAP, you know there's a bad guy and there's a big fight at the end of the movie where the villain is defeated and the world is safe. You know, without even going to see the movie, absolutely everyone you care about will survive. <br/><br/>With Fury Road, you really wouldn't be able to guess what happens-it is an original and authentic story. At the beginning of this movie, and pretty much throughout the whole thing, I'd never have guessed Splendid (the pregnant wife) would die, that Nux would martyr himself, and I genuinely was afraid they'd kill Furiosa when she got stabbed. <br/><br/>The action was insanely thrilling too! I was constantly on the edge of my seat, hoping everyone would survive. I was totally lost in the experience, not focused on the special effects. I literally had adrenaline rushes going. <br/><br/>Last but not least, THANK YOU for featuring such strong female characters. I heard about the feminist buzz and backlash prior to seeing it, and that honestly made me want to see what all the fuss was about. It definitely lived up to my hopes. <br/><br/>This is one of the best things I've seen in a long time. It touched me in a way I haven't really felt since watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Dark Knight, and Fight Club. Definitely a game changer movie."
"mariuskleppe","10","5","12","26 May 2015"," The best action-film in a long time!
","The movie starts of with a voice-over, and 15 seconds in to the movie, the action has already started! We quickly get introduced to the main- characters, and then the story starts. This whole movie is simply put a 2hour-long chase-sequence with real stunts, chaotic, but easy to follow explosions and fight-sequences (unlike the mess in Michael Bays Transformers movies...). This movie works so good, mostly because of George Millers vision. He's got such a great control over the action and the universe. Miller is the star of this movie, even though he doesn't appear on-screen (that I noticed.). When I walked in to this movie, I was a bit afraid that two hours of this would get boring after a while, but I guarantee you that it doesn't! The universe this takes place in, is really interesting, and the thing this movie does right, is that it doesn't tell you everything. It doesn't explain every single little detail about everything, considering the fact that it's probably less than 100 lines of dialog in the movie. It's visual storytelling, so the universe is as complex as you make it yourself. You can see this movie for the action alone, but there is a lot of interesting elements besides the action, even if it's only sort of hinted at. The great thing about the action, is that very much of it is done with practical effects and real people. This makes the movie feel more authentic, and it's a nice break from the cgi-heavy superhero-movies of today, even though there is some cgi, it's never too much. You feel the speed and the action, and instead of slow-motion, this movie use quite a bit of speed-up footage, which adds to the insanity of the movie. The movie is visually really stunning, and I especially liked the feel of the nighttime scenes (which were actually shot at day, but touched on in post-production.) It's visual beauty. The characters are also very interesting. Mad Max himself, is pretty much Mad Max as we know him (even though Tom Hardy has taken over for Gibson). Theron plays Furiosa, which is a female protagonist right up there with Ripley and Sarah Connor. Personally I think I found Hoults character Nux, the most interesting. I won't spoil anything, but he's great. The villain, called Immortan Joe, is a classic Mad Max villain, especially considering he's played by the same man who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max. His presence makes the movie even better. Overall I will say that Mad Max: Fury Road is hopefully a future classic, on par with MM2: The Road Warrior, and other action-movies like Die Hard and Terminator 2. It sure as hell deserves it. This movie is like an awesome roller-coaster. You're in for a ride that will shake you around for two hours, and when it let's go, you will, if you're anything like me, want to get right back on for a second spin! It's insane, and makes the Fast & Furious movies look like they're meant for kids (and I like those movies too.). This is just so much more thrilling. The plot may be a tad too simplistic, but that didn't bother me, because the action weighs up for it. If the Taken sequels had action-scenes like this, I wouldn't complain one second for the lack of an original plot! This movie is just so inspired, and feels so fresh. I can't really explain it with words, you just have to see it for yourself. Chances are, you'll either love, or hate it. It all depends on your taste in cinema, but it sure as hell fits me perfectly. I will also say that it's a movie that is meant for the big-screen, so don't download this on your computer or watch it on a small, bad TV. If you can catch it in the theaters, than do so! The visuals, and the soundtrack is best enjoyed on a large scale. (The soundtrack is awesome btw. And sort of played by the people in the movie, I guess you've seen the guitar-player in the trailer!). Watch it in theatres now!"
"topeth","9","5","12","22 May 2015"," Amazing, from head to toe!
","Honestly never heard of Mad Max series before. I just went to the theater to watch Tom Hardy. And man it was breathtaking. 3D effects, cars, crunching, make ups and the plot. Two words: TOP NOTCH! At first I thought it will be another mediocre Hollywood reboot but I am awfully happy that it proved me wrong. The film made me stay on my seat all-the-time and I literally forgot to go to the rest-room at some point. Brilliant, simply brilliant storyline, and each and everyone acted accordingly. Needless to say, made me watch the previous trilogy, nonetheless. I must say, George Miller has shown what he's capable of. Loved ""Happy Feet"" duologue and then THIS!. Couldn't get any better.<br/><br/>If you love action and pop corn, it's a must watch flick for you! And oh, in 3D of course :D"
"summerehca","9","5","12","22 May 2015"," Finally Seen It - Classic!
","After a week of skipping this film (due to other scheds) I finally watched it today. Sadly I didn't get the chance to experience it in IMAX (it would have made me a very very happy cookie). Regardless, the cinematography is just amazing. I also have no complaints (not one in editing- a first!).<br/><br/>The characters were (for me) strategically developed- not the traditional way we usually get in most movie scripts. There were moments I kind of murmured wt7? But in the course of the movie, even if there's less talk, I get what it means and say ahhh.. The visuals, the expression of the characters and the way the sequences were shown all somehow relate and I get it :) Unlike other films that had long interactions, but less substance. <br/><br/>Enjoyed every bit of it- I even found humor in some acts, especially that guitarist, lololol, and when he finally got tired, and obliterated.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy just doesn't fail to amaze. Charlize is just freaking furious (compliment)! and the vehicle action scenes are just wicked. This is ""Fast and Furious"" maxed.<br/><br/>I disagree on the R16 classification (in my country) though. It's not really gory. <br/><br/>I highly recommend the movie. Not a lot of CGI for a change, just natural action epic."
"daniell san","9","5","12","21 May 2015"," Now...This is what action movies should be like!
","The movie starts out with a bang and it seems like it never ends. Not that that is a bad thing. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action scenes are amazingly well done. The acting is great, though I did think that some of the wives could have done a better job at it. The characters are really interesting. This movie finally gets the female action hero right. The movie is as much a Mad Max movie as it is a Furiosa movie. The story is not that complicated, but it has layers of deeper meaning to it, which you can choose to ignore and just enjoy an action movie, or give it some thoughts. Either way, it's a very good movie. The desert landscape is beautiful! The vehicles and machines are very detailed and look great. What also stood out to me was the score by Junkie XL. He really outdid himself here. During one of the amazing action scenes I thought to myself: ""Holy sh*t! The score is absolutely amazing!"".<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! I've seen it in IMAX and it looked amazing. Hope to go see it again soon."
"murphyseanmichael","10","5","12","20 May 2015"," George Miller Scores...to the Max!
","In a drastic move for a director who has so far this century only worked with dancing cartoon penguins, George Miller returns to the franchise that made his reputation and delivers a masterpiece of violence, velocity, and vroom-vroom that sets a new standard for R-rated action.<br/><br/>The screenplay (by Miller, comic book artist Brendan McCarthy, and ""Mad Max"" alum Nico Lathouris) is a work of minimalist brilliance that never bogs down the story with exposition or shoptalk. Just scanning a list of the character names makes the imagination run wild; how many summer blockbusters can you say that about? <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is fun in the title role, but Charlize Theron is the star. Nothing left to prove, Theron has entered the high-franchise phase of her career and now finally has a vehicle (no pun intended) to demonstrate real courage, grit, and leadership, with a subtle redemption arc that distinguishes her character from Tom Hardy's, who is motivated solely by his will to survive and silly accent. The rest of the cast is terrific too. X-Man Nicolas Hoult skillfully elicits real sympathy as the comic relief.<br/><br/>The legions of people who worked on the visual effects, sound, and stunts are all MVP's, and every technical element is turned up to eleven. Cinematographer John Seale, Oscar winner for ""The English Patient,"" brings breath-taking desert visuals. Costume designer Jenny Beavan, Oscar winner (with NINE(!) nominations), deserves special recognition. My favorite? The heart-pounding music from Tom Holkenborg! If you loved the music in ""Fury Road"" then you are in luck: Holkenberg is scoring four more movies over the next year. I believe Holkenborg will come to define the sound of modern genre movies just as Hans Zimmer did in the last decade. Of course, the odds of this movie getting any Oscar nominations at all sit somewhere between those of ""Ant-Man"" and ""Paul Blart 2."""
"mcintoshnathan","9","5","12","18 May 2015"," Insane, Action Packed, Western on Wheels.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is handled and directed perfectly by George Miller and is by far one of the best action films of recent years. Mad Max: Fury Road is basically a Western on wheels, and is an action packed thrill ride, having you on the edge of your seat at all times, making you feel fear for the hero's life at all times. Everything you could ask for from an action movie, Fury Road has.<br/><br/>To me the only complaint I could have with this movie was Tom Hardy, don't get me wrong, he was great in this movie, but to me he didn't really sell the part of Mad Max. Charlize Theron's character ""Furiosa"" on the other hand was great in every scene. The villain ""Immortan Joe"" was exactly how I wanted him to be, Hugh Keays-Byrne did a great job as the antagonist.<br/><br/>George Miller's directing is also great, every frame was perfect, every shot and angle was done great. The cinematography was done exceptionally well by John Ceale, at no point did I take my eyes off the screen. Mad Max: Fury Road was so fast paced and so well shot, I didn't even want to blink, just because I did not want to miss a single moment in this movie. another thing that was great was the explosive action scenes, they were insane and exactly what I wanted from this movie.<br/><br/>Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is a fast paced, action packed thrill ride and is one hell of a movie and I recommend you to check it out, this needs to be viewed in cinema. Like I said the only problem I had was Mad Max himself, In my opinion George Miller could have set this in the same world and time period as the original Mad Max trilogy and gave Hardy his own character, then this film would have been a perfect action movie.<br/><br/>Go watch Mad Max: Fury Road as soon as you can, you will have a great time at the cinema. And will be very entertained."
"joeravioli","9","5","12","17 May 2015"," A vision of (almost) pure insanity
","Mad Max: Fury Road is true cinema. It does not, like the inescapable mass of dull summer movies, rely on a makeshift script and thoroughly uninteresting characters to sell tickets to a largely indifferent audience looking for two hours of bland entertainment for no reason other than to pass the time. Rather, Mad Max: Fury Road breaks well and solidly free of common summer movies. It is not only riveting, it is deliciously shot and well-directed, an art movie and blockbuster rolled beautifully into one. <br/><br/>The film stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, a solitary man trying to survive in a harsh desert wasteland, haunted by visions of his past. Tom Hardy instills a certain desperation within his character, almost making him seem like an animal, void of intellect and feeling. ""A man reduced to one instinct – survival"". Tom Hardy plays the role very well, but he sometimes comes across as good ol' Bane in his mannerisms, a man of few words and a whole lot of muscle.<br/><br/>Now, while Tom Hardy kills his role, Charlize Theron butchers hers. She plays Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed woman who teams up with Max to escape the warlord Immortan Joe's Citadel, armed with a massive ""War Rig"" and a group of young women referred to as Immortan Joe's ""breeders"". This role is easily the best role Charlize Theron has ever taken on. Her cold, piercing stare is as unsettling as the insanity raging around her. She is not, like summer movies nowadays would have us believe, a woman who simply exists to remove her clothing for the pleasure of a man. She comes across as a pinnacle of morality, strength, and power, better than anyone else on the screen could come even remotely close. Screw off, men's rights activists. I'm a man, and I can see that this is not feminist propaganda. This is just an unprecedentedly spectacular performance from Charlize Theron that does not involve her being a sexual object. Men's rights activistswow.<br/><br/>Of course, however, this film was not made to showcase Charlize Theron. This film was meant to convey pure and terrifyingly logical insanity that races purposely through your mind like a centipede, scorching your eyes and smashing your brains out, augmenting your own little crevices of insanity hidden deep within you until you are gasping under the strain of it. I, for one, occasionally wanted to stand up on my chair and scream. I was never sure why. <br/><br/>The chase scenes (which encompass almost the whole movie) are beautiful. It seems as if each shot was meticulously chosen in order to send a rush of adrenaline pulsing through the audience. Each explosion. Each maniacal yell and flying body. Each gunshot. Each and every flipping car. And a final, explosive flying 3D guitar. Each element of this film makes the audience understand that they are in the hands of a master director that has been crafting this wonderfully intense story for thirty years. This film should be the standard for summer movies.<br/><br/>Notice that I said that this film should be the standard for summer movies. I don't believe that it exceeded it to the point where it should be immortalized in the canon of incredible action movies. The final battle scene, while being as visually commanding as the other ones, was not as epic as I had expected it to be considering all the buildup that it had leading up to it. It felt much like the other scenes, invoking a sort of déjà vu that greatly reduced its effect. I was expecting a Matrix subway fight. Instead, I got the lobby scene for the second time. Now, that is not to say that this film is in any way bad. This film is very good, just not the excellent film that it had every right to be.<br/><br/>George Miller scorns Hollywood's money-grubbing emptiness with this film. You can almost hear his voice amid the chaos and violence saying, ""Seriously, is that all you can do?""<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"
"carterbennett","9","5","12","15 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully ""mad"" and stirring action genre landmark that represents an experience in the theater unlike anything I have had before!
","Mad Max: Fury Road- R, 2015 ➡️ Mad Max: Fury Road is an era-defining, world-class action spectacle that will be the perfunctory default for anyone answering the question of ""what film is the most iconic cinematic achievement from the year 2015"". George Miller is back in the director's chair here and gives us a true sequel to ""The Road Warrior"" that every film fan has been waiting for with baited breath. In Fury Road, the world has become a mere shadow of itself as the warlord, Immortan Joe, rules the wastelands with an iron fist. Charlize Theron's superb female hero, Imperator Furiosa, acts as the impetus that sets the plot in motion by stealing Immortan Joe's precious wives. Mad Max Rockatansky, played brilliantly by the viciously talented Tom Hardy, gets caught up in this chaotic maelstrom that seamlessly plays out as one long chase scene across endless stretches of desert. The action is relentless, heart- pounding, and beautifully shot but, when pealing back the layers of this unhinged action masterpiece, a powerful underlying message can be found that challenges the sometimes despicable lens through which women are viewed in society. George Miller, with minimal dialog, still manages to draw us to each character and their plights. He reminds me of the great Sergio Leone In that both have directed few but critically acclaimed films, both directors revived a seemingly dead genre, and each of their magnum opuses feature a character who relies on facial expression instead of words to convey emotion. The structure of the film and its stellar execution leave very little room for problems but there is still enough room for a few to squeeze through. The minor nit-picks I have with this film only include some stilted dialog and not enough Max in a ""Mad Max"" film. One thing that may deter the general moviegoer from seeing MMFR is the over-the-top kookiness interspersed throughout the film. This wasn't a problem for me but I can definitely understand how certain people could be turned off by that. Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully ""mad"" and stirring action genre landmark that represents an experience in the theater unlike anything I have had before! #9/10"

","Well I am 5 months into 2015 and this has got to be just about the worst film I have seen this year! I really am hard pushed to find anything to say about a film that has no plot, was made in 3D Imax and has the worst CGI and special effects that I have seen in a very long time. <br/><br/>It further and worse still, lacks any originality and leaves the Mel Gibson films looking like masterpieces, which lets face it is a long way from the truth although the originals had the benefit of being that original, this particular offering was at very best a poor imitator even with the benefit of all that computer Graphics Interface.<br/><br/>The main core of the film is the almost incessant crash, bang, wallop, and destruction of cars trucks and lorries with literally hundreds of vehicles and their drivers being plastered all over the screen and really that is all that goes on from the first minute onwards leaving me feeling that a better title for this film would be... <br/><br/>How to smash and blow up as many vehicles as you can in two hours. Starring more stuntmen than you can count.<br/><br/>The script was not just poor it was poverty stricken, with unbelievable characters, who pretty much lacked any kind of real personality, in a barren landscape that allowed for unlimited petrol vehicles with Nitro, and hot rod modifications that you would be hard pressed to find pre apocalypse. This film annoyed the hell out of me and I understand it cost $150million I came away from the film with just one single thought Why did they Bother."
"Aaron1375","10","7","19","17 May 2015"," Mad Max returns to theaters after long hiatus in furious fashion!
","After viewing Avengers Age Of Ultron a couple of weeks ago and now this one, I have to give this film the edge as far as enjoyment goes. 'Wow' is just one of the words I would like to use when describing Max's return to the big screen...a return that was long overdue and it was very nice finally seeing a Mad Max film in the theater. The film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action, a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot, no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they are...no, here we have simple action and the characters' actions telling you what they are about. It would be nice to see other Mad Max films in the future and it is possible as Tom Hardy did sign on to do three films. More than likely if they did get made, Max would once again find himself in the middle of a dispute that he really wants no part of, but begins to feel the need to help.<br/><br/>This film starts out with Max getting captured in record time as he is taken to a place called the Citadel which has water and greenery in abundance, but said greenery is controlled by a man named Immortal Joe. A woman who apparently drives for him, named Furiosa begins her next mission, but she is about to break ranks with Immortal Joe and Max will soon try to help her and her cargo escape the demented mad man and his crew of crazies in an attempt to find a place away from the madness.<br/><br/>It was great seeing Mad Max again as Miller made sure a lot of the staples from previous films were included as well as some odes to the previous films. It was nice seeing the sawed off shotgun, the pursuit vehicles and the nitro. Makes me wish they'd let Miller direct one of the many comic book adaptations as he proves you can create a film that is nearly all action without it looking like a cut scene from a video game. Tom Hardy does admiral filling in for Gibson, had they made this film when Miller had originally envisioned Gibson would have been in the lead role once again, but Hardy looked the part and it did feel like he was Max. It was also neat seeing that Miller got the actor who originally played the Toecutter from the first film to be the main villain here, though he is most definitely a different character.<br/><br/>So yes, really good action films with very little talking can be enjoyable to watch. Why wouldn't they be? I've never understood at times why they always feel the need to make action movies and such accessible to everyone. It is not as if they add gun fights and car chases to a musical to make it more enjoyable for a male, so why they always seem to do this for people who do not like action films seems a bit silly. Granted, you may lose some of the American audiences money, but a film like this is going to thrive in the foreign market. I at least hope it does, because I would enjoy seeing Mad Max on the big screen again; however, if I do not I will at least be satisfied with seeing this one as it was an incredibly intense action film rarely seen these days."
"jleecross","4","14","46","15 May 2015"," Not the Mad Max I remember
","If you have never seen the other Mad Max movies you will like this one, but if you are a fan of the old movies then you might be disappointed as I was. There wasn't anything new in my opinion, and there was less blood. I would rather watch the original movies myself. I was hoping to seen new wild action scenes and more violence but I was let down. Like I said If you want a only action movie and haven't seen the original Max movies you will like it. It's only pg-13 so if it comes to DVD with an unrated version then it might be somewhat better. I also felt like Tom hardy was using the Bane voice to much in the movie and made me laugh. My friend that hasn't seen the original movies really like it so I understand why there are so many good reviews because it has a lot of action."

","Of course I had heard a lot of good about Mad Max: Fury Road. Hell, it won six Oscars! But of course it's different to actually see it for yourself than just to rely on the opinions of others.<br/><br/>It's clear that this movie is different from the typical action movies that we get nowadays from every f##king movie studio that exists. There's something unique in the story and of course visually this movie beats any other action movie out there. <br/><br/>While the story is a bit dark and it has very serious themes in it, there's a somewhat loose feeling to it. The movie can be taken seriously, but there's a somewhat relaxed feeling to the things they've come up with. The filmmakers are pros and they know what they are doing, so if they want to add a flamethrower electric guitar in there, they can and they should - and it will be f##king awesome. <br/><br/>That flamethrower electric guitar reminds me, since I haven't seen the original movies I can't help but feel that I'm missing something. Why is there a guitar and war drums on a car? Is that... normal? Is that a regular thing or is Immortan Joe just a drama queen who needs his own theme music? It's cultural stuff like that that I don't know, but in the end that didn't seem to matter that much. But at least it feels like there's a world outside this movie, that the post-apocalyptic Australian wasteland has a culture, instead of just those three or four tribes we get to see.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road may be a bit long, and definitely feels longer than it is, but it's worth it. The audience wants desperately to see what happen, they desperately want a happy ending, all that. I was on the edge of my seat, even though during the start of the movie I was indifferent towards it. <br/><br/>Visually... I've never seen an action movie that looks like this. The editing is amazing, so are the effects, which might have something to do with the fact that they used CGI very little. But the cinematography... It's astonishingly beautiful. Every shot seems to be careful, and the colours are mind-blowing. Also the costume department has done such an amazing job, and all the vehicles look amazing... Everything in this movie just stands out from the typical post-apocalyptic action movie, and it's amazing.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing post-apocalyptic action movie, that definitely stands out from all the s##t that's out there. It's different, original, and just so damn thrilling and beautiful. It's a f##king action movie masterpiece! What are the originals like? If they are anything like this, I have to see them!"

","I think the actions was okay and the setting was put together well, but my biggest problem was the lack of a solid theme. <br/><br/>There are environmentalist messages, feminist messages, political/government messages, and more just littering the film. Any one of which, if focused on singularly, would make a solid and engaging story. Unfortunately, this jumbled-up mess of themes makes the film a jack of all trades and a master of none."
"joshteggert","9","4","9","8 May 2017"," (Review of Black and Chrome Edition)
","Let me begin by quoting Director George Miller commenting on this release: ""Losing some of the information of colour makes it somehow more iconic."" <br/><br/>Nearly 2 years ago to the day, Mad Max: Fury Road exploded ferociously onto the big screen. It now stands as a modern pioneer of the immense success that large franchises can achieve by using practical effects over CGI wherever possible (over 80% of the film is shot in this way). Re-released now in monochrome, this version of Mad Max: Fury Road is just as thrilling to watch as it is in colour; if in radically diverse ways.<br/><br/>Initial stipulations for Fury Road included making the film as colourful as possible. It is unusual, then, that Miller should be calling this desaturated edition ""the best version of the movie"". In fact, this is the style in which Miller always wanted to release Fury Road, and ultimately, it isn't hard to see why.<br/><br/>The 2015 version is certainly a stylish film; winning Six Academy Awards including Best Production and Costume Design. But the blend between action and monochrome is remarkably tasteful here; it can be strongly argued that Fury Road is the ideal film for this sort of translation. The black and white itself is never flat; it's not just a simple case of putting a filter over the screen. Plenty of extra contrast is added to the image which enriches the movie nicely, creating a chilling atmosphere at points. <br/><br/>Although unfortunately, in black and white it loses a lot of the emphatic impact of the flaming guitars, and the incredible stunt work isn't quite as staggering. For a film based primarily on its visual effects, this does take its toll on the overall product. <br/><br/>In contrast however, the outstanding performances by the cast are wonderfully enhanced, hurling the audience back to the golden age of cinema; where movies were dependent on the principle cast's integrity to be an effective movie, not special effects. In the moments where Fury Road isn't putting the Fast and Furious franchise to shame with its exceptionally filmed car chases through the Australian wastelands, the personal moments are somehow even more forceful than in the original. Miller is indeed right about the absence of colour making a film feel strangely more distinctive, and Fury Road benefits enormously from this added layer.<br/><br/>It was announced recently that James Mangold's gritty, dystopian superhero masterpiece, Logan, will be re-released in monochrome. Thus, it seems cinema's adoration of black and white is sliding back into popular culture again, and by God let it endure. The possibilities for future iconic re-releases of movies in black and white are limitless, and as it does for the use of practical effects in modern times, Mad Max: Fury Road proudly stands as an embodiment of the great achievements that big budget films can accomplish if released in monochrome.<br/><br/>What A Lovely Way (pun intended) to watch this adrenaline-fuelled spectacle."

","Mad Max and Road Warrior were great movies. <br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is a pile of dog excrement. <br/><br/>In addition to what the other reviewers who hated it said, it relied too heavily on CGI, had a scattered, poorly written ... dare I call it a ""plot""? because it really wasn't -- and we had no reason to care about ANY of these characters. It was a mess from the moment it started until it thankfully ended. <br/><br/>If this had been the original Mad Max, no one in Hollywood would have EVER made a single sequel of this horrific mess. <br/><br/>Sad that this is what passes for a ""good"" movie these days."

I was on edge through the whole thing. Ready for things to get interesting. But, it never happened. That interesting twist or thing that would explain this confusing world just didn't occur. They drove out into the middle of nowhere, fighting the whole way. Then drove back, fighting again. That's all that happened. Why does everyone love this movie? I honestly don't get it.

","where Mad Max (1979) was just a fun peri-apocalyptic romp and a genre movie that garnered no awards, who can explain this mess winning six Oscars®? Every single aspect of this film is a travesty compared to the original. The plot, the acting, the costumes, the dialogue, the soundtrack, the action, the pacing. It's all bombastic over the top nonsense. And loud. Very very loud. I have never come across a film that so disappointed me from the opening scene. I watched it unfold and thought, ""Oh for crying out loud, what is this? Surely it can't all be this bad!"" But no, it starts off ponderous and loud, and gets no better. Disappointment turned to frustration and anger. There's even the cliché of a female character gradually losing her clothes that's from 1980s teen slasher films and parodied in Galaxy Quest. And did I mention some guitar playing that seems to be taken directly from Todd and the Book of Pure Evil? George Miller should have had two DVDs to consult while making this film, and watched them every night after shooting: A green box with a copy of the original Mad Max, labelled MAKE IT MORE LIKE THIS ONE, and a red box containing Waterworld and labelled MAKE IT LESS LIKE THIS ONE."
"Lomedin","8","4","9","23 January 2016"," Just wow
","I'm sort of a fan of the old Mad Max saga. Those movies introduced me to a ""road movie"" genre of sorts, where films are centered around driving, ranging from Dead End to, even, Waterworld (I thought of that bad-mouthed movie as a sort of Mad Max with water instead of wastelands). I wasn't expecting much of Fury Road, to be honest. As the vast majority of sequels and re-makes nowadays, I thought it was going to be a hyped, clichéd attempt to revive the franchise. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road delivers the whole experience of the old saga, plus more. Let me start by saying that this new movie borrows A LOT from the old ones, from camera angles, to paraphernalia, even a bit of the fast-forward motion used in the old movies!! I checked afterwards and, to my surprise and delight, Fury Road creators are the same as the old Mad Max movies, so that explains a lot. I believe this new movie could easily pass for one of the old ones, minus that little extra CGI, of course. I'm glad they didn't try to add new, more modern stuff to the Mad Max universe.<br/><br/>Oh, and this is not a sequel, but some sort of re-make. It is another vision of the same theme. Personally, I think it'd be better to watch the old movies to get a better understanding of the reality presented to us in Fury Road. Those flashback/hallucinations would also make more sense.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of the movie are PURE NON-STOP ACTION, without cheesy or ""cool"" dialogue added, something that ruins most films nowadays. In fact, there's very, very, very little talking (throughout the whole movie), something that stays intact from the old days, as well; and that I sincerely appreciate. But, hold on, the action still continues after that marvelous beginning! When the pace slows down a little (just a little), it's only to gather momentum! It's hard to surpass that first part of the movie, OK, although it's still great.<br/><br/>The added CGI creates the perfect extra for that post-apocalyptic future, although it's mostly old stunts and little CGI (I think!), which is also a bonus, for me, in this industry overcrowded by cheap and over-expensive computer generated graphics.<br/><br/>The cast, although not great for the main characters, is acceptable. I'm not a big fan of Tom ""one expression"" Hardy or Theron. I'd actually have preferred Max to keep the ""mask"" longer, it gave him more of a ""Mad"" air. It reminded me of the sensation I got from seeing the last installment of Judge Dredd, where leaving the helmet on all the time supports the character and makes us focus more in what's going on, at the same time, instead of attracting unwanted attention to poor acting in the form of shallow facial expressions.<br/><br/>I found the mythology in this new movie very appealing. I'm glad they stayed away from Christian themes. <br/><br/>Allow me to also indicate that I hate movies like fast and the furious or whatever those are called. Please, in case anyone relates Mad Max to that trash, let me tell you that it's nothing of sorts; Mad Max uses the vehicles as a means to deliver a story of survival in a dystopia, contrary to the other movies where the means are the same as the end. This is not a movie about ""tuning"", saying clichéd ""cool"" one lines or any of such non-sense. This is a movie about survival. No matter how absurd it might seem, or actually be! You have to center in the action and forget about the rest, while still keeping it in the background as a reminder of what you are watching. Complicated? Well, it's just not about car racing and being cool, and let's leave it at that.<br/><br/>I read they are going to make a sequel to Fury Road. I certainly hope they can stay in the same road (no pun intended), no need to mess up an excellent comeback.<br/><br/>It's great to find a movie like this in this present reality of bad, over-hyped creations. More creators should go back to their origins and deliver shows like this. The only thing they could have added to make it more like the old movies would be Mel Gibson. I'm afraid that would have made Max too Mad, though."

"marvelous-17462","3","4","9","18 September 2015"," A Disappointment
","This movie is atypical of today's multi-million dollar blockbuster, special effect movies. The premise is a good one, but the movie fails to pull it all together. I thought the director rushed to cram everything in within a couple of hours instead of building out the characters and storyline. It tried so hard to stay true to the original two Mad Max/Road Warrior movies with the post-apocalyptic world and there's a nice spin in the movie (instead of a fight for gas this time it's about the scarcity of water) but it ultimately just wound up being a movie about a bunch of monster cars and car chases. Tie that to a sub-plot of women being used to bread warriors and this COULD HAVE BEEN a really good tie in to the original Mad Max movies. This was a disappointment, but many will like the action and explosions minus a true storyline."
"in1984","8","4","9","22 June 2015"," Proof that a non-stop Action-horror film can last nearly 2 hours
","8.1 of 10. This takes everything in the original sequels and ups it a notch while seemingly providing a prequel to the original films. The action is non-stop, the gore and desert dystopia beyond anything the original had to offer and bordering on horror often.<br/><br/>The downside? The end of the world dystopia scenario is less believable than it was in the early 1980s. There have been much better scenarios since then and they failed to integrate them (especially another female-hero anime called Nausicaa (1984) that remains the best of the Mad-Max series and imitators). It's also a little too cartoonish at times the way people are able to bounce around and survive brutal accidents. But it fits within the story of the film and is made believable enough to not interfere with the overall enjoyment.<br/><br/>It is true that this would be better called ""Mad Maxine"", but contrary to criticisms Furiosa lives up to any version of the Max character and gives the second half of the title and film meaning, plot, and mystery to enjoy."
"ferguson-6","6","4","9","17 May 2015"," Retaliate First
","Greetings again from the darkness. Thirty years have passed since we last saw Mel Gibson donning the leather in 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which was of course, the third in the franchise after Mad Max (1979), and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981). Over the years, rumors have persisted that writer/director George Miller was going to add to the franchise and take full advantage of today's high-tech movie making techniques by securing the budget necessary for a true blockbuster. It may have taken 3 decades, but Mr. Miller's dream is realized with his $100 million version (compared to $300,000 budget on the first one) that will undoubtedly satisfy the Mad Max fans, while also reminding the industry what an action movie can be (Michael Bay's corneas may burst into flames watching this).<br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky, a loner haunted by a tragic past seen only through millisecond flashbacks that occur at both inopportune and opportune moments. Hardy has the physicality to pull off the role, but despite the title and the history, this film belongs at least as much to Charlize Theron who literally drives the story as Imperator Furiosa. Tired of living under tyrannical rule, Furiosa frees a group of ""breeders"" played by Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough (Elvis Presley's granddaughter), Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. Their plan is to escape across the desert (well, everything is desert these days) and return to Furiosa's childhood home known as ""the green place"".<br/><br/>This is pretty much a two hour chase sequence featuring monster vehicles, soaring motorcycles, massive gunfire, screen-filling explosions, and enough stunt work to amaze even the casual movie-goer. All of this is accompanied by ear-bursting high-octane music courtesy JunkieXL (the first Max films were scored by Brian May of Queen). Some of this ""music"" is raw heavy-metal shredding occurring live on one of the chase vehicles – quite a sight and sound gag. It should be noted that stunt work is the surprise here. These days, most movies rely on CGI effects, while Mr. Miller mixes an extraordinary number of old school stunts with the compliment of CGI for such things as an overwhelming sandstorm and Ms. Theron's mechanical arm. It's a fascinating blend of old and new.<br/><br/>John Seale certainly deserves mention. He is an Academy Award winning cinematographer for The English Patient, and has also been DP on films such as Rain Man, Witness, Dead Poet's Society and The Firm. He has four Oscar nominations and is not the first cinematographer one would think of when putting together a huge action film; however, the choice pays off in what is a beautifully shot film – both in space and close up scenes. It brings an element of propriety to what on the surface appears to be out-of-control, non-stop chaos.<br/><br/>The post-apocalyptic look and feel is accented by periodic splashes of color that prevent the usual bleakness from others in this genre. Many will be surprised at the minimal dialogue, but the straightforward plot removes any need for extended conversations from folks simply trying to survive.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies) may be the most interesting of all characters, and probably has the most lines of dialogue (while still not saying much). He is a slave caught up in the dream of serving his master, while then re-discovering a modicum of humanity buried somewhere deep inside. Fans of the series will also cheer the presence of Hugh Keays-Byrne who plays the very striking Immortan Joe, and also played Toe Cutter in the original film 37 years ago.<br/><br/>Filled with nostalgia and respect for the original series, this fourth entry also provides a new palette for a new generation of fans. The biggest change comes from the focus on strong women who are out to change, or at least escape, a world rotted by the male lust for power. It's difficult to say insanity rules this world, because so little sanity exists that rational beings are non-existent.<br/><br/>George Miller will always be known as the creator of the Mad Max series, but we shouldn't forget that he also directed the Happy Feet movies, as well as Babe: Pig in the City. Perhaps those two personalities allow him to create a world as crazed and chaotic as we see in his latest Max film. Mostly we can feel happy for him that he was afforded the opportunity realize his filmmaker dream  a nice reward for 30 years of patience."

","OK, being an avid fan of the predecessor of the Mad Max original series, I thought ""oh, what a lovely day""; a new Mad Max! This film was up to scratch, Tom Hardy played a very good road warrior (but not as good as Mel Gibson but don't tell him that) a few minor things that my friends and I picked up on was the scene where they are trying to winch the truck and the lead actress (Charlize Theron) started trying to push it as if it was going to help. Another thing was that it had way too many guns, in the first film there was one shotgun; in the second one there was two guns, a shotgun and a pistol. Stick to the purpose of it being an apocalyptic bare landscape and only have a couple guns. I mean come on, that scene where the guy used two ak-47 and two ump-45's to spray bullets at the protagonists. Be real, they would conserve ammunition.<br/><br/>In conclusion, think that it was a good film, more of a run and gun than a storyline film but it was good and I would recommend it."
"Red_Identity","Null","4","9","15 May 2015"," Bombastic, grandiose, intelligent and wickedly entertaining
","There aren't many action films that do much for me. Usually, the story itself isn't engaging enough for me, and sometimes the action just becomes way too overwhelming to the point that I become desensitized to it and lose interest pretty much. In fact, this is what happened to the rest of the Mad Max films. I think all are decent, but great? Not really. So I was super excited for this because of all of the acclaim, but also hesitant<br/><br/>Thankfully, this film really did it for me. In terms of narrative structure, it's pretty straight- forward, but the universe created here is nothing short of outstanding, and the themes it's presenting are grandiose and powerful. For all of its madness (and yeah, it's truly mad), there's a sensitivity to the film that I can't really pinpoint. It's one of the loudest, busiest films I think I've ever seen, but the fact that its heart shines through and it actually comes across as honestly trying to tell a story about human nature, and not just putting it for show because it ""needs"" to have a story, is wildly impressive. Some of the dialogue is stuff to be expected, but the way the film paints these relationships without trying too hard really pays off. The film is able to maintain its madness and through it all actually resonate emotionally. That's a grand feat<br/><br/>But in terms of the action, wowza. Don't really know what else to say. Whereas many action films, and with a lot less action I may add, suffer from the way the action is filmed, nothing here does. The editing and cinematography need to be praised for that alone. There is so much happening and yet every scene comes across cleanly without any glaring problems. The film also cleverly overwhelms its first act with as much action as possible, and in its own way calms down after that. This helps to let viewers know that the classic ""action film"" structure will be broken, and it's done wonderfully. <br/><br/>To say that this is my favorite Mad Max film would be a huge understatement. It's glorious and majestic, wickedly bombastic and entertaining. Easily one of my favorite ""action"" films ever, and the only time I've been overwhelmed by an action film but was still able to enjoy it."

","Mad Max: Fury Road<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that Mad Max: Fury Road's director George Miller made Happy Feet and Babe but then he also made the original Mad Max and hence that statement should be the other way around. Of course, since this is almost 30 years since that Mad Max, the new version is at least 30 times grander. <br/><br/>Somewhere George Miller is yelling ""My movie's action will speak louder than words"" and that's exactly what the film does. It is a visual spectacle that redefines the sheer pace of an action movie narrative. Almost 90 minutes of the 120 minute movie happens on dirt-kicking moving vehicles which just refuse to slow down. When the vehicles stop you are gasping for air and feel like taking a shower but before u can regain your senses those mutated vehicles are running again. <br/><br/>Of course, words are not important, whenever the action quietens you have stunted B Movie dialogues which could have been better except for this hidden gem ""Hope is a mistake, if you cant fix whats broken you will go insane."" My only grouse with the film though was that whenever there is an opportunity to show unbridled gore, Miller flinches (maybe cause a NC-17 threat was peeking over his shoulder) but the movies jarring metal soundtrack makes up for it. <br/><br/>The star if not 'the action' would be by far Charlize Theron as Furiosa, a cold and calculating rebel who has balls of steel and then there is Tom Hardy as Mad Max who is more insane than Mel Gibson could ever get. See his eyes dart to and fro in a crucial climax scene. The guy seems dead inside much like the desolate wastleand he dwells in and yet there is a craziness which lurks in him. <br/><br/>Mad Max is not a perfect film and may age poorly but it is definitely the most exhilarating film you would see in a long time. <br/><br/>One Word: Epic!"

","...well, maybe the word ""lovely"" isn't the BEST way to describe it, although the visuals are quite beautiful.<br/><br/>I'd say that the best words to describe ""Fury Road"" are awesome, intense, chaotic, and jaw- dropping. It is one of the greatest action-adventure movies I have ever seen. Not only is the action well shot and executed, but the entire visual style has an epic quality to it. Everything from the character designs to the color pallet work together to form a masterful cinematic roller coaster ride. <br/><br/>This brutal and monumental instant classic also contains likable characters, strong performances, and subtle storytelling. As George Lucas once (ironically) said ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is full of mind blowing special effects, and also contains a pretty outstanding story. there are moments of genuine power and tenderness. At times Miller puts the action on pause, and the spotlight is now on the characters. So, despite this film containing seemingly non stop action, it still is strong enough script and character wise to keep the audience caring and engaged. <br/><br/>I would also like to note that I very much admired how Max's backstory is mostly kept a mystery here (perhaps it is explained in the original films, which I have yet to see-although I do plan to sometime soon). Instead, it is made clear that something has happened to him- there has been some tragedy in his past life, and it effects his character. It shows some kind of human weakness, almost like the final scenes of ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"". Warren Beatty's character always seems like the toughest guy in town, but by the end the pathetic nature of human beings is shown, and his weaker side is at last exposed."

After you finish the 2 hour flick you wonder if anything was even accomplished and leaves the viewer feeling empty after the stunt-induced high and raised adrenaline from one of many 10-15 minute high speed action sequences. <br/><br/>Any acting, or lack there of, is intended to be ignored by the viewer in hopes to avoid the lackluster and unintelligent dialogue written by an action movie director. <br/><br/>Could be the most overrated movie that won 6 Oscars, in my opinion."

There was nothing exciting that kept you on the edge of your seat. I was so glad when the movie finished. I was asked by my husband if the producer was smoking something when they made the movie because you would have to be smoking something to watch it. If I had bought this movie I would be asking for a refund. The story line is the same as the last Mad Max movies so why did they bother with it if they had nothing new to add?"

","I only got around to seeing the original ""Mad Max"" just about a month ago, thirty six years after the fact. Considering the amount of favorable press this film got and the huge amount of award nominations and wins it's already sustained, I figured I wouldn't wait around so long to see this one. Probably won't make it anyway but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Not generally a fan of these types of films, I'd be less than honest if I said I didn't get a certain eerie pang of visceral thrill out of the whole thing. The characters and action are so mind-blowingly furious it makes it hard to keep up. I also got a kick out of the odd names the writers came up with, though if I were watching this without captioning I would probably have been totally lost.<br/><br/>I don't know if it necessarily takes a warped mind to concoct something like this, but then again, George Miller also wrote and directed ""Happy Feet"", so there's obviously a creative bone in his body to speak of. Where the vision comes from is probably the better question. On a different day and in a different mood I might have experienced this picture entirely differently, but catching it the way I did, I have to say it was quite the experience."

","After finishing this movie I wanted my money back the problem is I didn't pay I watched it at my friends house. He was telling me how good it was and I completely disagree. Visually it was great but the acting was sub par and the story was weak I would rather watch the first three movies then watch this again. I may give it another try but I seriously doubt it. I am a big Tom Hardy fan but this has to be the worst movie he has been a part of I hope that if he is in any squeals that they give him a way bigger part and a better script. They must have been trying to give us shock and awe and hoping that we wouldn't notice the bad script."

","I saw this movie in the movie theater today. It is enjoyable, but boy, what a flimsy story. I reckon if they had invested 1% of the props budget in a decent scenario this film would be better off. Because the props are really fantastic. Great job there. Also, there is plenty of action. In fact, there is too much action. The whole movie is practically one long car chase. And with all things in life, good and bad, too much is too much: Rev up the engine, shoot a few times, fight on the truck, throw somebody off the truck, push a vehicle away Ben-Hur-Style, and repeat 5 times. There is your complete scenario.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews here, and yes, the movie lacks dialogue and in-depth character study. And a decent story, but I've said this already.<br/><br/>I have a suspicion that people who liked Snowpiercer, are also gonna love this one, i.c. 14-y old boys and hillbillies. The plots in the movie are highly improbable. I actually had a bad feeling after the first scene. And my fear came true. Not Mad Max homage worthy.<br/><br/>A game to play while you are watching this film is deciding which model looks best. It keeps you busy the whole time! <br/><br/>The budget for this film was 150m dollar. If humanity keeps making such films, surely we are heading for apocalyptic times..."
"jimlacy2003","6","13","43","14 May 2015"," Feels a bit like the old Max, but disappointing
","I'm old enough to have caught all the original Mad Max movies when they hit the silver screen here in America.<br/><br/>It was entertaining but I felt sort of let down. I expected more of original formula. As much as I like Tom Hardy in other movies, he honestly couldn't carry the Mad Max character. Then they tried to make up for it with some weird horror like montage/flashbacks. I got the feeling this ""Max"" had either gone insane or maybe he was on some serious drugs.<br/><br/>Mel has this sort of spark to him. His version was much stronger, more masculine, sort of like a superhero. Harding on the other hand seemed weak and kind of mushy.<br/><br/>I'm starting to feel that Gibson would have been better again despite his age. Sure maybe he couldn't crawl under a truck anymore, but Arnold and Stallone carry an action movie fine and they are even older!<br/><br/>It did have the Mad Max feel to it at times, but for the most part it seemed to have a lot more of the modern feel. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this time Miller must have been wooed and couldn't resist the temptation to over do special effects like 90% of most action movies are these days. I'll say it again, and again, if you don't have story you don't have anything.<br/><br/>Does every movie need to be one and half hours plus of pure SFX? It got to a point were the movie seemed too implausible and surreal.<br/><br/>And then it seems like Miller was thinking ""screw it, I'm going to make this movie really mean something!""; and make this weird dynamic about some political statements all over. Miller seemed have gotten soft in the head. The originals were like ""Watch this wild strong guy try to survive in some apocalyptic wasteland"" and that was all we needed.<br/><br/>This move just doesn't have that magic. The original Max really had this edge to it. And it had a lot of character.<br/><br/>In the end it's a pretty entertaining movie, but like me you'll probably leave a bit disappointed if you were a big fan of the originals.."
"starfoxfan86","10","6","16","13 June 2015"," an epic modern masterpiece
","What are action movies today? They are a sea of CG, PG-13s just for the label, Marvel super heroes, and Michael Bay jokes. But every so often there is something like this. and while this is an existing franchise this moves shows us what a modern action movie should be. One of the draws of the original Mad Max trilogy is the real stuntwork during the action scenes. There really is something special about watching an actual stunt and knowing it was done for real. Mad Max Fury Road actually is real stuntwork like it's predecessors- but not only that it is far more ambitious in every action scene. Just about every move someone makes or a crash during an action scene here really is a spectacle. The theatrical trailer is just a small taste of what happens. And I estimate that 50-75% of this movie is pure action- yet it somehow doesn't grow old. But this is not a CG free film. However CG was only used to remove stuff like rigging and wires- which makes the action even more spectacular. Another spectacle this movie has to offer is the production design. Just looking at the vehicles and how most of them are pieces of different vehicles is just incredible- and they all were real. And at last there's the story. This movie sort of is a remake of the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior but at the same time is it's own original film. Not only that but there's the aspect of the characters- and despite the massive amounts of action, every major character is completely developed, and even the supporting cast is very memorable for different reasons. In actuality the story keeps the action from getting old and the two parts actually are almost the same thing. This movie is almost a month old at the time I'm writing this review and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This may not be the case for most people, but the use of action as visual storytelling really left an impression on me and I wish more action movies will follow in its footsteps. It really is impressive that 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and after 14 years of delay that George Miller brought back his signature series with a completely new vision. I look forward to the sequels that come. This is a really simple summary and it does not do the movie the justice it deserves. Mad Max Fury Road is a movie that cannot be summarized in words. It can only be experienced."
"erniehbert","9","6","16","27 May 2015"," Oh what a film, what a lovely film!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' can best be described as the film equivalent of an adrenaline shot! A literally breathtaking movie, that offers the best action seen in years, even though relying on a somewhat thin plot.<br/><br/>Still, this doesn't mean that there is no story whatsoever. Director George Miller, the mastermind behind this whole franchise since the very beginning, does a nice job of familiarizing the viewer with the crazy post-apocalyptic world he created. Set in a desert wasteland somewhere in the future, this world is weirdly appropriate mixture of BDSM, steam-punk and motor-heads. Our hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, who replaces the original Mel Gibson) is captured by the so-called War Boys, an army who belongs to the crazy tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), whom they worship like a god. Joe rules over a region, called the Citadel, with endless water supply, yet limits the water rations of his people to a minimum to assure his leadership. One day he sends out a War Rig, driven by his lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), to get fuel and bullets, which just like water are rare goods in this world. But Furiosa has other plans: Together with Immortan Joe's wives, his 'breeders', she plans to free herself. As Joe finds out he and his army of War Boys start to pursuit her. Max, who's being used as 'blood bag' to a sick War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult), has to come with them, strapped on Nux's car. From here on a crazy movie emerges, that defines the expression action-packed in a new way! Explosions, car-chases, fight-scenes, everything happens at once, at an insane speed, captured by the camera in the most beautiful and iconic way one can imagine. The movie clearly benefits from the practical approach they took. One catches himself to cringe at some of the impacts seen on screen. The few CGI-heavy sequences fit in well with the rest of the film. The great soundtrack and sound-editing make this one of the liveliest movies of the last couple of years, maybe even of all-time. Thankfully the movie doesn't solely rely on its fascinating action. Instead it manages to bring in a lot of interesting characters and a thin, yet perfectly functioning plot. Especially George Miller's ability to establish his characters and give all of them interesting personalities is impressive, considering how little talk there is throughout the whole film. Particularly Imperator Furiosa deserves to be mentioned here: She is, probably even more so than Max himself, the main character of this movie. Her hope and search for freedom is what this story thrives on. Furthermore she is one of the strongest female characters in recent movie history, both meaning that she is kicking ass, but also well written, developed and understandable which is often a problem with female leads. The wives are also worth mentioning. They could have easily become one-sided forgotten characters, or even worse, annoying 'eye-candy', who depend on a man to save them. Instead all of them have their own character-traits, which make them likable and individual. The plot itself functions mostly as a justification for all of the insane action, but still offers enough substance to involve the viewer emotionally and intellectually. Some might even shed a tear here or there. Yet, one thing must be said about the dialogues. As I mentioned earlier there isn't a lot of talking in this movie. That's no problem. However, the use of dialogue is one. Instead of letting the imagery speak for itself or implementing things in the dialogue, important plot-points are often just spoken out directly which comes off a little weird from time to time. This is, seen in the greater context of the movie, forgivable, but could have been done in a smoother way. Performance-wise Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both great as lead characters, even though Theron's star shines a little brighter in this one than Hardy's. That's no surprise since Max mostly communicates via grunts and gestures whereas Imperator Furiosa is a more fleshed-out character, who experiences far more emotional changes and who develops therefore a closer emotional attachment to the viewer than Max. The supporting cast is solid throughout, led by a brilliant Nicholas Hoult. Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley bounces back from an awful performance in the awful Transformers 3 as the 'lead' wife and Hugh Keays-Byrnes is a wonderful villain. If somebody is faintly reminiscent of the first 'Mad Max' seeing him - he played the main villain there, too.<br/><br/>'Mad Max: Fury Road' offers everything one might hope for and probably even a little more. The mostly handcrafted action is obviously the selling point of this movie and that alone is worth the entrance. Still every action-sequence serves to develop the story as a whole, which even though short offers enough turns and twists to keep the viewer interested. As a whole this movie is a brilliant showcase for all studios on how to revitalize a beloved movie franchise in a fresh yet recognizable way. If this turns out to be George Miller's last movie one can only congratulate for ending his career with what might be the best action-movie of all-time."
"FlashCallahan","9","6","16","23 May 2015"," I am the scales of justice! Conductor of the choir of death!....
","Haunted by his turbulent past, and having visions of people of whom he couldn't save, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa. <br/><br/>They are escaping a Citadel tyrannised by Immortan Joe, from whom something irreplaceable has been taken. <br/><br/>Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high- octane Road War that follows.....<br/><br/>To say that this film is an experience is a huge understatement. To describe the film is simple. It's a two hour chase movie where the runners stop for a break for about ten minutes and then hit the road again.......literally.<br/><br/>But to say its a Mad Max movie is a little bit of an overstatement, as here he plays second fiddle, passenger if you would to Imperator Furiosa. The films story belongs to her, but most of the narrative belongs to the titular character, but you will be so lost in Millers vision, your left so breathless to even care about politics.<br/><br/>It's not a reboot in any sense of the word, this fits somewhere between the original and The Road Warrior, and it has that absolutely crazy feel to it, just like you remember. <br/><br/>Furiosa and Max aside, I couldn't think of one character who didn't have their own particular trait, from physical disabilities (believe me, in some twisted way the film plays out like a viewable medical journal), to strange looks, and this goes for every single supporting characters, not one is, how you would say in a perfect world.........normal.<br/><br/>They are all odd in their own unique way, the way that you wouldn't feel safe around them.<br/><br/>As soon as the war rig takes a detour, the action never gives up, and there are times when it's so over the top, so visceral, it's a white knuckle ride, and there were times when I was going 'ooooo' like an old woman.<br/><br/>Cars are thrown around, people, more so, and Immortan Joe has his own mobile soundtrack, awe inspiring, laugh out loud funny and making this something else. Even when the truck stops for a second, the imagery in the background of the huge, angry convoy, still makes it feel urgent.<br/><br/>My only quibble is, when Furiosa reaches what she believes to be the green land, the movie grinds to a halt, so we can have a little bit of a summary of events, but it only feels like this because the action of the film is so relentless.<br/><br/>Hardy, man of few words, is brilliant as Max, and at times, you really feel like he is channeling Gibson with some of the looks he gives.<br/><br/>But it's Therons movie, her quest, and she makes the film become more dangerous to her characters, something believable in an otherwise bonkers world.<br/><br/>Miller is a genius, his Dali-esque vision is beautiful, and this will easily be the most memorable summer movie of recent years, and I feel, in years to come also.<br/><br/>What a Lovely day for movies<br/><br/>Michael Bay take note, this is how you make a good looking action movie."
"Wayne1138","4","6","16","20 May 2015"," Visually amazing. But a good Mad Max film??? I don't think so.......
","Well, after 30 years we finally get another Mad Max sequel after years of development hell and false starts.<br/><br/>Firstly the good: This film is visually incredible. Production kept the film as real as possible with the stunts, etc and you can see that every penny made it up there on screen. I saw this in IMAX 3D and was blown away by how it looked and towards the end, it has quite possibly the best 3D effect ever in a film. Yes it was cheesy, but it suited the film. The films characters (with the exception of Max, which I will come to in a minute) was brilliantly portrayed by an excellent cast which you would only get in a Mad Max film. Nicholas Hoult should get a special mention as should Hugh Keays-Byrne returning to the franchise after playing the Toecutter in the original 1979 film. He was quite frightening as Immortan Joe and had the appearance to go with it. The guy with the flame throwing guitar needs a special award as 'Most crazy awesome minor character in a movie'. However, this is where the films only strengths lie.<br/><br/>The bad: I'm sorry folks, but Tom Hardy is VERY overrated as an actor and he is quite possibly the worst one in this film. He is NOTHING like Mel Gibsons version of Max. I bet he only has a few lines of dialogue in this film and the film really shouldn't have been called Mad Max but Mad Furiosa, as the film seems to be all about Charlize Therons character. When Hardy did speak its as though he was trying to find a middle ground of him being Mel Gibson and being his own actor and it was very badly done. I really think that the films praise is exactly what happened with the movie 'Gravity', and although Mad Max is nowhere near as bad as that movie, I think its another classic case of people being in so much awe of whats on screen, they have completely forgotten if they are watching a good film or not?? To me, this film is NOT what Mad Max should be. With the original three movies there was something towards the end of each movie that sent Max over the edge which made him 'Mad'. But with this film he is just along for the ride and for this reason and the fact that Tom Hardy was awful as Max, I didn't like it. Yes I am a HUGE fan of the original three films and its obvious that we will NEVER get back the grittiness of the first two films which in my book are the action equivalent of Leones Spaghetti Westerns, especially in style. Also the music was just awful as well. I liked Junkie XL's music for 300: Rise of an Empire but god, I missed the brilliance of Brian Mays scores from the first two Mad Max films.<br/><br/>The above is why I don't get why this film is being praised so much?? I recently watched the original film for the first time on blu-ray. It looked and sounded amazing and I still love it today. Probably because the first film is more relevant for todays times than ever before. I really did try and go to watch Fury Road with a fresh mind, but as I have mentioned, this just wasn't Mad Max for me. Its just a damn shame that George Miller didn't get to make this film 15 years ago with Mel Gibson. Sets were built, everything was a go, then the damn Iraq War started and everything got shut down.<br/><br/>Just a thought why the series hasn't been as good since the second one?? Its obvious that the 'glue' that made the first two so special was obviously down to Byron Kennedy who produced the first two and sadly died while location scouting for the third film. Just like the Star Wars films, it was the same when Gary Kurtz left, the films have not been the same since. Although the director is responsible for the actual end product, its obvious that lots of help and ideas comes from the producer. Its a shame really.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is already talk of another Mad Max sequel and I hope it goes back to basics next time and not the overblown and overpraised movie that is Fury Road. 5/10 and that was pretty much for the visuals."
"blakiepeterson","10","6","16","17 May 2015"," The Best Action Movie of the Decade
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the action movie I've been waiting to see in my five years of film reviewing. I haven't been waiting around in agony like a Southern belle longing for her Rhett Butler — I have, instead, been continuously leaving the theaters of various actioners pleasantly charmed. But thrills, yes, thrills, have been kept at a minimum. Sure, it's fun to see CGI, likable actors, and bombastic set pieces mix it up with the delirium of a succulent martini. Yet, these days, action movies seem serviceable, great for two hours but not for much else. They don't stick with you: you end up ranking their greatness in the scheme of other films in their franchise. Immediately after ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" last year, for instance, my sister and I spent most of the ride home arguing about whether it was better than the original ""Avengers"", hardly talking about what we liked about it, what made it such a success.<br/><br/>The minute I grabbed a seat for ""Fury Road"" last night, I didn't know what to expect. The first three ""Mad Max"" movies, ending thirty years ago with the imaginative ""Beyond Thunderdome"", were cynical explosions of dystopian disaster, where the mindset is kill or be killed and the lead character, the titular Max, isn't so much a hero as he is a wounded guy trying to survive. The ""Mad Max"" movies are so seminal because the action is so unforced: the remaining population is so willing to slaughter for the final drops of gasoline to propel their decked out vehicles that the films may as well be called Mad Max vs. The World. No one is ever, ever safe. You can count on Max to survive, but you can't bet that the world will be a better place after he fends off his latest opponent. Fiery and desolate, the balmy lands of the post-apocalyptic future are never much of a haven. Max isn't a hero, rather a man who can work a gun and a car and who seems to constantly be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>""Fury Road"" has been called a reboot of the original franchise, but reboot seems too plain a word. Reboot suggests laziness, a ""RoboCop"" no one's in the mood for. With the same director at the helm, George Miller, ""Fury Road"" is a reawakening, a rollicking continuation, and a startling return to form. Certainly, it is the most brutal of all the ""Mad Max"" films, not for the screeching sissies of the population. But it is also among the finest action movies in the history of cinema. We have been able to stomach superheroes smashing goons into the buildings of New York City, probably killing hundreds of civilians in the process, for so long — here, consequences are really consequences. The characters are vulnerable, however heroic or villainous they may be, and the action sequences produce just as much of a thrill as they do a shudder. For once, something humane in us lights when someone gets crushed by a mountainous vehicle.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson, portrays Max Rockatansky, a loner deep in the Australian outback attempting to hide from the dangers of the recent collapse of civilization. Only a few minutes into ""Fury Road"" is he kidnapped by the War Boys, the henchman of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who leads and controls a strenuous territory with a massive water source. The War Boys are essentially half-dead young men — Max, in response, is provided as a ""blood bag"" for the sickly Nux (Nicholas Hoult). <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), an ally of Joe, takes off on her war rig to collect gasoline from a nearby pipeline. But after driving off road, it becomes clear that she has something else in mind: she has brought Joe's five wives along with her, who act as his means of breeding. So a chase ensues, the nefarious foes close behind. Max and Furiosa finally meet when Nux catches up to the rig — and a partnership is formed. Left is a series of car stunts, tour de force performances, imaginative cinematography, and a feel-up of a dystopian society refreshing among a sea of ones filled with sexy teens and Hunger Games.<br/><br/>The aesthetic of ""Fury Road"" is something of a punky, raging pulp novel: cars are covered in metal spikes, guns are an extension of the arms of the characters. Night scenes are drowned in a cerulean blue, the days a ferocious orange; bullets, eye patches, and skulls aren't simply decor — they're part of the landscape, as natural as the air, as the dirt. Even part of Joe's entourage is an electric guitar player, who strums whenever sh*t is about to go down. These touches may be laughed at by some, but as a part of Miller's vision, they're something of a wonder.<br/><br/>And while the film may include the name Mad Max in its title, Furiosa is the hero of ""Fury Road"", and the female action hero we've all been waiting for. Long gone are the busty Black Widows and Lara Crofts: with her metallic placeholder for an arm, oil warpaint, bald head as a stab at gender reversal, she is an embodiment of zeroed in anger. Theron's performance is, by turns, explosive and vulnerable. You won't be forgetting Furiosa any time soon.<br/><br/>You can disagree with me all you want, but ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the best action movie of the decade. Before you completely write this statement off the map, though, consider this: what was the last action movie that really surprised you, really slapped you around and didn't ask if you wanted to take a five minute smoke break? This is visionary filmmaking, action or otherwise."
"tlooknbill","10","6","16","19 May 2015"," I Came away exhausted, mesmerized & thoroughly entertained. What did I just see?!
","I was dropped jawed throughout the entire movie. WHAT A RIDE! Gorgeous, incredible and original looking visual effects and set, costume and vehicle design. The car & motorcycle chase scenes & stunts were paced and timed perfectly so I could see all the detail. IOW no frenetic, jarring quick cuts that left me asking what just happened. Where did that come from? I missed something! It all made sense as if I was watching it live.<br/><br/>Special effects has really improved in the last 5 years. It's all very realistic and seamless. ""Prometheus"",""Gravity"",""Mad Max"" & ""Ex Machina"" are now four that's left me scratching my head in amazement. Usually in the past I could see signs of off looking CGI but now I can't tell fake from real. Where are they teaching people how to make this stuff? Only complaint is Mad Max was ear bleedingly loud. I actually felt I was getting nauseous just from the high energy intensity of the visuals and sound. Or maybe I'm just getting too old for these types of movies. I felt I lost some weight watching it."
"hellraiser7","10","6","16","18 May 2015"," The Mad and the Furious
","This is one of my personal favorite films. I'm actually a fan of the Mad Max films, I really liked the first one, second one ""The Road Warrior"" was even better and is also a personal favorite film of mine. It was a long wait for this film like reaching the destination of any long road trip it was well worth the trip.<br/><br/>I really like the look of the post apocalyptic world which I feel just like with ""The Road Warrior"" is in a wider scope, it's dark and yet fascinating at the same time. Despite the lack of certain technologies they at least have some technology that works but of course the most valued are the automobiles which is to me what makes the post apocalyptic world fascinating because it's a automobile subculture taken to the extreme.<br/><br/>It also really looks like the Mad/insane have truly taken over the earth. And it seems like Max and Furiosa along with others are literally almost the last sane people on Earth. Which really creates that isolation feeling.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult as Nux I though was a fun character and actually has a really solid character arc. He's crazy and yet he's actually really smart which makes him useful to the crew.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is excellent as Max Rochatansky, I really love the voice which is kinda rough and gravelly tone. Max is well still Max, it's true he doesn't say much in the film but Max wasn't known much for talk anyway because he's a man of action. And I like that as usual he's reluctant to do the right thing but he does it anyway because of how driven he is by his conscious and lets face it what else is he going to do.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron was just fantastic as Imperator Furiosa. She's one on my favorite fictional feme fatales up there with Betrix Kiddo (Kill Bill), Ripley (Aliens) and others on my list (I said my list) and literally steals the show. Her character is just true to her name as she is just driven by fury and is just hellbent to her task willing to mow down anyone that gets in her way. I love that she can kick some serious ass and takes crap from no one, she literally almost beats Max in a one on one fisticuff fight which I always find cool seeing a supporting protagonist beating or coming close to beating the main one which I don't see enough of.<br/><br/>Both Max and her have an excellent back and forth, in a way it's sort of the first time Max had a go two person that was a match for him and Furiosa is more that one for him. Both in a way are almost the same in a way as both have been robbed of their family and are mad at the gangs, the world and themselves.<br/><br/>I like that with all three characters they have something in common all three want redemption. For Max in his mind he failed to protect his wife and child from the scum in this world. Nux wants to be a hero but has been playing for the wrong team. Furiosa was practically kidnapped and forced to be one of Joe's solders. This one task in transporting the slave girls to salvation is to them is the thing they need the mos to make some difference in the mad world, and of course what their doing amounts to making a big difference.<br/><br/>The villain I thought was solid, fun and memorable, Immortan Joe played by Hugh Keys Bryne whom played the main villain in the first film. Which is really cool because in a way it makes things come full circle. I really like the look of him, he really looks like Sweet Tooth from the ""Twisted Metal"" video games. I really like the voice which is menacing and you can tell from his mannerism he is completely crazy and nasty from the inside out, which is just all the more motive for all three protagonists to get away from him.<br/><br/>But like with most of the Mad Max films we're all really in it for the action and automobiles and both have plenty of gas and speed to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>The automobiles are also the stars of the film and their terrific. I really love the designs of each of the automobiles which all look like they could be on the roster list in the ""Twisted Metal"" video game franchise. Each of them are uniquely colorful, dangerous and crazy looking. From one vehicle that is a mobile rock concert where there are enough amps to make anyone go deaf and there is some crazy mummy guy playing a guitar that also doubles for a flame thrower. Another with a crazy amount of spikes front to back, it's practically a mobile porcupine. <br/><br/>The action is just fantastic, the stunt work and chirography in fight but also automotive driving is spot on. And it's over the top violence which makes it even better where automobiles are just exploding left and right, bodies and body parts are just flying, heads are getting blown off, and so forth.<br/><br/>I really love the fact that this film is kinda one big chase movie which is great because it makes the film simplistic no boring bull crap, the pacing in this film is just constantly going almost like in the film ""Speed"" where you hardly have time to take a breath. One of the action sequences I really liked was seeing Max just jump on one rival vehicle after another and just beating the crap or killing any of baddies manning them, it just sort of remind me of Swashbulckling action.<br/><br/>Well I've said enough, Max is back and still has plenty of millage for fun.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

This movie is going to be a classic that I will buy and keep for a long time. See this movie as soon as possible."
"YoungCriticMovies","9","6","16","18 May 2015"," Furiously Majestic: George Miller Reboots the Series with A Beautifully Entertaining Film
","Here's a question: can an action film ever be considered art? Usually with big blockbusters such as Avengers or the Fast and Furious series, explosions are paired up with corny dialogue. Never do we see a film that treats this genre with respect and is willing to take risks. The last time such a movie, of the action/blockbuster genre, was able to achieve such balance and quality was probably with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises. But we have another savior, in the shape of mastermind George Miller; his latest installment in the Mad Max series: Mad Max: Fury Road, might compete to be one of the best films of the series, and I will be bold enough to say that it is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road achieves such a high caliber due to the incredible simplicity of its plot and the lack of unnecessary sub plots featured in today's action flicks. Fury Road avoids telling the entire backstory of our main character Max (Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson), and simply jumps straight into the action with Max being captured and held prisoner. We are in post apocalyptic Australia (although the film was filmed in Namibia due to the very rainy season that Australia had). In the original Mad Max films of the early 80s, the main concern then was a nuclear apocalypse, while this film sticks more or less to that apocalyptic theme, one can't help but look at the dry landscapes and relate them to the climate change epidemic we are facing. With Max prisoner to an oppressive leader of survivors named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), we move on to the story of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who ends up being the true main character of this story. Furiosa is a loyal and celebrated commander of Immortan Joe's army of War Boys. However, as the story opens we see Furiosa betray Immortan Joe and steal his personal Breeders (women slaves used to feed and reproduce the survivor population). A chase ensues and Max, being used as a blood bag, for an ill soldier named Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is taken along for the ride.<br/><br/>What is most impressive about this film is that the majority of special effects used for the explosions and flying cars were not CGI (according to IMBb 80% of the special effects were live stunts). I think the risk alone of that by the actors is enough to earn my respect. However, the explosions themselves were panned to look beautiful; this paired with the either heavy metal soundtrack or Verdi makes most of the fight scenes feel majestic.<br/><br/>George Miller is an aged director (70); he's made various great films including the original Mad Max trilogy, and the more family friendly Babe and Happy Feet. What is most striking about Fury Road is the lack of dialogue. Apparently Miller had composed the film using storyboards first, it was only after that that a screenplay was written. And I think it's the fact that Miller created the story visually first that makes this become a precise spectacle. <br/><br/>This lack of dialogue also allows our actors to display the frantic paranoia that verges on insanity. The performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing, but the true surprise here is Nicholas Hoult. Hoult is probably better known for his role as Beast in the new installments of the X-Men franchise; in Mad Max he plays a crazed War Boy who has Max as his prisoner and blood bag. Hoult portrays his character with a restricted insanity so that he seems scary enough, but one does pity him. Tom Hardy plays Max with more grunts than dialogue, and when he does speak he uses a voice that recalls his role as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. However, after such scarring moments of his past one cannot blame Max's character for having gone well, mad. So in that aspect, Hardy does a good job in handling the role. As for Charlize Theron, she plays Furiosa with a composed viciousness; since she is not objectified in this film as the attractive female that she is, she was able to show the range of her acting chops with more ease. In fact the majority of the second half of the film was filled with a womanpower that was appreciated and, in the apocalyptic setting, didn't seem forced at all. It was only in some points that the actors felt a little lost amongst the chaos so that some character development doesn't end up being too realistic.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Fury Road is the perfect reboot/sequel to the Mad Max trilogy. The beautifully created action sequences along with and explosive pace are enough to make one feel goosebumps. George Miller you've done it again."

"deepak-zeest","10","6","16","17 May 2015"," Watch 'Mad Max : Fury Road' because it is pointing its fingers towards you and screaming, ""Witness Me!"" 5/5
","So, here was another weekend, and as is the norm, a movie in the theaters was on the cards. I and my friends were all eager for 'Piku' as the word of mouth was on a roll.<br/><br/>But sometimes, things don't happen the way it should – as goes the rule of the Fury Road. I randomly checked for other movies which were on the show this weekend, and was excited by the ratings of Mad Max's Fourth instalment. With a staggering 99% Rotten Tomatoes, 89% Metacritic and 8.9 IMDb rating, I just drifted towards this mad ride of contemporary cinema. And oh what a ride it was!<br/><br/>Having never watched any Mad Max instalment before, I had no idea what to expect from the movie. But then, less expectations, more fun!<br/><br/>The movie is based on a post-apocalyptic world, and adding any more description to it would be an injustice towards the people who are yet to watch it. It's a one of a kind movie and describing the movie would be like ripping the heart out of it's charisma. I mean, we must have watched movies of different genres and different scenarios and different presentations, but one could rarely fathom a movie which goes beyond those classifications. This movie redefines every adjective which we have ever used for describing a movie. It is pure ingenious cinematic brilliance.<br/><br/>This movie sucks you in its world and makes you undergo such surrealism that you are on the edge of your seat throughout its ride. It is not only the madness which gets to you, it is the ultra- skewed world, the premise, the machines, and the inherent humour in the face of doom which gets instilled in your veins as if you are the part of that world. Such is the intensity of the cinema that you'd want to jump in the road of fury- as binding as it gets towards a true movie- watching experience and a cinematic marvel.<br/><br/>I learnt about the Mad Max franchise from Wikipedia and I was more than overwhelmed to know that the first Mad Max movie broke all the records of the Box-Office in Australia (it is an Australian franchise), and held the Guinness record for most profitable film for decades. The other two sequels have also had great runs, and by the look of it, the fourth one is seemingly going to topple the previous films' earnings. George Miller, the director of the franchise must really be a man from another world.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for its surreal setting which seems from another planet/world, its thrilling and spell-binding action sequences, its war-machines, the special effects, and exclusively for the madness, the humour and the innate meaning it carries for the dwellers of the real world. The last time I was this overwhelmed by a movie, its name was 'Interstellar'. Watch 'Mad Max : Fury Road' because it is pointing its fingers towards you and screaming, ""Witness Me!"".<br/><br/>For the sheer cinematic experience : 5/5"
"dunnypop","10","6","16","17 May 2015"," Crazy, Fun, Inventive, Beautiful...
","Crazy, Fun, Inventive Beautiful and most of all CRAZY!?!!<br/><br/>I've been a Mad Max fan growing up, I must have seen Road Warrior countless times and when I heard they were doing a remake/sequel without Mel Gibson I was skeptical. Then again it was George Miller, so perhaps there would be potential. The Mad Max series has progressed more and more with ideas and visions of how an apocalyptic society would be, and Fury Road had a far larger budget than the previous films. <br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning and the car stunts are something I haven't seen. I'd compare the car stunts to the Raid 1 & 2, they are creative, over the top, and some scenes are very extreme. The acting is top notch as Fury Road has Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. There's a sense of sadness through those characters. Also the other characters you get a small glimpse of the chaotic nature of this not so distant apocalyptic future."
"StevePulaski","9","6","16","17 May 2015"," What a lovely revival
","After allowing it to lie dormant for nearly three decades, George Miller reboots his beloved ""Mad Max"" franchise in a manner that, I believe, very few saw coming. While it's the season for raucous, summer blockbusters that require little thought and provide for passing entertainment, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" changes course for the series and the idea of a blockbuster. This is an exhilarating, but uncommonly brutal, display of some of cinema's most kinetic and coherent actions sequences of the last decade, sewn together with everything from grotesque characters and characters that tread the line of being impressionistic.<br/><br/>For the first time, the titular character isn't played by Mel Gibson, but instead, Tom Hardy, who provides a large amount of subtlety. In addition, I'd say that he also has about two full pages worth of dialog in a one-hundred and twenty minute film. He is less a character and more a brushstroke representation of an action hero, even moreso than in the last three films. Taking place, yet again, in a distant future where societal order has collapsed, Max is kidnapped early in the film by a gang known as the War Boys, led by the ruthless King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), to be used as a blood donor. Meanwhile, a woman known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who was assigned to use an enormous, armored truck to collect gasoline, the most sought after commodity in the community, is driving off course with all five of King Joe's wives, all of whom meant for breeding. Max winds up escaping and hitching a ride with Furiosa, resulting in a long chase throughout the entire desert.<br/><br/>There is a simple moral of personal redemption in ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" and it's a moral that keeps the film from being entirely empty. However, it's not tacked on or exploited in a way that feels heavy-handed. This is one of the many tricky dances ""Fury Road"" manages to pull off and do so very well. It's also a film of details, with screenwriters Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nico Lathouris essentially playing around on the large, spacious canvas of the desert, seeing where they can go and what they can do in order to create a film entirely focused on creating tension and breakneck action. Consider little inclusions like a deformed character who rides on an enormous truck, shredding on an electric guitar with dozens of loud speakers behind him. It doesn't add much to the story, but it provides for some incredible sounds throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The film also bears the best cinematography and visual effects so far this year. The desert has scarcely looked more attractive in all its sun-soaked glory, and cinematographer John Seale gets some of the best, most vivid shots of it throughout the entire film. Consider the scene when Furiosa collapses to her knees in the desert, as the sand and the sun are shown as limitless representations of time and space and stray sand grains softly glide on top of more compact sand, effectively creating what looks like a mirage. Or even consider the longshots that show the intense scenes of the War Boys catching up to Furiosa's truck. All of these beautiful inclusions and more are thanks to an extraordinarily talented visual effects and cinematography team.<br/><br/>Finally, we have the action, which makes up about ninety-five minutes of the entire film, and for the first time, I'm not complaining. For one, the action in the film is captured clearly and vividly. Miller never loses us in the camaraderie; everything is so visually pristine and clear that there's never a lost sense of suspense because the camera-work is shoddy or the editing failed to do the scene justice. Editor Margaret Sixel really shows her talents in the beginning of the film, a briskly paced opening sequence involving Max, who is haunted by past memories, desperately trying to outrun the War Boys whilst being burdened by visions of his past encounters. These kinds of scenes are haunting, and add a layer to what would otherwise be standard situations in action films. However, the action is captured so crisply that it's impossible to ignore the sheer magnitude of talent on display here.<br/><br/>For me, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an early candidate for the most surprising film of the year and favorite summer blockbuster. This is a film that pulsates with life and energy, taking one exhilarating, cacophonous circumstance after another and bathing it in road rage, gasoline, and unbridled chaos. Its immaculate portrayal of madness almost works to call out other big-budget films that have skimped on their own visual clarity, proving great results can be achieved if time is taken to do such great work. It appears that during his time away from the franchise, Miller reflected on where he wanted to take it, and what results is a fully realized film that struts with confidence and swagger. The film proves a lot of things about action films, but most importantly, also proves you can have a franchise lie dormant for years and, if seriously handled and given to the original creator, there is still potential for a spectacular comeback."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","10","6","16","17 May 2015"," A forceful decisive and entertaining action packed journey like no other, PERFECTION
","A visceral and awe-inspiring masterpiece of Odyssean proportions.<br/><br/>George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is a culmination of over thirty years worth of a vivid creative vision into a magnificent, spectacular and awe-inspiring masterpiece. Not since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight have we left the theater exclaiming ""I want to watch it again!""<br/><br/>From the same lucid and resplendent apocalyptic wasteland as Miller's 1979 Mad Max – the landscape of Fury Road is a palpable physical manifestation of a world eviscerated by war. The barren desert lays way to a humanity re-built from that arid destruction as it battles to survive. Fury Road's story is wholly original and separate from the plots of its predecessors but deserved at their sides. Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron),and their encountered perils searching for salvation. A search in a desert wilderness where savagery stems from the vestiges of primal necessity.<br/><br/>Upon opening on the first photographically framed scene, Mad Max: Fury Road dramatically propels forward at an increasingly accelerating velocity, knocking audience members forcefully into the backs of their plush cinema seats. An onslaught of decisive and visceral action displays the narrative at hand with purposeful glory.<br/><br/>This ability to derive story from action is proof of Mad Max residing at the pinnacle of great storytelling. From our heroes and their beastly rides to the extras with a lifespan of a few seconds, each character was immensely textured and filled with intriguing detail. Fury Road naturally and effortlessly creates compelling characters and a complex alternative world, all the while taking the audience on a truly immersive ride. We wouldn't be surprised to see George Miller's Fury Road studied for years to come in film lectures and art schools.<br/><br/>For those who have no interest in seeing the film, we at least dare you to go for Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Abbey Lee, Zoë Kravitz, Courtney Eaton or Riley Keough. Not that these mavens are exploited for their beauty, just whatever it takes to get you in a seat and watching this film. So that you too can experience the pleasant event of having your face melted by its twisted metal glory.<br/><br/>At the end of the two hour saga, with pounding symphonic score to match, audience members are left rejuvenated and euphoric from the after glow of a truly mind-blowing experience. This is what film making and film viewing is supposed to be; this is the massive ability of the cinema. George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road will go down in history as one of the most effective film experiences of all time. My sympathy goes to the aspiring directors whose projects must follow this epic cinematic accomplishment.<br/><br/>(Update) Pro Tip - Don't watch the film in 3D. Our second viewing was in this capacity and it completely cheapens the action and makes it feel rife with CGI, when it is not.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases"

","After a 30 year gap, George Miller at last returns to his road-warrior franchise set in a dystopian future, this time starring Tom Hardy in the title role. However, the film is misnamed – his partner in mayhem, Imperator Furiosa, superbly played by Charlize Theron, provides all the motivation and purpose for the (thin) plot and story. Max, unwillingly at first, is just along for the ride. The ride in question though, is a thrill-a-minute chase across arid desert and rocky canyons infested with all kinds of post-apocalyptic low-lifes intent on stopping or capturing Furiosa's fortified articulated lorry – the War-rig.<br/><br/>Furiosa is a driver for the local warlord, a horrendous character named Immortan Joe who seems to have fathered an entire race of warriors and uses them, along with his control of the water supply, to enforce his will on the ragged and desperate population. Joe has five favourite concubines he uses as breeding stock and Furiosa's mission is for her to return to her childhood home and save Joe's women at the same time. Naturally, Joe is reluctant to part with his harem and so pursues his erstwhile employee which provides a frame on which to hang two hours of hugely enjoyable chaos which often makes little sense but never fails to entertain and amuse.<br/><br/>Miller must have enjoyed the advent of CGI, it enables this film to be what the first three films never could be, although, to be fair, the CGI is used sparingly and heavy reliance is placed on daring and dangerous stunts. If there was an Oscar for stuntmen this film would be right up there! The cinematography is stupendous and set and costume design are sumptuous and convincing.<br/><br/>This film may only attract technical awards by the Academy, but believe me it's an evening's entertainment not to be missed.<br/><br/>The only real criticism I have is that the character of Max is not developed in any real way, save for the flashbacks he gets at critical and often inconvenient moments. Max has very little dialogue and very little emotional input to the film. Hardy does very well with what he was given but I hope that the next film has him open Max up a bit more in some ways.<br/><br/>Welcome back Max! 9 out of 10."
"RealHumanBean","10","5","13","26 May 2015"," The Best Action Movie of the Decade
","After three decades, Mad Max returns to cinemas. I had high hopes for the fourth installment (to my knowledge confirmed as a midquel between Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome) and the return of George Miller's direction gave me hope, even without Based Mel. That is why I am happy to report that Fury Road wholly delivered. It is not as good as Road Warrior, but hey, being 2nd best ain't too bad.<br/><br/>I'll start with the obvious. Tom Hardy is great as Max and is worthy as a successor to Based Mel. His Max carries all the nuances Mel carried and while not as dynamic as Mel Hardy still keeps his stoic demeanor flawlessly through the film. A newcomer in the series is Charlize Theron as the warrior Imperator Furiosa. She's totally badass, even more so then The Amazonian in Road Warrior. She may be one of the coolest female badasses I've seen.<br/><br/>Speaking of these two, what makes Fury Road work as an action movie is how fragile Max and Furiosa are. The peril is real as is the threat of them dying. It is easy to root for them and feels great to see them succeed. However, it is just as easy to root for the villains. They're so delightfully insane that it's just pure jot to see them on screen. One dude has a powdered wig made of bullets and sits in a chair mounted to a car. Another dude is eyeless and rides on top of a car playing a flaming electric guitar for a majority of the film. The villain of the film, Immortan Joe, while not nearly as good as Lord Humungus from Road Warrior, is still pretty cool and his design is one of the best villain designs I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>The guy who steals the show is Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. He is so insane it is awesome, and his character arc throughout the film is strong, poignant, and genuine. Goofy like the Gyro Captain, but also a tragically well written character, Nux serves as the most memorable side character. Good thing he has lots of screen time. The War Boys in general may easily be the best and most fun group of baddies I've ever seen in a movie. On the downside, the sex slaves Immortan Joe is chasing aren't memorable and are just kinda there and some of their dialogue is confusing. They're walking talking MacGuffins, but what else could they be?<br/><br/>The thing to be most commended is the action. Fury Road starts fast and never lets up. It is basically one long action scene, but the action is so visceral, intense, genuine, and mad that it never gets old or tiring. This is without a doubt the best and most fun blockbuster action I have seen in a theater in quite some time. The direction is pitch perfect and the editing is high octane. The sound also perfectly accompanies the direction in bringing these sweeping car fights to life. The sound effects are perfect and the score, ranging from classical or booming orchestral, compliments each scene.<br/><br/>The plot is-oh come on who watches Mad Max for the plot? There's a truck. In it are sex slaves a tyrant wants. Max gets tangled. Drive away from the tyrant or die trying. That is Fury Road. It serves its purpose and echoes a typical Mad Max plot and serving as a segway into the mind blowing action scenes. For all its runtime the movie is entertaining as Hell while also being masterfully crafted.<br/><br/>In short, this is the Mad Max movie George Miller dreamed of making. As a Mad Max film, it succeeds in leaps and bounds. It is one of the most intense and thrilling action movies I've ever seen and rights all the wrongs commercialized blockbuster have inflicted. Nostalgic without ever feeling rehashed, this trip down Fury Road is one Hell of a ride that should not be missed. Please, I urge you to go see this film if you are A) A Mad Max fan B) An action movie fan C) One who actually cares about great quality high budget movies not about rehashed superheroes or toy lines.<br/><br/>Don't let this suffer the same fate as Dredd. Help the return of the violent R rated testosterone high action movie succeed."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","10","5","13","24 May 2015"," George Miller is a mastermind
","Last night's viewing of the latest Mad Max installment has left me and the entire cinema in awe. I was never a huge fan of the Mad Max movies so when I heard about another installment I was not too thrilled but I decided to give it a shot. The first impressions and reviews that I heard from Cannes got my hopes up, and the IMDb reviews got them even higher. From the opening sequence I new that something wild and crazy was at hand. <br/><br/>1) The story. Unlike the last three movies, this one has a story that actually makes sense and has a beginning and an end. It is not something spectacular or groundbreaking as Inception or Interstellar but it functions perfectly. Simple and understandable without any difficult explanations or twists, ending with a sequence that can only be explained as an adrenaline injection into the spine.<br/><br/>2) The acting. Since the movies stars are Hardy and Theron much was expected. I believe that Hardy was the best possible choice for Max and he did a good job. The cold, crazy, mad performance he gave made me feel like I was watching a wild animal in a cage trying to escape. This perfectly intervenes with the script and the dynamic of the movie. His madness and barely controllable rage follows the story so perfectly it is hard to believe that any take was made during filming. Fluent and uninterrupted, without a single break of character Hardy is Mad Max. But, even though it takes a whole lot of heart to say this, Therone gave the best performance in the movie. Her acting is something so perfect and flawless it is hard to believe she has only one Oscar. Her character and her portrayal was extremely vivid and lifelike. She was the only character that I believed was a real life person and not a comic-book-style-version of a real life person in an post- apocalyptic world. Combined, Hardy and Theron took the movie to a whole new level, a level the previous versions never even came close to. <br/><br/>3) The atmosphere. By far the best element of the movie. The post-apocalyptic feel was present from the first sequence to the last. One could almost feel, taste and smell the dirty and disease infested wasteland of a world the story takes place in. The colors and combinations of colors present in the movie gave it an even more relevant feel. The drastic change of color picturing night and day was as beautiful as terrifying. But the thing that makes this mad movie even crazier is the paste. Perfect timing, perfect duration of the sequences, the editing was the best I have seen in an action movie in the last 20 years. <br/><br/>All in all, this visual masterpiece is George Millers triumph and best movie by far. It is brutal, ugly, dirty, it holds no connection to reality whatsoever, and that is exactly why it is so brilliant. It is a movie that must be seen over and over again. At this point Mad Max Fury road is the best movie of the year, the best Mad Max movie, and one of the best, if not the best action movie in the last decade!"

","If you're reading this, you should stop right now and go see Mad Max: Fury Road...and if you've already seen it, go ahead and see it again. Sure, there isn't much for character development or much by way of story, at least not the conventional variety that movies usually contain...but it was still there, just a bit differently conveyed and with a strange sort of (I'm loathe to use the word in reference to this movie, simply because it sounds absurd)...subtlety. The plot is propelled in a very visceral way, with the explosive momentum of the action itself as the vessel...and good lord was that intense.<br/><br/>This movie took the tension and action from Max Max, The Road Warrior, and Beyond Thunderdome, rolled it all into one beautifully executed package, and made it far more epic than the previous films could have been. This was the movie I spent more than a decade waiting on, from the first time George Miller began discussing his plans for Fury Road (only to have it put on what appeared, at the time, to be a permanent hiatus), and it was worth the wait. As much as I wanted to see Mel Gibson reprise his role, Tom Hardy handled it with the sort of professional capability that made it easy to deal with while experiencing the final product. Hell, there were even scenes where he was almost indistinguishable in the role from Road Warrior era Gibson. Charlize Theron was fantastic in what amounted to the leading role of the movie, but Theron being great comes as no surprise to anyone, I would imagine. She always is. Of course, we can't forget the absolute perfection of continuing the Farscape correlation, at least those of us who were fans of Farscape. Melissa Jaffer (who played Utu-Noranti Pralatong) plays Keeper of the Seeds in Fury Road just as Virginia Hey (who played Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan) portrayed ""Warrior Woman"" in The Road Warrior.<br/><br/>And then there's also the fact that Hugh Keays-Byrne (who played Toecutter in Mad Max) once again portrayed Max's major antagonist by portraying Immortan Joe in Fury Road.<br/><br/>Little things like that really do make me happy.<br/><br/>I'm not going to deny that there are probably numerous flaws with the movie beyond the miniscule ones that I noticed, but I couldn't conceivably care less...the whole was strong enough to compensate for any shortcomings in the components. Admittedly, I'm a Mad Max fanboy. I'm one of those people who sincerely feels that original trilogy of films stands just as strong as movies like The Terminator, and the other movies from the same time period that are considered to be classics by many. My opinion is, of course, a bit biased in that respect...but not that biased.<br/><br/>It was fun, it was intense, it was jaw-droppingly spectacular where the effects were concerned, the cinematography was actually beautiful in a lot of respects, the acting was solid and consistent throughout, and Miller's directing was superb. This one is worth seeing on the big screen, as many times as you can manage it, in 3D if you can manage it (it takes advantage of the 3D better than a lot of movies do).<br/><br/>So, get going!"
"wpedmonson","10","5","13","19 May 2015"," All in all, the movie is a fun ride, a tense one, and it delivers.
","I couldn't help but think of St. John Paul II's description of the culture of death, and how it kills a civilization either slowly or very quickly. Peter Kreeft, following on this line, said the the Third Reich was supposed to last a thousand years but only held for over a decade simply because it chose to build itself through killing its own. A similar note rings throughout Mad Max: Fury Road as we are presented with a story of humanity at a crossroads in figuring out how to rebuild itself after a profound era of destruction. <br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a group of women who escape a Viking-like primitive civilization in search for freedom from slavery as prizes for a select group of men in her culture. Civilization as we know it now has dramatically fallen and gangs of primitive tribes form around a culture of gasoline and cars, manipulating them and extracting all their worth as their dependence on it will eventually fade. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads a group of harem-like women out of their desert city as Max (Tom Hardy) gets reluctantly drug into their escape, merging goals of finding a way out to freedom. <br/><br/>The relationship of men and women, one that's crucial to the survival of a civilization, is at the core of ""Mad Max: Fury Road."" What the movie presents are two extremes of the sexes in relation to each other, one given a very bad depiction in its harsh expression (and rightfully so), and the other in a more subtle though inevitable retreat into nothingness. The city Furiosa and Max escape from is nothing more than a slave state with a despot that controls his people through water distribution. He chooses a group of women to be his harem and that's that. Later in the film we're presented with a rival tribe composed of only women and hostile to all men that come their way (they're even laying bait and hunting them). This too, will not sustain a civilization. The obvious necessity for any civilization to thrive is a way to produce stable homes for children, and a culture that threatens that (and there are plenty of ways that that can be threatened) will destroy itself, especially if it rejects this necessity. <br/><br/>The two main characters, Max and Furiosa, are a microcosm of this tension between the sexes, grappling for power but working together toward the same goal, freedom from a destructive society, both struggling with the negative tendencies of their sex. <br/><br/>There are few movies that I've felt such anxiety over the pursuit of an evil and terrible gang of villains, seeing what they do to those who oppose them. The terror they're threatening throughout the movie is almost debilitating, and thankfully there are a few moments where we have respite from it. A parallel exists today in ISIS, which I couldn't help but think of throughout the movie. It's a terrorist society built on religious extremism and is notorious for brutality toward women and their enemies, and unapologetically so. The depiction of these gangs roaming and destroying what they wish is likely similar to what's being done by ISIS in our time, which puts a weight on other societies to act on it in some way. <br/><br/>Religion itself in the movie is given a lot of screen time, and in very interesting ways. The religion of Furiosa's society mimics the pagan religion of the Germanic tribes of ancient northern Europe with references to Valhalla, and their warrior emphasis. Men are brought up from birth as soldiers, and the society is built around war and plundering. Characters in the movie routinely pray (some to an unknown god) and reference the afterlife, which in a sense is a welcome addition to the film, giving characters in the movie a more interesting arc and drive. Some will interpret this as a vestige of primitive societies that more ""advanced"" ones will grow out of (and there is certainly the existence of childish religions), however it's not clear that the filmmakers are saying that. <br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, Max is portrayed as a selfish and very distant renegade, all the while carrying hallucinations from a past trauma. In this, I welcome an actual ""madness"" to Mad Max, something I was always wondering about the older movies. Max just seemed like a tough guy, nothing really mad (meaning crazy) about him in the older films. This movie takes it more literally in the sense that he's suffering from a psychological ailment throughout the movie, and it comes up repeatedly. This adds an interesting handicap to Max, and a more visible struggle he's working through as he escapes the tribe trying to kill him. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a fun ride, a tense one, and it delivers. Other reviewers have called it a much-needed shift for action movies in our time, especially as the Fast and Furious style films run their course. This movie carries with it a feel of mythology and universality, something any Jason Statham movie probably couldn't convey as well. As I write this, news of more Mad Max movies are on the way, and I hope they hold this theme of civilization building, stripping it down to its chrome shell and seeing how long it will run on a certain frame. <br/><br/>This movie does not contain any explicit nudity or foul language, though the violence is intense and gory."
"RevRonster","10","5","13","19 May 2015"," This set the bar high for the films of 2015 and action films in general!
","Unless you identify yourself as a Men's Rights Activist and really hate strong female characters, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" might be the best movie of the summer.<br/><br/>The story for this one has the spirit of the other Mad Max films, the characters are terrifically written and performed, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are particularly awesome in the film and Theron pretty much steals the show as Furiosa, it was cool to see the actor who played Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) in the first film return and play a new, equally insane character, the action is almost too much to handle and those with weak hearts might go into cardiac arrest from it all (but appreciate it because the action is so awesome) and the over-the-tops elements not only feel at home with the Mad Max franchise but help make it wickedly entertaining and, at times, amusing.<br/><br/>Aside from the spectacular action, one of my favorite aspects of the film was how strong the female characters are. None of them come off as weak or set dressings or as damsels in distress. This movie, thanks to the help of George Miller getting Eve Ensler to consult on the characters, isn't compiling with the outdated notion that action films have to be all about gruff, growling men who seem to never shave but actually trim their 5 o'clock shadow. It stinks that this has to be a highlight when, in reality, it should just be expected but it was so refreshing to see an action film with women who just come off as tough and you never have to question why they are that way.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved this film and have no complaints about it. The movie proved that sequels—even done years later—can work and it proved the old, completely outdated notion that Hollywood is still mysteriously pushing in 2015, that it is possible to have strong female characters in an action film. Heck, I actually thought the character of Furiosa was way tougher and cooler than Max and I now want to see a spin-off that's all about her. Hollywood, take note because this movie just took you to school on how to write strong female characters."

","Description: Oh what a day!!! What a lovely day!!! Max is taken prisoner who needs to escape. Don't worry I won't spoil it for you. Max gets into some deep trouble, the trailer shows him attached to a Deuce Coupe called The Nux Car in the middle of a fight he doesn't even want to be.<br/><br/>Things I liked: <br/><br/><ul><li>Visuals: Breathtaking, totally steam-punk and beautifully done. Every frame is warm or cold and a wallpaper. Shocking at times due to the horror they oozed or the dizziness they induced, it made the whole movie watching experience unforgettable. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Vehicles: Totally cruel and merciless instruments of death. Whoever has worked on it has a twisted mind. They have made use of whatever they could to design these vehicles. I read that they lost few vehicles to the desert while shooting, what a pity. I wish they create a museum of these vehicles for people to see them. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>War: Epic guns, spears and epic action choreography makes you want to watch this again and again. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Music/Sound FX: We have hummed the soundtracks practically every time we watched, damn that music is awesome. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Costume: Totally steam-punk, I need to get this jacket desperately. - </li></ul><br/><br/>Actors: Tom Hardy - Thank you for being Max, none could be madder than Mel Gibson but you. I've seen Bronson and now this, Sir, you are a great successor to Mad Max after Mel Gibson. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron - You Ma'am are great and beautiful and bad-ass at the same time. When Furiosa is being followed for the first time, you can see tears in her eyes and she holds back and carries on with her mission to save the girls. You can see the desperation in her eyes. Hats off for the action and the great work as Furiosa. <br/><br/>Hugh Keays-Byrne - The only actor who has acted in two Mad Max movies, Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). The actor has shown what cruel looks like. The way he calls out the women's name, ""Splendid"", it shows his command over them and how he dispensed cruelty over them. <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult - Nux was awesome, insane, we witnessed you take an acting in supporting role to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Director: George Miller There is so much left unsaid but yet revealed in a different way to the audience. This was a work of art, once in a blue moon a movie like this is directed which blows our minds. This was legendary. For e.g. A lot is not shown about the cruelty of the villain, but we know that he feasts on the people's needs and keeps them hungry. We know that Max is delusional and deranged, but his past is not shown to us. <br/><br/>This is like art, you are convinced and become part of a well written and directed movie. The cinematography, script, casting, music, drama, action, all stitched together create an unforgettable experience. Truly a worthy wait of 30 years!!!<br/><br/>Blu-Ray: Do buy a Blu-Ray when it's out. But I wish they add more and more story to the unrevealed parts in the movie and reveal more of it to us. Maybe they add background of each character, deleted scenes. I wish the Blu- Ray is uncut.<br/><br/>Verdict: I have loved what they did to the franchise, made it more insane. I exhort you to watch it if you haven't already. Fury Road isn't like the earlier Mad Max movies, it continues to entertain you from start to the end. I give it a 10/10. Do yourself a favor, watch it only in IMAX, because it's ... It's Madder!!!"

","I went into this film sceptical , I thought that as I hadn't seen the others I would be confused and bored. BUT! What actually happened was that in the first minutes I was blown away by this amazing film!!! I never believed That it would be this good but it was. The film goes on a confused and tyrant spiral as we see the socially inept max having to join forces with Charlize Theron character who is Badder than Bad and action packed. She is saving the sisters who only exist to be bred for babies in this apocalyptic thrill ride. There are also insane sites such as a baby being pulled out of his mothers tummy with a knife and a man who is living on oxygen through a crazy and disturbing mask. To be fair just watch for Nicholas Hoult as the Wonderful Nux who adds the comic relief and tragedy to the film. What A day What A lovely Day!!!"
"ironhorse_iv","9","5","13","18 May 2015"," What a lovely day, to watch a good over-the-top popcorn carmaggeddon film! Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, watching.
","Mad Max is back on the road to success, after years of being off course. Don't get me wrong, the original ozxploitation Mad Max film franchises (1979 to 1985) by George Miller is probably the most famous post-apocalypse films to come out of the Australian New Wave of the 1970s, but this film series hasn't aged, well. First off, Mad Max's main star, Mel Gibson, fell from public grace, due his controversy statements against Jews, women and homosexuals. Second off, the film series hit a road bump, in 1985, when the movie, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome tries a more kid friendly approach by going PG-13. It got released with mixed feelings from critics, and audience members. The 1985 sequel also didn't yield the box office results that the producers wanted. It was only moderate successful, so any plans for sequels went into development hell for thirty years. Due to those reasons, the film series almost seem like it run out of gas. It wasn't until its driver, George Miller repacked, Mad Max as Fury Road, a continuity reboot; did the engines start to move again. Fury Road, once again, tells the story of 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, now played by actor, Tom Hardy, who must teams up with the a mysterious driver Furiosa, (Charlize Theron), to help a group of sex-slaves flee from their capturer, the evil warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Max and Furiosa must cross the post-apocalypse desert world in hopes of reaching, a mythic place call, the Green Place. Can they make it to the safe haven or will Joe recapture them? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, the film is visually impressing. The cinematography for this movie, is just as amazing. They made the Namibia deserts seem as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other post-apocalyptic movies which typically have bleak desaturated colors. It remind me, so much of 1962's Lawrence in Arabia, with how visually appealing, it was to watch. This movie is a must watch in 3D for that, alone. Still, there were some things that were too gimmicky or corny. The Doof Warrior's guitar, as it flies towards the camera in Fury Road, is jarringly poorly done. Especially given the utterly flawless effects throughout the rest of the film. Another thing, that I love about the film is how over 80% of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects, stunts, make-up and sets. CGI was used sparingly mainly to enhance the Namibian landscape, remove stunt rigging and for removing Charlize Theron's left arm. The stunt work is intense. It's extremely violent, with nonstop car chase scenes, explosions, and hand to hand combat. This movie is a good example that the Academy Awards need to have a category for stunt work. Still, the movie does go over the top, unrealistic at times. It's funny, how many bullets are wasted for a post-apocalypse film. The acting is pretty good as well. Charlize Theron is great, as the female lead. She shows that female action heroes can be, awesome. The film is driven by strong women and can be seemed as a feminist movie. Mad Max is pretty much a supporting character, to be honest. Still, you see a lot of him. Tom Hardy really gets the character of Max. A man of action and of few words. He was build, to be an action star. Still, the character has a confusing, origins story. The writers try to suggest that this Max's origin is the same as the original films, but clearly something were changed. While, yes he kinda wears a near-identical outfit, while wearing a leg brace as he did at the end of 1979's Mad Max and the entirety of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, but the movie gives him, some really haunting flashbacks, that we haven't witness, before. I don't know, where his hauntings came from or who the girl, was. It wasn't in the original films. There was a few other things to nitpick. I wish, he drove the modified police Interceptor, more and he looks a little more like Mel Gibson's Max. The movie has a lot of odd-looking supporting characters. At much, as I love the character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult). I can't buy into his heel to face turn and his love story with one of the sex slaves. It was a bit forced. Another weird moment in the film is the freaky looking side-characters. It remind me of 2006's 300 in a bit when it comes to the grotesque. Still, this movie makes more sense, since it take place, after a nuclear holocaust, but there were some really over the top gross-villains. It makes me, wonder if the water at the citadel is honestly, safe to drink. In my opinion, it seem poisoned. Overall: This demolition derby testosterone full film is a lot of fun, to watch. It's amazing that Miller has been in charge of the Mad Max series for so many decades, and I'll be looking forward to the next series of Mad Max films, from him. This is a must-watch. You have to be crazy, not to watch this film."
"aaronkalat","10","5","13","18 May 2015"," The best action film since Terminator 2.
","Right out of the gate this film fires all 8 cylinders and never lets up. The film is pretty much one large chase scene, and while that sounds terrible on paper it works incredibly well. The style of directing here is unique in that there isn't much exposition dialog at all. Everything you need to know is presented in small doses as needed to advance the story. The film does exactly what a film should do and that's show, don't tell. You need not see the previous films to understand who Max is, or why he does what he does.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely gorgeous. Most post-apocalyptic films are bleak and dreary but this film breaks the mold. For those not familiar with post-processing film techniques, it's as if the entire film has been ""instagrammed"". Because this film has little exposition through dialog the look of the film says it all. One of the most impressive pieces is when they show the inside of a dust storm, that's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>The sound design is flawless. You feel every bullet, shake with every explosion, and are brought to near tears by the soundtrack. There is also a very unique presentation to some of the tracks as the war parade has musicians acting as war drummers and ""trumpet"" players on the front lines. I'm reminded of how TASM 2 used dubstep during the showdown with Electro, but this time the incorporation is actually good.<br/><br/>The film is ridiculous on so many levels in the best kind of way. The man playing the electric guitar that shoots fire out is nothing short of lovable. You actually feel like you are on the front lines of an all out war with war drummers and said electric guitar man being the driving force behind the energy. The war boys are wicked cool and their belief system gives inspiration to their absolute madness. Their leader is utterly terrifying. Everything from his voice to his armor to his inability to feel true fear helps elevate this villain to the top 10 list.<br/><br/>The amount of detail presented in every shot is breathtaking. You really get the feeling that this is the film the director wanted to create for the last 30 years but because of budget concerns he was never able to. The fact that this film was in development hell for so long is usually a clear sign of a destined failure (see Duke Nukem Forever), but here it payed off. <br/><br/>The acting is spot on. Max is still a man of few words and Furiosa is the perfect teammate. If you had to create a team of badasses you would pick Furiosa and Max. Their chemistry is brilliant. It's not forced at all. You know they need each other to survive and when they work together great things happen. <br/><br/>I was a little nervous when the first 30 minutes of the film contained Michael Bay levels of madness. I thought ""well, there's only one way to go from here"". I can safely say I assumed wrong. The director has more than enough fireworks to last the entire run time. The finale is absolute madness. It's not just people killing one another so survive, it's about redemption for multiple characters. This was their last chance to make things right and you felt everything we have witnessed was nothing compared to what was to come. The delivery was so action packed I couldn't believe what I was seeing.<br/><br/>It's hard to find flaws in this film. Sure, we can nitpick little things but honestly, I would need to study the DVD/Bluray with a microscope to find them. If you like action films you owe it yourself to buy a ticket for this."

","This will become a classic in its own right I have given this a 9 because I would have wanted to see Mel Gibson back but too be fair Tom Hardy plays a very menacing Max and totally believable ,but I cannot help thinking that the role was written for an older Max who was looking to cure his inner demons Since seeing the film I have read that George Miller wanted to cast Mel Gibson but his previous public misdemeanours had prevented him from doing so .What a shame I watched the film last night and felt the need to add my positive thoughts to the others on the IMDb review board.<br/><br/>It has a different agenda from the first three in that fuel is no longer the controlling element but water, hope and the future of the human race Charlize Theron dominates this film and her character develops as the film progresses into a caring person ultimately looking for redemption Someone I went with actually thought she must have had a prosthetic limb in real life such are skills of the CGI boys Go see this in the Cinema and enjoy it in all of its Widescreen and Dolby Surround Sound it is the only way to watch this masterpiece"
"isheikher","9","5","13","14 May 2015"," A new classic that demands repeat viewings
","Flesh and metal collide in the part sequel, part reboot, post apocalyptic, no holds barred Mad Max: Fury Road. 70 year old director George Miller returns to the franchise he created, 30 years after the last outing. This time with Tom Hardy as Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa, two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanity. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple, Imperator Furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland, and take Immortal Joe's young brides with her. Joe of course sets out to stop her and Max is caught up in this battle. Charlize Theron is fantastic as Furiosa, with her artificial limb and war paint, determined to find her home and reunite with what's left of her family. Tom Hardy as Max is a man of few words, troubled by visions of past horrors. Both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of Joe to safety. The film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of Max, Immortal Joe and his War Boys. The performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue, exposition takes a back seat here.<br/><br/>Unlike previous films in the series, the budget this time around of $150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director. The sheer originality on display is impressive. Stunning photography, high contrast, warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland. The jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable, Fast & Furious is a walk in the park compared to this. You must see it to believe it, but even then you still ask yourself, ""Is this actually happening?"" It has the right mix of CGI and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like James Cameron's Terminator 2. And it all looks awesome in 3D IMAX. The score by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) is loud, heart pounding, epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen time. <br/><br/>Are there any negatives to the film? Only a few. Immortal Joe was fine as the main villain but The Bullet Farmer and The People Eater lacked depth, i wanted more time with them to understand their reasons for actually being part of the chase. Joe's brides (which included Zoe Kravitz and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) weren't the best performers and were quite bad at times.<br/><br/>So despite tall that, i highly recommend this film if for some strange reason you've been sitting on the fence. It's feral, dark, gritty, anarchic, surreal, just pure mayhem. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just any action film, it's one that sits side by side with your favourite Hollywood blockbusters, a new classic that demands repeat viewings for it's visual triumphs and sonic assaults. Now if you excuse me, i'm off to watch it again."
"dtocila","5","10","33","17 May 2015"," A decent action flick at best, Mad Max: Fury Road is very overrated. *minor spoilers*
","The film has some interesting concepts but it doesn't particularly excel in any area. There are some decent characters but none of the characters are really all that memorable, with the exception of a guitar playing maniac who swings around on a mini-stage for the duration of the film. Guitar-Man, as I shall dub him, was the funniest and most memorable part of the movie for me. <br/><br/>Over-all, the action is somewhat entertaining but it wasn't memorable. There is a lot of vehicular warfare but most of it feels bland. The hand-to-hand combat and gun-play are similarly bland. The character development isn't particularly revolutionary. Both of the main characters remain mostly undeveloped by the end of the film.<br/><br/>On the topic of characters, I must point out that some people are bashing the film and praising the film for nonsensical reasons. On the one hand there are those who insist that the film is feminist propaganda, introduced into theaters to pollute the action genre with excessive and invasive commentary on social issues like equal rights for men and for women. This is simply nonsense. Max is portrayed as the stronger character more than once. If it wasn't for Max, the mission would have arguably failed and Furiosa would have died. Both characters have adequate screen time and I saw no contrived attempt to depict Furiosa as a feminist symbol. For the most part, it didn't feel like the interaction between the two characters was supposed to serve as some kind of political commentary. Being that she has only one arm, Furiosa is seen in a weakened state multiple times. Not only does Max save her, but he provides her with the right path to take when she is about to set out on a long and useless journey. Those who are attacking the film because of it being ""propaganda"" are, in my opinion, grasping at some serious straws. Simultaneously, it is nonsensical to praise this movie for its depiction of women. Yes, there is a strong female lead. Yes, there are many women who play important roles in the film. But to focus on this is to ignore the fact that the action is bland and the story undeveloped is to prefer political commentary over action in an action film. To focus on praising the supposed feminist material embedded deep inside the action is to inject politics into a movie that is fairly simple and straightforward.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie has failed to provide satisfying and memorable action. Yes, there are a few cool scenes and some fun moments. But for the most part, you won't come away from this movie remembering any particular crash or explosion apart from the rest. This isn't to say that they are all equally amazing crashes or explosions...to me, they weren't really spectacular to begin with. While the film did have some stunning visuals, some appealing music, and a very interesting post-apocalyptic culture...it failed to be what it could have been. If it intended to be an action film, it didn't deliver enough. The throaty V8 sounds are never met with interesting vehicular warfare. Rather, it's the same repetitive chase-and-speed-up, with the occasional exploding spear thrown for effect. The interesting sub-cultures the group encounters are never given enough treatment to establish an intricate and well-woven narrative for the audience. If the film intended to be a commentary on a woman's ability to match men, it failed to do more than offer viewers with the opportunity to inject immature and baseless politics into the film. But perhaps it intended to be a fertile soil from which wide-spreading dialogue on feminism and representation could spring forth. If that is the case, it arguably succeeded in achieving its goal - but the price for this is failing to be a great movie, and instead becoming an overrated and politicized ploy.<br/><br/>I would encourage you to watch it once if you're looking for some mindless action and plenty of V8 noise to take your mind off of things. Don't look here for a meaningful treatment of complicated issues, though. Its greatest deeper meaning comes not from a deep, detailed, and carefully constructed narrative...but from the internet warriors who insist on forcing deeper meaning onto the bland action."
"beckersjos","8","6","17","29 May 2015"," Mad ???
","Well, first off, I would like to point out that this film is one of the best paced action movies I've seen in a long time. Hence, the 8/10. But it isn't a Mad Max film. It's kind off a late spin-off, there were many after the first Mad max films. And as thus I can appreciate this film. But as a Mad Max film, I give a solid 2/10. Why? No real explanation or exploration (character building) into Max's ever growing madness but some vague flashbacks and references to the old Mad Max films. The over the top action-scenes, greatly cgi'd though, were most of the time too long and only there to fill up this movie with yet more action, so that the story was left floating around(which explains the lack off ). But as said in the beginning it's an action film and there is plenty of it in this movie. Too bad they lure people into thinking that this film is the real deal and feed on the franchise. I did find myself at the end of this film hoping that Max would leave, and he did. There is at least that. Disappointing Mad Max,film but great stand alone action flick."
"j-madej","10","6","17","23 May 2015"," ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a sort of benchmark of how other action movies will be judged in the future. Excellent!
","There are some movies considering a visual style, the special FX or pure TNT action that set the benchmark of excellence for other movies to follow. These films come very rare, sometime once in a decade. It is even more rare to actually see I remake which is directed by the same director from the original movie and it is total rarity if the new version is better then the original. This is precisely what we get with this years most action charged remake of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", an absolutely marvelous attempt by director George Miller to revitalize this cult 80's classic. The original trilogy set Mel Gibson on to the Hollywood stardom and who knows this film might take Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy to the next level as well. <br/><br/>""Years after the collapse of civilization, the tyrannical Immortan Joe enslaves apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress the Citadel. When the warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads the despot's five wives in a daring escape, she forges an alliance with Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a loner and former captive. Fortified in the massive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord's henchmen in a high-speed, deadly chase through the Wasteland."" <br/><br/>Essentially the whole movie we might describe as long continues action chase scene. The intensity of pyrotechnics, stunts and greens screen compositions is a unbelievable experience. I had a pleasure to see it twice. Once in IMAX 3D and once in standard 3D. The IMAX version is where the film truly excels, in fact watching it, you as the viewer are actively participating in what is going on on the screen. The combination of great sound design and visuals create hypnotic atmosphere which we are lucky to experience. I must say I don't remember the last time I felt such a rush, it is truly mind-blowing. The way it is shot it looks as if director of photography recorded the action sequences in very slow frame rate and and in the post production editor speeded the action up creating very crisp sharp picture. Normally whenever camera operator moves camera sideways it creates a motion blur. In ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" the picture is so crisp that at times is almost looking bit artificial. Apparently 80% of the movie was shot on location using practical stunts and only 20% of sequences where supplemented with CGI. I have to say the first 30 minutes can be put in to a film history books as the most intense and mind-blowing action sequence. This film also uses a different color palate then most post apocalyptic movies of the past which usually focus on washed out desaturated color scheme. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is highly colorful and saturated with red hot explosions and beautiful golden deserts. The final color correction is a real eye candy. <br/><br/>The lead performances are very solid. Charlize Theron brings extreme amount of intensity not seen since her magnificent Oscar awarded performance in ""Monster"". You can see that she did her homework. The inner work which she has learned in Ivana Chubbuck studio shines through every inch of her being. There is a strength and vulnerability in her performance which in someway steals the whole movie. Tom Hardy in the last few years became truly well crafted actor. His minimalistic approach to acting brings to mind genius of Marlon Brando. He does't talk much relying on body language and sort of mumbling delivery of lines which creates very believable characterization. The chemistry between him and Theron is very good and we are hoping for them to succeed and fall for each other on the romantic level. It looks like Nicholas Hoult has been casted based of his performance as a lovable zombie in ""Warm Bodies"" and to some extent delivers similar type of performance as a War Boy - Nux who is trying to get to mythical Valhalla, place popularized by Vikings as the paradise after death where all the real warriors reside after their heroic death. <br/><br/>In terms of the story or rather a plot ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is very straight forward which for some might leave something to be desired. But lets face it this film does what it promises. It offers mind-blowing action unlike any other you have seen in the last few years. In that regard ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" sets a new standard for action intensity and it looks like we will see more of sequels considering that Tom Hardy signed a contract to make 3 more movies. If there is one thing to be critical about it, is the fact that plenty of dialog was rerecorded using ADR (automatic dialog replacement) which gives sense of artificiality, because it is very difficult to rerecord dialog and give the same type of performance intensity as in the actual take on location. The reason for it might be above mentioned frame rate racking, which later in post- production is being speed up where lips do not move in sink with the sound of the actors and subsequently need to be looped in ADR session. <br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a new type of movie of a digital filmmaking age, sort of benchmark of how other action movies will be judged. I loved it and if you like an exhilarating action you won't be disappointed as well. I promise!"

","Mad Max: Fury Road is a triumphant realisation of all that is possible on the big screen. The explosions, the violence, the sounds!! Forget all that you think you know about blockbuster action movies. This is it!! Okay, let's pump the brakes for a second. What makes a classic movie? Storyline and dialogue. Sure, but we'll have none of that here thank you! Not necessary!! Don't get me wrong, I love a good, cleverly written movie with witty dialogue and an interesting premise, plus a dash of quirkiness. But, although 'Mad Max' is indeed interesting it doesn't have or need any of that other stuff. This is visual story telling in its most basic and pure form. It is little more than a car chase through the desert spanning a couple of days and destroying countless vehicles and lives along the way. And it is beyond epic. This is quite possibly the most action packed movie I have ever seen. At times it borders on complete sensory overload. There is just so much awesome stuff going on (including a gimp chained to a truck playing a flame throwing guitar!!). And ladies, yes, you should be going to see this with your boyfriend/husband/significant other. Hell, go with the girls. The thing is this: I don't remember ever seeing a movie with so many strong female characters in it kicking serious arse. True, many of them are insanely hot, but some are also old and wrinkly. All are awesome. Girl power all the way. I would be so darn happy if I went to see this again and there were big groups of girls going to celebrate having a vag and an attitude in this high speed desert pursuit rather than the formulaic, clichéd bullshit that is 'Pitch Perfect 2'. Sorry, I just don't care how funny Fat Amy is. Director George Miller deserves to be knighted. Or, at the very least, he should be given his own reality TV show where he gets to judge the everyday functions of everyday people in a situation that makes it seem somehow not mundane, thereby becoming the most popular personality on TV. The guy is a saint. When I first heard they were making a new Mad Max a thousand years after 'Thunderdome' I was highly skeptical. No way could he pull this off. No way could he make this relevant. Modern audiences won't appreciate it. What's he gonna do? Have an old Mel Gibson? Oh wait, Tom Hardy is going to play Max and it's going to be set around the same time as the original movies??? I dunno man I have never been so happy to be wrong about a movie. The theme song from the Lego movie belongs here now. Everything is awesome. Quite simply, this is the best movie I've seen this year. Go see it. 9.5/10 See all our reviews at www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews"
"nils-engman","10","6","17","18 May 2015"," Max is back; better and madder than ever in this extravagant action spectacle.
","Mad Max: Fury Road stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult and is directed by George Miller. The plot revolves around Imperator Furiosa; a woman who is trying to get back to her homeland, as well as escorting five young women who are on the run from the dictator-like Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne); a man who has rallied an army of doomed, radioactive-poisoned boys - the Warboys, the Kamakrazee - and who has basically enslaved a population of people, since he promises them water (something that is rare in this world). These five women (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Riley Keough and Courtney Eaton) are also Immortan Joe's ""wives"" (kind word for it), his price breeders. It's here where Max's and Furiosa's paths cross.<br/><br/>Now the story in Mad Max essentially boils down to a two-hour car chase (even though the story has more layers to it than what you would expect in any similar films). Furiosa needs to get these women from point A to point B. But there's a lot more going on than that beneath the surface of the initial plot. <br/><br/>Mad Max has gained a lot of hype, especially during the past week or two. Most of this originates from early word-of-mouth that supposedly said that this movie was amazing. The movie then gained an unprecedented 98 % on Rotten Tomatoes and an 89 on Metacritic (seven points higher than The Dark Knight). Critics cited this as one of the greatest action films of all time. Now, obviously this puts a ton of pressure on this movie. And how well does it hold up to those words? Well to put it simply: Mad Max: Fury Road is an achievement, and one of the best films I've ever seen - ever! This movie was absolutely incredible. A feast for the eyes. If you're a movie fan then this is a must go. You have to see it to believe it. <br/><br/>So why is the movie so fantastic? Well, let's start with the performances and the characters. Tom Hardy is great as Max Rockatansky. He may not have a lot of lines in the movie, but Tom Hardy pulls off Max's troubled past subtly and perfectly. And then you have Charlize Theron as Furiosa. She was fantastic in the role. Some have argued that she is actually the main character of this movie, the one who really drives the movie forward. And that's not a bad thing, because she knocks this role out of the park, and Furiosa as a character is really well written and fleshed out, despite the fact that the focus isn't really on the characters at all, but rather the action. The biggest surprises of this movie's ensemble came from Nicolas Hoult, who plays warboy Nux, and from the lovely ladies who play the characters who are referred to as the wives. Nux as a character may be the deepest in the movie, and at one point, that character even moved me to tears (in a movie in which a man plays an electric guitar which shoots flames through it's neck...yeah, it's that good). The wives are also very interesting, since they don't play like usual damsels-in-distress at all. Instead, each one of them feels unique and important.<br/><br/>Besides the performances and the surprisingly layered and deep characters, there was a thousand other things to love about this movie. The score is perfect (by Junkie XL and the writing is also perfect. It just really fits with the movie. But let's get down to the bones of it. The essential parts of why this movie has made such a splash. First of all, this movie contains what easily competes with the absolute best action sequences ever put to film in the history of motion picture cinema! The action scenes - who are 80-90 % practical effects, differentiating itself from today's CGI heavy films - are absolutely breath-taking, mind-blowing and jaw- dropping. There were several moments were my jaw dropped from the sheer spectacle before my eyes. And due to my other main thing, namely, the cinematography. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the most beautifully shot films of all time in my opinion. The way George Miller utilizes day and night sequences, and differentiate themselves from one-another is brilliant. Every shot is a sight to behold and it's so nice to see a post-apocalyptic film that has such colors that this one has.<br/><br/>Verdict: Mad Max: Fury Road is a spectacular visual effects extravaganza of epic proportions, with surprisingly layered characters and heart-stopping, beautiful cinematography and production design. But the real surprise is the tender backbone that the film backs up its insane action scenes with. And it's all thanks to the real star of the picture; George Miller, who's dream film (no, quite literally dream-film. He dreamed of this movie a decade before it ever saw first light) is perfectly executed by a master film-maker. By the end of the film you can't do anything than to applaud and bow to the mastermind himself. Mad Max: Fury Road is THE movie to beat for the remainder of the year, and the action movie to beat for the remainder of the decade.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Darkhorse_Knight","10","6","17","18 May 2015"," DHKR: Mad Max: Fury Road- ""Oh What a Day! What a Lovely, Lovely Day!""
","The Post-Apocalyptic genre is a very bleak, but somewhat uplifting critique on our future. The idea that the world would be wiped out through a thermonuclear bombing, an act of desperation causing the destruction of a country, or even the Rapture of Biblical Lore has been hammered into our minds for years, becoming as popular as a view of our future as much as the shiny utopian model from The Jetsons is. <br/><br/>Personally, I'm a big fan of this genre. A world where scavenging and common necessities become vital for your survival has a great deal of potential for survival based horror, adventure, revenge stories, even stories that just expand in the setting alone. Just remember, when you think Darkhorse Knight(DHK), you think Post-Apocalyptic stories.<br/><br/>That being stated and brought out of the way, I'm about to review one of the best films to embody this genre, and the best summer film of 2015 as of now. Mad Max: Fury Road, and Oh, What a Lovely Day it is to be a cinemaphille! <br/><br/>The film starts off with Max, our cynical protagonist played by Tom Hardy(Dark Knight Rises' Bane) standing on a crag along with his car while a narration gives us a brief statement about both the Oil Wars and the Water Wars. After a brief car chase with a tribe of Raiders, Max is captured and shackled, being assigned as a ""blood bag"" for Nux(Nicholas Hoult). <br/><br/>Soon, we get a good look of Immortan Joe, the anarcho-fascist ruler of the many tribes. A crippled man wearing life-support and covered in armor adorned with the many biker medals one assumes after a life of conflict, Joe is immortalized as a god among mortals. He controls the water and the food, and therefore he controls the Wastes. Despite many wounds and blisters covered, Joe proves that he's the chief and king for a reason, by leading charges with his Lieutenant, Rictus Erectus on a monstrous war machine made up of vintage muscle cars from the 50s. <br/><br/>During a supposed run to Gas City, Imperator Furiosa, another Lieutenant, sneaks Joe's prized ""breeding women"" away to a sanctuary that may or may not exist in the desert. After being double crossed, Joe sends a war party lead by himself to chase down the rogue Imperator. Nux, hearing this, finds this a great way to prove himself worthy of Valhalla, so he may die a heroes death and be born again. Since he needs blood to make his journey, Max is forced to join him.<br/><br/>However, the mission is compromised by a sandstorm. The heavily pregnant breeding women is killed after Joe runs her over with said war machine, to which he grieves so much that his iron jaw opens. Later, a Raider medic finds out the child that died in the womb was ""perfect"", as in free of any known defect. Fueling the flames of his vendetta.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is within the confines of a war rig, a tanker. Resources like Gas to fuel the truck and water to help cool off the engine are becoming needed by the mile in order to reach the sanctuary. At the same time, they both need to stay fast and conserve reserves, and it's impossible to do both without fail. <br/><br/>The film soon also doesn't have any subplots. The entire running time is about getting to sanctuary. The only thing close to a subplot we have is Nux trying to deal with a crisis of faith, while at the same time prove that he's worthy of Valhalla, if it doesn't exist. Even the closest thing to romance in the film is with Nux, but it's only implied and never shown again due to his demise at the very end, sacrificing himself to further the mission<br/><br/>Fury Road is a success as a summer blockbuster can get,and it runs to the end and goes beyond, reaching for the stars in a giant bloody war machine. It is also a continuous piece of the trend regarding Post-Apocalyptic story telling. Don't miss out on a great film!<br/><br/>Also, there's a Raider with a Fire-Spewing Guitar. How much better can you get!?<br/><br/>5-Stars- S-Ranking"
"SquidwardHitchcock","3","10","34","16 May 2015"," It's just a bunch of explosions
","The rest of the world is wrong. This movie is terrible. The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 1 is because it is visually stunning and imaginative. Well one day the special effects and visuals in movies are going to be even more advanced, and then this movie will have even less to offer. <br/><br/>There is no character development, and no explanation of anything going on in the plot. Actually, scratch that. There isn't a plot. The whole movie is one long chase scene where Mad Max and company run away from half-dead people, and everyone cuts and shoots each other. There was basically no dialogue between any of the characters, just a series of explosions and grunts. I've actually never seen a movie with so little dialog."

","Everywhere I turned there were people telling me about the Mad Max Reboot.<br/><br/>With the original tale the warning was: it's not about nuclear disaster, it's about the lack of petrol. Which did not stop the audiences rave about nuclear disaster, especially after Chernobyl.<br/><br/>With this one the production team made it clear. They put a useless monologue in the beginning to make sure the audience gets it now: it's about petrol. So a wise guy put in a lizard with two heads. Which, like in all cautionary tales written by English majors, lives and functions well.<br/><br/>Now, because the problem is petrol, the only way to entertain yourself is to cover large distances without roads in inefficient cars that are made even less efficient with all sorts of addons.<br/><br/>Precisely because there is no petrol, all people use electric tools that are fueled by the toxic fumes going out from the ears of the writers and director involved.<br/><br/>And because there is no petrol, there are no roads either. Which helps the characters save fuel and run on pixie dust.<br/><br/>It becomes mildly amusing once you start seeing the ugly white corpses as Minions on a budget. Probably painting them yellow, instead of white, would have made the film somehow better."

","I don't think those of a gentler disposition would be attracted to the relentless heavy metal/steampunk chase element of this film(this element constitutes about 97%).That I stuck it out to the end had more to do with my fast forward button.It is not a dystopian masterpiece.It is entirely informed by mind-rotting apocalyptic video games."
"Leofwine_draca","10","4","10","24 February 2016"," Pure action spectacle
","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.<br/><br/>I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film."
"HerImperialDuchess","10","4","10","21 January 2016"," The Winner of 2015
","Twenty years from now, when film geeks and ordinary movie-goers both look back on the movies of 2015, which one will first spring to mind as the movie that most defined the year? Above the Avengers, above all the traditional Oscar-fare, above even the return of Star Wars, Fury Road stands as the movie of the year. I truly believe that in ten years this film will be near-universally regarded as one of the greatest action films of all time alongside Die Hard, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Matrix, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>It is an absolute masterpiece. A film so lost in it's world's insanity that the viewer can't help but be pulled into every mad minute of it. The near-constant action is directed and choreographed with a precision and eye for detail usually reserved for art films. It's commitment to practical effects adds reality to every explosion and car crash, every bullet fired and punch thrown until you can almost smell the gasoline, smoke, and blood. And yet there is such beauty in it, it's as if we're looking through the eyes of George Miller to see the beauty to be found in all the chaos and destruction. Awash in bright colors of orange and blue, that play as the gorgeous backdrop to the brilliant and unique designs of a fleet of tricked out muscle cars and war rigs making their eventual destruction into bits of flaming, twisted metal all the more visually stunning.<br/><br/>But all the action is backed up by a story with more feeling and humanity than countless more 'serious' films. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and a brilliant supporting cast milk every bit of emotion and character to be had from a script as stripped down and efficient as the film's visuals are over the top. The subtlest of facial expressions and effectual use of sparse dialogue manage to convey all the emotion we need to understand what's at stake. It's a story of redemption, of finding life and hope where there is none, of acting for justice and equality.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road won 2015 ladies and gentlemen. Give it a round of applause."
"johnplocar","10","4","10","9 January 2016"," Best action film I've seen in oh so long...oh so good!
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"": This was my absolute, most anticipated film for the entire year. And to just get this immediately out of the way, this film did not in any single way whatsoever disappoint me. It has been days since I've seen the film and I'm still pumped about it. ""Fury Road"" is a masterpiece. That is exactly what it is and there is not another word that describes it any better. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word in terms of action, concept, writing, character, style, effects, acting, sheer filmmaking. I grew up knowing of the ""Mad Max"" franchise but I didn't really grow up with it other than the glimpses I had gotten and the few scenes I caught on television as a kid. Not until I got into my late teens that I caught the first Mad Max movie on TV one night and I liked it, but it wasn't until the second viewing a few years later that I fell in love with it. It was something that for some reason or another went over my head the first go around, but when it finally clicked I went straight into watching the second film ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"". At the time I was determined to not let the second film one go over my head like its predecessor, and I fell for ""Road Warrior"" right away. To me, the first two movies are some of the greatest action films of all time; although that is pretty commonly said about ""Road Warrior"", the original I think is pretty underrated. Now, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" I honestly don't like much at all. There's really no hate that I have for ""Thunderdome"", but there not a whole lot for me to enjoy about it either. Mel Gibson is still good in the role and that's about it. Then when I came across the rumor of ""Fury Road"", at first I was a little skeptical but once I saw a trailer and some still images, any skepticism I previously had completely subsided and was replaced with excitement. If this film ended up being bad, you have no idea how depressed I would be. The fact that this actually somehow exceeded my expectations is beyond comprehension. ""Thunderdome"" wishes it could have been this. For a film being in production hell for 30 years, this was an unbelievable achievement in film history. Probably because it had a genius like George Miller behind it; creating the entire story solely out of storyboards alone. Which makes this film such a rich experience; it's as if I was watching a silent film at times. Every shot was completely stunning. Any time the movie took a breath, it was still so beautifully constructed that I could put the film on mute and still get an emotional response. Although I will say that the musical score was just as beautifully composed and added even more to the performances on screen. There is not a boring moment throughout any of the running time. There is not a dull character that comes into play. There is not a bad stunt or special effect thrown in during any of the action. It is as close to flawless as humanly possible. I will say that it was slightly sad not seeing Mel Gibson in the role anymore, but Tom Hardy nails everything about Max Rockatansky. That is the most negative comment I could say about the whole thing, and I don't even think that even comes close to counting as a knock against the movie, actually in a way is a compliment to a talented actor. He felt like the same character, but has naturally progressed into more of a primal being than before. For the first half of the film he doesn't even really speak, he grunts. This was awesome just to watch him sort of mumble and grunt to himself and some of the other characters. But I loved that the film still remembers the first ""Mad Max"", being haunted by the death of his family. It went into that territory just enough that it supplied me the character development for Max that felt satisfactory and justified the movie to remain as action packed without feeling as though there were no one worth routing. As much as this is Max's movie, it is equally Furiosa's too, played by Charlize Theron. Oh god she did fantastic in this; embodying exactly what Miller said to be, the ""Female Road Warrior"". In anyone else's hands, could have gone horribly wrong, but it doesn't. She is fierce while also heartbreaking. Furiosa deserves as much credit for making this film work as Max does, if not more so in some aspects. Lastly, I just want to go over the villain real quick. Entering the frame, it was as if seeing the next Darth Vader pop on screen. Immortan Joe holds such a presence that I thought I was gonna s**t my pants! So now that I have gone on and on about this movie, this is a must see for the summer. For the year. For the decade. A straight up ""must see"", period. I loved this movie. It's pretty obvious that most everyone who has seen this film loves it. I do not want this to be the next ""Dredd"" film. Or ""Edge of Tomorrow"" where it is an absolute great film that gets screwed in the box office and never gets another chance to expand its universe with a sequel. This is one of the greatest action films of all time right next to the first two Mad Max films in cinema history. Please go out and watch this. I am begging you, if I don't get a sequel to this then I am going to go on a killing rampage...I mean, I will be very sad. Seriously though, was fantastic and I hope to see more of Max's, and even Furiosa's, story in the future."
"punishmentpark","7","4","10","29 November 2015"," A pleasant surprise.
","I got a chance to watch this for free, and was a little curious anyway. The first part of the film was fast and chaotic; it didn't seem very promising. Tom Hardy seemed hardly worthy of following up Mel Gibson's legendary portrayal of futuristic hero Mad Max. But I decided to pull through.<br/><br/>The film may seem pretty simple and straightforward, and in a way it is, but it is was also quite entertaining and there were a lot of little (and big) things going on. Hardy turned out to be an okay successor to Gibson, and Charlize Theron was even more than okay. The rest of the cast played a great variety of characters, of whom the leaders and Nux (Nicholas Hoult - it took me a while to recognize this 'boy') impressed me most. And those models weren't hard to look at, at all.<br/><br/>The biggest fun of the film is in, you'll not be surprised, the action sequences on and around the 'war rig'. The guitar player, the motorcyclists, explosions, and what not, the list is seemingly endless. And then there are some pretty atmospheric intermissions, for a good deep breath, before it all starts up again.<br/><br/>I'm still very much in favour of the first Mad Max film as the best of the series, but this one was more than doable.<br/><br/>A good 7 out of 10."
"chrismj11","10","4","10","7 November 2015"," Isn't This What The Kids Want?
","Can I begin by saying that most people usually just pay no attention to the original Mad Max and claim that the Road Warrior (2) is where it all began sadly. It's a shame that the first gets passed off in this manner as it is an absolute classic and I urge you to check it out if you haven't. The second is excellent, don't get me wrong, Thunderdome being the weakest in the series for me. <br/><br/>People giving this film bad reviews are wrong!<br/><br/>Fury Road is basically the film George Miller wanted to make all those years back but didn't have the means to at the time. This film was quite simply awesome. Screw what people in these reviews are saying about there being no plot, that's garbage. The plot works because it's bleak and simplistic. There's not much left in their dying world and the portrayal of its nothingness works throughout. <br/><br/>This brings me back to my original point of people saying Mad Max 2 is the true Mad Max film. Isn't that what they all wanted with Fury Road then? Another insane piece of celluloid depicting epic chases through dense unforgiving terrain? Bleak landscapes with ""humongous"" bad guys?! <br/><br/>All in all, a truly great edge of your seat action film with menacing bad guys, insane stunts and some of the best camera work known to man! An excellent addition to the Mad Max world. <br/><br/>Bring on the next instalment!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","4","10","23 June 2015"," Maybe not the best action film, but it's certainly the most action film.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the last film I expected to be this year's darling of the first half of 2015. Does the original trilogy really have that mainstream fondness? Cult favourites certainly. I've only seen the tedious first half hour of the first which I will finish at some point. I trust Road Warrior is a significant improvement. But since Beyond Thunderdrome, George Miller directed family movies such as the Babe sequel and the Happy Feet pair. He has an Oscar for directing a cute film about dancing penguins. But was the sunstroked chaos of Fury Road swirling in his head the whole time? Nevertheless, despite its long production period, Fury Road is not a film that feels overthought. Waiting out a couple decades of mindless CGI disaster porn, Fury Road is a breath of fresh dusty air with ambitious practical effects taken to a scale not possible in the 1980s. It's commendable for that alone, given it's essentially one long chase scene with little time to breathe. It's an incredible technical feat with its editing and creativity to keep it thrilling.<br/><br/>However, it's very rough around the edges, the curse side of its wild blessing. The first act is overcooked and all over the place, setting up its promises and over-delivering. It's a blur, and with confusing motives, it's difficult to latch onto. However, once we're through the sandstorm and it strips down its dynamics, for one giving its protagonist Max a chance to grunt a word, and reveals its secrets, there's a reason to invest in what it's trying to do. If you want to call it a feminist agenda to expose a collapsing patriarchal hierarchy then fine, but it's very welcome in an otherwise barren genre. The film does something that most films these days have forgotten, letting the hero be a hero. Max is a complete stranger to the story, and while he helps because he must, there's an element of his moral compass in there too. So many films revolve around the protagonist's problems, but a real hero is much less self-involved. It's refreshing to see a classic archetype utilized so well. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron steals the show from Tom Hardy, providing an emotional texture with her glazed over eyes to the film's action that it would otherwise severely lack. However, the world of Mad Max is not an endearing one. The revolting culture of the antagonists is vague and while I'm glad it didn't go into it despite the idiosyncrasies, it's something I can't embrace. Nicolas Hoult is especially awful, never landing a sincere moment, at least not until the second half of the film where he's all walk and no talk. Shame Miller's taste in dialogue is so dreadful. At least his taste in atmosphere is something to behold, though the guitar guy took me out of it every time he was on screen. I'm not sure if I would call Mad Max: Fury Road one of the best action films of the decade, but it's certainly the most action film.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Forget about story arc. Mad Max: Fury Road is an unpredictable thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The protagonist Max stays in the background so that the secondary characters (who are not critical to a sequel) have screen time to be humanized before some of them are killed in an orgy of clever and inventive brutality. The refreshing lack of humor is made up for by a handful of personalities whose agendas are evident and therefore interesting. Although it is violent, the passion put into every scene shines through the bleakness. It feels authentic as dystopian fiction. The themes of despair and hopelessness are presented convincingly with the help of amazing settings, props and cinematography. I don't have any real complaints apart from Max being perhaps a bit too hard to relate to. Overall, here is a movie that has realized its potential. Watch in 3D."
"ForgottenWorlds","10","4","10","26 May 2015"," What a lovely Masterpiece
","Miller invented what we actually know as the ""post-nuclear"" universe, and all the movies after Interceptor toke huge inspiration from (almost ripping off) its vision. George Romero in the 70'-80's did the same with zombie movies, but failed to impress at old age, on contrary Miller still continue to impress, proofing he's still the BEST in this genre. Without spending many words I'll say: this is a MASTERPIECE. Action, Vibe, Photography, Fxs, Stunts, everything will surpass your expectations and satisfy your needs: if awesomeness is what you need.<br/><br/>I bet, in the next decades we will be submerged by other movies like this, because let's face it: we NEEDS movies like this.<br/><br/>Cheers from Germany"
"yansenringo","8","4","10","25 May 2015"," Mad.. From The Beginning To The End
","It's about adrenaline rush from the beginning until the end, however, George Miller can very well maintain the plot and simple storyline so that although he has brought the rush from minute zero, the movie could still execute and present the climax in a very good way to the audience.<br/><br/>The moviegoers who haven't seen the original movie should be able to learn and gather the puzzle of the story, not to clear everything up (yet!), but the way it tells the story and ""explain"" it is so classy for a 'mad action brutal full of truck race and debris' movie. We won't feel confuse when we leave the theater, in fact, asking for more :). Sure there are some details that questionable, but hopefully those can be answered in the sequel.<br/><br/>The actors performance are quiet balance anyway, Charlize Theron appears to be too plain for that strong character of Furiosa, I was thinking that someone as strong as Sigourney Weaver could fill that shoes. Tom Hardy simply nails it, this classy actor can transform from the unknown to resentful to lovable and reliable Max. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays brilliantly as Immortan Joe, very full of testosterone and adrenaline, his total madness and love for the wife and baby in the other side can represent what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>Absolutely Look forward for the next one!"
"jkbonner1","10","4","10","24 May 2015"," In a world that's gone insane, only chaos can reign
","That's the world of Mad Max Fury Road. Our world. Earth. As it is in the forthcoming future. A desert planet where once was green vegetation is now only sand and salt (dried out ocean beds). And hostile tribes of different peoples, some possibly mutants, war with each other for scarce resources, one of most scarce being water.<br/><br/>The plot is simplicity itself. A powerful warlord and cult-leader, the ugly and evil Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who wears a hideous mouth mask, holds power supreme over an impoverished people. From his balcony at the Citadel, his stronghold, like a beneficent god he opens three floodgates, allowing gushing water to fall to the waiting masses below.<br/><br/>He also has a private harem, and a wandering woman, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has stolen five of them, all beauties, because she must rescue them (she alludes to being abducted as a child from her native land and perhaps serviced such a warlord herself). She drives off into the desert with a truck holding a tank-load of gasoline and with the women safely stowed away in the passenger compartment.<br/><br/>Unknown to her Max (Tom Hardy), an itinerant wanderer overwhelmed with guilt by the death of his wife and daughter that he could not prevent, captured and tortured by the warlord's warriors, escapes and hitches a ride on Furiosa's truck. Wary of each other at first, they come to terms and are soon cooperating. Which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Because the warlord learns that five of his beautiful sex slaves, one prominently pregnant, have been abducted. Brimming with rage he storms out after her with his army of goons into the barren desert in full pursuit to capture his women and carry them back and in the process destroy Furiosa. And so the battle begins.<br/><br/>The goon army armed to the teeth and plowing through the desert in their makeshift but deadly vehicles with their banners flapping in the breeze and their massive oversized tires and their strange music filling the air and pursuing with full and deadly fury Furiosas'a truck and savoring the sweet revenge that they will unleash on her when they catch up with her looks for all purposes like some malevolent caravan of motley beasts guided by miscreant creatures straight out of the Wizard of Oz. Or the gates of Hell.<br/><br/>Furiosa sees her deed as a way of finding redemption, partly because she herself must have served some warlord. Max tells her: If you can't fix what's broken, you will go insane. She must face the fact that the land she left, her green land, is forever gone. Max tells her in order to find the green land again, she must return to the Citadel. Furiosa with Max's help, and also with the help of the young women whom she's rescued, must battle the warlord's warriors all the way back. And what a fight. Total mayhem like so many wars. Vicious and merciless. And fought to the bitter end.<br/><br/>Normally I don't much care for blow-'em-ups/shoot-'em-ups and this movie has it in spades, far enough to satisfy the most hard-bitten action junkie. But from a review, I read that Charlize Theron was in the movie, and playing the main character to boot. It's as much her movie as it is Hardy's. Possibly even more so. Normally I don't see a movie because a particular actor's in it, but I've seen her in several movies and she's very good.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding. Most of the movie was filmed in the Namib desert in Namibia, an African republic to the northwest of South Africa. The red desert with its large, forbidding rock formations is stunning. And the formidable sandstorm that rushes down on them like an enormous tsunami is incredible. I have a scene like that in a book I wrote. But words must be chosen very carefully and even then it remains challenging to capture the moving action of such a titanic thing. The music convincingly supports the militant and life-or-death hand-to-hand fighting taking place. Brutality begets the beast. It's my understanding that very few of the scenes were CGI-generated (the great sandstorm must have been though). If that is so, then I must say they are all splendidly done. Kudos to Miller for his directing.<br/><br/>I give it 10 out of 10. I'd like to say a bit about my ratings. I read one reviewer who said he doesn't like to give any movie a 10 out of 10 because it can always be made better. If one looks at a movie like any other work of art, this is true. No work of art exists, or will ever exist, that somehow couldn't stand a bit of improvement. I'm a writer and know that myself. An artist must do the very best job they can with the skills they possess. But that being said, the work must end so the artist can reach their audience. Otherwise, the work of art is a perpetual ongoing project. So, if the directing, script, acting, score, and cinematography are of very high quality, then I give it 10 out of 10. Yes, it could probably have been worked on more. But then, there would never be a movie that could actually be seen by viewers like me.<br/><br/>I vaguely remember the original Mad Max series from the 1980s and they struck me as tongue-in-cheek (notwithstanding Miller wrote and directed these too). As far as I was concerned, they could have taken place in a galaxy far, far away. But not so this Mad Max. If you get beyond the action, there's a hard look at where the future of this planet may be heading in the not so distant future. And it's not a pretty future."
"cultfilmfan","Null","4","10","23 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road
","I think what would be most appropriate when reviewing a film like, Mad Max: Fury Road, is to do a move that the late great, Roger Ebert did a couple of times. When he reviewed his own film, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (which he wrote along with writer/director Russ Meyer) and when he reviewed John Waters' Pink Flamingos, he gave neither film a star rating. With, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the reason was quite obvious, because he wrote the film and was good friends with Meyer, and regardless of the film being a cult masterpiece (which I think it is), he did not give it a star rating because the rating would have been biased, so instead he gave more, or less of a recap of information and what putting together the final film was like in general. John Waters' Pink Flamingos (which I would also consider a cult masterpiece) was one that Ebert felt that he could not give a star rating to because he felt that a rating system did not belong, or would not be acceptable for such a film. If you have seen, Pink Flamingos (and every lover of the offbeat really should), you can definitely see what he is talking about. The film, while I still like it very much, is extremely offbeat and you could use any number of adjectives to describe it (whether you liked it, or not), but to rate it as one of the great films of all time, or even what to rate it at all, would prove definitely a perplexing and difficult problem for some. I would personally give perfect ratings to both Dolls, and Flamingos, and I personally own both films and consider them and look at them very highly. Yet bizarrely, I find I am running into Ebert's dilemma when it comes to Mad Max: Fury Road though. I simply do not know how to rate it. As my alias on this site suggests, I am definitely a fan of all films offbeat, misunderstood and stuff that the general public has shied away from. So why am I finding it so hard to give a rating to Mad Max: Fury Road, which definitely falls into a lot of those categories? I think part of this is while I certainly did find a lot I liked in Mad Max: Fury Road, and in general, I would have to say that I did like the film, I think part of the dilemma for me is that this is an action film and very few action films rank very highly, or favourably in my palette of taste for films. To say that, Mad Max: Fury Road is not an action packed film would be the understatement of the year because from the second the film opens till it ends, it is action packed from start to finish and sometimes is so over the top in it's action and violence and often even it's fast editing style which jumped from scene to scene as if filmed by a madman, reminded me of Russ Meyer's own editing style, which was very similar only he never really made a film like this and this editing feels like Russ Meyer's style with a day's worth of coffee and energy drinks thrown in. Before, I run out of space to write, I must say what I liked and disliked about this film to be a proper reviewer. Basically, there was nothing I did not like. Even though the action genre is definitely not my thing (never has been, never will be), I still liked Mad Max: Fury Road and found things to like and dare I say, even admire about the film. My biggest compliments probably come on the technical side of the film. The cinematography capturing a post apocalyptic wasteland and showing all the gritty and barren backgrounds to the absolutely and sometimes hideously looking people inhabiting this space, was all very well done. The makeup, costumes and cinematography was all first rate in every single way. The editing (which I described above) is also extremely impressive and worthy of praise here as well. The acting is definitely not award worthy, but I felt all these actors did really hold their own and did a decent enough job here. What, I really found impressive and an admirable trait for this film, was that a major studio like Warner Bros, would go to all the efforts to get this film made and spend one hundred fifty million dollars to do so, is an incredible feat and I am impressed that a major studio would shell out that kind of money for a film so offbeat and definitely bizarre as this one. Warner Bros and other major studios would do that type of thing all the time back in the day, but now unfortunately it is becoming more and more uncommon. Perhaps with this film there is still hope for Hollywood yet. As it stands, I will not give this film a star rating because I don't feel I can, but I did definitely enjoy the film and it certainly never left me bored for it's two hour running time."
"just_for_movies","8","4","10","23 May 2015"," Insane and exhilarating, but doesn't quite live up to the hype
","Mad Max: Fury Road is an insane movie boasting amazing stunts, great action, artistic cinematography, epic music, and much more. It had many good aspects to it but in the end it didn't quite live up to the hype.<br/><br/>The latest installment in the Mad Max franchise is essentially all about the action. The action is insane for sure and immensely thrilling to watch. George Miller has such a unique style when it comes to action and it definitely shows in his latest piece of work. The stunts are crazy and very believable as most of the stunts were done practically without the use of CGI. <br/><br/>The cinematography on this movie is splendid in it's own way. The colors are very saturated which oddly gives the movie a more gritty look. The camera work also fits nicely with the action.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for this movie is thrillingly epic and may be one of the best soundtrack out there. Each piece is electrifying and fits in perfectly with the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing as the two lead roles in this movie. They bring a sense of desperation to the movie and their characters. The supporting cast is also great in their specific parts.<br/><br/>The story/plot is not so important in this movie but it is still there and there are some important plot points one does not want to miss. There were some messy moments on the story but all in all, it felt complete. The pacing was very fast and there was next to no quiet time, but it still felt like the movie was evened out quite nicely. My only gripe is that the characters weren't fully developed. <br/><br/>In the end, Mad Max: Fury Road is an exhilarating ride with great action, music, cast, and cinematography. It was gritty and dark but extremely entertaining and thrilling. I had very high expectations for this movie and it didn't quite live up to the hype, but I still think that it's one of the best movies of 2015 so far."
"Alexandrspyr","8","4","10","21 May 2015"," At Last An Action Movie With Good Action?
","I wanted to see this really bad after witnessing the mountain of positive reviews and a score of 8.8 on this site, also I wanted to see if it was anything like The Road Warrior which I enjoyed immensely in my teens. So after watching this film in the theaters I have to agree with the hype, this movie is at last an action movie where you can actually freaking see what happens and where the action is kinda logical,where questions of ""how and why"" make sense and the moments when they don't are few and far in between.I feel like I have to make this clear, this is an action movie and should be reviewed as such(it is what it needed to be), compare this to most of the action movies that Hollywood produces each year and yes this is a masterpiece from that point of view. Although I don't know if I can agree with this being No25 movie of all times, but I can see the appeal of it.<br/><br/>The visuals where astonishing,not only can you almost see every detail that is important, it is also beautiful to look at. The stunts were amazing and directing from a technical point of view was really well done. The non stop action that glued you in your seat just wins the Oscar here, entertainment at its finest. The actors for the most part were good, Theron was awesome as Furiosa and the main villain Immortan Joe left a good impression on me, and the dialog was entertaining to say the least(what a lovely day indeed...). Why 8/10? Well, minus one point for some flaws here and there and for the plot which could be a tad better (although you can argue that it was good enough for an action movie), and minus one point for Tom Hardy as Mad Max. Although I don't consider him a bad actor or that he was horrible in this film, it might be just my personal bias because I liked Mel Gibson much better and I inevitably compare the 2 of them.<br/><br/>Overall this is an action movie that you have been dying to see, forget Transformers where you can barely see who fights who(scratch that, you can't see even that..) or Fast and Furious where a car under 1ton stops a freaking tank(yea that happened..), here you have Mad Max:Fury Road that retains the ridiculous over the top elements that its predecessor possessed combining it with non stop action that is clear and makes sense. Nothing more and nothing less."
"diac228","9","4","10","19 May 2015"," Explosive whirlwind of entertainment, no action fan will leave this film disappointed
","So this is what happens when you give George Miller a good budget. <br/><br/>Completing a recent trifecta of spectacular world cinema in the action category (The Raid 1 and 2), Mad Max Fury Road not only easily becomes among the top movies of 2015, but arguably amongst the best action movies this century. Two hours of absolute post-apocalyptic mayhem, this is one of the rare sequels that not only stands tall with the originals, but actually surpasses them. What used to slightly restrict the previous Mad Max movies were budget and technical limitations. But in the 21st century, with more money involved, and more resources to tap into, George Miller's decade-in-the-making vision comes to life in the most entertaining and thrilling way. <br/><br/>Fury Road may have the Mad Max tag, but his story is just one of many that roam around. The most impressive amongst the cast (Tom Hardy as Max really didn't have much to do outside participation in the carnage) is definitely Charlize Theron, who plays the tough-as-nails woman that jump-starts the action that will preside over the last 100 minutes of the film. Without mentioning too much, Theron (has there been a quieter action career than Theron?) as Furiosa steals a massive armored rig and raises absolute hell as she tries to make it to her childhood homeland with other prisoners. Crossing paths with her is Max, a loner with recovering from his past who also has been taken prisoner. Even though plot isn't usually a focus point in action movies of this caliber, there is plenty of social commentary and feminist themes to stir the pot. <br/><br/>While the verbal and storyline aspects are nothing to scoff at, the technical details of this movie is the headlining show here. Nearly flawless, from the art direction to the cinematography to the editing, the apocalypse has never looked so beautiful. The colors pop out at you, and the camera-work isn't shy of displaying the miles upon miles of nothingness that surrounds the characters. It truly feels like the end of the world as you see the small shadowy figures of vehicles maneuver through the layers of sand or see dark blue darkness when the sun mercifully comes down. And then you have the wide array of visually unique characters that look straight out of your pulp comic books (Yes, the guitar-playing fiend deserves his own story). It's a hauntingly beautiful ride. <br/><br/>Miller's directing is what makes the movie stand out. The action sequences are intense, relentless, and done with so much precision and attention to detail; you cannot look away from the screen a millisecond as you see the next round of carnage take place. This movie tries excruciatingly hard to separate itself from the pack of normal summer blockbusters, and it succeeds by pacing like a video game; continuously escalating and topping the previous action sequence. <br/><br/>The Raid movies also notoriously saved their best tricks for last. And my friends, even if you might be the slightest bit underwhelmed just wait until the final 30 minutes. Be prepared for some of the tightest and well-choreographed action since the criminally underrated Adventures of Tintin (The ""Opera Chase"" deserves much more love). The mix of special and practical effects blends in so well you swear you can smell the burning tires. The movie is one big long vehicular chase, and one that never starts feeling stale. <br/><br/>Summer may have peaked extremely early, because it will be very difficult to top the vicious joyride of Fury Road. From start to finish, from the top-tier acting right down to the sound effects, this Mad Max installment is the best hands-down, even though Hardy is no vintage Mel Gibson. Not sure what happened to American action filmmaking, but now Australia and Indonesia own the right to claim their country has produced the finest action flicks this decade. If you are in the mood for a highly entertaining yet original action extravaganza, look no further. By the time 2015 finishes, I can guarantee you that Mad Max Fury Road will remain as one of the best movies in the entire year."
"cheighlee","9","4","10","19 May 2015"," Watch it twice
","Way back, when I watched the Matrix for the first time, as did everyone else back then, I didn't know what to think about it. What did I just saw? How to process this? Is it good, better or even bad? Then I watched it again and it's actually that good and it's fresh. <br/><br/>Same thing here, watch it once to get into it and then re-watch it to understand it. Fury Road is so fast and stylishly paced that you just don't have the time to soak explosion of details and process all of it at once. Hence repeated viewing.<br/><br/>It's the movie Michael Bay wish he was 1/10th able to make one day, but he can't because he is a hack. It's Frank Miller's wet dream of how over the top everything and cranked up to 11 is but doesn't look crass and cheaply macho. Yes, this Miller, George, the Mad Max creator, Babe maestro, somehow pulled it off again and made Mad Max: Fury Road one of the super-blockbusters of the year 2015. And rightfully so.<br/><br/>One requirement is needed though. If you never saw older Mad Max movies, do that first. If you hadn't watch them in a long time, refresh your memory first. Not for the story but for the atmosphere that is so rich and unique, everyone's been copying it since the first and second movie. It does take a while to take you back into it emotionally, how everything is damn insane and silly in the Mad Max universe.<br/><br/>This movie drives you from start to finish in no time, no stopping, pedal to the metal and it's never boring. The opposite of this is the final fight between Zod and Superman in Man of Steel that lasted 45 mins and you were bored and/or sleeping from the get go. No, Fury Road keeps you engaged all the time.<br/><br/>And that's also one thing that actually choked this movie a bit. If you look closely you can see how magnificent and smart everything is and detailed, from cars, to costumes and characters. Movie just zooms through it and almost never lets you fully enjoy it, savor it. It's like Miller is saying to us ""We're not here for you and fan service, you're here for us, now enjoy."". Which I like - no BS and audience pandering, just getting straight to it, but I would also like more of everything... please. But judging from initial response from, well - everyone, we will probably get at least one more movie, named Mad Max: The Wasteland.<br/><br/>Performances are mostly solid, those breeder wives could get an acting lesson or two, but overall - solid. Super-kudos to massive amounts of practical effects and makeups. It looks great, gritty, so gritty and dry in fact that it actually made me thirsty while watching.<br/><br/>Really nothing more to say, go see the movie."
"jagslap","8","4","10","19 May 2015"," an action movie that stays with you
","Mad Max was really fun. Could probably have benefited from some more editing to improve the pacing though. They could have easily cut 15 minutes or so. i watched fury road earlier & it was a god damned THRILLRIDE.<br/><br/>really loved mad max. seeing the most recent trailer before another movie recently, i was sure this thing was gonna suck. and starting off, i thought the action in the 1st act was encroaching on emotionless bling, à la lightsaber fever. (i'm blaming that now on the 3D, but i will watch again to be sure. the 3D did enhance many areas later on.) but soon enough they started injecting the characters with life, and we were off. i say it all the time, but once a movie has me caring about it's people, i'm able to achieve suspension of disbelief and take the ride i'm supposed to take.<br/><br/>this latest version of the mad max universe was a masterful combination of the classic films and some creative new ideas. the mythology really entertained me and has me wanting to become a bigger fan of the series. i will definitely watch the original trilogy again. i had just watched them in 2014 but thanks to this film its time to go back already and really soak in as much of the mythos as possible. fury road has created a fanboy here. <br/><br/>the picture was photographically beautiful. i'll enjoy looking at all that again in the near future. lots to marvel at. but also cinematically there were great things going on. moments in the big road battles were actually breathtaking, and the retro zooms and framerate speeds added the perfect touch that both paid tribute to the classics and added to the manic feel of the movie. <br/><br/>i had also heard about the feminist interpretations of this film and i was not disappointed. this was my favorite charlize theron role ever. and the way they sort of deflated the cliché hero archetype to create this max was much appreciated here. i realize he wasn't super human in the originals either, but here we have a character who goes lower than anti-hero into pitiful territory. it's welcome in an age where we seem addicted to writing nauseatingly ""safe"" men in lead roles. the risk is taken here that max will not be idolized or even identified with by a large percent of the male population, and thats a refreshing change of pace."
"shadowyx12","9","4","10","19 May 2015"," A triumphant return to form for both Mad Max and George Miller!
","Let me just first say that right off the bat that Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most insane action films that I have ever seen! Although the film deviates heavily from the original trilogy in terms of aesthetics (the overtly orange-yellow palette, the ridiculousness of the action scenes...), the story and spirit remains pretty much the same: Max Rockatansky is trapped in a post- apocalyptic Australia and does all he can to survive - while getting involved in the dangerous affairs of others.<br/><br/>Prior to watching Fury Road, I quickly squeezed in some time to watch both the Mad Max and Mad Max: Road Warrior - both great movies in their own right. Entering Fury Road, I had some expectations of how the latest Mad Max installment would turn out. Based on my rating for this movie, one can say that my expectations were blown out of the water.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy as Mad Max is just as good as Mel Gibson as Mad Max. The character's lack of faith in humanity, paranoia of strangers, and sense of loneliness are all brought convincingly to the screen by Hardy. Not to mention, he can be just as brutal and violent - don't worry, some of the best action scenes in this film belong to Max (despite the belief that this movie eventually sidelines Max for Furiosa).<br/><br/>That's another thing that really surprised me - Charlize Theron as the tough-as-nails Imperator Furiosa. Not only is she completely unrecognizable in the role, but also (IMO) gives one of her career bests here! Her commanding presence on screen is proved by the fact that she can hold her own against any of the male characters (including Max), and that she can take great risks at the expense of the group she's trying to save. Along the way, she also makes a number of painful decisions that elevates the film's emotional impact. In all honestly, I'm hoping that Miller and Warner Bros. do a spin-off movie for Theron's character if Fury Road proves to be a success at the box office.<br/><br/>The story may seem simple and straightforward (it basically feels like two long, ridiculous car chases), but don't let that detract you from the fact that it is imbued with a deep sense of back-story and many complex themes. Despite what sceptics are saying, Mad Max: Fury Road is not some dumb, typical popcorn-flick. The film also lightly touches on a number of current social/political issues: gender equality, global warming, and authoritarianism. <br/><br/>Recently, I've been noticing a number of my reviews haven't been helpful too fellow readers. If anything, I believe one of the reasons why they aren't helpful may have to do with the fact that I assign a 'verdict' at the end of my reviews – telling people whether or not they should be watching the film on the big screen. I realized that in my short time as a movie reviewer, people will make that decision on their own regardless if they take my review into consideration. I also realize that he/she may actually end up liking a movie I gave a poor rating to or disliking a movie I gave a great rating to – and that I have to respect that. Starting with this review, I will no longer be putting 'verdicts' at the end of my reviews.<br/><br/>All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is designed and meant to be seen on the big screen. I'm certainly glad that I saw it on the big screen (even though at first I had no plans to see it at all), and highly recommend it to anyone. This is a great film; don't let the opportunity slip by."
"The_Film_Cricket","10","4","10","17 May 2015"," What a wild ride!
","What a grand, insane work of vision is Mad Max: Fury Road. This is what you wish for from all of your action movies: something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination, a movie that gets rolling and doesn't have time to stop; a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes can't catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around. Half the time you don't understand everything that you're looking at, but you don't really mind. It's so big, so grand, so full that it demands to be seen in a theater. I pity those who hold out for television.<br/><br/>What surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that I normally despise: The Reboot. Yes, George Miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create, but he's not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence, he's embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar road.<br/><br/>Thirty-six years ago, when Miller first conceived of Mad Max, he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future. His was a world gone mad, a savage and unholy world in which The Bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with. The participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they weren't driving spiked vehicles into one another, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. It was unique, it was visionary, and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever since.<br/><br/>In Mad Max: Fury Road, the McGuffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline. The plot here is thin enough that it doesn't bungle the action, but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity. We meet Max (Thomas Hardy) a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of PTSD – he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save. Before we can get a good look at Max, he is captured by The War Boys, a bald and skin-bleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling – imagine if Sweet Tooth from ""Twisted Metal"" were a rock star and you've got the idea. His cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of Australia with it's own war drums and guitar solo. No kidding, there's a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose! What follows along a pattern of Miller's four Mad Max movies is that in each movie, the world appears to be getting worse. In the first Mad Max, the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized. In Fury Road, the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state, still able to drive cars and have religious rites, but closer in common sense to apes then to man.<br/><br/>In the midst of this chaos, one of Joe's warriors, the one-armed Furiosa (Charleze Theron), goes rogue and steals one of Joe's War Rigs. What the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons. I won't spoil it, except to say that Mad Max: Fury Road isn't all boys with toys. As the movie moves into its second half, it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survival.<br/><br/>They exist amid a world in which every this is always moving. George Miller doesn't want you to catch your breath. He allows you two or three slow beats, but for most of it's running time, this is a movie that is always on the move. Essentially, it's a chase pictures, but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all. Even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense. The chase scenes have an orientation so that we don't just feel that we're watching a lot of nonsensical editing.<br/><br/>His palette is refreshing in that it's bright and colorful, forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see (look at the trailers for Dawn of Justice and The Fantastic Four and you'll see what I mean). But Mad Max takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun. We see everything, and there are bright colors, definitive colors. Every vehicle, every costume, every location and every character has their own texture and their own look.<br/><br/>What a crazy ride this is! What a unique visionary is George Miller. He is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as Mad Max and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as Babe. What he proves with Mad Max is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies. It is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us. He had a plan and he executed it beautifully. Just like his trucks, he kept his eye on the road, and he didn't stop for anything."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is an absolute cracker.<br/><br/>This film will grab you by the scruff of the neck and take you through a relentless journey of carnage, and by the end of it you will probably need a lie down. I know I certainly did.<br/><br/>In preparation for going to see this movie, I re-watched the originals, but there really is no need. Mad Max starts here. The originals will now feel like a barely noticeable gentle breeze on a warm summer's day, compared with this crashing hurricane of mayhem.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed beautifully, and the set pieces and action shots are utterly outstanding. None of this would matter if they didn't create the perfect atmospheric backdrop, but they manage that beautifully and neatly in the first ten minutes of the film. All of the characters are introduced, and the world feels real. It feels convincing. It feels utterly terrifying.<br/><br/>Then it sets off on a car chase and it doesn't let up for 110 minutes. There are explosions, moments of extreme violence, the odd moment of wit, a despicable villain, thought-provoking sub-themes, and it all adds up to a wonderful film.<br/><br/>More please."
"MattBirk","9","4","10","16 May 2015"," Another Amazing Chronicle of the Nomad Known as Mad Max
","Frank Miller has created a staple in the action movie genre, Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of a ride! Thankfully, Miller chose not to reboot the franchise starting with a dreadful origin story, instead he chose to follow along the path of 1981's The Road Warrior. The movie picks up after the death of his family where he struggles to survive on his own while he is continuously tormented by their deaths. We know just enough about Max to make the character work, but enough is left hidden to make him a cryptic warrior.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the movie is, of course, the action sequences which were mostly done via actually stuntmen. Something about knowing/seeing real people attempting all these crazy scenes/stunts makes the movie much more exciting and authentic. Fury Road is so fast paced and loaded with action galore, you never know what Miller has up his sleeve and what he is going to throw at us next. Though there was a moment or two where the movie seemed to be in action overload and a change of pace was needed. But what really drove the movie home was how he placed all this great action in an obscure, bizarre world where tyrants reign supreme. It's interesting to see the same things that we value today carry over into the post-apocalyptic world, food, water, and, of course, fuel. The world may be a wasteland, but some things never changed, the disparity between people will forever remain.<br/><br/>It was also great to see Max taking the backseat and letting Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the wives lead the movie. They, along with the clan of women, kick just as much if not more ass as Max and the War Boys. Fury Road is being praised for its thoughtful representation of females in the movie, which is absolutely true. Telling this tale with women is partially what makes the movie work so damn well. At the same time, Max is represented as the nomad who is caught in a war of two different parties and is doing nothing more than surviving. The core of the movie may be about Furiosa and her reaching for freedom but at the same time this is just another chronicle of the rogue warrior, Max.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road will EASILY go down as the best action movie of 2015, if not one of the best of the past 25 years! It's safe to say that Mad Max is here to stay, especially since Tom Hardy is signed on for THREE more films! Style and action haven't mixed this well in years!"

","I never got the chance to see the previous Mad Max films, starring Mel Gibson, so I went into this with no lines to follow. After hearing so much about it, and reading almost every review I could come across, I must say, I was exited! First thing first, I got what I expected, leaving the theater with a smile and my body comfortably numb. <br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 Australian post-apocalyptic action thriller film directed, produced, and co-written by George Miller, and the fourth film of Miller's Mad Max franchise. The first film of the franchise in 30 years, Fury Road stars Tom Hardy as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, making it also the first Mad Max film not to feature Mel Gibson in the title role. The film also stars Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult."" Instead of making this a review within a thousand words, I'll make some pointers below:<br/><br/>WHAT I LOVED:<br/><br/>+ Charlize Theron is excellent. What a performance! + Nicholas Hoult is also excellent! + I'm not a fan of post-apocalyptic movies. This one, I liked. + Anyone else felt like this was a non-stop, over-the-top inferno of twisted metal, bones cracking, explosions and gasoline? I did! + Costuming looks great. Amazing attention to detail. + I loved Furiosa as a character. + Amazing visual effects!<br/><br/>WHAT BOTHERED ME A BIT:<br/><br/><ul><li>I wanted more from Tom Hardy - Though I liked the score at some points, it was too generic to me. 60% of the music in this film did not feel original, and it felt way to forced sometimes. You ever get that feeling when you watch a scene, and you think ""How would this work out with no soundtrack at all?"" Is this really necessary here? - Again, the soundtrack. After all the action, I would appreciate a small window of silence. The dialog did not always strike me when the music kind off ""was in the way a bit."" This made it a struggle to get emotionally attached to the characters. - I expected EVEN MORE from the action scenes at some point. - Some scenes felt a bit rushed, and some did'nt. Unfortunately, the wrong scenes sometimes felt rushed or dragged. </li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, a great action movie! The best ever? No. Did it meet my expectations? Hell yes. Was it perfect? No. <br/><br/>I never give movies a 10 or a 1. This one, for me: 8,4."

","Mad Max Fury Road is everything you've never expected from a modern day action movie. And if you've set your expectations low or aren't into post-apocalyptic movies, you'll be in for a surprise. And by the end of it, you'd have wished that you'd never thought so low about George Miller's ambitious masterpiece.<br/><br/>30 years since the fourth movie, George Miller sets Mad Max Fury Road in a world where almost everybody has gone insane, including its lead, Max Rockatansky. The plot is paper thin and its nothing but an escort mission, lead by Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa, through barren post-apocalyptic wastelands and chased by the main antagonist, Immortan Joe and his maniac War Boys. This is a standalone movie and can hold strong on its own, but if you do want to get into the tone and mood of Mad Max, you oughta watch the old trilogy as it also sheds some light on Max's story and arguably on who Immortan Joe really would be.<br/><br/>Its one orgasmic chase sequence, from start to end, and there is little room for character development. But who's complaining when you are glued to your seats, entertained shitless with its almost unrelenting brutal action. Nothing can prepare you for the intense action in Mad Max Fury Road and this review might feel meaningless until and unless you've experienced it. Its all out gritty and it'd help if you've got a wicked sense of humour. You are also not given much time to think as you are pushed from to one action set piece to the next.<br/><br/>As Max, Tom Hardy does have an ample role to play in the narrative, but this is essentially a Furiosa movie set in the Mad Max universe. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is indeed the lead protagonist and Max just accompanies here in her insanely dangerous 'road trip' and you cant help but applause at Theron's strong performance here. I am not a huge Nicholas Hoult fan, but in Mad Max he delivers as Nux. As for Immortan Joe, Hugh Keays-Byrne delivers and it is a real feat when he has a mask on which covers most of his face. It would have been great if they had shown his face at least once, at least for old time's sake to see how 'Toecutter' from the original looked like now.<br/><br/>The visuals, doubtlessly, are spectacular and what adds to the sheer beauty of it are practical effects. We've all been conditioned to watching and, growing on, CGI heavy movies this past decade and the difference here could be instantaneously felt. Its not completely devoid of CGI wizardry but practical effects dominates the visuals here and its nothing less than eye popping. For the first time, normal 3D felt serviceable and at the same time I kept repenting that I didn't see it in IMAX. You know its good when you see your partner dodging car parts and entrails every now and then. Normal 3D does wash out, what would have otherwise been, a brilliant color palette and the end result is a somewhat dark and de-saturated film. Exceptional sound design and Junkie XL's background score is the cherry on top.<br/><br/>Compared to the old trilogy, The Road Warrior still stands supreme. Suffice to say, Mad Max Fury Road had me, breathless, gaping at the extremely well choreographed action sequences. I had to wait a few hours before I could collect my thoughts on the movie and rant about it. This is by far the best action movie I have seen this year, OH YES, much better than Avengers Age Of Ultron. As for the feminism critique revolving this movie.WHO CARES! This here is a fine piece of action cinema, Thank you, George Miller!"

","I just got back from seeing an advanced showing of Mad Max: Fury Road which I was extremely excited to see. It did not disappoint.<br/><br/>It Exceeded My Expectations.<br/><br/>It is one of the greatest movies of the decade.<br/><br/>Where to begin with such a spectacular film? The film is Rated R, but The Action Scenes which are some of the best I have seen in a very long time make it seem PG-13. An amazing way to get younger kids that are in the 13-15 year range to see it. But just because the violence is more PG-13 doesn't mean it's bad, it's freaking amazing! The movie's action scenes focus was on the cars and my god it is creative and brilliant.<br/><br/>The actors are all great and crazy. Nicholas Hoult as Nux is the performance of the year. Nux is an amazing character because he starts out crazy, but ends up finding out his true destiny and learning from the other humans. I would have never expected this from any movie. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are amazing in this as well. <br/><br/>Everything is amazing. The Direction, The Writing, The Effects, The Sound, The Editing, The Camera Work, The Music which is done by Junkie XL, I was even in love with the movie's color! Yes! The Color Scheme of the movie is excellent, Blue and Orange being the most vibrant and important to the whole setting of the film.<br/><br/>I cannot express myself more to say that this is one of the greatest motion pictures of the decade, if not the century, if not one of the greatest films of all time. This is a film that is going to define all blockbusters to come. Mad Max Fury Road is almost perfect, a vibrant, crazy as hell, energetic joyride that deserves to be a success and should be seen by everyone, even those who have not even seen a single Mad Max film. <br/><br/>To put it bluntly, it will be a lovely day when you see this film.<br/><br/>98/100 A"

","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much."
"ramair350","6","5","14","5 June 2015"," Basically a live-action movie of the ""Motostorm"" Playstation game
","This is a well-done action move. End of praise.<br/><br/>I am shocked that this movie is trending at 98% ""fresh"" on another website that aggregates critic reviews. But I guess that measurement is basically saying that most people agree the movie is ""good"" (and not ""bad""), yet the depth and ""how good"" the movie is is not reflected in the score.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a solid 6 out of 10; it IS a decent action movie, more ""good"" than ""bad"", yet there is little depth to the film. Seriously, this feels like a script that would have been written to fabricate a ""story"" to fit the Playstation 3 game ""Motostorm"", which is essentially a bunch of crazy vehicles racing in a post-apocalyptic desert location. Well, that is basically the plot of Mad Max. The acting IS good, but don't expect the best movie ever; this is not a Chris Nolan style action movie, folks.<br/><br/>By the way, I AM old and a fan of all of the original films (even Thunderdome); this one is a fine reboot, but is so over-the-top I would rank it slightly behind the original series since the action sequences are pretty much unbelievable (although I did appreciate that many of the sequences were true live-action and not 100% CGI, although there is some obvious CGI going on plenty of times).<br/><br/>Recommended if you want a decent non-stop action movie without much plot."
"Al_The_Strange","10","5","14","19 May 2015"," ""If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane.""
","The world of Mad Max has progressively become madder and madder; 30 years after the third film, Fury Road presents a fresh, new tale in the mythos of the legendary road warrior. This time, the picture the film paints of the future is far more vivid than anything that's come before. Against the backdrop of harsh desolation and vicious tyranny, the stage is set for a new round of intense vehicular carnage: what follows is a relentless onslaught of bullets, fire, and bloodshed.<br/><br/>This film starts off fast and furious, and it keeps the pacing up all the way to its finale. It can be generalized as one two-hour chase scene, but that's not to say that the action ever becomes dull, or that the film never takes the time to breathe; like any great blockbuster experience, it's a roller-coaster ride so full of ups and downs that it keeps the audience exhilarated constantly. The film's chases are the biggest highlights; there are a plethora of incredibly well-designed vehicles that crash and burn in phenomenal ways, while the characters fight and struggle across the moving cars. The film is consistently loud, explosive, and intense. When the characters do manage to catch a break, the characters struggle against each other and against the elements, so there's hardly any drag at all.<br/><br/>Within and outside of the action scenes, the film tells the story it needs to, and it does so with minimal use of exposition, very effectively showing more than it tells. In the same vein as The Raid, Dredd, or Duel, which were simple stories centered around the situation, so too does Fury Road use its central chase scenes as a basic skeleton from which to add on more to the characters and story. The characters are a compelling bunch; Max is reintroduced to us as a broken man, still haunted by events of the past (which are shown in rapid-fire flashbacks, and differ vastly from what's shown in Mad Max). Max's journey becomes entwined with that of Furiosa, a tough and brave woman whose motivations are revealed as the plot moves on. Together, Max and Furiosa represent two characters who are broken in some way, and join forces to fight their way to liberation and freedom. Some audiences have said that Furiosa is more the main character than Max, but I find that both share screen time equally, to complement each other the same way Max had to share time with everybody else in The Road Warrior as a rogue element. What might throw people off is that Max doesn't speak much in this film; what little he says is gruff and crude, and he fills the rest of the space with a few grunts and noises. However, Max remains the narrative focus of the film, as it tracks his journey in and out of bondage, and finally to liberation, to become a legendary drifter once more.<br/><br/>This film is captured with fantastic photography and punchy editing. Color schemes are very bright and vivid. Filling in the shoes that Mel Gibson left behind, Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky with a phenomenal presence, and with blunt, animalistic dialogue, which is fitting for the primal world he inhabits. Charlize Theron plays it tough as Furiosa, but with enough distress to elicit sympathy for her struggle, and make her character well-grounded and well-rounded. Nicholas Hoult is surprisingly lovable in his role, and Hugh Keays-Byrne exudes a phenomenal presence as Immortan Joe, who stands as one of the most chilling villains I've seen in a while. Writing is concise and it gets the job done. This production has loads of superbly detailed sets, props, and costumes, all of which brings the post-apocalyptic world to life fantastically. It all contributes to showing and illustrating the culture of the War Boys, which shows plenty of well thought-out ideas and concepts. Most stunts and crashes were done practically; what few special effects the film has are used precisely and effectively, and are great. JXL's music score adds to the experience admirably.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is easily the best-looking film of the series, and it boasts the biggest and most brutal action scenes. It's a perfect example of how a simple premise can be used to tell an invoking story and craft an exhilarating experience. Best of all, it does so using the power of images and sound, just as cinema should.<br/><br/>5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
"nat43","6","5","14","19 May 2015"," Very disappointed
","The makers threw away so much potential in this movie that it hurts. The script is very poor in terms of logic and depth and only great at creating super eye candy action scenes and nothing else. The world they created holds big potential but they didn't care at all to show it and how it works. The little things we see do not make much sense left alone and surely create unnecessary thoughts in some viewers distracting them from staying in the never ending action. Because of this action only perspective the movie could get even boring for a few people craving for a bit more than action on the road till the very end. The entire plot is totally idiotic to be honest and serves only the purpose to create one action scene after the other. If you manage to shut down your brain for the 2 hours running time you might be able to love this movie, and I think it is sad to see how many people are able to do just that, because like this there is no reason for the producers and studios to care more about the script and they will continue make idiotic empty eye candy movies. I gave it 6 out of 10, because the part they focused on they did great."

","In an era of CGI-filled movies it's so refreshing and awesome to see a movie like this that uses so many practical effects. The cars they had to build and the explosions, the costumes, the makeup, it was all amazing. You can tell that this movie was made with love and treated with care. The entire movie is basically one big action scene, but there are character development moments and it's never shown through expository dialogue as this is a movie that is told almost exclusively through actions. The performances are pretty good and the world created by George Miller feels real and it's spectacular. <br/><br/>There is only one thing I genuinely dislike about this film and that is that there is a moment near the end of the film that the way it was shot it looks completely CGI and it looks like it was just there to be shown in 3D. Next to the entire practicality and realness of the film, it really seems out of place. This is a very minor detail because I loved everything else about Fury Road. This was one of the best movie experiences of my life! This movie was awesome! The action was super intense, but it wasn't dull, lame car crashes (Need 4 Speed). The world created by George Miller is amazing and it has really cool characters too. This is definitely the best movie of the year so far and definitely one of the best action movies I have ever seen. Also, by far the best Mad Max. A+ Action movie that will BLOW your mind. The score is great and the sound effects are awesome. The movie is very quickly paced and it's never boring. Great film.<br/><br/>9.9/10"
"nick-sultana","10","5","14","17 May 2015"," A Mad & Fury Blockbuster Worth The Hype
","When a few years back, Australian director George Miller announced a new Mad Max film would be in the works but sadly it would have taken over 25 years for the project to fly off the development stages (as there was issues with production, locations and even script development over the years) but this year was the year audiences would finally see it on the screen in this final completed work. The question is for all fans was; would it be worth the wait all these years to happen, and would it be worthy as its original trilogy? The following summary below pretty much sums up the wait and anticipation had really paid off for both the fans and the filmmakers. <br/><br/>Fury Road is a worthy wild action ride that packs punch, value and high quality into the trilogy that was established previously, it can be considered both a reboot and a sequel but this enables Miller to expand the wasteland universe and to further the life of the 'Road Warrior' Max. Having seen the trilogy countless times, we are immediately aware of the production value it should carry, but with the film having the biggest budget to use (beating the trilogy's separate budget values), Miller crafts not only an epic film in action and storytelling, but in terms of value, concept and direction he gives us a shining feature that stands strongly and respectively for the fans of the franchise. <br/><br/>Casting in the film was great, in particular marks the first time that a different actor has filled in the shoes and duty of portraying Max and that actor was Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Lokie, Bronson and Inception). At the time when it was announced of his role, fans both agreed or disagreed with this casting choice as he was of British decent and it was Mel Gibson that defined the role as iconic for both him and the franchise. With Hardy, he gives a solid performance that makes us feel that Max has still strong after so many years past since Thunderdome, and pulls it off without no flaws that makes him solid like Gibson. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron plays as Furiosa, a character that seems to take the leading action role as much as Hardy but there has been criticism from various anti-feminist groups that she is more dominate and more action-oriented than Hardy's character on screen and thus making fans feel that Max is a secondary character. From my perspective, this is a false fact as Max does play a major role throughout the story; as he's assisting with Furiosa's journey of redemption to bring the women into a safer world, without Max's assistance she may not have survived Joe's ambush and violent attacks to stop her.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes the talents of Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Warm Bodies), Hugh Keays-Byrne (From the original Mad Max), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Nathan Jones and Megan Gale to name some, in which all play great performances in their roles. From my eye, Hoult makes homage to the Gyro Captain (from Mad Max 2) that's in the form of his wild boy character Nux while Byrne's Immortan Joe is dominate as the villain and bares the similar voice with Bane (played by Hardy ) with tension and pure bad buy quality (there's barely any bad dialogue from him or any of the characters).<br/><br/>In terms of action, Fury Road is indeed a major contender for action quality that matches not only the quality from the previous films but takes it further in terms of stunts, practical effects and choreography work. From explosive crashes, high-wired acrobats, jumping and moving along moving vehicles and fist fights on top of tankers, the film does it with amazing eye for detail and realism using practical effects and stunt people whilst using minimal CGI to assist the action or landscape. The fast and clear camera work and editing makes the action sequences seem so beautiful, brutal and flat out insane that it leaves the recent Fast and Furious films in the dirt and in shame.<br/><br/>Cinematography, sound mixing, editing and practical effects are all top notch throughout the film, Miller and his crew give the action, story, its characters and its deserted environment a style that has been missing from the genre for sometime (though a few today have occurred to be solid examples such as The Raid 2, Furious 7, Kingsman and even some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films) but Miller reignites both the genre and his style of filmmaking that make it seem possible for the film to get Oscar worthy consideration in 2016; which would be nominated for best cinematography, sound mixing/editing, visual effects and possibly direction. The amazing cars featured (including the signature Interceptor) are all real, detailed and seemed so based from the minds of Miller and his design team and it's a true fact that 350 vehicles were used in the film, but who knows how many of them were destroyed during the making of the film (I hope the future home entertainment release will feature a behind the scenes look into this and the production values).<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic action ride that delivers solid entertainment for both action fans and fans of the original trilogy, Miller has taken so many years to get this franchise back on the screen and the results we see are the best we've seen in filmmaking and the genre itself. This is perhaps my favourite film I've seen alongside Age of Ultron, CHAPPiE, Kingsman: The Secret Service and Birdman but this film stands at the first position and earns itself an 'Seal of Approval' for quality entertainment."

","Get ready to replace your eyeballs after this experience, as Max Rockatansky is back in his most explosive, sensory overloading, vehicular led journey yet! Fury Road, a petrolhead's sand infused dream come to beautiful yet utterly bonkers existence in George Millers long gestating action extravaganza, that not only laughs in the face of modern blockbusters, but blows them away by creating some of the most outstanding carnage ever captured for our screens. <br/><br/>In a modern day and age where it's hard for action events to differentiate themselves from each other, blockbusters that are CGI laden and shaky cam heavy, Fury Road does the impossible and turns what is essentially a 2 hour long desert set car chase into something that is unique and refreshingly mad. With a budget in the hundreds of millions and a crew that clearly knew how to deliver the goods, 70 year old director Miller has had his visions come to roaring fruition, from the cars, the inhabitants and the milk productions, this is the apocalyptic wasteland that Miller must of envisioned all the way back with the original Mad Max, but only know did technology met the requirements. <br/><br/>It's without question that what elevates Fury Road to the next level of pure cinematic enjoyment is the fact that the world we enter into for these 2 adrenaline fuelled hours is a world that feels like a living breathing entity, a handcrafted and often destructively beautiful labour of love. There will be a constant reminder to oneself that what you are seeing is largely perfectly constructed stunts and props played out to painstakingly elaborate setups. Every clash of metal on metal, every loud burst of exhaustive vehicle power and every swaying stunt man is a sight to behold and thanks to a thankfully strong cast of leads and supports, Miller's orchestrated chaos is not lost by the wayside.<br/><br/>It was never going to be an easy task for the actor stepping into Mel Gibson's leather boots, but man of the moment Tom Hardy does a solid if slightly unmemorable job in his new gig, in what is a role that sees Max play wingman to Charlize Theron's feisty and soon to be iconic Imperator Furiosa. It's a criticism of the film that it does seemingly waste an opportunity to get more out of Hardy and while there are small moments of greatness and thankfully humour (Max heading off at night-time to take care of a car full of bandits springs to mind) his turn is not a highpoint of the film. While criticism can be made of this aspect of Fury Road, it's also in an opposite effect a huge win for the film that it doesn't rely solely on the charisma or bulking presence of Hardy to succeed and finds great moments when Theron takes centre stage and in the moments from support from Nicholas Hoult as bad luck War Boy Nux and a fantastic bandit named Doof Warrior who takes inspiration from Jimi Hendrix with his axe work. <br/><br/>An action event of recent times unparalleled equals and quite possibly one of the most purely visceral and intense action films ever made, this wild and frightfully wild car chase is going to please fans of not only the Mad Max universe but cinema fans the world over. George Miller toiled long and hard to get his ultimate vision to our screens and after all his blood sweat and tears its fantastic to be able to say Fury Road is the great success that it is and hopefully the beginning of an all new saga for our beloved road warrior. <br/><br/>4 and a half dedicated guitar players out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","What was the purpose of this film? It has a budget that is many times greater than the original film, and none of the qualities that Mad Max had. The 80s film was great fun and it reflected much of the spirit of that decade. It was also simple, sincere, and despite the violence, quite innocent in intent. But what about this new version? It has no reason to exist, other than to make money. It is not an homage to the 80s in any real sense, it exploits that era's cinematic ingenuity, bastardizes it and throws in all kinds of nonsense that plague our nihilistic age. The new film is a film about nothing, it is sterile and empty of meaning. It is a p.c. nightmare in which lone women drive cars in deserts and beat men up to survive. It's kind of ironic that a film about anarchy, rebellion, and brute struggle for survival actually caters to the sensibilities of a weak, entitled, spoiled, deluded, politically correct generation that conforms completely and indulges in fantasies about human nature that have no basis in reality and that would be shattered in an instant in the kind of universe Mad Max depicts."

","Well, it took me all of 5 years to get round to seeing the bloody overpraised monstrosity, so I accept I might not be the target demographic, but even so: how anybody ever had the nerve to call Fury Road a great film is beyond me. It has all the depth, plot and character development of a pinball machine.<br/><br/>It's not a TERRIBLE film, but it IS a very dull, empty and meaningless one, with no believable, likeable or even understandable characters in sight, and pretty much the entire cast, with the possible exception of Charlize Theron, is Australian soap opera level at best, and the bevy of supermodel brides some way below that. Tom Hardy's accent seems to roam across three continents for no discernible reason throughout, changing nationality from line to line and scene to scene on a whim. The dialogue is to all intents and purposes non-existent, certainly overwhelmingly unnecessary, consisting primarily of people pointing and screaming things like ""I'M GOING OVER THERE NOW!""<br/><br/>Having said all that, and excusing the gaudy overabundance of CGI, I will say some of the action scenes are handled well, with a few good set-pieces and the occasional spot of successful tension-building thrown in. And maybe today that's all some people need."

Max, an officer without any legal support, is left without any options but to take the law on his personal hands against those who killed his wife and son. It is clear the Justice system cannot help him. Max becomes a brutal revenger hunting down and murdering those who had the law ""protection"".

","I have a friend. I don't know if he wants me to use his real name so we'll call him Ben. Ben is what I would call a radical film fan. We were in the same high school TV and Video Production class and we both love film, but he's a radical film fan. So when he came to school and told me ""Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film I've ever had the privilege to watch in theaters."" I replied, ""Chill out dude I'm sure it's good but it's not that good."" He kept on hyping it for me so when I eventually did see it, it was not even close to what I was expecting. It took me three viewings of Mad Max: Fury Road for me to realize it was a great film. I have now come to the conclusion, that although Spotlight was a GREAT movie, Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film of 2015. There has never been a director I've watched in my life that took more risks with the camera than George Miller in this movie. He directs the crap out of this movie. It is one of the best directed films I've ever seen, and my film watching career includes over 500 movies. The acting is first rate and spectacular, however the visuals and absolutely fantastic imagery overtake the great performances across the board which further proves my point that it is a fantastically directed movie. I can't find a single flaw with this film. If it had won best picture I would have been one happy camper. It is a GREAT movie, and I will be upset if it does not make this years AFI top 100. You are doing yourself a major disservice if you do not see this movie, it is beyond what I would call a great film. Mad Max: Fury Road is the Best action film, nay the best movie I've watched in the past 10 years. WATCH IT NOW, BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND."

"dansubs-415-765148","3","3","7","13 February 2016"," A road chase that never ends
","First its important to say what Mad Max Fury Road isn't. The rich vein that was the story and world of the original Mad Max movie is destroyed along with the car in the first ten minutes. That effectively is the end of the Mad Max connection and back story and now we start a road chase that goes for two hours out into the desert.<br/><br/>Some fantastic stunts and rare Australian cars are destroyed for an audience who probably never appreciated what they were looking at in the first place, as Max goes for a ride in a truck. Max is a sideline character in his own film as an actor not suited to the character mostly grunts his way through a film where he occasionally tries with mixed success to carry an Australian accent. To be fair the whole film tries and fails to be Australian, as part of this film were shot in Africa and its painfully obvious to those who know what Australia should look like.<br/><br/>This film is intended to be a rich visual stunt spectacular and at that it truly does succeed. The story itself could have been written in an afternoon after lunch and is intended not to stretch the brain cells of the audience so their heads wont hurt. It is all about the visuals and really did I mention the visuals. <br/><br/>So if you were hoping for a genuine Mad Max reboot, the answer is a firm no. This film is in no way for you. If you want to watch some well done visual stunts and you thought Fast and the Furious was the most realistic and well written film franchise you have ever seen - Mad Max Fury Road is waiting for you.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad film if you part your brain, but it isn't in any way Mad Max and that is the problem.<br/><br/>At least it was better than Beyond Thunderdome."
"MrPersonGuyMan","10","3","7","19 January 2016"," ★★★★
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a genre film of the highest order, one that torpedoes through its genre conventions in an eruption of smoke and rust and would sooner perish than take a moment to dust off its shoulders. It is a film drenched in gasoline and liquid anarchy, splurting flames out of its umpteen exhaust pipes and rumbling so deeply the back of your skull starts itching. Director George Miller, who also directed the past three Mad Max films, released his last entry ""Thunderdome"" three decades ago, and this one seems to have bathed (or scorched) in the vivid gleam of his wildest fantasies for every minute of them.<br/><br/>While Thunderdome has since garnered a reputation for being the worst entry in the series – my thoughts being the exact inverse – Fury Road brings a previously unknown dimension in modern technique to its proceedings that adds to the effect in ways that would never have been possible back in the franchise's time. Miller's latest is an unceasing succession of sensational action sequences– a visceral circus act that isn't content with simply juggling chainsaws; they must be ablaze, while it walks a tightrope that is also ablaze.<br/><br/>Max Rockatansky, who we've come to know as Mel Gibson's post- apocalypse persona, is recast as Tom Hardy, whose formidable presence has not been lost upon the chaos and the Madness of the world around him. He is a man haunted by his past trespasses and hunted by whoever is within proximity. This world, brought to a wastelandic extreme we've yet to see from this series, is ruled in part by a tyrannical dictator by the name of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a creature whose mask can only remind viewers of Hardy's previous role as Bane in ""DKR"". His cult is in possession of a spectacular array of vehicles that make for chase scenes that set out to overwhelm and succeed.<br/><br/>Joe and his army are in pursuit of Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a female warrior of Joe's who sets out to escape his wrath with his Five Wives in tow. Here is where the film's feminist undercurrent is rooted, in the developments of these women who have none but themselves to look towards in the midst of mayhem. In the previous films, the mere presence of a woman on-screen has been sufficient cause for unease, the promise of death or worse perpetually shimmering on the horizon, drawing ever near with each passing moment. That raw fear has since driven these women to adopt a fierce will to survive while shielding their perceived delicacy from the cruel outside. They are powerful but nonetheless fragile, beautiful but capable; an oasis of purity in what is very much a man's world.<br/><br/>Among those pursuing them is a War Boy named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a blindly devoted member of Joe's army who is also Max's captor. He employs him as a ""blood bag"" and a living masthead of sorts for his vehicle. Nux serves his master with a raging loyalty and a belief that his efforts will secure him a place in Valhalla alongside the best of them. They follow the pack into battle, and from this point forward, the film sets a cinderblock upon the gas pedal and hunches over the steering wheel, crazed and with black rings around its eyes. The entire film is in essence one long chase, ebbing and flowing, constantly involving, and always aware of its surroundings. The chase scenes in Fury Road aren't simply a means to a cheap thrill; they explore all that is possible within the boundaries of their convention. They have spatial awareness, making full use of the depth of space around the vehicles. An explosion isn't something that just happens for the sake of an explosion; you see where it is in relation to everything else, how it affects the surroundings, whether it changes the state of play. The cars don't simply inhabit the desert environment; they are integrated into it, which means the stunts are allowed to be as fluid and elegant as those you would expect to see in a Jackie Chan movie.<br/><br/>It's gratifying to watch Miller's supercharged imagination run wild across the screen. The characters are all either desperate for purpose or starved of reason. With bodies painted white and faces in various stages of embellishment or disfigurement. They howl, they pant – you'd swear they guzzle octane like OJ. The vehicles are all tattered assemblies of the remnants of our society, tricked out in various ways that suggest a Transformer's rendition of ""Frankenstein"". The set pieces are monuments of modern filmmaking. The initial chase involves a storm, which is all I'm willing to divulge, as I can neither bear spoiling the scene any further nor ever come close to doing it justice. And then the movie tops it with each new sequence. The canvas is saturated with colors that would be too rich for a desert wasteland but for the vision of its artisan.<br/><br/>Max, one who for the most part faces his inner demons in anguished silence, seems to take the passenger-seat to Furiosa, who is a force to be reckoned with, as beautiful as she is unrelenting. Her black- sheen brow, shaved head, and mechanical arm all tell stories about her before she utters a word. Applause is also due towards the wives, who escape from the citadel in search of a better world that may not be and never have been. They ground the events in a sense of urgency, a realism brought about by the conviction in fighting for a cause which keeps the film from mushrooming into a 2-hour blowout of unchecked excess and insanity. Well... completely.<br/><br/>I just about enjoyed every minute of Fury Road; in a phrase, it was exhilarating. In another, it is one of the year's best films. This isn't a reboot of a classic franchise, or even a proper sequel; it's an evolution."

","Starting with the frenetic, sped up camera shots at the beginning, until the end (which should have been within the first 2 minutes), this schlock paled in comparison to the 3 preceding films. And I'm not saying this because of nostalgia or some codger notion of ""the original's always the best"".<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was just so...goofy, unnecessary, and annoyingly dumb. Admittedly I would have rather seen Mel Gibson climbing out of the car in the beginning, but obviously Tom Hardy took the reins instead. And I had no problem with that, he did a good job in the TDKR, so that didn't really skew my opinion. And Charlize Theron is a good actress, I had no problem with her being in the film either.<br/><br/>The problem wasn't the casting choices. The problem with this film was the film itself. It had a poor screenplay, script, storyboarding, characters, etc. It lacked all the excitement and intensity of the original films and replaced with again, goofiness and half brained stupidity. With the exception of the film quality (HD), I have nothing positive to say about this film."

Instead, she has freed Immortan Joe's imprisoned wives and escaping back to her former home, the Green Place. Max is chained as a blood bag on the front of his car with War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).<br/><br/>The action is unrelenting. The car stunts are amazing and fully worthy of the Mad Max name. It is pure energy on screen. The only thing missing is a gyrocopter and Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy is physically acceptable as Mad Max although I'm not thrilled with the character. He's lost a bit of the spark. The spark he lost has been transferred to Furiosa and has lit a blazing inferno. She is more Mad Max than Mad Max. I am also pleasantly surprised that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is actually good in this movie. The action, the outrageous vehicles and the pure energy make this something unlike anything else.

","Mad action blasts away any urge to fall asleep through this movie. Car chases, explosions, combat, and babes all interplay well so boredom ceases. Scenes of bad guy fortresses, vehicles, and weapons stack the odds pretty high against Max and his new found friends. Everyone there pushes to the limit. Even little crony bad guys put up decent fights. Even one or two of the super model ladies pull a couple ones. Watching this movie in 3D just amplifies all this action, and the color choices just really brought out the Gothic post apocalyptic setting. Barren and thirsty lands seem sweltering while five peoples face scarce resources and corruption. Each group of people showcase slight competitive advantages which Mad Max's band just blows to shreds."
"craig-s-nelson72","7","3","7","16 May 2015"," Mad Furiosa: Fury Road
","I saw the movie this evening and thought it was good, but not as good as Mel Gibson in The Road Warrior from 1981.<br/><br/>I would only rate Fury Road a 7.0, not the high 8's like it is now.<br/><br/>I thought the following.........<br/><br/>1) This was more about Imperator Furiosa and her fight against the tyrannical Immortan Joe. She was the main character in this movie, Max was the supporting character. The real title of this movie should have been Mad Furiosa: Fury Road.<br/><br/>2) I grew up during the original three Mad Max movies. I intimately know The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, and are in my top 10 films of all time. Was this supposed to be a reboot? Or was it supposed to be a sequel? 3) For the younger crowd who didn't see the first three movies, how are they supposed to know who Max is? There was little to no development of his character. We don't know why he is out there in the wasteland. We don't know his history and what happened to his family from the likes of Toecutter.<br/><br/>4) In Mad Max and The Road Warrior, Max's Ford Falcon XB GT Police Interceptor was a major ""character"" in those films. However, in Fury Road, the car had very little screen time as it was flipped over in the first 3 minutes. Then we only saw it repaired and painted in a silver color in certain shots as the War Boys were chasing Furiosa.<br/><br/>5) I thought Immortan Joe was very interesting and was a better character than The Humungus, although very memorable, in The Road Warrior. Hugh-Keays Byrne was an excellent choice. That face and the mask leaves a psychological impression. In case people don't know, Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in the 1979 Mad Max film.<br/><br/>6) For me, part of the appeal of the first three movies was the unmistakable heavy Aussie accents by everyone in the films.........excluding Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and Master (Angelo Rossito) in Thunderdome. In Fury Road, everyone had a non-specific ""British"" accent. It was kind of a hodgepodge or a hybrid of Aussie meets British accents. British and Aussie accents are distinctly different. Tom Hardy does not sound Australian. Charlize Theron sounded like her normal American self, except for when she said ""Gayzzolyne"", trying to sound Aussie.<br/><br/>7) Perhaps the most memorable bad guy character in the Road Warrior was Wez (Vernon Wells) with the Mohawk and ass-less chaps. He has lots of screen time and had that cinematic dominance on screen. Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) did not seem like a dominant bad guy character in this movie. He is just huge. Jones is 6'11"" and 350+ pounds of pure muscle.<br/><br/>8) What kind of dust storm was that supposed to be? Not like anything I've ever seen. Maybe it was a nuclear dust storm? 9) Finally......the chase scenes and the cars. Just as good, if not better than the first three Mad Max movies.<br/><br/>That is all............."

","I saw ""Mad Max:Fury Road"", starring Tom Hardy-Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, Sucker Punch; Charlize Theron-Prometheus, Reindeer Games; Nicholas Hoult-Beast in the X-Men movies including the next one, Warm Bodies and Hugh Keays-Byrne-Farscape_tv, Mad Max_1979.<br/><br/>This is an action packed reboot of the Mad Max movies from 1979-1985, that starred Mel Gibson, and no, he does not make an appearance in this new one. It is directed by the same man that directed the original 3 movies from 30 years ago, George Miller. In this reboot, Tom plays Max, an ex-cop living in the dark, apocalyptic world of the not too distant future, where there is a shortage of resources, mostly gas and water. Hugh is the man in charge of a place called the citadel, where he dishes out supplies very sparingly and he also keeps a small harem of Victoria's Secret super models as breeding materials. A couple of them were real VS models. Most of Hugh's underlings look like bald-headed, white paint covered cannibals, and the movie starts with a group of them capturing Tom. Charlize drives one of the gas tanker trucks for Hugh but decides to steal Hugh's breeding girls and head for a safe haven in the dessert, where she grew up. Nicholas plays one of the white paint covered underlings sent to retrieve Hugh's stolen property and he takes Tom along as his personal living blood bank-he has Tom strapped to the hood of his car with an iv needle leading back to himself. Pretty soon, Tom and Charlize team-up while trying to avoid all the supped up cars, trucks, motorcycles and other assorted vehicles that are in hot pursuit. One thing that I really enjoyed was that the stunts are about 80% real stunts-not CGI-although there is some CGI used; Charlize is missing an arm and I don't think that they really cut it off for this movie. Oh yeah, I also liked how the bad guys had their own traveling music along with them. There were literally people playing drums and guitars on one of the vehicles, as they were barreling through the dessert fighting. The stunts are fantastic and I don't see how some of the stunt people survived some of the crashes that occurred. This movie is so action packed that it is an adrenaline rush! It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"Robert_duder","10","6","19","2 June 2015"," An insane post-apocalyptic opera...possibly a masterpiece?
","I honestly expected to walk out of Mad Max: Fury Road giving it a 10. I rarely hand out tens (went all last year without a single one) and this is now my second. The critics love Mad Max, fans love Mad Max...the buzz has been terrific. The reason behind it? They did everything right. This is not a ""reboot"" (I HATE that expression) or a remake. It can fit in the previous Mad Max incantations, stand on its own or be open to interpretation (a fan rumour suggests Max in this film is not even the same Max as Mel Gibson's.) They didn't hire a new director or writer etc etc...instead the studio heads let the master himself come back 35 years later and redefine his vision. There are easter eggs throughout the film that connect this movie to The Road Warrior, the Mad Max world and sets itself apart. The bleak wasteland is so intricately created that half of the time your jaw is dropping at the sheer insanity in front of you. Does it make sense? Does it need to? What has happened to these people to make them completely insane? It is science fiction-post apocalyptic-action madness. And action it is...I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that is quite literally wall to wall action. It does manage to demonstrate a story but its pretty thin because this is just one event happening in this wasteland. When its all over, I couldn't think of anything bad to say about it. It was insane and I loved it.<br/><br/>The only less than stellar comment I can say about the film is Mad Max himself. If I were George Miller, I would have ditched Max as the focus of the film and changed it to Furiosa (but more on that in a moment.) Tom Hardy picks up the iconic role of Max and he is alright in the role. The thing I've always found with Hardy is I'm not sure he's a leading man. He's a hot commodity in Hollywood but I don't feel like he has the charisma to truly carry a film and I didn't feel like he carried this one. I get that Max is a man of few words but you go back 30 years and watch Gibson in the role and he just oozes charisma. You are riveted to his Max. Hardy's Max you hardly remember he is there most of the time. You could remove him from the film and it would have been nearly as good. The scene stealer, the heroine, the reason to see this film is Charlize Theron. She is absolutely mind blowing amazing as Furiosa. Her character is full of depth, determination and simple bad-assery. She is one of the best female heroes on screen in a very long time. Nicholas Hoult is excellent as the insane defector Nux. His character could carry a film on his own. Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to the Mad Max Universe as our main villain Immortan Joe. Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in the original film 35 years ago and despite being a little underdeveloped, hes make a heck of a villain this time around too. The gals that play Immortan Joe's wives are also quite good but underdeveloped. Still the film definitely has a lot of extremely strong female characters.<br/><br/>George Miller has created a chaotic opera of insanity with Fury Road. There are scenes in this movie that made me go...what in the world?...and yet you cannot deny the absolutely epic absurdity of this world he's created. I could watch this ten times to see what is happening behind the action. The film is ultimately one massive car chase and the action does not stop for a single moment and yet it is the furthest thing from mindless action. I thought it was unfortunate so much CGI was used in the film but then I discovered that Miller insisted on practical effects whenever possible so now I don't know what to think but all I know is that I think he may have created a modern day masterpiece much like he did back in 1979 with the original film. Action, sci-fi, Mad Max fans need to see this immediately. It is likely the best summer blockbuster we will see!! 10/10"

To be sure i actually watched an old Mad max movie and really there is a huge difference. Sure the special effects are much more convincing but the acting and the atmosphere is more convincing in old one.<br/><br/>Why i gave 7 is because i love Mad Max series and i am hoping they will shoot more and while doing so they will improve.

The casting, acting and introduction of each and every standout characters were really good especially Max, Furiosa and Joe.<br/><br/>Most of the instances of the film is in the desert with many highly customized cars,trucks and bikes (not so colorful ones), people fighting for their survival, impressing their lord (Joe) by doing all the craziest things possible to gain the basic needs to them like oil (from the Oil Town) and bullets (from the War Town).

The Action Adventure starts when Joe and his slaves (War Boys) try to bring them back, later supported by the people from Oil Town and War Town.<br/><br/>Max is used as an slave source of (High Octane)blood for the War Boys and he tries to survive and escape doing all craziest action possible teaming with Furiosa (highly skilled mechanic, driver and the Lady to watch out in the game).<br/><br/>3D is used at its maximum in the action sequences especially the 10 seconds of climax (witness me scene) is awesome.<br/><br/>I watched it in the front row (didn't get one on the back row) and I felt myself in the desert riding one of those vehicles.<br/><br/>This is one of the movie (after Gravity) which I felt is worth a watch even more than once in theaters."

","Having never watched a Mad Max film before maybe It wasn't a great idea to spend my money on a action franchise that I know little about.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the film is stunning I love the souped up cars and the setting of the film. Im glad this was filmed using practical effects rather than another CGI monster like The hobbit. The car chase scenes were amazingly shot and overall the editing, effects, direction etc. was great. I thought Charlize Theron had a good part and acted well.\<br/><br/>On the other hand Mad Max (Tom Hardy) had about 5 lines in the whole movie and read them out with the same dull expression on his face. I saw very little signs of madness apart from out of context flashbacks that I may have got if I had watched the other three films. This bothered me. There was virtually no character development and instead we got 2 hours of a car chase. I wasn't expecting much more but atlas let me invest in the characters so I'm not watching mind numbingly dull and repetitive chase sequences where I don't care who lives or dies. The villains were also poorly developed with little incentive to chase Max and co down the road for days. The girls that were being ""saved"" were the most dull motionless set of models. They just stood there.<br/><br/>This brings me nicely on to my next point the plot or rather lack of it. Basically Max gets captured by some white monster things, he escapes into a truck with Charlize Theron's character. they try to find safety from the war boys and in the end just go back to where they came from. No twists, no character development, no story.<br/><br/>6/10. I don't understand how people can give this movie a perfect 10. Are they blind to the stale acting, 10 lines of dialoge and a glorified car chase for 2 1/2 hours"

","I have only a fleeting memory of the Mad Max films from 1979-1985 directed by George Miller and starring Mel Gibson. These were set in the dystopian future in Australia, where energy is a critical commodity. Max was a man mad with revenge after his wife and child were brutally murdered. This setting is all the background you need to know about the previous franchise in order to enjoy this present incarnation, 30 years after ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"", the last film of the first trilogy.<br/><br/>In the massive Citadel, a skull mask-wearing tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules, cruelly withholding precious water from his impoverished subjects. Mad Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has been captured to become a blood donor for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Joe's War Boys. Elsewhere, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a female War-Rig driver, helps Joe's five wives escape to the fabled ""Green Place"" of her childhood. Nux, with Max still attached to him, joins Joe and the other War Boys to pursue Furiosa. This chase leads to a major explosive battle-royale in the desert, one that would cause an upheaval of the balance of power in the outback. <br/><br/>The screenplay by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris was rich and complex, with deep emotional moments. The cinematography of John Seale, with his orange-tinged day scenes and yellowish-hued night scenes, was breathtaking to behold. The magnificent action sequences with 90% actual (not CG!) vehicular stunts with gigantic monster trucks were so perfectly planned and executed. These were edited with precision by Margaret Sixel, with awesome sound mixing to boot. I thought the eye- popping 3D effects for those exhilarating car chase scenes are very much worth the extra in ticket price.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy was impressive in both his athletic ability and his facial expressiveness as the quietly macho Max. He was required to underplay his role since Max is a strong and silent type. But to his credit, Hardy was able to come up with a relatively silent but memorably strong performance. His final scene was very haunting even without any words being spoken.<br/><br/>Despite being totally bald, one-armed, with black grease on her face, Charlize Theron never loses her elegant screen presence for a moment. Her performance, so rough and physical and yet so warm and moving, was the very heart of the film. Truth to tell, she was riveting every time she is on screen, even stealing the thunder from the title character himself. Rare as it may be for an action film, I feel Theron is definitely in serious contention for a Best Actress award.<br/><br/>More than anything else, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one gorgeous-looking film. Director George Miller was able to mine cinematic beauty from the vicious violence and badass brutality amidst the dirty and dusty dystopian setting, and that is no mean feat. I am looking forward to the coming installments of this new and improved Mad Max franchise. 9/10."
"dfle3","8","5","15","14 May 2015"," Apocalyptic, surreal, exhilarating. 82.5%
","As with Mad Max 2, this latest instalment of the Mad Max franchise presupposes no prior knowledge of the preceding movies. The term ""reboot"" has been applied to it, which is perhaps fair enough. Having a new star as the titular character (Tom Hardy) lends credence to this view. As with Mad Max 2, Fury Road begins with a voice-over narration setting the scene. In Mad Max 2, that voice was some nameless man, acting as a teller of the myth of Max. In Fury Road, it is the voice of Max himself. Mad Max 2 struck me as more mythic, but Fury Road does not eschew this approach but it does appropriates other stylistic genres. <br/><br/>Perhaps the driver of this story is a variation on the story of The Iliad...all Hell breaks loose when the wife of a powerful man goes walkabout...off the reservation, so to speak. There seems to be more emphasis on a picture of a post-apocalyptic society here than in previous Mad Max films, although perhaps Beyond Thunderdome did delve in to this aspect...it's just that I remember very little of of it, apart from that cage-fight setting etc. Early on in the film, at least, it's more about creating a sense of place and society than focusing on Max. Most of the movie is one long, frantic, car/truck/motorcycle chase sequence...which might sound like a bad thing but director George Miller makes it exhilarating...although perhaps falling short of the standards he set in Mad Max 2...which happened to be my introduction to the franchise and made me conclude as a child that he had outdone Hollywood (later watching the first film in the series was a disappointment, I have to say). <br/><br/>How does Tom Hardy fare in the role? In this, he seems a marginal character a lot of the time...an accidental/incidental hero, if you will...low intensity often, too. He looks buff compared to the lithe Mel Gibson in the first three movies. His accent seems a bit weird too...I can't remember if I found it to sound South African at times...or maybe that was one or two other characters? Some of the other characters have weird accents too...either they're not nailing what they're going for, or it's just a mixed bag of accents. Max's costume accessories at times recall his role in The Dark Knight Rises. Sometimes Max's predicament puts in mind Daniel Craig's James Bond being in a similar, outlandish circumstance (e.g. being a hood ornament... literally!). <br/><br/>In this mad world, it's good that Max isn't the be-all and end-all. Quite a lot screen time is spent on Charlize Theron's character...the fancifully named ""Imperator Furiosa"". One has to give Charlize great kudos...I doubt that any other actor has taken The Method to such an extent as to have their forearm amputated for the role! She is, in a way, a rival to Max's myth.<br/><br/>Also impressive about the film is the cinematography and style of it all. The sea of humanity early on in the film, the aesthetic, which seems to draw on such diverse sources as ""Beneath the planet of the apes"" (perhaps...foggy memory!), underground American horror films about the backwoods people and Freaks...etc.etc.etc. The refugee camp aesthetic has a distinct looking cast but I don't think that they have the memorability of the goons in Mad Max 2, with the likes of The Humungus, Wez and The Feral Kid (although he is not a goon!). Let's not forget The Gyro Captain in that latter camp too! <br/><br/>Some really impressive visuals can be found in the dust storm sequence, which seems positively of The Apocalypse and one setting which brings to mind wastelands enchanted by an evil spell...a la ""Lord of the rings"" or ""Excalibur"" like. The latter setting has a surreal feel to it in stark contrast to its stark, monochrome colour palette. <br/><br/>Perhaps for the first time in this series, the ""mad"" part of the title character seems to be literalised. He has demons which torment him. To be honest, I wasn't sure where to place these in the chronology...before going into this movie, I suspected that it was set some time after the events of the original movie and perhaps before or after the events of the second. Max has numerous flashbacks which unsettle him. I did wonder if one of the faces I saw was meant to be the Feral Kid or another was meant to someone from the first movie...but the age of the character in the flashback I Fury Road made me doubt that...although the original movie isn't clear in my mind. It might very well be possible that the events of the flashbacks could be fodder for a sequel to Fury Road...assuming that they haven't been covered in the prior movies.<br/><br/>My casual reading of the series is that the first movie was set in a remote, violent community. Some time between the events of that movie and the second, some sort of global catastrophe occurred which brought mankind back to a primitive, dog-eat-dog state. Speaking of which, there are some nice, seeming references to Mad Max 2...from the truck driven by Furiosa (is that where this movie's title derives from?) to a nice nod to the dog food scene...but turned up to 11 (something the squeamish may want to close their eyes momentarily for!).<br/><br/>To be honest, I would have been happy for Mel Gibson to reprise his role as Max and I didn't really need ""name"" overseas stars brought in, but Charlize is probably less of a marked choice than Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome (although she had a couple of great songs on that movie's soundtrack!). <br/><br/>I'd place this movie behind Mad Max 2 and above Beyond Thunderdome, which I saw before rating movies at places like this. It's an exhilarating ride."

"vasco_cid","10","4","11","4 January 2017"," Who CHANGED the World? Miller did.
","As fast, exhilarating, over the top and relentless as possible, Mad Max Fury Road is exactly the film that we want and that it needs to be. Visionary George Miller shows us that a two hour chase film can simultaneously be a jaw-dropping work of cinematic art in every visual and technical aspect as well as surprisingly deep and metaphoric story.<br/><br/>Thirty years after the end of the iconic trilogy, Miller revisits the iconic dystopian world he created and inevitably defined the late 1970's and 80's, boasting a new cast and making use of the best modern technology in the way of practical effects and filming techniques demoting digital effects to bare minimum. Despite being a Mad Max- character centered franchise, Theron's Furiosa gets equal if not more prominence than Hardy's charismatic Rockatansky in a film that raises feminist issues left and right despite its high octane macho cover. Miller does this with such effortless insight and balance that we never feel any kind of unnecessary or forced agenda being rubbed in your faces.<br/><br/>Fury Road might certainly not be a film for everyone but its instant classic and landmark appeal is undeniable. Gorgeously shot, impeccably acted and frenetically edited and scored (Brothers In Arms by Tom Holkenborg is one of the best cues in recent memory) Fury Road is an exemplary piece of filmmaking to remember for all the good reasons."
"Vivekmaru45","7","4","11","26 June 2015"," The Latest Film Has The Best Special Effects, But That's All. Mad Max 2 Is Still The Undisputed Champion.
","In 1979, George Miller directed a dystopian action film which earned US$100 million worldwide and held the Guinness record for most profitable film for decades. The film propelled Mel Gibson to an international cult figure called Max. This film Mad Max, was followed by two sequels, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome.<br/><br/>I watched the sequel to Mad Max before I ever saw the original Mad Max. The original Mad Max can be considered a backdrop story to Mad Max 2. I think the original film was made just to launch the more serious chapter of the film which was the sequel. The concluding third chapter was generally considered a mediocre final chapter of the franchise and an average performer at the Box Office.<br/><br/>The Human society is decimated by a nuclear holocaust and the few survivors fight over the meager resources, gasoline, food and water. Enter Max, a patrolman whose wife and toddler were literally run-over by vicious motorcycle gang and who is now just a ""shell of a human being"" wandering aimlessly through the badlands...<br/><br/>Miller's latest film Fury Road can be considered a continuation of events just after The Road Warrior and a prequel to Beyond Thunderdome. In fact, a character called Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) is very similar to the Mad Max 3 character Aunty Entity(Tina Turner).<br/><br/>Mel Gibson who played Max in all three of the films has been replaced by English Tom Hardy. This I find very offending. Mad Max is an Aussie franchise and should have stayed that way. Also the absence of Mel Gibson in the film is an open insult to Mad Max fans all over the world. The casting of South African actress Charlize Theron is the final slap on the face. Aren't there much prettier Aussie actresses to choose from? What about Nicole Kidman a veteran Aussie actress? Why was she not considered for this film? <br/><br/>Plot: Max is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for the sick War Boy Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa drives her armoured war rig to collect gasoline. When Furiosa drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives — women selected for breeding — are missing. Enraged, Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.<br/><br/>Verdict: Mel Gibson fans will find their hero sorely missing in this one. The only consolation is that Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the main antagonist ""Toecutter"" in the original Mad Max, is cast as a new villain Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Fans of Tom Hardy will be disappointed, as Charlize Theron ousts him in every cut of the film. She is the major character of the film and Hardy plays the role of the side-kick. The sound and special effects are very well done, which is the only redeeming aspect of this latest film.<br/><br/>More George Miller Films: Twilight Zone: The Movie(1983), The Witches of Eastwick(1987), Lorenzo's Oil(1992), 40,000 Years Of Dreaming(1997), Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet(2006), Happy Feet Two(2011).<br/><br/>Thank you for having the time to read my review.

"jgunsenhouser","9","4","11","28 May 2015"," Thank you, George Miller for Fury Road and thank you in advance, for the next installments
","The Road Warrior on steroids...at 70, George Miller's still got it. This put F&F to shame when the majority of the automotive action is real, and I'm still not quite sure after seeing FR in 3D, how Tom Hardy did not get seriously injured with some of the stuff he did. All the action was searing and you can see cinematographer John Seale's fingerprint on everything...Miller and Seale can truly shoot a real, REAL action scene and put the camera in places it probably shouldn't be able to go. One highlight for me was the uber-dramatic, phenomenally scored sandstorm scene with its flawless CGI integration...the CGI is there but the seam is invisible. This scene literally had me eyebrows raised and saying, ""These storyboards must've been fun to plan out"" The integration of the FX and the live-action footage is truly at expert level. (Sorry, Marvel...but you can always see the CGI in your movies and we always know where it starts and ends) I simply cant say enough good things about MM:FR, but I'll try...Tom Hardy apparently signed on for 2 more MM installments under Miller. I can't imagine what Miller has planned for us next but with George Miller, we should be ready for anything. One thing that really sticks out for me is that for the viewing my wife and I went to last night was rather small, our auditorium was only half-filled but after the last shot finished and Directed by George Miller appeared, everybody at our showing clapped for a whole minute...that didn't happen at either Avengers or F7. This movie has changed the action genre again, but this time, to a place where movies have never gone...directors not wanting to shoot scenes the easy way, but the best way. Most directors will incorporate the digital work for a whole list of reasons...George Miller takes that list, burns it with a lighter and blows the ashes away with a leaf blower. He doesn't use CGI to make it easy, he uses it to turn the already jaw-dropping into the absolutely eye-popping. Using CGI so perfectly and so minimally, you don't know where it is or how much there is. You watch any superhero movie or F&F movie and you can see where the digital work is...here, don't even bother looking. And that's where George Miller takes us, to a place where we know it's there for about 2 seconds, but we don't know where it started and finished and we don't care at all. As good as F7 and Avengers were, there was a lot of areas they could've been better...George Miller not only goes to that place but now he owns it and he doesn't have to give it back.<br/><br/>With the technical aspect locked up in the hands of Miller, Seale and crew, the real reason to watch this is the magnetic chemistry of Hardy and Theron...a masterfully staged fight between Max, Furiosa and Nux quickly transforms into a reluctant partnership against Immortan Joe and his regime and they quickly adapt to whatever the situation brings, especially when Furiosa gets stabbed at the worst possible moment. Their commitment is never to each other but to surviving and they both acknowledge that they are only resources to help that cause. Max doesn't even tell her his name until she's almost dead...because at no point does knowing his name help them on their journey, that is until knowing him as a person, more or less, as well as his blood, helps her to survive her injury. A small detail but pivotal to their relationship as it wasn't important until it became important. And enough can't be said about Theron as Furiosa...she is this generation's Ripley, a survivor who isn't afraid or too proud to take help when she needs it, and, above all, will see her cause through to the end. Theron truly owns the role when she agrees with Max to head back to their compound...she already offered to cement their partnership, he goes one better and offers to go back to the Citadel with them AND help them retake it because now, surviving isn't enough for either of them...they both seek redemption and they know they need each other to accomplish that. Theron owns that scene going from completely defeated, then willing to take the second path, and finally agreeing with Max's suggestion because it still offers hope and she completes the 360 perfectly because she knows that Furiosa has to complete her journey. Hardy and Theron are the best on-screen pair I've seen in more than a decade and I really hope that Miller has more for them to do together. This movie should've been an epic fail on so many levels...yet George Miller looks at the odds, laughs at them, pushes them out of his way and blows them up in the first 15 minutes. Or maybe that was Max's car..."

","This flick should not have worked. Not only is it yet another 80's remake but even more worrying, yet another entry into the post- apocalyptic genre that is so much in vogue right now. But there was something promising about those trailers though. . . Even from the opening credits you get the sense that this is not gonna be a conventional ride; something in the lettering that suggests a time where films were made for pure entertainment. The movie is set in the near future but this is no cutesy tween franchise in the making, designed to capture that ever important 12 to 17 demographic.<br/><br/>Oh, f*** no. <br/><br/>There are no spunky heroines, no games, no mazes and no adorable robots learning how to love. What you have is the dirty, broken remnants of humanity trying to survive. The setting is dystopian in the true sense of the word, a gritty, grimy and grotesque world where mankind is barely holding on, their bodies ravaged by disease, where water is a precious commodity and a healthy baby is valued more than anything. This is a world of fire and blood, life or death ride on a whim and damn if it isn't a beautiful thing to watch. The mayhem starts from the opening scene and doesn't let up until its dusty, breathless ending. Director George Miller and veteran cinematographer John Seale have crafted a maniacal and delirious romp through the gorgeous Namibian desert and created what is, essentially, a 2-hour long car chase scene that looks amazing; vehicular manslaughter as grand spectacle. The main reason for making this film seems to be the director wanting to answer the question: what kind of movie can be made if you have no concern at all for stuntmen safety. For most of the running time there are people jumping on, over, below and, in one memorable sequence, even swinging from poles around moving vehicles, Miller and Seale capturing every vertiginous shot with precise expertise. You are going to come out of this movie exhausted and dusting sand from your clothes. <br/><br/>As Max Rockatansky Tom Hardy brings that quiet intensity he is famous for but, despite the title, this is Charlize Theron's movie and the story is mostly presented from her point of view. As Imperator Furiosa she carries the film's McGuffin, all lovely five of them, and some of the most poignant scenes. For even if this is a damned and barren place it is not, entirely a man's world. Women are very much a part of it and can be lethal too. A movie about cars, violence and explosions that still manages to empower women? Not even all 7 Fast & Furious flicks can match this ride for ferocity and enjoyment. <br/><br/>Now, some may complaint that the story is hard to follow, and to be honest, I had a difficult time following the Australian accents. But this is mostly the gripes of a public used to having the plot spoon fed to them like delicious apple sauce. There is no hand-holding here, no lengthy exposition to ease you into this world of woe. This is just not that kind of movie. The director has much more respect for his audience than that. The earth is f***ed, humanity is dying, get used to it. Not that you will have too much to ponder what is going on with all the craziness happening on the screen. Fast cars, explosions, fights, a dude playing the guitar, even a goddamn tornado! And you want to worry about backstory? Naah, son. You walked into the wrong theater. Now, sit back, shut up, and enjoy the glorious madness. Oh what a lovely day indeed! <br/><br/>Parent's brief: Rated R. Running time: 120 minutes On Sex and Violence: This is gonna sound a little counterintuitive after reading the preceding review but, there is actually not that much graphic violence in the film. I'm not saying bring the little ones. That R rating is there for a reason, but most of the violence is cleverly implied. There is some nudity but no sexual situations."

","I went into this film with pretty high expectations. I'm a fan of the earlier Mad Max movies and by the time I saw it the initial reviews were in and they were all very positive. I was excited to see it and, simply put, it was incredible!<br/><br/>I could not believe how much fun I had with this film. I loved more or less everything about it. I thought Tom Hardy did a great job as Max and that's coming from a big fan of Mel Gibson's portrayal in the first three. I loved Charlize Theron in this movie too. She was an absolute badass but at the same time she brought a refreshing amount of emotion and heart to the chaotic wastelands of 'Mad Max:Fury Road'. It really is just nice to see a strong female character after so far this year just being given Anastasia Steele (Fifty Shades of Grey) and Jupiter Jones (Jupiter Ascending). The actors gave performances that were compelling, but it was the man behind the camera that impressed me the most.<br/><br/>Directors that are making an action movie can learn from George Miller as 'Mad Max:Fury Road' is a tutorial for film makers on how to make an action movie correctly! These days action movies suffer because their directors choose to use quick cuts, extreme close ups and worst of all shaky cam when they're creating their action sequences. This causes car chases and fist fights to become confusing and hard follow. George Miller throws this lazy technique out the window, rightly. Fury Road sees Miller create scenes of absolute carnage and mayhem with car crashes and explosions, whilst capturing all this chaos within beautiful wide shots with no shaky cam to be found so all the glorious destruction is clearly visible for the audience's pleasure. And another big plus is that the viewer isn't left feeling detached from the world of the film by poor CGI because Miller uses practical effects, the car crashes seem so real because they are. Furthermore, I was clenching my fists as I watched Max face peril at every turn. Unlike action heroes nowadays that seem to be indestructible, Miller puts our protagonist in danger constantly, he is vulnerable just like the rest of us and I worried for his life at times, it was fantastic! I was full of adrenaline and grinning uncontrollably throughout the entire run time.<br/><br/>If you have not seen 'Mad Mad: Fury Road' yet I strongly suggest you fix that as this film deserves all the money that can be thrown at it. You will be left drooling as you witness George Miller's return to the Mad Max franchise that he executes with such grace and expertise. Michael Bay take note! Thank you George Miller."

","Charlize Theron described this movie as a ""fever dream"" on Jimmy Fallon, and I have to say that's the perfect description for the flick. It's like watching the Fast and the Furious in the stark, post-apocalyptic desert with psychotic minions performing Cirque du Soleil. The movie had very little down time, very little character development, and honestly very little plot, but it absolutely succeeded without all these elements. This just shows the genius of Miller. The effects and stunts were about the best you can see in any movie, old or new. The pulse-pounding action definitely kept me on the edge of my seat with white knuckles. No need to be a Mad Max guru, as this story sits fairly independent of the previous masterpieces.<br/><br/>Sure there were some parts of the movie that didn't add up and you could definitely poke holes in if you over-analyze it. It also seemed like some of the characters later on in the movie were just plot fodder. However, you don't have long to think about these things before you see a posse of 2000 horse power monster rigs and hear 2000 decibels of screaming guitar on the horizon and anticipate another chase unfolding complete with explosions, crashes, rolled vehicles and flying sand.<br/><br/>I loved it and the movie far exceeded my expectations. A movie has to be near perfect for me to give a 10, but the 9 stars here are certainly deserved."

In terms of sizzling the characters with flesh, blood and souls, of note are Nicholas Hoult and Charlize Theron because they put so much juice and bounce into whom they played and make their characters tough and vulnerable all at once. Nux is a war boy played by Hoult who switched side and went out on his own prophecy of dying historic and heroic (sic) on a fury road. It was a real sad moment to see him go. As for Charlize's character, the Imperator Furiosa. With a name that sounds like a newly discovered species of carnivorous flower, she too almost went out but story dictates she needs to return to take the helm so Max saved her. And what about Max (Tom Hardy) you may ask? Well, he is as good as any Max can be and that is plenty more than you can ever ask for."

","Honestly Mad Max is something you would never expect. Tom Hardy delivers a fantastic performance as Max and Charlize Theron does a pretty amazing job as well. This movie was honestly in the top 10 best movies i've ever seen. It's different its unique its something you've defiantly never seen before. I encourage you to watch this movie it was great! It's all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy. Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development. George Miller returns with his greatest ideas in his mind, resulting in raising the bar in all terms for the genre - colorful characters, satisfactory plot, delightful setting, enigmatic character and story backgrounds, multiple references to other movies of the series, and enough of personal and overall human drama. It's only May, but we already have our movie of the year."

","I'm not usually into post-apocalyptic world movies, but this movie was brilliant. It had amazing effects and could not have been a better cast. Tom Hardy is my favourite actor and he never seems to disappoint no matter what role he plays. He's portrayal of Max was great and its one of my favourite movies now. (honestly, I only watched it because he was in it) but Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie you can watch over and over again, I have never seen a movie with so much action. Finally a movie that doesn't involve sex or profanity, just pure action. I recommend this movie 100% even if you aren't into this genre, the acting is perfected by every actor in the movie and it just makes it all the more better."
"RyanGini","6","4","11","21 May 2015"," Great movie, but trying to promote social agenda
","The new Mad Max is a great movie, with non stop action. Minimal to no story line line, but thats what you'd expect from a movie like this, so thats not really a bad thing. The action is great, the stunts and CG are awesome. That being said, it really seams like the director/ writers are trying to promote a social agenda. The whole movie is about the women being the action heroes. In fact, there are a number of scenes where Max is helpless, being saved by the women. I have nothing against the women thing, but the main action hero should not have to constantly be saved by the costar. Its not as simple as just ""who's more hard-core"", they actually built the entire story about woman fighting against the men who are all bad except for the two ""good"" guys in the entire movie. So, ultimately, great action movie; but be prepared for a social agenda."

","Director George Miller sets the screen on fire with this visually stunning masterpiece. In what amounts to post-apocalyptic feminist manifesto as well a cautionary statement regarding the code of masculine violence, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give nothing less than the performances of a lifetime, both sure to receive Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences acting nominations for what they have achieved here. The special effects, stunts, cinematography, and story combine beautifully to create a film that may simply too powerful for the screen to contain. George Miller is undoubtedly set for an Oscar himself for this overwhelming spectacle as well his astonishing career as the finest director of the last fifty years. No one has ever been as imaginative, creative, and technically proficient with his cameras. A motion picture of such magnitude and magnificence demands acclaim and is receiving it in spades as millions flock to their local cinemas to experience the thrills, beauty, and powerful message that is Mad Max: Fury Road."
"Jonmad17","8","4","11","21 May 2015"," Listen modern directors: show, don't tell.
","If you're tired of films with more exposition than story, then this is your post-apocalyptic Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max Rockatansky, a former cop with a hero complex who's slowly being driven mad by visions of his past. He's soon captured by a band of paint-streaked fanatics who take him back to The Citadel. There we encounter Immortan Joe, theocratic dictator who holds his population enslaved via his control of the most precious resources in a post-apocalyptic world: clean water. Joe is treated like a deity by his ""war boys,"" a cadre of genetically damaged soldiers who live short lives and are willing to sacrifice themselves to do his bidding. <br/><br/>During a routine run to gas town, one of Joe's most trusted war generals, Empirator Furiosa, veers off unexpectedly. We soon learn that she's smuggling precious cargo: the so-called wives of the dictator. Joe finds out, chase ensues, and the mad Max somehow finds himself involved.<br/><br/>To parrot every other review for the film yes, the mostly practical effects are spectacular, yes the editing is great, yeah the characters are interesting, and of course the themes are fascinating. But what's most impressive about this film is the innovative way it handles its story. George Miller gives us a narrative that's almost completely devoid of expository dialogue. He asks us to infer things like character motivation and world status through action instead of dialogue. We never get a scene explaining why a character feels a certain way or how Joe's regime came to be, we see characters whose dialogue is meant to make situation sense and not simply serve the plot. This is a refreshing contrast to Christopher Nolan style writing, where half the script is spent explaining the other half. Miller has faith in his audience's intelligence, and doesn't condescend with simplistic elephant analogies or examples ripped from Event Horizon. <br/><br/>The film wears its political leanings on its sleeve, and its feministic elements go far beyond giving its action heroine so much agency. There's a matriarchy depicted as being a possible viable alternative to the patriarchal Joe. The film deals with themes like the perception of women as property, and the attempt to control women's bodies in various ways. It's rare (and therefore interesting) to see a high budget film this explicitly political. <br/><br/>So yeah, watch this film. Don't just watch it for the spectacle, but be amazed as to why simple doesn't necessarily mean simplistic."

","Taking your breath away is a sentence which I thought is clichéd and cannot actually happen unless you are hit by soccer ball in your guts. But this is exactly what happened after seeing this movie, I was getting breathless with non stop excitement.<br/><br/>There is no story as such to this movie. it is about what a simple idea can do if the director has the vision as Miller has. This is directors movie. Period. No matter how great Charlize Theron is, she still couldn't upstage the director. Miller is a star.<br/><br/>The vehicles used in this movie are out of this world and straight from hell. Shudder to think if something like this ever happens to the world and we start using such vehicles. There is no need for guns, the vehicles are enough to cause massive destruction to the mind and body.<br/><br/>This is a road movie for the completely deranged. you will never know where you lost two hours when you see this movie. it is like someone is torturing you but you are still enjoying it and enjoying it a lot.<br/><br/>Check out Nicholas Hoult ( the sweet zombie from Warm Bodies ). He is a revelation and I have never seen acting like that before. Miller made sure he has a villain to match the grand canvas and Immortan Joe as villain is picture perfect.<br/><br/>1 point I am taking out of this movie ( not giving it a perfect 10) is because of TOM HARDY.

","George Miller has bested himself and risen into a status of film maker legend such as Stanley Kubrick and uh...Stanley Kubrick.. for his attention to detail and love of his art. Some movies are for profit but you get a strong sense that everyone who worked on this was aware they where participating in creating something great and Millers dedication seems to have spread like a plague. The post production was unrivaled and a thing of true beauty. The utilization of frame rates that was experimented with in the previous MM films was honed to perfection and turned into a special effect of emotions all to it's own. Due to the heightened frame rates and extensive frames more movie was packed into a smaller time frame.The manipulation of frame rate was able to subliminally transcend the protagonist plot armor barrier. If I could criticize this movie, it's in not easing up on the viewer throughout the entire film with this subliminal trick. This factor alone makes it worthy of it's R rating and fury title. George Miller is the man behind the mask of Immortus Joe and may have been possessed by similar evil spirits into creating this."

","I enjoyed the new Mad Max film. It did justice to the first three films, while at the same time managing to add enough new elements to the mix to justify its own existence -- no small achievement! Tom Hardy didn't bring quite the same gravitas to the role as Mel Gibson did, and I would have preferred to see the aging actor in the role, which I think could have made it more moving when Max is suffering nightmarish visions of his dead wife and child -- that's the trouble with a reboot that doesn't ignore the previous films, in squaring away the new cast with what has gone before. But, all things considered, it didn't disappoint, and I suspect it's one that might be even better second time round, when there's a chance to take in more of the secondary characters and the visuals. 8/10."
"cortlahman","9","4","11","17 May 2015"," Ugly, but in a good way.
","Who would have thought that 30 years after Beyond Thunderdome we'd be treated to an actually decent Mad Max movie? Actually, just plain decent doesn't do this movie justice; it was fantastic.<br/><br/>Beyond Thunderdome took the Mad Max series into a cutesy, kid-friendly direction. Thunderdome was closer to being The Goonies than having anything to do with the stellar second film, The Road Warrior. Thankfully Fury Road is ugly, gritty and fast paced. There is maybe a total of 12 minutes of this film that have no action.<br/><br/>Fury Road is exceptional because of how relentlessly it throws images of carnage at the viewer. Take the infamous big rig chase scene from the Road Warrior, multiply it by 10 and you've got Fury Road. However, it's still even so much more than that! I was astonished at how nicely shot and clear all the stunts were in this film. I say clear because I pretty much never lost track of what was going on amidst all the boom boom. Coherency is so rare in modern action films, of which many are full of boisterous CG effects that destroy your perception of what is happening.<br/><br/>The only thing I can ding this movie for is that the plot is slightly jagged. However, the sheer brilliance in the pacing of this film smooths even those hiccups.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Mad Max: Fury Road. If you're going to see only one film this summer, get in the driver's seat and go watch this.<br/><br/>9/10"
"dfranzen70","8","4","11","17 May 2015"," Max rocks.
","The latest Mad Max is a frenzied, endless race of souped-up, well-armed vehicles across a whole lot of sand. The relentless pace makes for a wildly exciting film for which the plot is superfluous and generally unnecessary. There is much mayhem and madness. It is quite good.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the best pure action movie you'll see this year; even The Avengers and Star Wars have a fully developed story to get in the way. This one is a shot of pure adrenaline that never lets up. Here, the titular antihero has been captured by one of those omnipresent roving biker gangs I expect we'll all see in the near future. Max is turned over to a slaver/warlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls water and food for everyone in his stronghold, called The Citadel, doling it out whenever he sees fit. He also uses women for their breast milk and maintains a concubine of several wives, so you know he's not a good guy.<br/><br/>Working for Joe - or, rather, idolizing him to the point where they believe he and only he can lead them into the afterlife world of Valhalla - are the War Boys, pale zealots who pilot terrifying vehicles of mass destruction and gain their strength and energy by usurping blood from generous donors - like Max. The War Boys love Max.<br/><br/>Anyhow, every so often ol' Joe has to send out an Imperator for supplies; the Imperator drives a huge rig called a War Rig that's exceedingly well armed and customized to the driver's tastes. The driver in this case is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has another plan in mind - rescue dear Joe's wives and take them to her own birthplace, the Green Place. Joe quickly gets wind of this and sends out a flurry of War Boys. One of the Boys, named Nux, is weak and in need of blood, so he straps the newly captured Max - a universal donor - to a pole on the front of his machine, and the race is on. Mission for the bad guys - stop Furiosa. Mission for the good guys - get to the Green Place by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Really, the entire movie is a chase across a barren wasteland. It is a post-apocalyptic world, after all. There's leaping from car to car to truck! Oh, and the War Boys? They attach these long, bendy poles on the hoods of their vehicles with one of their own at the top. Then they can bend to and fro and either jump on the War Rig or maybe sneak in through the sun roof, steal a wife or two, and bounce back. Sheer genius! There's an enormous, blinding lightning sandstorm that accounts for much of the CGI in the film, but for the most part the effects are anything but computer generated. Loved the visual look of the movie, too, with washed-out landscapes and colorful foregrounds. Director George Miller's vision shows a world that appears dead on the outside but with glimmers of that most valuable of commodities - hope. And all of the little details, such as the vehicles themselves (some hybrids of 1950s cars, including an original Beetle) and Furiosa's guns and prosthetic arm, add the right touch. And how's his for strange - 3D is put to good use here, with junk (and people) flying off of cars and right between your eyeballs! For much of the first third of the movie, Max wears a face guard that sort of looks like an upside down pitchfork. One would assume Hardy is used to such gear at this point, having been through The Dark Knight Rises as Bane. Here, he's even tougher than Bane, even after he's had blood sapped from him like syrup from a maple tree. Max's name, incidentally, is mentioned only three times in the movie. Which is fine, of course - after all, we the audience know damn well who he is, and the lack of a name for his traveling companions lends itself quite nicely to his anonymity. He's like an even more badass Man with No Name. But he does have compassion, mainly because what haunts poor Max's every waking moment is the feeling that he let innocent people die (see previous three films in the series). Will that happen on Fury Road? Not on his watch! (Possibly.) Hardy is the figurative bomb as Max, a towering dynamo of nonstop energy. Theron gets ""ugly"" again (note: she is not ugly, even here) with a shaved head, big muscles, and an attitude that would make Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor weep with respect. She should definitely make more action movies, provided they're more like this and not like Aeon Flux. It's always great to see a strong female protagonist, and here we have several; in addition to Furiosa, Immortan Joe's wives aren't wilting flowers but rather ass kickers who can load and fire guns. Pretty refreshing to see that, you know? This latest Mad Max - and will it be the last? - had me on the edge of my seat, which meant that I had to hold on lest I was blown away. But indeed, I was metaphorically blown away anyway, with a much-welcome return to visceral violent cinema in one of the year's top films."
"jadepietro","8","4","11","16 May 2015"," Road Rage
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: As reboots go, the crash-and burn crowd will love this epic state-of-the-art film. Others, not so much.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>The good news about our bleak future is that even with the limited amount of water and gas, our vehicles will not be gas-guzzlers, will never overheat, and can get at least 200 miles per gallon. Earth may be a wasteland, but you can still get around pretty well. Survival is within one's grasp for the most fast and furious of us all. So throw that logic to the wayside and put your pedal to the metal for George Miller's reboot, Mad Max: Fury Road. (It's the only way you can survive this onslaught of heavy metal.)<br/><br/>There's a lot of sound and fury (but not much plot) in the wild steam-punk extravaganza called The CGI and stunt work are jaw-dropping. Shall we say...to the Max? And there is more demolition and destruction per minute than most action films this days as director George Miller brings back his Mad Max saga with a vengeance.<br/><br/>Yes, the crash-and burn crowd will have found nirvana with this action thriller, with its big rigs and even bigger wheels, fast motorcycles, and super muscle cars. Other moviegoers looking for more story and substance need not apply. <br/><br/>As for me, my feeling were decidedly mixed. I felt somewhat uninvolved with the resulting mayhem on the screen, yet was in awe of the spectacle. Expectations were high for this film, and the film delivers with the non-stop action sequences so unrelenting and well staged. Production values are top-notch all the way. Still a nagging sense of the unfulfilled lingered throughout my movie-going experience. The actors do a credible enough job, especially Charlize Theron. The budget is bigger and one action scene easily tops the next in a giddy childlike craving for more thrills. Had I somehow outgrown the absurd nonsense of the post- apocalyptic future and become desensitized to the carnal violence from years of viewing other action thrillers of the same ilk? Why didn't I get more pleasure from this new and so-called improved version? It is what it is.<br/><br/>While visually satisfying for the eye, the mind has no such engagement. Exposition and dialog are at a minimum. The non-existent plot is never fully explained. (There is virtually no deep revenge motive as in the original source. No time for real emotion to be on display; just plenty of car crashes and violent killings.) The whole film is just our anti-hero Max escaping one perilous situation from the next mindless chase scene, albeit stunningly filmed and choreographed. <br/><br/>In retrospect, the colorful characters are pale comparisons to Mel Gibson and his cronies. The actors are not at fault; it's the script which sacrifices character development for bigger adrenal-pumped stunts. Tom Hardy takes over the Mad Max role and his interpretation is less sexual cool and more brutish retro hero who speaks in his low raspy voice and grunts his dialog. He is still effective in the role, but he downplays the character to the point of irrelevance and keeps his emoting at bay when the opposite acting choice would have had more impact on the movie-going audience. One rarely empathizes with this updated Max wannabe. Ms. Theron actually has the more showier role as Imperator Furiosa, a female rogue warrior. The actress makes the most of it with her gonzo crazed look, buzz cut and metal arm, and her macho posturing. She brings woman empowerment to another level with her Amazonian crew along for the ride. (Let's here it for the girls!) In fact, Theron's character has more screen presence and steals the film from under Max's grip.<br/><br/>Also helping to keep things in motion are Nicholas Hoult as Nux, who plays a psycho sidekick and rightfully overdoes his madness. Hugh Keays-Bryne as Immortan Joe, brings real menace to his villainous one-note role.<br/><br/>The director's work remains solid, even if his script (along with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) lacks any real depth. Miller once again captures the surreal qualities from his earlier trilogy and masterfully handles the non-stop action. His use of hyper movement contrasting with slow motion imagery heightens the tension and adds a poetic spin to his vision of scorched vistas and its zombie-like inhabitants. The film is stunning reproduced with all its pyrotechnics and razzle-dazzle. There is an epic beauty about it all. Kudos to the stark production design by Colin Gibson, the frenetic editing by Margaret Sixel and the atmospheric photography by John Seale, all contributing greatly to Miller's absurd world.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a mad exhausting romp to the dark side.

"julianmarq","7","4","11","14 May 2015"," The Crazy Piles Up
","This movie has an excuse plot and it never pretends it doesn't. The dialogue is simultaneously flat and over-the-top, the actions the characters do at no point make sense and the only thing even remotely approaching a character arc is Nux's and the bulk of it is over a one-minute-long half-cooked conversation.<br/><br/>In any other movie, that paragraph above would mean a rating of 2 or 3 from me, what pushes it to 7?<br/><br/>Well... Everything else! The aforementioned excuse plot is there to have Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and Nicholas Hoult witness and participate in Miller's string of increasingly insane ideas.<br/><br/>This is obviously a movie the director had been waiting to make since the 70s, but the technology of the time and the budget didn't allow him. In retrospect, that worked in the other movies' (well, 1 and 2) favor since the less focus on crazy stunts meant more care for the characters, but I digress.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't let its audience rest, for the most part. After every over-the-top stunt happens, something even crazier follows. Most of it is stuff we had seen before in other movies, mind you, but this movie's achievement is that it puts it all together and at no point one even questions what is happening. Most of my objections came after leaving the theater and thinking back on the ""plot"".<br/><br/>A testament of my sensibilities, though, is that my favorite scene doesn't involve cars or explosions: It is the perfectly choreographed, adeptly directed, completely believable, raw and brutal fight of Max and his unlikely ally vs Furiosa and the Five Wives. It was almost transfixing.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie worth watching (albeit maybe not rewatching, I'm pretty sure most of the craziness loses its impact on second watch and one will find its lack of pathos more obvious).<br/><br/>Plus, there's a red-clad guy on top of a truck playing a humongous guitar he also sleeps on. Anyone's argument is invalid."
"neilbenammar","7","4","11","14 May 2015"," Deranged is the new black.
","Dear George Miller, I truly admire your post-apocalyptic take on the future of humanity- it is senseless, spectacular, isolated, barbaric, idyllic, brash, demented, berserk, refined, and nonsensical all in the same breath. <br/><br/>Let's try to break this film down into 3 separate plot-points or occurrences. First, Miller immerses us into the wondrous yet disturbing landscape of Mad Max's Australia - a dry and barren futuristic wasteland. The film essentially is one giant tracking-shot for the ages. A video game-like sequence (of sorts) in which our favorite bad boy Max, traverses the unknown territories of Miller's universe- in the hope of helping Imperator Furiosa smuggle wives; belonging to a tyrannical cult leader named King Immortan Joe- from his utopian citadel. <br/><br/>If that sentence sounded long and absurd, it's because the plot itself needs psychotherapy. Trying to adequately sum up the storyline is an insurmountable task - thus; let me skip trying to explain it. All you need to know is that it's a mindless car-chase extravaganza that ends with good prevailing over evil. <br/><br/>The characters in Fury Road are all over-the-top- simply put: they are just plain fun to look at. The special effects are unfathomable in their grandeur. Yet after all that praise, the film misses the point of what ""itself"" is trying to accomplish. <br/><br/>I was expecting a catharsis for the character of Max. His moral-ambiguity towards everything he does, anyone he meets, and anything he tries to accomplish - is never truly explained. Let's take for instance, his quite peculiar relationship with Furiosa. Max lives in a world filled with savages that support a madman - yet we do not understand why he chooses to protect Immortan's wives from being captured. He feels conflicted at first, and later just becomes their secret guardian angel. The convolution in the plot is irreparable. <br/><br/>If like me, you expected to find a poetic message left at the end of the film - you will be extremely disappointed. I waited and waited for something emotional to happen that would enable me to empathize with these characters. This moment never came. The one underlying problem with Mad Max: Fury Road is that the ideas it presents are so far-fetched and borderline crazy - they detach the viewer entirely from the film. There is no background given to the characters, therefore, all credibility in the storyline is tossed out the window. The journey Max and Furiosa undertake is confusing. The plight of both these characters is not resolved in the end. Furiosa will try to establish her ""Green Place"" in an area previously run with violence and cruelty; and Max just wanders off into the sunset - doing whatever he does after that. Which is a way of saying: it's unclear where Max will end up and what tasks lie ahead of him.<br/><br/>The practical effects used in some action-sequences are revolutionary. They even hired individuals from the Cirque-du-Soleil to perform some of the stunts. This shows Miller's dedication to create a lifelike universe - where the viewer is expected to spend over 2 hours engrossed inside. However, this universe lacks any sort of human component to it. All the human elements or themes of this film started to develop a deeper significance towards the climax but ultimately were left dying in the dust with car wreckage. <br/><br/>The desolate land, George Miller details in the film imparts us with a sense of psychological confusion. The universe of Mad Max is fundamentally flawed- which is the point I think, but Miller neglects the prospect of refining it. He does not explore the motives of the characters inhabiting his canvas. He sets a grimy tone to the universe but fails to justify its purpose or presence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually pleasing spectacle but the actors playing the protagonists do a poor job at conveying powerful feelings to the audience. This may or may not be George Miller's fault, but at the end of the day, no one can deny the fact that this film is, and always will be a visual masterpiece. <br/><br/>Consensus: A soulless circus that entertains, or a cartoon parody of itself? No one can deny George Miller as a mastermind but I feel even he lost something in the making of this puzzle. Was it his sanity?"

","Awe-inspiring aesthetics and masterful photography. The film unleashes a devastating force and arrogance in all its directorial and scenographic choices starting from the punk and cyberpunk taste of the costumes, to arrive at the meticulous quality of the never banal chase scenes and furious fights aboard whimsical and eccentric cars. In the face of the fact that this ""action package"" occupies most of the vision after all, and therefore it would have been easy to fall into repetitiveness. These are undoubtedly positive elements, which fill in all respects the semblance of emptiness (desired and not at all dystopian) in the deepening of the plot of the characters, and in particular of the protagonist. These latter criticisms of the film are understandable, but nevertheless they do not in any way undermine the audiovisual experience, which is decidedly of another level compared to modern action cinema."

Also the cinematography is not great. It is filmed with ultra dynamic range and there is little contrast (most certainly not shot with REDs). I don't call that good cinematography, just a stylized quality that makes it look like a real time rendered video game. In fact I would say that the action and camera work is atrocious because they need to rely on many fast cuts to hide none existent practical effects.<br/><br/>Also, I don't get the premise because it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Max from the previous movies. This is more like an alternate universe where, despite limited resources in a post apocalyptic world, there are unlimited resources and Max has zero resemblance to the original Max. Also, somebody should have told Hardy that he is not playing Batman. He can speak in a normal voice and not grunt out overly raspy lines. They took about 66% of the way through the film to even start with any resemblance of character development and even then there really isn't any.<br/><br/>So basically, the action is dumb (and very, very repetitive), there is nothing interesting about the characters or dialog, and there is no plot at all. I mean none at all. Start driving down the road with a big chase. Chat a little. Then turn around with a big chase. That is it.<br/><br/>Now, if you think that the Avengers is the greatest movie ever made, theeeeennn this is right up your alley. If you are moderately intelligent, then don't do what I did. Skip this movie for the rest of your life. It is not worth watching even once."

","This was better than I was expecting, even with all the rave reviews I just didn't think I would like it as I'm such a huge fan of the originals. I figured it would get Hollywood-ized with Charlize Theron looking like a post apocalyptic starlet, all pretty and clean and then CGI'd so that it lost that cool unique atmosphere of the original. Neither of these things were true.<br/><br/>Set in a sun parched post apocalyptic future, we again follow loner Max (this time he is Tom Hardy) as he gets caught up in the plight of a group of warrior women as they flee from an evil ruler/dictator across a desert wasteland. <br/><br/>Most of this movie is one big car chase, which actually isn't a bad thing, full of high octane stunts its pretty awesome and also keeps the atmosphere and tone of the originals perfectly with lots of weird, crazy characters. Its desolate, futile and Hardy is mostly silent. Theron does a good job, doesn't look pretty.<br/><br/>Even though I was surprised that I enjoyed this and that ultimately it is a good movie I'm still not sure it warranted all the accolades it received."

"connorveenstra","10","2","4","3 November 2017"," A masterpiece of death and destruction.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is everything I want an action movie to be and more. The action is spectacularly filmed, with cinematography that makes me salivate to think about. The pace is so fast that you never get bored and it constantly keeps your attention by having very little dialogue, making sure that you have to watch the film to get what's going on. <br/><br/>The characters have a surprising amount of depth to them, with Furiosa being a huge standout among female action heroines. She's tough, but not emotionally cold. Competent, but not invincible. Her motivation to save a group of women from a patriarchal tyrant is immediately sympathetic and you root for her all the way to the end.<br/><br/>Fury Road might not be the smartest movie in the world, but nobody can deny the craftsmanship that went into making what I consider to be the greatest action film of all time."
"rkhalid","7","2","4","13 May 2017"," Was expecting more...
","Having not seen any of the previous Mad Max movies the beginning of this film certainly confuses, scares and freaks you out at first which I guess is what the directors were trying to achieve and achieve they did. However, after the first 10 minutes when you've seen all the scenes and characters you get used to it. The special effects were certainly good and the plot was an interesting though rather dramatic one. <br/><br/>Again, having not seen any of the other series, my outlook on the movie may not be accurate but as a stand alone movie and having gotten so much buzz including an Oscar nomination I was expecting a 'WOW!' movie. Unfortunately, the acting of some of the main characters (mainly those 'breeder' girls) was very poor and dragged the movie a bit. Also the random love affair between Nux and the red haired girl was pretty cliché which spoiled the movies realism. There were some plot parts which just seemed to be added on for no proper reason but that may just be me having not been a part of the series. <br/><br/>All in all a great movie with great themes and effects though some acting which could have been improved."

","This gets an A- from me. I am surprised at how much I like it! Fury Road is definitely a fitting title --most of the film takes place in a desert. It is very atmospheric. Generally I am not interested in action films. I find a lot of it boring. This is the first time I have ever watched a Mad Max film. Although the action starts right away, it took a while for the film to pull me in. It isn't mindless action, but sometimes it was hard to tell what was happening. It felt like it took a while for the story to formulate. It is frenetic but not in the familiar shaky camera kind of way. The effective dramatic scenes gives it a right amount of balance in the proceedings without being cheesy. By the end, I was intrigued by the whole thing. Then the more I thought about it, the more I appreciate the scope of it.<br/><br/>In addition, Tom Hardy isn't bad to look at."

Desert settings (in Jodorowsky's case, Mexico), apocalyptic themes, arty cinematography and even the use of actors who are missing limbs, have other disabilities, possibly blindness, etc. See also HOLY MOUNTAIN and his long-sought version of DUNE. Jodorowsky was interested in Aleister Crowley. I am not going to summarize Mad Max. Watch EL TOPO and then go back to Mad Max. I did find Mad Max rather longish. It also predicts the super-literal Monster Trucks movie, now in theatres. Some people find the trucks the most imaginative thing in Mad Max."
"deacon_blues-3","6","2","4","29 February 2016"," Unrealistically negative (just shoot me now!)
","I have always found the Mad Max films and their ilk, for all their sound and fury action, to be boring. This is because the stories are set in a world where no one who lives there would actually want to go on living! A good story needs a certain amount of raison d'être for it to be worth watching until the end. If I ever found myself living in such a world, I would not care to go on living in it. Just kill me and get it over with.<br/><br/>This is the main problem with these films. I think it takes a certain level of emotional sickness to find such a world entertaining. This one, unlike the original Mel Gibson films, really minimizes the back-story of Max's tragic origins and it also minimizes his altruism. We are left with pure survival for survival's sake. But in a world without joy or even any reasonable prospect of longevity for one's self or one's children, what's the point?<br/><br/>Perhaps the sick minds behind such films see the present world in the same terms. I feel truly sorry for such an outlook, but I cannot identify with it. As bad as the present world is, it still presents us with the simple joys and beauties of God's intended creation, as well as a reasonable expectation of happiness, which is the basis for most modern constitutions.<br/><br/>This film is finely made and acted, so I give it a 6. Too bad it's lack of hope makes the story of no real interest. Everyone in it should just give up and die. Perhaps the only hope would be that the Wise Creator would just obliterate it, forget about it, and start over from scratch?"

","I never liked the original Mad Max movies which is why I put off watching Fury Road. I finally got around to seeing it and although better than the Mel Gibson films I still didn't like it very much. I can see why this would appeal to people . The action sequences are spectacular and the special affects are top notch but that's just not enough for me. Is a plot too much to ask? I found the constant action irritating and was relieved when there was a rare gap in the ensuing pandemonium . Another irritation is Tom Hardy. He seems to be reviving his rile as Bane ( Dark Knight Rises) by mumbling his lines. Sadly it has been announced that there will be another Mad Max film in a couple of years time. I hope I'm more successful in avoiding that one as I was with this."

","2 April 2017. This Max oddly puts Mad Max definitely in second place as Tom Hardy takes over for Mel Gibson. Hardy's character seems to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder with strange flashbacks that are never explained and never support the movie, rather they just distract from the storyline. Instead, Charlize Theron in the role of an Imperator whatever that is has the lead position and perhaps the only reason the movie wasn't titled Imperator was because to make money under the Mad Max brand. No wonder Mad Max is likely really mad through out the movie.<br/><br/>What this new version and re-imagined Mad Max movie has going for it is its dazzling visual effects along with great new look of the various action sequences. The hyper-space of the photography sped up though seems more like one of number of gimmicks used in the movie. Instead Mad Max is all flash with very little in the way of emotional substance, with a thin storyline and not much in the way of character development. What redeems this movie in part are the few scenes were there really is an emotional connection between characters and there are a few, except for the requisite kill offs of a few prominent but secondary good characters.<br/><br/>For those who love video games, this movie is for them, but for the rest of the audience who look for something in the way intelligence and meaningful plot, well, just be mad like Max is."

","Tom Hardy takes over the role made famous by Mel Gibson in this fourth film in the 'Mad Max' series. The plot has Max reluctantly team up with a renegade female trucker transporting the abused, pregnant wives of a tyrant to safety; distrust turns to mutual respect as the pair fend off attacks from the tyrant's underlings. Right from the opening monologue, 'Fury Road' feels like a decidedly different 'Mad Max' film; add in cutaways to Max's memories of a young girl and the action hero is more conflicted and haunted here than ever before. The film additionally does something different by giving Charlize Theron much screen time as the gutsy trucker with her own insecurities as she searches for her hometown as a safe place for the wives. These two angles do not mesh all that well together, with Max oddly relegated to a supporting character despite a deeper than ever glimpse into his psyche. The limited exposition also leaves open unanswered questions regarding blood transfusions, whether fertility is an issue and what everyone's obsession is with painting their teeth. Some elements (a rock guitarist strapped to the front of one truck) also come off as simply weird for the sake of it. And yet, if never entirely successful, there remains something to like in George Miller taking the material in new directions rather than just recycling what has been done before."

The pace is amazing, the locations spectacular, as the hunt whizzes along - assault vehicles that look like prickly dinosaurs, wan war-boys celebrating their jihadi death wish, and bizarro guitaro licks from a ship's figurehead.<br/><br/>The first part of the chase is like an old sea battle, as the tanker- galleon heaves across the desert ocean under heavy sniping fire. The second part is more like an aerial dogfight, with pole-fighters raining bombs from the air.<br/><br/>For all the fury, there is an attempt to set up different zones, different civilisations, as in any epic quest - but it doesn't work. Simply not enough care in the plotting and characterisation, although there is a degree of development. The actors are OK, but they can't deliver much to care about, and the interlude where the action gives way to motivation is very poor. <br/><br/>In the end even the locations turn out monotonous, and a scene where the green place comes into view is far too brief and, I think, misplaced. And all the time I was thinking about one of the anchors of the plot - the water supply - that doesn't make sense in its steampunk setting.

","I grew a huge fan of the original Mad Max trilogy. I've seen Road Warrior too many times to count. When I heard that a new Mad Max movie was being made, I was thrilled. That it took so many years to make only built on the anticipation of finally seeing this. The trailer was incredible. The reviews came out calling this a breathtaking, mind-blowing 2 hour thrill ride. I bought my ticket for the 7pm screening and sat down.<br/><br/>An hour into the movie, I checked my watch to see the time. That is never a good sign. As a pure stand alone action movie, it succeeds. The stunts were spectacular. Without giving away spoilers, the new ideas Miller introduces to a chase scene were great to see. I read that there was very little CGI used. I got that for the most part, even though there are some scenes where it looks wildly out of place. The cinematography is fantastic. The cars they built to eventually destroy are great to look at. Charlize Theron does well as essentially the lead character. But that's where the positives end for me.<br/><br/>For me what separated the Mad Max franchise from the rest of the flock is the story. It succeeds by combining great action with a simple yet good plot. Blowing up cars and chasing people only impresses to a point if you're not invested in the story and don't care about the characters. I didn't care whether any of them lived or died.<br/><br/>I get that Max is not supposed to say much but they went too far, really not giving him anything to work with. So in the end, the movie amounted to bad guys chasing good guys in 1 direction, then bad guys chasing good guys in the reverse direction. That's it."
"lwood28","10","5","16","17 May 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road Is A Action Masterpiece
","Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action films I've seen in a long, long time. George Miller is back with Mad Max after Beyond The Thunder Dome which was 30 years ago. Directors who usually return to a franchise who started it don't end up really good. Some examples are George Lucas for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Or Steven Spielberg for Indiana Jones 4. But George Miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life. This is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far. Tom Hardy as Max did a fine job but Charlize Theron as Furiosa is amazing. Her character kicked some major ass. The story was also great and it was very simple. It's just getting from point A to point B. The action was amazing and there wasn't any of that shaky cam. George Miller's direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing. The movie is also very intense I also felt hot while I was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area. I really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do CGI for tough shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real. This film isn't for everyone. The film is very weird and crazy which most people can't take. If your a Mad Max fan you'll enjoy the hell out of this film. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year. I really hope we get to see more Mad Max films in the next couple years because this film deserves all the money it needs and sequels it needs. I would say that Mad Max Fury Road is considered a action masterpiece."

You go to see a movie with this name: ""MAD MAX"", you saw the trailer, you probably watched or at least have read something about the previous mad max movies, and still you wanted to see a movie with a great storyline!...something is escaping me...whatever! Well, I loved it...the action is great, the sound superb, the scenarios and color wonderful, and all the actors delivered. Oh! and if you could wait 1 hour and a half to walk out, you probably could wait another half hour and see it through the end. That's just my opinion."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is an exciting movie, but for long-time fans of the series, this latest effort is simply the last twenty minutes of The Road Warrior expanded into a two-hour time frame, and the number of bad guys increased by a factor of ten! And Max is not even the main character! It should have been titled ""Furiosa: Fury Road"". Worth seeing once, but not a classic like The Road Warrior. Charlize Theron does a credible job, but Tom Hardy is very disappointing as Max. This is probably not his fault; Hardy is a decent actor but does not have the imposing and threatening presence of Mel Gibson. George Miller and the other writers haven't written enough of the character into this script."

Where Max(Hardy) comes in, I don't understand. I take it was captured, and he escaped, but was recaptured.

"tomimt","9","4","12","29 May 2015"," Insanity like no other
","I don't think I can come up with any original praises for Mad Mad: Fury Road. People have complimented it far better than I ever could, so my short review of the restart of the series that begun in the already distant late 1970's is, that I liked it more than I have liked any action movie in a long while. George Miller has managed to create a movie, that manages to grab you from the first minute and doesn't let you go until the end credits start to roll.<br/><br/>Now, for a bit different view. I saw the movie with my older brother, who said, that while he liked the movie, he also thought it wasn't as good as people have made it to be. As he put it, he was glad that he saw it, but he wasn't in a hurry to see it again.<br/><br/>What is undeniable though is the amount of insanity Miller has managed to bring to the screen. This time Mad Max, played by Tom Hardy, is more feral as a character than he was when Mel Gibso was playing him. Max is also not the only competent road warrior, as Furiosa (brillianty bad ass Charlize Theron) makes the life more than enough difficult for the villain Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).<br/><br/>The world of Mad Max has gone even more insane in this new installment. Every scene is filled with oddity and madness. Immortan Joe rules with an iron fist, and water, but has also surrounded himself with his slowly mutating children and insane troops of drugs sniffing war boys. Furiosa steals something of his, the wives and breeding stock of Joe, and this starts the relentless, feverish chase across the desert sands. The plot is simple and people don't talk much. Thins are explained with few words that don't always even end up being sentences. But the looks and the expressions of the characters are more than telling. The main driver is the visual storytelling that movies can be at their best and in this Miller has managed to create a modern master piece.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an action movie, that shows modern action directors how action should be done. Action is clear and easy to follow, yet it makes you grab you hand rests. The settings, despite their wasteland bleakness, are stunning and instead of over use of CGI, most of the daring stunts have been done with practical effects.<br/><br/>I can't promise that MM:FR is a movie for everyone. No matter how much it has been praised doesn't automatically mean that it is a movie that everyone would like. But at the same time I do recommend to give it a try, as even if you don't end up loving it, you may end up liking it."

From frame one, Miller paints the cinema screen with a gleefully vibrant vision of chaos and elemental fury. Every performance, every shot, every ingenious switch-up of narrative; It all comes back to George Miller and his prophetic revitalization of cinema. stupendous clarity and craft on display, mainly because Fury Road showcases a sense of confidence that hasn't been seen in cinema in a very long time.<br/><br/>This isn't your ordinary post-apocalypse film in terms of the look, and that essential difference comes down to one word: color. Whether its the powdery flares, the shimmering stars, or the dusty deserts; Seale demonstrates a masterful eye for dynamic images and their relation with one another. The editing is absolutely wonderful, in terms of pacing and the flow of the connections between shots.<br/><br/>All of these fantastic forces combine their talents to support George Miller's vision <br/><br/>George Miller's latest is a supreme force of cinema, combining every individual aspect, each of exemplary quality, into something of a rampaging behemoth of destruction and lunacy.

"Gresh854","10","4","12","20 May 2015"," Ladies and Gentlemen I Present To You...The Greatest Action Film In Over A Decade!
","Mad Max Fury Road is directed by George Miller starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult and is a continuation to the Mad Max series making this the 4th film. Ladies, Gentlemen, Mad Max Fury Road, was Mind-Blowing. I haven't seen such amazing action sequences in a movie since movies like the Indiana Jones Trilogy, Aliens, Die Hard, Terminator 1 and 2, Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2, and the Matrix! This movies action is unbelievably revolutionary and original that it will make you so pumped to see the movie again and again. Now what makes this movie feel so unique, and so action packed, is its beautiful shots and smooth paced action shots. The big plus is that most of the action in this film is made by practical effects! Lately we have been watching lots of movies with unbelievable amounts of CGI, which is not a bad thing in some ways. I enjoy CGI once and a while it can sometimes be amazing and sometimes terrible. I recently saw Avengers 2 which was full of CGI and I hugely enjoyed the film. But the practical effects in this film were by far better than any of the CGI effects ever released out in the Cinematic Universe! <br/><br/>Characters - Tom Hardy plays Max who is a man mentally troubled by his past, trying to find a path of hope through a futuristic post apocalyptic deserted world. Tom Hardy as Max I felt was a really good cast, especially since Hardy has been doing hugely well in his career. I didn't though feel like his character wasn't too impressive, but he still did a great job as Max. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa a women who is trying to escape with a special group of (I won't spoil what) cargo. She was a really badass character in this films and was a surprising addition to the Mad Max Universe. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux who was honestly my favorite character in the film because I found him the most relatable too. Nux is a member of Immortan Joe's settlement known as The Citadel, but later tries to ally himself with Max and Furiosa. Nux is corrected man who believes that he is destined for something great. I felt Nux was the most emotionally touching character that you can truly care for. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe who is the main villain who I felt was a pretty badass villain in the film. He wasn't anything real special to the film, but I think he is a terrific addition to the Mad Max series.<br/><br/>Plot - The plot is overall pretty simple. Furiosa is trying to get away from the settlement ""The Citadel"" with a special cargo when she later runs into Max who doesn't know whether to ally with her, or not. While this occurs, warriors from the Citadel chase down Furiosa throughout a straight through action packed, consistent film. This movie is straight forward action, there's not a ton of dialogue but it works and leaves the audience drooling with ""Ahhh"".<br/><br/>Score/Soundtrack - I'm not really big on listening to a musical score in a film, but in this film the score is so pumping and exhilarating, you can't help but notice it. Like in Indiana Jones, there is consistent music that just pumps you up and makes you really really excited. This film had that kind of score that can greatly improve your enjoyment for the film.<br/><br/>Action Sequences/Special Effects - The action and effects in this film is what makes Mad Max Fury Road, Mad Max Fury Road. The action in this film is so well directed with smooth and beautifully paced camera-work. Amazing stunt work that just can't make you not geek up and get excited. There was a man with a electric guitar that shot out huge flames playing on a truck with huge surround sound. Tell me that's not awesome!!! The practical effects in the film made me so amazed. Every shot you saw in this film could be a humongous poster that you can put on the Movie Theater walls. Every shot you see you can look at with ""Wow"" because its so beautiful and awesome! There's this one shot in particular that shows most of the vehicles lined up with a very mixed color sky background that was probably the most enjoyable landscape shot I have ever scene in a film. I am going to see this film in Theaters so many more times just to see the action in this film.<br/><br/>Pros: -Great Casting -Fabulous Action Unlike Anything! -Amazing Effects -Great Casting -Motivating Original Score -Beautiful Landscape Shots -Interesting Narration -Very Unique to Many Action Films of Today<br/><br/>Cons: -I COULDN'T FIND ANY!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Guys, if you miss Mad Max Fury Road you will be missing out on the 2015 ride that you need for this year. It is by far the best film in over a decade and by far the best film so far and I will be quite surprised if this film beats any of my top films for 2015. Mad Max Fury Road Gets A: A+ 10/10"

","If an earthquake starts to shake your home what's the first thing to come to your mind? Survival. Should your car break down in the middle of the desert and you have no phone to call for help, what comes as the first instinct? Survival. I may be placing a lot of emphasis on the word survival, but we take for granted how much it takes just to survive. We hear stories of starving children that are teetering on the brink of death, yet they manage to survive for at least another day. What makes us want to survive? Protection.<br/><br/>So what is it we're protecting? Whoever it is we want more then anything to see the new day. No matter what people of think themselves, no matter how much of an egotistical jerk they are, there will always be someone that their going to put more importance on then their selves. Maybe their a child that might have a better chance then you had or maybe an older persons who holds an important bit of information that's needed for everyone else's survival. When a major disaster strikes, we drive ourselves to save everyone. When the world has fallen apart like it has in Mad Max: Fury Road, then everyone else matters more then you.<br/><br/>Max (played by Tom Hardy) is still drifting around the Austrian Outback dessert in the same post apocalyptic wasteland we've seen in the previous Mad Max movies. He's captured by an army of the infamous leader of a thriving city, Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne) where he's being held as a prisoner and a universal blood donor of one of Joe's sick henchmen, Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, a famous driver named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) has been assigned to take a large vehicle to collect gas (which is very hard to find in this world).<br/><br/>In the middle of the escorted transportation, Furiosa makes a sharp left into the desert where it's made clear that she's going rouge, taking the rig along with the four wives of Joe with her, escaping their slave-like roles. She manages to loose the rest of Joe's army in a sand storm, all except for Nux who still has Max with him, taking plenty of clean blood from them. Max escapes once they catch up with the Rig and joins Furiosa and the other women to get to safety in a rumored land of green where there is hope for the future of humanity. <br/><br/>It has been thirty years since the last Mad Max movie and I wasn't sure what to expect, as I wasn't sure if people were still hungry for the road warrior. Not only does director George Miller prove he still loves this character, but has pulled off one of the greatest action movies off all time. Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching one continuous car chase that runs through out the majority of the movie. You would think that would become boring after a while, but Miller kept it's focus not on the action (though it's great!), but on it's characters.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy does well as Max, still making him likable even though he doesn't have much dialogue in the film, but he does not need it. The real stars here are Charlize Theron and the rest of the women. It's not just their characters personalities, but how much they play a part in the story, always helping out and working together to flee away from the mad men. You could say that Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the most feminist movies ever made (yet the guys still work on an equal level).<br/><br/>I'll give this five Mad Max vehicles out of five. Get ready to ride into Hell as we watch interesting characters drive through an interesting world. The characters are great, the story is great, the design is great, the car stunts are great. It is truly a lovely day indeed!"

","I wouldn't usually watch films of this sort of genre, I'm not always a fan of the image that they create and the in your face advertising, which usually disappoint. With Mad Max, it lives up to the reputation. the whole world that is created in this film is marvellous, real aesthetic is built up before the torrent of violence occurs. while of course the film is never going to be heavily character based with complex layered story lines, for what it is, it is a widely enjoyable film. the costume and design is very absorbing in itself, with realistic props being created. I do feel the film needed a little more dialogue, the characters often became unrelatable or cared for due to the lack of development, if something bad happened to certain characters, often the feeling created was less than sympathetic. overall, however, it remains a strong film with good aesthetics created and enough fast paced drama to ensure the film progressed at a good rate."
"Rickting","10","4","12","18 May 2015"," The film of the summer even though it's only just begun
","In a post apocalyptic world, Mad Max (Tom Hardy) helps Imperator Furiosa get 5 young women selected for breeding away from a brutal army, one of many settlements following the overall collapse of civilisation. Although this is my first Mad Max film that hasn't damaged my enjoyment of the film at all. Described as a 2 hour chase sequence, that it is, but it's a lot more than that. It may be a stunning, sensationally made action film with more destructive force than an armoured tank blasting through a power station and boast dazzling stunts, jaw dropping cinematography and break taking, bone rattling visceral thrills, but thankfully there is also a soul. While the film is called Mad Max Fury Road, the film belongs to Charlize Theron. Her strong, well rounded Furiosa is the main character in many ways, and the other female characters are strong as well. Tom Hardy is typically excellent, though fairly silent, as Max while Nicholas Hoult puts in a gleefully nutty performance as a villain who the film also gives an interesting story arc.<br/><br/>On a visual level the film is impeccable and George Miller thankfully doesn't resort to shaky cam. The stunts are daring, the stakes are high, the explosions are beautiful and each set piece gets bigger and better than the last. The tension continues building right until the end, so in terms of thrills MMFR pulls out all the stops. The film creates a compelling cinematic world with many fascinating details, mind blowing production design and a glorious sense of insanity. Thanks to the films focus on character and story as well as action, one becomes emotionally wrapped up in the storyline and occasionally the film is even genuinely moving. For sure one to see on the big screen, MMFR is a grand tapestry of explosions, high octane thrills, humanity and post apocalyptic heaven which doesn't waste a dollar of its $150 million budget. Let's hope George Miller makes those 3 sequels Tom Hardy is signed on for as soon as possible. It'll be difficult to live up to this though.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This has got to be one of the best, if not the very best movie of 2015. From the get go Miller takes us on a roller-coaster ride of visual, sound and gore that pays full compliments to the original trilogy, and then some!! Hardy is excellent in the role of Max, if anything he should have been given a more prominent role, with Furiosa taking most of that glory, but I can see why Miller did it, and when the going gets really tough it's Max that comes and takes it to another level, so it really bodes well for the next chapter on the Mad Max series! What really got me in this movie, besides the stellar acting, was the superb stunts and special effects, that finally update the Mad Max story and bring it fully to the 21st century, but without overdoing it with CGI and all the better for it."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","4","12","18 May 2015"," An insane & action packed roller coaster ride!
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie that revolves around Max Rockatansky(Tom Hardy). In the future, humanity as we know it has ended. In a desert landscape, people are fighting over Earth's basic necessities. A ruthless leader named Immortan Joe(Hugh-Keays Byrne) has total control over the water of the desert. Now, it is up to a rebel named Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) with the help of Max, to put an end to Immortan Joe & his dictatorial rule to bring back peace. Furiosa also wants to return to her childhood home. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the craziest films I've ever watched & I'm stating this as a compliment. The action & special effects of the movie have been superbly crafted. There is not a single dull moment in the film. The constant car chases & brawls on top of these cars is the highlight of the film. In fact, you can't even call these vehicles, cars! They look monstrous & are fully battle ready & fit perfectly with the tone & theme of the film. Except for maybe 10 minutes of the film, the action is non-stop & the IMAX 3D puts you right in the middle of the action & mayhem on screen. The only flaw in the movie is the lack of character development. I would have really liked it if Max & Furiosa were given more detailed back stories. We should have been given more insight into Max's traumatic past. Better character development would have helped the viewers understand & sympathize more with all characters. Performance wise, this film ticks all the right boxes. Tom Hardy is excellent as Max Rockatansky. Despite being given minimal dialog, Hardy makes the iconic role of Mad Max, his own. Charlize Theron is outstanding as Imperator Furiosa. Theron portrays various emotions as the mysterious Furiosa with panache. Nicholas Hoult is great as Nux. Hugh-Keays Byrne is menacing as the antagonist, Immortan Joe. Josh Helman is good as Slit. Nathan Jones is effective as Rictus Erectus. Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee & Courtney Eaton are brilliant as Toast the Knowing, The Splendid Angharad, Capable, The Dag & Cheedo the Fragile respectively. John Howard is effective as The People Eater. The supporting characters are impressive as well. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action movies of all time! A unique experience. It's a must watch, especially on the big screen."

The plot is very basic and simple and there is no need to watch previous Mad Max movies. 3D action effects are awesome and just doubled the entertainment. No one will ever regret after watching movies like this. I have seen all transformers, marvel movies but I bet this alone movie can beat them in action and effects.

I, for one, am not a fan of modern day action movies. They are lazy, CGI clusters that are just made to look good, and they can't even do that right. Modern day directors simply don't understand how to make an action movie. Thankfully, George Miller hasn't forgotten. Miller's Mad Max remembers something that all others seem to have forgotten, the fun aspect. Fury Road is pure fun. It doesn't let story of perfect development get in the way of that. The story remains simple, as it should be. The other major problem with modern day action is the overuse of CGI. Fury Road has an astounding lack of it. The amount of practical effects in this movie is amazing, the movie simply looks great. If it had all been done with CGI, this would have been much more disappointing. I highly recommend Mad Max: Fury Road to all action movie fans out there, as it is the best one in decades."
"adamarket-248-37143","8","4","12","15 May 2015"," High Octane Action - The Best Apology for Thunderdome Miller Could Ever Make
","Mad Max 4 should be titled: Apologies for Thunderdome. <br/><br/>While the third movie wasn't completely awful, it diluted the power of the American titled ""Road Warrior"" or as we called it in England where I first saw it, ""Mad Max 2"". By the time the third movie came along in 1985, I could actually see the damn film without somebody telling us it was a ""video nasty"" and something we shouldn't see.<br/><br/>Fast forward 20 years to 2015 and a massive marketing campaign for Mad Max: Fury Road. First thought - thank you George Miller for this movie, it's as good as an apology for Thunderdome as I could hope for. Do I like the movie as much as the pinnacle of the series, Road Warrior? I do not. Why? Max isn't so much as maximus as minimus to Charlize Theron's Imperator Fursiosa. She's the *real* hero of this movie. Max plays a supporting role, and you know, maybe that's OK.<br/><br/>First off, despite being an action movie, this is an adult's movie. It feels more like a 70's movie with adult themes, reactions and action than EVERY other action movie this year. It's a testament to this film that I watched every trailer BEFORE the movie minus the hopeful Ant- Man and thought, ""There's no way I'm watching that sh***y movie"". <br/><br/>The best movie this year is 'It Follows', but guess what? Mad Max: Fury Road is a solid #2. <br/><br/>Things I love. The plot has no story arcs. It's like a Japanese Kurosawa movie. Max and a bunch of ladies have to escape an evil daddy figure and that's it. Simple set up then ... action. <br/><br/>What follows is all logical minus the way Max gets kicked up onto another vehicle to help save the day. People die when you don't expect them too. Not because you want it or it's appropriate, just because, s*** happens. I loved the non-calculatedness of Mad Max. <br/><br/>Max isn't the hero you've been looking for. Furiosa is. The mission is righteous, but geez, this is an imagined and detailed world where barely anything makes sense. My favorite thing was how a bad brainless goon becomes the ultimate self-sacrificing hero without it feeling forced. That's good movie making. <br/><br/>In conclusion, American audiences don't often see this kind of movie. It doesn't follow format. It's exactly why Avengers: Age of Ultron failed. Joss Whedon is super talented but he was *contained* by rules of his own making. George Miller has NONE. He made a movie about a sometimes great, sometimes victimized called Max who helps a truly heroic and hopeful being called Furiosa make the world just a little less shitty. <br/><br/>For the authenticity and trueness of the story and acting, I give this movie a high 8/10."

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" deserves that honor, and a sweeter breath of fresh air you can not ask. A return to lean R-rated action where practical effects rule the day, its veins coursing with high-octane gasoline and attitude to spare (hell, balls might be more apt to describe it). It unloads the thrills but sneaks in the human sadness unsuspected.<br/><br/>Really, this is just the kind of big-budget Summer action movie I've been asking for.

"tardieu-felix","8","4","12","14 May 2015"," The World belongs to the Mad
","The pitch of the film is not very complicated : a car chase in the desert. <br/><br/>The world in which George Miller takes us is a hostile world, a world that is no longer the world as we know it. And the film may lack some elements staging the madness of this world's individuals outside the action scenes : indeed, although they are visually impressive (we are finally getting rid of CGI for most of the film) we can not prevent this tendency of Fury Road to repeat itself in identical sets. We could almost be tempted to say that the film lacks madness ... And, finally, it should be noted that Max is not the main character of this film ; his character is always a witness of the scene in which he is located. And indeed, it is a bit all the approach taken in the film : the viewer is projected despite his will and his ideal in this world without landmarks, without sufficient reason, as Max is. Thus, the vision of Miller seems diminished since it never takes enough space in the narrative. But the film remains a very decent & entertaining piece of work and deserves the praise it gets."

","""Mad Max Fury Road"" is one long hyperkinetic, violent, chase scene. It has received over-the-top reviews; that's why I went to see it. The reviews insisted that ""Fury Road"" is so good it transcends its genre: teen boy action movie / video game. I was hoping for something like ""300,"" a violent action movie that is better than it needs to be. In fact ""Fury Road's"" star, Tom Hardy, costarred with ""300""'s star, Gerard Butler. But ""Fury Road"" really isn't any better than any other violent, teen boy, action movie / video game. It's not exceptionally smart or funny or cinematically awe-inspiring. <br/><br/>There's no challenging thought or interesting history. It's just the same old same old: manmade apocalypse, humans in a devastated landscape, evil men doing despicable things, with lots and lots of chasing, punching, kicking, ugliness and loudness. After I walked out of this movie, the world was an uglier place. As I passed cars, I saw the souped-up cars of ""Fury Road."" Everything seemed menacing and everyone seemed to need a punch in the face. I don't think it's a good thing that movies peddle nihilism as a drug to teen boys. <br/><br/>""Fury Road"" takes place in the future. The landscape is desert. An evil and very ugly ruler, Joe, who wears a skull mask and a Darth- Vader-style breathing apparatus, hoards water. Joe uses the water to support his population of war boys, bare-chested, muscular men in white body paint. Joe also harvests breast milk from captive women, and impregnates other captive women, ""breeders,"" with his offspring â€“ future war boys. <br/><br/>Some of his subjects make a break for it. Joe sends out his war boys to catch the escapees. The escapees are trying to make it to the green land of many mothers. <br/><br/>The entire movie, from start to finish, is one long chase scene. It's so fast moving and stimulating that it actually gets boring. You don't know or care about any of the characters. None of the characters are particularly likable. It's so horrible â€“ the quick scene of women's breast milk being harvested, for example â€“ that it becomes laughable. It's very loud and your ears ring after you leave the theater. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy as Mad Max spends the first twenty minutes or so of the movie being bound and tortured. Pretty passive for the star of an action movie. Charlize Theron carries the action, and she is very good. Not bad for a 39 year old woman. Nicholas Hoult is poignant as a war boy who undergoes the closest thing the movie has to character development. My favorite scene in the movie lasted about thirty seconds; Tom Hardy says, ""My name is Max."" It's a tiny oasis in a desert of violent chase scenes. <br/><br/>Men are bad and destroy and exploit; women are good and nurture. I suspect that this aspect of the film will arouse controversy. <br/><br/>The future is full of white people. In the large cast, only Zoe Kravitz, who is half Jewish and half black, is a bit darker skinned. This aspect of the movie will also arouse protest. The future may be a dystopic no-exit hellhole, but black people should be allowed to suffer in it as much as whites. <br/><br/>The war boys are eager to die for their malicious leader, Joe. Joe promises them that when they die they will go to Valhalla. I wondered if this might not be an allusion to suicide bombers dying with promises of 72 virgins on their minds."

This is not even mentioning Max, or that the allies Max, Furiosa, and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds.

I don't know what I saw other than a never ending car chase, barely any dialog or plot development, and 'weird' things just thrown in there as if the writer/director or anyone who was part of production was totally stoned/high. Seriously a flame throwing guitar? you would think in a place where water and fuel was scarce there would be massive conservation efforts. Not a drumming vehicle or a a driving guitar thing. Luckily i saw this on Netflix as i would never forgive myself if I actually paid to see this movie in an actual theater. This movie as well as the former - should have never been made. It should have ended with the 1981 film and that's it. The 8.1 rating on IMDb also has me doubting IMDb itself as this movie I don't see how 8/10 is possible unless its a negative number. Obviously the system is rigged as this was truly a awful and preposterous movie. Even the post-apocalyptic movie ""the postman"" was better (had a story, plot) and more realistic than this trash.

","Every movie carries a target or complex. In the film industry counter you can find a movie for every taste and color. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" - is primarily a striking action, the second - furious action, and the third - ""shooter"" action. Gunman reached their goals even with a reserve. Let us examine the eight-cylinder engine is now on the cogs and nuts.<br/><br/>Pilot: the protagonist is quite typical, but very memorable and devoid of distracting roughness. We face a brutal male knight without fear and without reproach, the valiant and noble specimen so ignoble environment fauna. Tom Hardy, may not be the ideal candidate for the role of Mad Max, but after watching the film, we are ready to take him for a forgotten hero of roads. The protagonist: 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Passengers: minor characters contrast and memorable. Study of characters pleases, each character has its own unique style, originality, and their fury. Charlize Theron is a huge clever, though not demonstrated unsurpassed game with thriller genre was more than convincing. Selection of actors: 8 out of 10. Game actors: 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Subwoofer in the rear luggage compartment: the sound and the music is not just great, they are smart! Sound environment and is fully consistent with the actions taking place on the screen, each drum hit adds fury to the action and tension.

Despite the fact that in fact 90 steps - is a continuous action, watch the non-stop action it was interesting and in the same breath. It's hard to believe: at least a couple of scenes will make your scale of ""sentimentality"" pull up sharply its red arrow already in the critical area of ​​the division. Yes, my friends, there is drama, there is something to think about. The plot: 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Body painting: the most important that we managed to maintain and even increase - the atmosphere. It emanates from each disc of improvised car, from every grain of sand and shift knob. The era of madness, the era of survival in hostile environments, where water and petrol worth more than life, this is what causes a person to become even more insane than the world around to his madness to make fortune scales bow to him.

He plays the role in a manner that will remind you of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, who when the time comes decides to make a difference.

As I always religiously do with any movie, before ""pressing play"" on my DVD player, I had avoided to read any review on the movie: other people's opinions are often influenced by those people's expectations and in turn risk to influence my expectations and my judgment. Besides all the expert's opinions and seasoned critics' views, what after all matters the most to me is the answer to: ""did you like the movie?"". I did, very much so. I vaguely recalled the original Mad Max. But after watching this ""4k UHD movie"", all my memories seem like an old fading Polaroid picture. Spectacular action sequences, amazing special effects, a futuristic medieval background and an out of this world (somewhat Turneresque) photography left me begging for more. Mad Max: Fury Road: a visual feast, strangely romantic and brightly dark. Thanks George for the ride!"
"zardoz-13","9","3","8","26 May 2015"," Max Is Back with Max Action
","Moviegoers old enough to remember the 1980s may cherish memories of those gonzo, post-apocalyptic, B-movies where humans struggled to survive in either an urban or desert wasteland against gloomy odds. Those low-budget, R-rated, schlock sagas with gladiatorial looking psychotic freaks careening around in beatnik-style buggies straight out of an auto graveyard were both 'drive-in' movie and VHS favorites. These lowbrow actioneers were definitely an acquired taste. Exploitation classics like ""1990: The Bronx Warriors,"" ""Warriors of the Wasteland,"" ""2019 - After the Fall of New York,"" ""Exterminators Of The Year 3000,"" and ""Warrior of the Lost World"" proliferated during the 80s after ""Max Mad"" surprised Hollywood and generated a market for this violent, slam-bang, dystopian nihilism. According to DVD Times, ""'Mad Max' was shot on a budget of 400,000 Australian Dollars, which is a tiny budget for such an action packed film. Up until 'Blair Witch' it held the record for greatest profit to budget ratio (It grossed $100 million USD eventually)."" Not only did director George Miller make a superstar out of Mel Gibson with ""Mad Max"" (1979), but he also ushered in the grungy, low-class, genre that eventually inspired big-budget replicas. Does anybody remember Kevin Costner's ""Waterworld?"" The studio that produced ""Waterworld"" sought to remake ""Mad Max,"" but they wanted to stage it on the high seas. Thirty years after he wrapped the third entry in the ""Mad Max"" trilogy with ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985), George Miller has revived the post-nuke warrior in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with Tom Hardy taking over Mel Gibson's role. About four years ago, Paul Miller—a Michigan native no relation to George—helmed a fan film ""Mad Max Renegade"" that filled in the gap between the first ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior."" If you aren't a 1980s movie aficionado, you may have trouble appreciating ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with Charlize Theron taking star billing over Tom Hardy. <br/><br/>When we first see Max (Tom Hardy of ""The Dark Knight Rises""), he is standing with his back to the camera on a craggy zenith overlooking a parched desert. In voice over narration, he explains that he used to be a policeman. Furthermore, he reveals that his past still haunts him as much as his doubtful future troubles him. An agile two-headed lizard makes the mistake of scuttling too close, and Max gobbles it down. No sooner has he climbed back into his car and driven off than a phalanx of cars pursues him with a vengeance. Max crashes his car, and his dastardly captors take him to an unspecified place in the desert where a collection of buttes towers over the rugged terrain. This place is known as 'the Citadel.' My chief complaint about this spectacular looking, souped-up, action thriller is the lack of information not only about our resourceful hero but also the people and places in it. The lunatic mutants who shanghai Max are called 'Warboys.' These bare-chested brigands cavort about in trousers and boots and have painted torsos flour-white from the waist up. Clean-shaven skulls complete their ghoulish appearance. They worship a sadistic tyrannical , Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne of the original ""Mad Max""), who decks himself out in a plastic outfit with what appear to be oxygen hoses sprouting from a grotesque face mask with a billows on his shoulders. Miller never divulges why Joe relies on such a macabre apparatus. Joe rules from one of the buttes and controls the water supply. ""Do not become addicted to water,"" he warns, ""it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence."" Meantime, he maintains a harem of young, curvaceous, Victoria's Secret models with which he procreates while another harem of corpulent cuties yield buckets of breast milk from pumping units in Citadel. Indeed, ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is not your conventional, run-of-the-mill, road trip. Joe has constructed an elaborate system of elevators as well as massive tanker trucks that he dispatches to fetch fuel. He has assigned a driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron of ""Monster""), to cruise into the wastelands with an escort of Warboys to replenish their gasoline supply. At the last minute, Furiosa goes rogue and swerves her vehicle off-course into the desert. Initially, her heavily-armed escort believes she is complying with new orders. An alarmed Joe assembles an armada of bizarre vehicles to pursue Furiosa. One of Joe's Warboys, Nux (Nicholas Hoult of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past""), desperately wants to commandeer a pursuit vehicle, but he has to take his 'blood bag' with him. Since his capture, Max has suffered with Warboys tattooing his back and suspending him upside down to furnish blood to Nux. During the feverish pursuit of Furiosa, Max manages to escape Nux and negotiates an uneasy truce with our heroine. Max learns Furiosa is searching for her utopian homeland, and a quintet of Joe's wives have chosen to defect and accompany her. One of the harem is poised to give birth, and Joe is incandescent with rage when she shields these treacherous fugitives. <br/><br/>Basically, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" amounts to an adrenaline-laced, testosterone-laden, high-octane fantasy boasting outlandish hybrid vehicles and amazing motorcycle aerobatics. The narrative unfolds in an anonymous desert in the distant future. At one point, a gargantuan dust storm teeming with twisters engulfs everybody. Max sits out the early part of the movie as a prisoner in the Citadel. Hardy wears a face mask a little more revealing than the one he sported as the maleficent Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Hardy proves every bit as resilient as Mel Gibson's Max, and he is constantly running a gauntlet. Surprisingly, Charlize Theron steals the show. Although minus part of her left forearm, she brandishes a creepy mechanical contraption that enables her to steer her big rig. Despite its scarcity of exposition, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" qualifies as an entertaining, often surreal, but ultimately fast-paced demolition derby."

","I went to the cinema with small expectations, since i remember that i kinda enjoyed the first three Mad Max movies, but they didn't really stuck with me. But it sounded like this would be a ""classic"" action movie with a lot of real stunts, not so CGI heavy like all the super hero movies nowadays and just a bit different. Boy and it is! I haven't had such a blast watching an action movie since Con Air or Terminator 2, there's just a certain raw velocity that this movie gets right, like few of them do. I won't tell you too much about the story, i certainly liked it and it's a nice ""postapocalyptic"" one, with great characters all over the board. Max is great, not talking much at all, but it fits him perfectly. And then there's the mentally and physically scarred Furiosa, marked by the harsh conditions of this cruel world. She's the character you will be rooting for the most, played brilliantly by Charlize Theron, which might just be my new favorite actress for her portrayal of Furiosa. Her screen presence is just so strong. The rest of the cast is really wonderful as well and cast spot on. All in all, a movie with fantastic action sequences that get you up on your seat(literally), a very cool post apocalyptic mood, strongly played and likable characters and just great pacing: it gives you time to breathe every now and then so you can fully enjoy the next part of this wild ride!<br/><br/>9/10"

The sub character are likable and the unlikely alliances formed are interesting. Even though the dialogue is limited there is never a dull moment with some fresh, original, dare I say unique action setups. With people leaping from one car to another using poles reminiscent of giant dune buggy aerials to name just one. It's one long road trip in a strange, post-apocalyptic world from start to finish with branding, skin tattoos, siren like females and a combination flamethrower/guitarist on a bungee to name a few. <br/><br/>Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris' basic screenplay has plenty of surprises and it tries to move away from the paint by numbers actioner that have flooded the screens for an age. <br/><br/>The acting is solid, Charlize Theron has fantastic presence as the one armed Furiosa, lacking any levity which gives credence to the character who is trying to help a group of women (including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) escape for a better life.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is on fine form as the dream and nightmare vision afflicted Max but is on a equal footing with Theron in terms of screen time as they face danger together throughout against rival nomads and the memorable cult leader Joe played menacingly by Keays-Byrne. Nicholas Hoult Nux leaves an impression and characters develop and refreshingly change alliances. Even the eccentric characters and over the top stunts, gun-play and explosions feel grounded because you buy into the world where gasoline and water are scarce.<br/><br/>Its not glossy like the Jurassic World nor Terminator Genesys, Fury Road is dusty, gritty, surreal in places, visually impressive entertainment, perfectly executed and more than just another action movie."

I mean you reach the precipice of WTF when the convoy drives out with a truck in the middle mounted with a wall of speakers, fronted by a blind dude suspended by rope playing a triple-necked guitar made of car parts, and carrying four massive war drums on the back.<br/><br/>Imperior Furiosa is tasked with the latest gas run, but she has something else in mind as she smuggles out Immortan Joe's five young wives. So begins an epic car chase to get them back that takes up pretty much the entirety of the film's runtime. Yes, you read that right. Mad Max: Fury Road is pretty much a two hour car chase. A car chase through canyons and swamps and sand dunes and salt-lakes for miles and miles. There's even a catastrophic sand storm, complete with sand tornadoes and lightning, that gets in their way. Immortan Joe's warband is joined by other local warbands as well, leaving Max, Furiosa, and their charge of young women fending off a horde of crazed lunatics.<br/><br/>Acting is of pretty high quality throughout as well. Charlize Theron was the perfect casting choice for Furiosa, with her difficult past behind her and her hope of a brighter future ahead. She's driven and smart, but not completely unreasonable. Rosie Huntington-Whitely, as much as it pains me to say it, wasn't too bad either. Even with a (fake) pregnancy bump weighing her down, she never lets it get in the way of being a born leader of her fellow wives. Nicholas Hoult was even quite good despite the somewhat cheesy dialogue and blinded-by-faith attitude. Tom Hardy was also admirable, as always. I'm a big fan of his, however this was far from the best performance I've seen of him, mainly because his quiet, brooding Max is a little too similar to his quiet, brooding portrayal of Forrest Bondurant in Lawless. In fact if it wasn't for the starkly different settings, it might've been easy to allude to them being the same person.<br/><br/>With all that said though, let's face it, the real reason anyone is going to go and see Fury Road is for the visual spectacle. Oh, and what spectacle it is. Everything is grimy and barren. The world they inhabit is a wasteland devoid of green, devoid of water. A lot of the visual effects and stunts are in- camera as well. In fact there's only one bit that was obviously CGI, and that's when the debris of a massive crash comes hurtling towards the screen, you know, just to make extra good use of that 3D that I didn't watch it in. Other than that though, all the stunts and car crashes and explosions look so real and natural, because they really were done live, in camera. The choreography of the various segments of the sprawling car chase are meticulously thought out, and the actors and stuntmen hanging from car doors and hanging on to rooves for their lives adds such a massive sense of urgency and tension. I literally gasped at least once as Tom Hardy got just a little too close to the ground for my liking.<br/><br/>Oh, and let's not forget the cars. Oh my, the cars. The Fast and Furious franchise has plenty for the lovers of actual cars, whether they're super cars or classic cars, but Fury Road's cars are something completely different. Each and every one is an individual, botched together of various car parts in order to make the most outrageous and extravagant vehicles. There's double- stacked Cadillacs with monster truck wheels, a truck fronted by three stacks of sedan grills, a camper bristled with spikes resembling a porcupine, a Pontiac with caterpillar tracks. There's elements of all sorts of vehicles from every time period; from the modern to the classic, from the practical to the sporty. There's massive, over-the-top wheels, and exposed engines, and open- backed boots. And it's not just the four-wheeled variety that gets dolled-up to the max, with skulls, vents, chains, pipes and spikes. The various motorbikes that appear all look uniquely bizarre as well.<br/><br/>Fury Road is just plain good, adrenaline- fuelled fun. It looks great, it's got a great story, and some great characters brought to life by some great acting. It's superficially tense, and yet the world-building and character development makes it hugely engaging. There are a few things that are hard to swallow with scrutiny (like the shortage of fuel, which is best met by driving lots of gas-guzzling vehicles for miles and miles and miles somewhat recklessly, throwing petrol bombs all over the place, obviously), but with something as crazy as Fury Road, it's not hard to just ignore that and let yourself get taken in for the ride. I give Mad Max: Fury Road a bristling 9/10. BRING ON THE SEQUELS!"

","Saw it today. Seen all 3 previous Mad Max movies. Loved Road Warrior and Mad Max1. Been waiting for this ever since it was announced. Saw the trailers, read the hype, worried it wouldn't live up. It lived up and some. George Miller is a GREAT action director + his movies have a charming weirdness. I loved this movie. It's like Road Warrior & Beyond Thunderdome mixed up and boosted. Beautiful, well imagined fantasy world. Charlize Theron is fine as Furiosa. Tom Hardy good as Max - not like Mel Gibson but good in his way. Pounding music. 3D is just right, not overdone. One thrilling action set-piece after the other. It's great. Will see again. Recommended to fans of the genre (Fantasy-action)."
"paulmcuomo","8","3","8","19 May 2015"," So insane, so good, so intense - SO worth the hype.
","Disclaimer: the reason this is an 8 and not a full 10 is purely because I found some nitpicky things with the world building, and also because it was a bit too intense and non-stop for me. Please don't kill me for this.<br/><br/>I have seen the first Mad Max and the majority of the second. Didn't see the third, but the first two were amazing as part of an amazing series worth a 30 year wait for this latest insane installment. Seriously, the action in this movie - both fight scenes and car chases - is some of the best I've ever seen, if not THE best. Action scenes shot the way they should be; with proper choreography, shot in a way that creates intense moments where the hero is invariably struggling and being victorious - just like a real situation. Max has always been a hero that deals with injuries and set-backs in ways that would actually happen and its great to see of that happening here.<br/><br/>Speaking of Max, we have a new actor in the lead role, partly because Mel Gibson is now almost unhirable, but mostly because he is now too old. Replacing him however is someone perfect for it: Tom Hardy. If you read my Child 44 review, you'll know that whilst I hated the movie, I commended Hardy for rising above the s**t script to give a performance that was pretty much brilliant inspite of everything. In Mad Max though, he gets less lines to work with, but his body language says all: gruff, tough, angry, not a hero willing to care or show any humanity towards others and being at his best in dangerous situations. The most character development is shown by Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult, who starts off as an anti-villain but later becomes a sympathetic, lonely, broken man who helps the heroes after he builds a relationship with one of the brides.<br/><br/>One character who is receiving HUGE buzz is Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron. Bold, tough, determined in her mission to rescue to brides from the movie's terrifying villain Immortal Joe in a non-stop drive to the ""green land"", Theron plays a character who is not a typical ""I'm affected by a terrible path"" type of heroine and brings a matter of fact toughness purpose to the role that make this the best work she's done since Monster.<br/><br/>In terms of the story, it is pretty much what you read above: the main plot is Furiosa helping the wives of Immortal Joe escape from his people the War Boys who have captured and enslaved Max at the start of the film, and Max tries to get revenge whilst ending up helping Furiosa. The few breaks inbetween the intense action are great as they set-up the others breaking down the barrier between them and Max and getting him involved in their mission. It's hard to talk about the breaks because, honestly, there aren't that many and most development actually comes through the fight scenes, which is amazing to even say.<br/><br/>My only words for you - SEE THIS MOVIE! It deserves your full attention, and if you don't, you'll regret it!"
"AliceofX","9","3","8","19 May 2015"," What You See Is What You Get
","It's typical of action movie advertising to promise that ""the thrills never stop"" in a trailer with clips from the 2 or 3 best moments. Mad Max: Fury Road has the rare trailer that accurately depicts the experience that you are going to get walking into that movie theater. It's almost non-stop action with a minimalist plot. <br/><br/>Now I have seen some people complain about that aspect of the movie - the plot of the film and little character development. And I have to admit that it did grate on me a little, my more accurate score would be 8.5. But that is a very minor nitpick because a movie that is a visual spectacle would only suffer in having a complicated plot. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is simple, but it works. <br/><br/>Typically saying ""much action, little plot"" would be an insult, but George Miller manages to create a masterpiece that, similarly to last year's Lego Movie, puts to shame the inferiors and shows just how glorious things could be when done right."

","It's the most action packed movie I've seen in years, literally.<br/><br/>They sum up the story in about 10mins of the film and the rest of the 2 or so hours is spent racing through a post apocalyptic dessert. All action.<br/><br/>But what I loved most is the retro feel of the movie. It looked like it was made one or two years after Beyond Thunderdome. I can only conclude this has to do with the right decision to let original Mad Max director George Miller direct it. The old school filmmaker crafted a film that looks like all the special effects are done on camera with no CGI. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes the wheel as the title character, but in fact his role is very secondary to Charlize Theron, who plays Furiosa, whose trying to help the wives of A cult leader escape his clutches and make it to what they call ""green land"" <br/><br/>The movie has very beautiful scenery that completely contradicts the insanity of the action. On top of that was a killer musical score going through the whole thing.<br/><br/>Fury Road is a blockbuster that lives up to the frequently quoted phrase, thrill ride, cause it truly is non-stop. <br/><br/>Thumbs up."

It is beautiful in all its disgusting glory, and it holds on to you for almost its entire runtime. There are some spots left in so that you can catch your breath, but mostly it's all just chasing and being chased. Mostly the latter. Despite its post-apocalyptic setting the movie manages to burst with color in every scene.<br/><br/>The movie did slow down a bit in the last act, or maybe all the action exhausted me, but it never got boring. The only parts of the movie I did not like was when they tried to connect their world to ours. Some parts of it worked, like how they (re)used old technology, their religion and how they spoke. But especially one scene (""shows"") was jarring."

The remaining actors (Tom Hardy included) need to attend workshops at the very least. Some of the supporting cast should change jobs altogether. <br/><br/>The experience of this movie was overall shallow, based on visuals and clichés. I expect a little more quality from the writer and director of something that cost an estimated $150'000'000 to make. <br/><br/>Result: 6.5/10, rounded up to 7, as the rating system doesn't take 1/2 points."

"rogerdarlington","Null","3","8","16 May 2015"," The road to hell ... and massive box office
","Following ""Mad Max"" (1979), ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981), and ""Mad Max Beyond The Thunderdome"" (1985), thirty years later the same writer and director, Australian George Miller (now aged 70), offers us not so much a sequel as a re imaging of the eponymous hero with Britain's Tom Hardy taking over the lead role from Mel Gibson. The result is a triumph. <br/><br/>There is a plot - but it is a simple one of escape by and attempted recapture of the five beautiful wives/breeders of the chieftain Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who was in the original movie as a character called Toecutter). There is dialogue - but it is minimal and Max himself is so laconic he does not even announce his name until almost the end. But never mind the story or the words, this is supremely a film with an utterly thrilling vision of non-stop action and excitement.<br/><br/>If the 15th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch were alive today, this might well be the fantastical nightmare that he would conjure. Shot in the glorious deserts of Namibia, this is a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by wonderfully bizarre-looking characters and incredibly-inventive vehicles with war drums and bass guitar supplementing the roar of the gas-guzzling trucks, cars and bikes. <br/><br/>The road they race along is properly named and many characters die and many vehicles explode in a fury of conflict and conflagration with barely a pause for breath - and all achieved with the minimum of CGI. Max is aided by two very different warriors: the one-armed, feminist freedom fighter Imperator Furiosa (a shaved-headed Charlize Theron) and a bare-chested, tumour-ridden Nux (white-mouthed Nicholas Hoult) who exhibit more life than the emotionally-wasted (and mad with loss) Max.<br/><br/>Apparently Tom Hardy has signed on for three more ""Mad Max"" films which is fine by me."

The series was tarnished somewhat by the Peter Pan-esque Beyond Thunderdome.. Considering how some of the recent re-hashes were (Total Recall, Robocop), I wasn't sure if this one was going to be any better... However, once Tom Hardy joined the project, I was certain it was going to be epic... And I was not disappointed... It was far better than what I had imagined by looking at the trailer... An edge-of-the-seat thriller that keeps you entertained and mesmerized... Doesn't waste any time in setting up the pace and somehow manages to keep the tempo up...

It is not the most impressive when it comes to story, but hell, it doesn't really matter, it is fun, it is insane, it is freaking MAD. The villains are twice what the original villains were, and the same goes for the chase and action scenes. The one thing I would want to complain about is, it simply doesn't have enough Max.

","Mad Max makes The Fast and The Furious look like little kids on tricycles making motorcycle sounds. Needless to say, I loved this movie. I saw it with my Dad not knowing what to expect. After the movie ended, I talked my Dads ear off about how awesome it was, not knowing how much he hated it. If you like action, you will love Mad Max: Fury Road. The movie is a constant car chase that is never boring. George Miller's use of practical effects brings a level of realism to the screen that recent action movies like The Avengers and The Hobbit failed to create. I haven't shown it to my friends yet because of our busy schedules but they are already tired of hearing me talk about all the great things about Mad Max. It is the closest Hollywood has come to creating a western punk opera. Even without the format of a Broadway Musical (unless you count the bad-ass flame throwing guitar player), the score will keep you captivated from beginning to end. What a day. What a lovely day!"

","I went and saw this with Mrs Sankari last Thursday. We bought tickets for the 18:45 showing, and I expected the place to be packed. It wasn't. There were probably 12 people in the entire theatre (including ourselves) so we scored perfect seats.<br/><br/>Two people walked out after the first half hour. I still have no idea why.<br/><br/>MMFR has rather idiotically been described as a feminist movie, and so-called 'Men's Rights Activists' have reacted to this with the well practised impotent rage for which their tribe is notorious.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the whole thing is a manufactroversy. Just off the top of my head:<br/><br/>* the prevailing culture is unequivocally partiarchal * the only known matriarchal tribe is on the verge of extinction, with less than half a dozen members left * nearly all of the fighting is done by the men * when the women fight the men they are invariably overpowered * Furiosa spends most of her time driving, while Max spends most of his time fighting so that she can stay alive long enough to keep driving * five of the main female cast members are helpless sex slaves * the remaining members of Furiosa's tribe don't even have names (or did I miss them?they were interchangeable characters anyway) * all of the women end up being rescued by men * by the end of the movie, men are still in charge of everything<br/><br/>If that's a feminist movie, I'm Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>So anyway... this is one huge knockout blockbuster; a hell of a ride with all kinds of crazy shizzle. Miller's direction is superb. Within the first 10 minutes he uses broad strokes to paint a complete picture of his post-apocalyptic world, and by the 15 minute mark you're fully immersed.<br/><br/>Everything feels real and utterly believable. The deliberate use of practical FX (including fully driveable vehicles) places this film in the upper echelons of cinema, leaving CGI-heavy wannabes like Avatar in the dust. The main characters were extremely well drawn, and properly fleshed out. My personal favourites were Max and Nux, with the latter particularly impressive due to his development throughout the film.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, there is just so much to describe and appreciate. It is hands down the best film I have seen in years and I will definitely be seeing it again.<br/><br/>I rate Mad Max: Fury Road at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a jaw-dropping 9/10 on IMDb.

","After hearing so much good feedback about this movie, I finally broke down and headed to my neighborhood theater to see it... though in the back of my mind I was thinking, ""It can't be THAT good!"" Well, it's been about an hour and half after walking out of the theater, and I'm still feeling blown away. The reports of the movie being almost non-stop action are true - it's basically one action sequence after another. Now, normally I would probably object to the fact that all this action doesn't leave much room for story or character development, but the action is top notch and filled with much variety, so my interest was always up. Also, in this age of CGI and quick edits, the action in this movie goes against the norm for the most part, using practical effects and more relaxed editing so that it's very easy to follow all the action. <br/><br/>However, I will admit that the movie is not perfect. Here are a few quibbles I had with the movie:<br/><br/>(1) A substantial amount of dialogue is hard to make out, due to a combination of thick accents and lots of background noise<br/><br/>(2) The Max Max character actually is up and center a lot less than you think. In the first half hour, he's mostly pushed to the sidelines. He does get more to do in the subsequent portion of the movie, but even then there's almost a feeling he's a supporting character and not a lead character.<br/><br/>(3) I did not understand the visions the Max Max character had several times of an unidentified female character. Who was he thinking of? It's not explained.<br/><br/>(4) The chief villain of the movie is not fleshed out enough, and the complaints I've read here from other IMDb users that he's more or less a clone of the villain in ""The Road Warrior"" do have some weight.<br/><br/>Despite those quibbles, I did enjoy the movie a lot.

","I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of this movie. After  watching the trailer, I was really excited to see this movie and it did  live up to my expectations to a certain extent.  Max (Tom Hardy) is a cop on the run in a post-apocalyptic world which  is now a barren wasteland. He is captured by Captain Immortan Joe and  his gang for his blood. There, they seek to turn him into one of their  own by branding him. Immortan is an evil lord in charge of the only  water and oil supply. He uses his reserves as a means of power over  other humans and he has a large gang (War Boys) to keep everyone in  check.  Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is working for Immortan but then decides to  make a run for it with a few other women (fertile women are in a short  supply as well) to a greener land. She makes the escape in a truck  filled with 3000 gallons of guzzling (water or oil) to make a deal with  a small pack of motorcycle riders in the desert.  As she is chased by Immortan's gang, she unwittingly takes Max who then  offers her help to escape the gang. The rest of the movie is then set  of the various chase scenes and the attempts of Furiosa, Max and the  girls to escape to the green land.  The cinematography and the visual imagery is certainly stunning, worth  experiencing on an IMAX screen. The chase scenes and the landscape  (especially a few scenes in moonlight) were absolutely amazing. The  various concoctions of war vehicles is amazing as well. There were a  few elements of humor as well paired with some really weird things  (women's milk supply, the various outfits and characters including a  guy playing a fire breathing electric guitar throughout the chase  scenes). The music definitely adds to the atmosphere as well, not to  mention the various stunts. The action really gets crazy towards the  end.  On the other hand, there were some things I found lacking. Character  development is certainly missing and there's definitely nothing  significant there to make a connection with the various characters. The  dialogue is ordinary and cliché. The ending is predictable and certain  things don't make sense (like how a gang with tons of ammo and better  equipped vehicles) is unable to stop Furiosa and Max.  One thing is certain, it was different and entertaining, hence a 7/10"

I am not just talking about the stunts which used minimal CGI. Miller has never forgotten that the action serves the human element and that is kept front and centre with superb pathos.<br/><br/>The action is out of this world and it wisely stayed rooted to real world physics. Every vehicle looks like a Franken-monster stitched together from waste metal. The weapons, primitive and deadly. The desperate race across the desert is exhilarating and a symphony of sounds, excesses and madness. Each crash and explosion of twisted metal more jaw-dropping than the preceding one. Yet through all the crazy mayhem, Miller's hand is steady and the orchestra of madness is conducted with superb clarity and pin-point accuracy. Not once did I fall out from the story. I was pulled in immediately and the action is so relentless that I forgot to breathe. Thank goodness for a short respite 30 minutes in.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron turned in an outstanding performance and Tom Hardy as Mad Max, the renegade of the wasteland and the Road Warrior, is fantastic. After a while, my mind was thinking Mel who?<br/><br/>Not a good review... The words here cannot begin to capture the grandiosity of what Miller has achieved. I apologise Mr Miller.

The guy is a huge Star and he also directed Braveheart, Apocalypto and starred in the best one of the Mad Max series: Mad Max 2 (1981). On the other hand, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) could easily be the second best of the series. George Miller knows his stuff and delivers great action sequences, very cool ones, indeed. The action and Charlize Theron performance are the very best of the movie. Tom Hardy is a fine and intense actor, but he is not a Star in the level of Mel. So, if you can ignore this fact, or you're too young, then you will enjoy thoroughly one of the best action movies of the year."
"tinovalkki","8","4","13","29 May 2015"," Visually stunning average script..
","Mad Max is visually stunning film. Most of the movies special effects and stunts are real and you really can see it. Mad Max looks like a movie which won't produced any longer. Today most of the special effects are made with computers. Even the quality of today's CGI-effects still never looks so good like the old type explosions and stunts like they were done in this movie. Frank Millers visuality is beautiful to watch and movies red/brown landscape looks almost magical. Movie is full throttle action from start to finish. That can be a strength of this movie, but it is also the weakness of it. Because of all the action thru out entire movie it's ending won't blow your mind. Also there are some weakness in it's script. Script isn't very clever but it's weakness is buried with all the action. Tom Hardy is good choice to play Mad Max even the story won't give to him much enough to shine in his role. Despite it's weakness in story Mad Max is still one of the best action movies this year so far. With better script it would be perfect."

","*** WARNING: spoilers in the second half of the review ***<br/><br/>1.<br/><br/>I am now writing this review after i have watched the movie twice. First time with friends who really liked the movie and another time with ones who dislike the movie. As i said, after seeing it twice, i'm giving it BY FAR 10/10!<br/><br/>First of all, this is a PURE INSANE ACTION MOVIE. The plot is not the main issue in this movie. Many can call it a shallow opinion, but in this kind of movies, you don't need an amazing plot to make an amazing pure action movie, A symphony of pure action.<br/><br/>Many may say that a GREAT movie have to have mainly a GREAT plot,a GREAT acting and a DEEP somewhat feelings for the characters. I think that a GREAT movie is the one that synchronizes all of the above in just the right way, even without the GREAT elements of the above - which this film did with an outstanding way!<br/><br/>The movie is NOT connected by anything to the old Mad Max trilogy, only by it's name and some guiding lines and the car, of course. The most common mistake is to come to this movie with an expectation to a deep plot and overwhelmed dialogs - DON'T!<br/><br/>This is a SURREAL, DARK, BRUTAL, APOCALYPTIC & HIGH CGI EFFECTS MOVIE.<br/><br/>No unnecessary dialogs that cut the extremely high pace of this move and no too emotional explanations about the background of the characters. ONLY the necessary information is included to know and sympathise well enough the characters. Also included is a spiritual cause. No long and brutal journey is worth the price without a spiritual cause.<br/><br/>2. SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>The characters: Imperator Furiosa - A character that seeks for redemption for joining the bad side and mostly have guilt feeling about her past and a high commitment to free Immortan Joe's ""property"", the most beautiful girls in this film, led by Splendid, the amazing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.<br/><br/>Mad Max - A dialog that i can compare to Jean Claude's dialog from the 80's and 90's movies. Almost NO dialog. The deepest sentence in this whole movie was saying his name, twice! On the other hand, He's just not the main figure, he's just a tormented force tool that helps Furiosa to escape Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Nux - A well developing character in the movie. He literally evolves from the Dark side to the good side. He helps, with his handy hand and brilliant mind, Furiosa to escape from Immortan Joe. His character does get redemption even he almost didn't feel it. A great supporting act by Nicholas Hoult!<br/><br/>Immortan Jow - A dictator. controls his almost-dead subjects by water. The water gave him the power in a world that politicians like him destroyed it. He's obsessed by having his property. Like dictators obsessed by power. He wants his ""propert"", the girls, to be returned no matter the costs. And that's his weakness, he forgot to protect his own citadel in his madness. A good and needed evil to make this movie a super fast pace.<br/><br/>After seeing it for the second time, i was as enthusiasted as i was in the first time! Although there's A LOT of holes in the plot, like the path in the canyon that miraculously repairs itself and the Arrow that hit Max in the head. As Max vanishes in the crowd at the end, seems like the injury is not that serious - An arrow in the brain! The fast pace of this film will distract you from that kind of stuff, and you know what? The movie is so amazing, that i'll forgive the production. ""Mistakes to keep the movie running high""."

"themadmovieman","8","4","13","14 May 2015"," Insanity gone utterly mad!
","What an insane film! Unlike the disappointing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and more like the first two movies, this takes the craziness to a brilliantly high level. With constant mind-blowing and explosive action throughout, epic visual effects and cinematography, and a pretty exciting story too, this is an absolute thrill ride that can't be missed.<br/><br/>The main thing about this film is that it is totally and utterly insane, but deliberately. You see how severe this apocalypse has been by the way that everybody's just gone completely out of their mind, making for a world of total madness and insanity.<br/><br/>The fact that this film approaches this insanity with a good sense of humour, to the extent where you see a guy with no eyes playing a double guitar that shoots flames out of it whilst in battle, this film is quite simply a hell of a lot of fun to watch, however the drama and excitement in the story is not at all cheapened by that.<br/><br/>This film has a very simple plot, being set around what is effectively a two-hour car chase across the desert, but the success here is that it manages to bring in proper drama and intrigue for its main characters along the way. Max, played excellently by Tom Hardy, is as enigmatic as ever, and although he doesn't have the sense of extreme anger like the first three films, he's still a solid action hero that you always want to support.<br/><br/>However, the stand-out character here is by far Imperator Furiosa, who claims what is effectively the position of main character, being the one whose ambition and drive pushes the entire story along, whilst she's also a very strong, and totally badass action heroine, thanks to a brilliant performance by Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of this film is the visuals and the on-screen vibe that it gives off. The special effects, both practical and CGI, are stunning to behold, whilst the cinematography of the action sequences throughout is flawless, taking a very simple approach to filming the fight scenes that makes it much easier to watch than a generic shaky-cam look.<br/><br/>This is also the first Mad Max film where you get the vibrant colours of the desert world shining through. In Mad Max 2, there's a little bit of that, however this film is simply beautiful to look at, whether it's at the wide golden landscape shots of the vast desert or the gloomier, bluer night scenes that add to the eeriness and tension of the story even more.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give this an 8, because of its fantastically exciting story, strong characters and performances, stunning visuals and the sheer insanity that prevails throughout."
"michaelRokeefe","8","5","18","3 June 2015"," Physical and frenetic..Max is back!
","Nitro fueled injected, high octane, smash your face and kick ass bold action. Not a sequel or even reboot...not even a retread; Max is back for another post-apocalyptic life threatening trip in the Wasteland. Max Rockatansky(Tom Hardy)is captured by desert raiders called War Boys and shuffled back to an outpost where his uninfected blood can be harvested as fuel for the captors. These savages are under the rule of a masked ruler named Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne).<br/><br/>Max will reluctantly befriend a relentless driver Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron), who has accomplished a getaway for herself and five of Joe's wives,including Capable(Riley Keough)and The Splendid Angharad(Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Max will help Furiosa fight off Joe's minions and other marauders on the way across the Wasteland to an oasis called the Green Place.<br/><br/>Elaborate vehicle chases and crashes as all hell breaks loose. Perilous and adrenaline pumping rushes back and forth the Fury Road. Bloody mayhem. The carnage is very aggressive, blatant and grisly.<br/><br/>The cast also features: Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, John Howard, Abbey Lee and Nathan Jones. Kudos to director George Miller, cinematographer John Seale and Junkie XL for the vibrant score. (By the way, the alluring Miss Keough is the granddaughter of Elvis Presley)."

","Absurd, gratuitous and made for 13 year olds who think skulls as decoration in everything and everyone is the ultimate coolness.The explosions are the main characters and grunts the dialogues.The only joke it has is that it is seen as a species of Sharknado with a budget thousands of times larger. And yet it's not as funny as Sharknado and similar Syfy movies."
"michaeltong-29180","7","3","9","4 May 2016"," Looks different but isn't
","In an age where Hollywood blockbusters look very similar, where a major US city gets destroyed in almost every film, I understand why Fury Road is a breath of fresh air. It looks unique. The art design and costumes are fantastic. It totally deserves the Oscars it won.<br/><br/>However, the story and characters merely serve as a vehicle for action sequences. That's cool if you just like action, but come on, lets not act like it's a masterpiece. It's an action packed thrill ride, but nothing more. The dialogue is clunky and even the action gets repetitive. There isn't much depth to any of the characters, except maybe Nux who has the most character development in the whole story.<br/><br/>In anticipation of this film I watched Mad Max: Road Warrior for the first time and I couldn't help but think about how much better it is. In terms of scale it is a much smaller film, but it is gritty and tense. The world is brutal and a can of dog food is the best meal a man can expect. In Fury Road people use water, gas, and bullets like they're infinite. The rules of the world don't make sense. It's inconsistent and it constantly breaks my immersion.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is poorly cast and poorly written as Max. Say what you want about how crazy Gibson is, but he can convey more in one look than all of Hardy's grunts in FR combined.<br/><br/>Theron is good as Furiosa but her character is underdeveloped. She has no arc. She just is. She suffers from being too perfect. She has no flaws. Every bullet she fires is a headshot. It's boring.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe looks cool, but he's hardly as intimidating or interesting as The Humungus.<br/><br/>One of the biggest things that was praised about the film were the ""practical effects"" but that is all undermined by having Max survive a fatal CGI car crash in the sand-storm scene. He doesn't even get a cut. All tension goes out the window after that part.<br/><br/>Fury Road is loud, fast, and in your face but it's compensating for a lack of interesting story and characters. It is the cinematic equivalent of dangling a shiny object in front of a cat. Sometimes that's all a film needs to be, but lets not pretend it's the best film ever. The praise this film received almost makes me think the bar for good films has been lowered."
"Christopher_Reid","10","3","9","21 January 2016"," Visually incredible, great action, interesting soundtrack
","This is one of the most visually amazing movies I've ever seen. It makes most movies appear dull by comparison. The yellowy orange sand contrasts with the blue sky and white clouds and overall the landscape is gorgeous and really well filmed. Night scenes have a blue tinge so that we can see everything and it feels like moonlight or the twilight hour. The vehicles are extravagant and spiky and bulky and have all kinds of gadgets attached with cool things I haven't seen before. There is a cliff and an artificial waterfall with poor people stuck on the land below. The cast of characters look crazy, like a freak show or something. This is not a movie going through the paces, it's hugely imaginative and creative and the passion of the film-makers comes through in every frame.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is not weighed down by anything unnecessary. It is dominated by action throughout and it focuses on that. Exposition is achieved through chase or fight scenes. We figure out what is going on as the movie progresses. There are no sappy moments, characters rarely cry and the movie doesn't bother to dwell on their feelings too much. It's more about survival. But the characters are human enough to relate to and care about. Tom Hardy is stoic and hardly says anything as Max. He communicates through stares and gestures. Charlize Theron is really good as Imperator Furiosa. She's tough and determined but you can tell she still has fears and hopes.<br/><br/>It's a great achievement that the film makes use of so many practical stunts and effects. It feels far different from other action movies of recent years. It will not date the way CGI-fests will. The editing makes it easy to follow the action. It can be chaotic, but we know who we're looking at and what is actually happening. The way scenes play out is highly original. People can get snatched out of nowhere, explosions happen haphazardly, vehicles get crushed or flipped, harpoons lodge into trucks and have to be removed with bolt-cutters. But they're not arbitrary montages, they're planned out sequences of events with logical consequences that build tension and excitement.<br/><br/>The music adds to the strange, ominous, brooding atmosphere of the film. It uses a range of styles. There are powerful low pulses on strings, crazy electric guitar and tribal drumming stuff (which parallels what's on the screen) and just generally lots of good music that I found hard to categorise.<br/><br/>I wish more movies could be as bold and imaginative as Fury Road. I love the stark imagery throughout. The bad guy looks so cool and bizarre. It seems deserving that it has received 10 Oscar nominations. Clearly a lot of work was put into it and it isn't imitating anything but is reaching out into new possibilities for cinema. Why can't a 2 hour movie be one long action chase scene with real stunts? It was also nice to hear so many Australian accents in a movie. It feels like home.<br/><br/>The visuals in the movie suggest a kind of hell or purgatory for the main characters. Will they find heaven or at least a stable, happy life? What is the right path to take? Riding off into the unknown or against the odds for a real chance at redemption? Perhaps there will be a nuclear war and maybe this is what humanity will become. But even with this extreme environment, there are parallels to modern life. For me, this world actually makes more sense than real life. I don't understand people that *need* a coffee every day and who enjoy chatting about reality TV shows. Send me to Fury Road where my life has meaning - survive!"
"stephenmcmul","9","3","9","13 September 2015"," Why are there so many negative reviews?
","This film is great fun!<br/><br/>I don't understand the number of negative reviews here on IMDb. Admittedly, a significant portion of this movie's run-time is action, but what where you expecting?<br/><br/>An important thing about this film is that the action is genuinely well done; this is impressive considering that many of the 'blockbusters' of recent years (Transformers, recent Die Hard movies, Wrath of the Titans, etc.) often contain action sequences you can fall asleep watching despite being stuffed to the brim with CGI. In areas, this film clearly relies heavily on CGI, but it's never over done. The action in this film is essentially all part of one huge car chase, with few diversions, which allows for a continual steam of exhilarating carnage.<br/><br/>The main characters in this film all look very distinct, and have vibrant and entertaining personalities. Tom Hardy is brilliant as Max, and as many have pointed out, Charlize Theron is great as Furiosa too. Also worth mentioning is Hugh Keays-Byrne, who is very effective as a menacing presence in the form of the tyrannical warlord 'Immortan Joe'. There could be more dialogue in this movie, but it wouldn't be necessary- if anything, it would remove from the awesome non-stop insanity of the film. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is into action films, and feel that general moviegoers will likely find a lot to like here too."
"BirdmanT7","Null","3","9","15 August 2015"," Mad Max with a Feminist Disguise
","I have always liked the ""Mad Max"" films, I like George Miller as a director because he created a vision of a apocalyptic post nuclear violent future world with ""Mad Max"" films. I respect him for the fact that he never let anyone else direct other sequels of MM films other than himself. Miller returned after 30 years for this long awaited sequel and among all the directors(Scott,Spielberg, Lucas) whom attempted to do sequels with CGI, Miller somehow managed to refuse that option and went old school with a real crew, stunts in the desert and at 70 years of age he created a masterpiece with ""Fury Road"". <br/><br/>I just saw this recent ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" with Tom Hardy, which at first when I read he was casted as Max I thought it was a odd choice but now having watched this film I am sorry to say that I feel he was a terrible choice. I hate to compare one actor to another, I liked Mel Gibson because he made Max more interesting and charismatic on the screen, where as Tom Hardy seemed lost or confused with this role. I have seen Hardy playing these very oddball sociopaths roles like ""Bronson"" or ""Bane"" (in Batman) or the simple-minded Bob in the ""Drop""; I think his acting ranges only between those types. Hardy seemed to only to play the tough brutal Max. I heard in a interview there was not full script for him and it was mostly story boarded but that is an actor's dream to improvise. So he can blame there was no script but that missing script had more lines for Charlize Theron and the other characters like NUX than Max whom the movie was suppose to be about. <br/><br/>This was a great action film, a true masterpiece of its kind, Miller not relying on CGI was what made it great, however it lacked a coherent narrative in parts. Also the casting of these super model looking girls as breeding mothers dressed like they were in some Vouge magazine shoot out in the desert just didn't fit when it came to casting. The photography had a comic book look compare to they way Miller had that barren landscape in ""Road Warrior"" which complemented the theme of a post apocalyptic world rather than this primary colors, glossy blue sky that looked like a Disney movie. Although the sets and cast of characters of these various characters like ""Nux"" and ""The Bullet Farmer"" were very interesting and he really got the comic book look come alive on the screen. <br/><br/>This movie was disguised first with action then with a feminist theme; but it was really more of marketing strategy to appeal and draw a wider female audience. To have female hero ""Furiosa"", a freedom fighter battling against an oppressive male regime. Theron made this character tough she looked like a an action figure; compare to Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"" as ""Ripley"" with non-model looks was only wearing a unisex worker's uniform was smart and forceful. This was suppose to be a Mad Max film but ""Furiosa"" became the center of this film, the action disguised the viewer to forget it was a Mad Max movie, he was just a passenger, it was like a Houdini magic act to suddenly convert this movie into a Feminist action film; sorry to say that was another cloak to think someone like ""Furisoa"" is a feminist role model. <br/><br/>In ""Road Warrior"" and ""Beyond the Thunderdome"" there was a lot of more dialogue spoken by Max than this film. Miller was the person who co-wrote those first 3 Max films stories and scripts, so how come this there was no lines for the new Max?. I feel the Mad Max that I knew was missing on the screen. Hardy was this mute, brooding and angry Max that felt he didn't want to be in this movie. That scene where he first find the girls washing with the water hose by the truck he was just moaning to get the wire cutter. Those fight scenes with Theron were stupid in a way, because Furiosa saw Max was a prisoner and tied up and used as blood bank, he was not part of war boys, so why fight Max?. The old Max was more smarter in how to assess the situation around him with humor. There is no sense of humor to Tom Hardy's Max at all, he is more muscles than brains. The plot would have been more interesting if Max had captured and returned these women with NUX to bargain and exchange to get his car and fuel and then rescued them back.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the film itself, the visuals and most of all Charlize Theron as ""Furiosa"" who really carried most of the weight of this film but I can't call this a Mad Max movie. I hope Mr. Miller either finds a new Max or breaths some life into Tom Hardy's version of Max with a script that Hardy can read and follow, because casting should not just be about how big a star is to sell the film. My choice for Max would have been either another Australian actor like ""Sam Worthington"" who has been in a number of action films like ""Clash of Titans"" or ""Luke Evans"" (who was in ""Dracula: Untold) that really surprised me as how good an actor he is, his reactions has more depth than Hardy could ever conjure a grin. The Mad Max films are now made for a new generation who probably don't care about depth or acting but more about the action, so I hope Miller started a trend for films to be shot with a real setting and crew instead the illusion of CGI."
"asda-man","9","3","9","21 June 2015"," It's nice to see that George Miller has mellowed in his old age
","Slow, uneventful, boring, and subtle. These are some of the words you'd never hear from any sane person describing Mad Max 4. Before I dig deeper I should probably let you know that I'm a twenty year-old man who only recently watched the original Mad Max trilogy, so I don't have any nostalgia attached to them. The first Mad Max film is genuinely considered mediocre by most people apart from proud Aussies, and my opinion was pretty much the same. It didn't leave a particularly lasting impression.<br/><br/>The Road Warrior, however, is generally considered as one of the greatest action movies of all time. I was expecting a full-on action fest (much like Fury Road) but unfortunately what I got was a ponderous seventy minutes involving Max titting about with a colony of people protecting fuel before ending with a spectacular car chase. I was quite disappointed and can name several older action films that are far better than The Road Warrior (Terminator 2 and Hard Boiled to name two). Beyond Thunderdome is generally considered as the worst of the lot but to my pleasant surprise I actually enjoyed this the most out of the trilogy! It might have something to do with me being a massive Tina Turner fan, but I thought there was more action and better characters than the other two films.<br/><br/>After being largely underwhelmed by the Mad Max trilogy, I had my expectations for Fury Road lowered. Pretty much every review I've read has been astonishingly glowing with many hailing it as one of the best action films of all time, but didn't they say that about The Road Warrior? Fury Road is directed by the same George Miller, a man now in his seventies who hasn't directed an action film since Beyond Thunderdome and whose recent credits include Happy Feet and Babe: Pig in the City, Mad Max 4 is bound to be pretty weak, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Believe the hype. Mad Max: Fury Road is an incredible feat. I have no idea how George Miller managed to pull out something so utterly spectacular out of his bag. Fury Road is the best action film I've seen since The Raid and has some of the best stunt work since The Dark Knight Rises. In my opinion it leaves the original Mad Max trilogy lying face down in the dust. Fury Road is the great big throbbing war machine whilst the original trilogy is some old rusty bicycle. The first ten minutes of Fury Road is far better than anything from Mad Max 1-3 and the entire two hour film definitely contains far more action than the first three films put together. Fury Road is amazing.<br/><br/>It opens with an epic monologue from our new Max, Tom Hardy. Mel Gibson never did anything for me as Max. In fact, the character of Max never did much for me. I much prefer Tom Hardy as Max. His accent may be as muddled as Stu's tan in Mrs. Doubtfire but I think he has much more of a presence than Mel Gibson ever did. His famous interceptor is destroyed within the first five minutes which is obviously symbolic. Just like James Bond getting shot in the opening of Skyfall and a TV exploding in the opening of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, the interceptor getting totalled represents a new era of Mad Max. George Miller has completely cut the ties from the original films and quite rightly so! We get thrown into a huge world and feel fully immersed. The imagery is huge and epic. It feels like something from Lord of the Rings with some powerful masked weirdo sitting on a giant cliff and spilling gallons of water to his loyal pale-painted followers. The villain in Fury Road is basically Aunty Entity on acid and curiously similar to Tom Hardy's very own Bane. He's a brilliantly memorable villain who has his very own breast milk farm and an army of seriously sexy wives.<br/><br/>It occurred to me about three quarters of a way through the film that I actually cared about the characters on the screen, which I've never felt before during a Mad Max film (apart from Tina of course). The action still comes first, but there's still some character development to keep you interested in the thin plot. Some have complained that Charlize Theron's Furiosa character takes over from Max but that didn't bother me at all. I love strong female characters and Furiosa is definitely that! I cared about the clan of oddballs and their goal. Enough, anyway, to make me care about who is in the action.<br/><br/>Talking of action. Fury Road's action sequences are every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's a total intense onslaught of revving action from start to finish. Within the first thirty minutes, we're plunged into a fiery sandstorm with a furious army of vehicles in hot pursuit. I sat there completely mesmerised by what I was watching. There's a jarring moment shortly afterwards where Max slowly awakes from a pile of sand and the slowness of the scene is so bloody jarring! Ninety minutes of Fury Road is just pure full-throttle action. It's amazingly executed with so little CGI and jaw-dropping stunt work. The final chase sequence is completely exhausting.<br/><br/>Fury Road is eye popping. I felt like Toe Cutter before he collides into a lorry in Mad Max 1 for most of it. Let's just hope that the sequel will be like The Raid 2. It could easily get better by putting as much focus on character development and plot as well as the action. The Raid 2 did exactly that and produced one of the best films of the twenty first century. As it stands though, Fury Road is a gigantic, towering achievement. You can almost feel the testosterone sweating off the screen. The Fast and Furious franchise can well and truly sod off."

And mind you those are the only 5 minutes of sanity we get.<br/><br/>Then starts the long ride of action that will keep you on edge of your seat for whole of the movie. Cars chasing, trucks exploding, insane shooting, stabbing, gore violence is on your plate which will blow you away.<br/><br/>Acting wise both leads do not have much to show case as direction and action take front seat and do most of the talking. Story is nothing more than kind of redemption and salvation.<br/><br/>My final take Go for it, as it is bang on your buck and will leave you insanely amazed."

Charlize Theron is an awesome actress and she played this part perfectly, as she does all of her roles. I don't want to leave out the other cast members especially Tom Hardy,Zoë Kravitz and Nicholas Hoult, they were all equally amazing.After seeing this version of the movie I went home and found the previous versions of this movie on demand. I grew up watching Mel Gibson play Mad Max. There are some movies you know can't be re-made( like Conan), but I can honestly say that they did an extraordinary job with the re-make of Mad Max.

"adamscastlevania2","8","3","9","25 May 2015"," A fun, but not faultless return for Max
","(79%) A remake?/sequel? that really, really goes for it full force in the face and in doing so largely impresses, yet doesn't quite take the crown of the very best of the series which is, and probably always will be, Mad Max 2. Tom Hardy fills the role that Mel left behind in the mid eighties, though this time Max hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film, but then he was never a big talker, with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely Charlize Theron's character. This is a visually epic looking film with TONS of loud, fast well shot action, though I missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesn't have as much of. Plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through, some of them good, some not so great. In terms of all-out action this is a must watch. It's hugely entertaining and very well made, it's also worthy of the Mad Max name, which is probably its biggest accomplishment."
"simon-wang","10","3","9","25 May 2015"," weird, sick and ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ...
","Firstoff I never watched the original films. So seeing the bizarre, insane world of Mad Max for the very first time, I couldn't help thinking ""what the heck?"", I thought the movie walks on a thin line between sick and brilliant, but now I know that it's both: every shot of the movie is needed and pitch perfect.<br/><br/>You must admire it, not only the vision of George Miller, but the relentlessness to put this gigantomatic vision into reality. I bet not one single soul except Miller, expected such a movie could ever exist, until they actually saw it.<br/><br/>The music often reminds of an orchestra, and that's pretty much what it is: an orchestra of blood, bones, dirt, absolutely breathtaking action, unique cinematography and epic heroism.<br/><br/>The ending literally brought tears into my eyes, not only because it was such an uplifting, heartfelt conclusion, but also because it was so pitch perfect, like the entire movie was pitch perfect, and like probably no other movie will be in a long time ..."
"Joxerlives","9","3","9","25 May 2015"," The kitchen sink, the working surface and the whole damn dining room!
","Wow, you really thought that Mad Max 2 was the ultimate chase film but it really has nothing on this! It got to the point that it was utter sensory overload but never boringly so (because you cared about the characters, the ultimate secret to any action film)<br/><br/>Okay, first off I see this as a reboot occurring just after the original Mad Max. We see Max with his iconic 'last of the V8 interceptors' police car at the beginning and as that was destroyed in Mad Max 2 we must assume that Hardy's Max and Gibson's Max one day came to a fork in the road and one went one way and the second went another. Therefore Gibson's Max is happily living out his life with the feral kids after returning to them at the end of Beyond Thunderdome, staying right there, living a long time and being grateful. Hardy's Max by contrast is still looking for redemption before finding his new family and purpose (at the end he walks away from the celebration in true cowboy style, just as Gibson's Max chooses not to go with the settlers to form their new colony 'The Great Northern Tribe' at the end of Mad Max 2, he isn't done yet). We see the beginnings of Max's moral comeback here, choosing to risk his own life when he could have walked away, finding in Furiosa and her sisterhood something worth fighting for and living for. When he finally reveals his name to Furiosa it shows that he is beginning to remember who he once was and who he might be again, no longer just a nameless drifter.<br/><br/>All credit to some extremely brave stuntmen who made this film, really beggars belief that no one was killed in the filming. Amazing special effects too, the idea that Furiosa's missing arm was created using purely CGI is staggering. <br/><br/>A feminist film? I guess so, we have both the 'brides' and the 'milk cows' rebelling, we have the motherhood taking over at the end. In the previous Mad Max films we'd had rape, a formidable female warrior who was then killed off and Aunty Entity, in many ways an admirable figure but also the quasi villain. Staggering that this got a 15 rating, the caesarean scene made me cringe like nothing else. <br/><br/>All told pretty damn brilliant and definitely up for another sequel."
"AndrewPalmeri","10","3","9","25 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road Review
","Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of the most phenomenal movies Iv'e seen. This movie has everything you want and more from an action movie - suspense, gore, thrill, explosions and much more. From the beginning till the end you feel like you are apart of the movie. It captivates you in a way most films fail to do. The film leaves you with emotion and suspense, the whole way through. Not to mention the acting is superb. This film has such a different tone and feel, but different is good in this films case. George Miller as yet created another masterpiece in the Mad Max franchise. Congratulations to the cast and crew because this movie is superb!"
"harry_priya","9","3","9","25 May 2015"," Really good but...
","Technically this movie was incredible, and my opinion of it increased when I read that about 90% of the stunts were real, not CG. The acting was superb (I'm not a fan of Charlize Theron but she was exceptional here) and it was great to see women kick some ass. In spite of that, this movie made me so uncomfortable - especially that highly intense opening scene - that while I can say I definitely appreciated the movie, I did not enjoy it. The setting and behaviour of some of the characters is really gruesome, and there's no preparation at all - you're just thrown in head first.<br/><br/>Still worthwhile to watch, but be prepared for some horrific scenes."
"Kolorgasm","9","3","9","24 May 2015"," It's wildly action-packed, oozes with pure adrenaline and it doesn't run out of surprises, really.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is no doubt one of the best films this year. It stands out among the rest because of its complex and twisted world building, strong and compelling heroines, stunning visual effects and action scenes and most especially, it's unique and moving story. This film literally has the most dangerous and explosive car chase I've ever seen in any film, and I saw the whole Fast & Furious film franchise. George Miller is indeed a genius, to create such a twistedly beautiful story of survival and to actually sell it is not easy. I am very impressed with the world building, the details, the whole atmosphere and feel of it got stuck on me. I imagined I would not last in that dry and disease infested world where everyone has to fight for food and water. Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) are two compelling characters that clearly have different agendas, caught in a brutal world they are forced to be on, but because of a common enemy, undecidedly became the strongest of allies. Watching these two heroines exchange guns and the steering wheel is nothing but exciting and thrilling. Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road is mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat experience that doesn't flood you with too much script. This film is all about the goods. It's wildly action-packed, oozes with pure adrenaline and it doesn't run out of surprises, really. What a lovely day."
"alidur07","9","3","9","24 May 2015"," Miller is back!!!
","Oh George, you know what you do, don't you? Mad Max is really mad! Tom Hardy nails it, but the looks on Theron's face is beyond hot, the looks could only be explained as, I guess, mad... For the ones looking for what they are expecting to see after watching the trailer, you'll find it. Before going to the movie, I hope George is not going to disappoint me, but hey, he didn't. My expectations were already very high from the trailer looking all mad. For the big fans, Mad Max is back. And, I never exaggerate when it comes to movies. Scenes just do not let you sit back and lean on your back. It just doesn't let you breath for a second, which is well planned and exercised by Miller... Good job!"

","Mad Max Fury Road is exactly how an old movie franchise should be rebooted! All the old Mad maxes mashed into one, stamped with an unpredictable script and pumped full of steroids and speed!!! Jurassic park 4 and terminator 100 (whatever number it is now lol) should take note! Don't make a movie franchise because it has a history and you can make money from the name, make a film because you have a great story to tell! Mad Max has quite a story to tell, possibly even seeing a glimpse of what humanities future may even be like when oil and natural resources have run dry. Defiantly go see this film for the sheer cinematic brilliance!"
"mbntz-04670","10","3","9","24 May 2015"," A masterpiece for this generation
","Mad Max; Fury Road. There are almost no words to describe the sheer brilliance of George Miller's latest effort, the finished product speaks for itself. The action is high octane and non-stop, it is a beautiful film to look at, and that largely has to do with the fact that almost all of it is achieved through practical effects. I read somewhere that director George Miller spent 17 years to work on a script for Fury Road, and his effort has paid off tremendously. Another thing that makes this movie a masterpiece is that; you don't even need to be familiar with the original story and film to enjoy it, all the groundwork is established right off the bat, and the characters develop much deeper throughout the course of the film, that you feel as if you know them. Truly a spectacle, and achievement in filmmaking, bravo George Miller! 11/10 that extra one is for the guitar player with the guitar that shoots flames"
"tim-31277","9","3","9","24 May 2015"," Miller's dream realised at last
","Stunning non stop action tour de force from Miller. Seat of the pants, superbly choreographed stunts, without the obvious fakery of CGI, leading presumably to many injuries from the consummate cast.<br/><br/>Hardy is outstanding as the jittery, haunted Max. A man of few of words, many regrets, and plagued by visions of a violent and heartbroken past. Theron's moody portrayal of the rebel Furiosa, whom Max reluctantly assists with escape is equally excellent, reminiscent of a young Ellen Ripley.<br/><br/>Visually, Fury Road - with the help of 2000AD's renowned Brendan McCarthy - has refined Miller's post apocalyptic dream to perfection. It is glorious to behold, and sets, makeup and costumes are incredible.<br/><br/>Like previous outings for Max Rockatansky, little is discussed about the why and the how, and much is implied through snippets combined with meaningful gazes between the main leads. This adds to the mythology of the franchise, the modern day western, the man with no name.<br/><br/>Less is more is done very well yet again by Miller, and this insane romp of a car chase, exploding across a parched land consisting of the broken, diseased and insane remnants of humanity, is presumably what he envisioned in 1979. Then he had the talent in Gibson, but not the money, but still managed to produce a reasonable facsimile of his minds eye.<br/><br/>In Fury Road the vision is finally realised, and hopefully in further installments we may discover ""Who killed the World?"" in an attempt to untangle the past, and give hope to Max's future."
"WilliamOTyler","10","3","9","24 May 2015"," His name is Max and his movie is brilliant.
","Oh what a day! What a LOVELY day!<br/><br/>Director George Millar returns over 30 years later to add a new story to his original Mad Max trilogy. But this sequel, fitting right in with all the previous entries, pushes the already full throttle franchise to near-biblical proportions. Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic race of humanity versus the utterly insane, and it is stunningly beautiful, a visual feast indeed. Every aspect of it is over the top fun. From its color palette to its extreme costume and mechanical styling, this is definitely a modern day opera.<br/><br/>The landscape is empty and bleak, like a blank orange canvas being splattered with white zombie torsos and spiked hedgehog cars. I've never actually wanted to be inside of a dust storm until now. I have never wanted dirt in my mouth as much as I did watching this movie. To be in the thick of all the parched craziness, it's a testament to the visual designers of this film that such extremely hot and dry conditions look gorgeously appealing.<br/><br/>As the dust kicks up and the action starts, Fury Road will not let you forget that this franchise is best known for its car chase scenes. If you're a car person, this movie will absolutely make you lose your mind. But if you're not a car person, well... This movie will still make you lose your mind. The high octane, high speed action here is unreal. It's all just absurd, in the best possible way. These scenes are so engrossing that they sweep you right into them, and just when you think it couldn't possibly push any further, it does. This is like watching Gods fight, which is fitting as the film has an overall mythological feel to it. By the time the very first car chase scene ends, you've already been taken on several loops and thrown to the ground, left to ask yourself ""What did I just watch?!"" And that's just the first one, all while fully establishing our main characters.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely on point. Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky is a great succession to Mel Gibson: quiet and strong but still growing madder and madder after all these years on his never ending Odyssey. Nicholas Hoult is quite inspired as Nux. He's feral and tasty, both sour and sweet. The true strength of the film's characters, though, comes in a different form.<br/><br/>The women of Fury Road are more than just pretty faces. In fact, they are extremely important to the survival of anyone in this film. They are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. They plant the seeds of life. They offer the milk of growth and strength. They release the waters to replenish. They are goddesses. The core group of women here, whose perfect supermodel bodies are covered in only wispy pure white cloth, are furies not to be reckoned with. They are sirens and they are oracles and they will certainly be the end of you.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa is the leader these women need. She's ruthless and does want needs to be done to get the job done. At the same time, she's haunted and not without heart. She's the female equivalent of Max himself, only better. Even Max realizes he wouldn't make it without her and it is a wonder to watch these two work together.<br/><br/>They are aided by Junkie XL's down right dirty score. It sounds grimy and savage in itself, with a harsh drum line and textured electronics. If you could get the musical equivalent of rust brushing against itself in an epic thematic score, this is pretty much it.<br/><br/>It doesn't get much better than this, as far as action flicks go. This is George Miller's masterpiece. With all the high profile movies coming out in the remainder of this year, I'm already calling Mad Max: Fury Road my movie of the year. I would be thoroughly surprised to see any other sequel or remake coming have this much style, originality and symbolism ingrained into such strong characters.<br/><br/>His name is Max and his movie is brilliant."

"i_ianchev","9","3","9","21 May 2015"," What a lovely day!
","If you haven't watched one of the best action movies this year, go to the nearest 3D movie theater and correct this mistake...<br/><br/>It's been a while since I have watched a grand cinematic masterpiece with lots of quality action sequences. Maybe since ""Prometheus"".<br/><br/>Anyway, I want to say a few words about the 4th Mad Max movie which is a true heir to the old movies, and especially to the first one. The exhilarating survival story is concentrated on the desert pursuit of our main hero Max Rockatansky who is helping Imperator Furiosa and the beautiful women, who happen to be running from the die-hard Immortan Joe. This being said - there is no more story setting, no time for prehistory, for building characters in the beginning - the action starts immediately. And it is fueled with relentless strive to overcome dire situations with desperate measures. <br/><br/>What strikes me most is the visual perfection of the execution of each action sequence. It is real, it is scary, it is fast and it is furious. Yes, the dialogue is not much, and is not that good. But the presence of each character and his/her traits are true, visible and charming. We get to see each of the main characters pursue their way of survival, but in the end only together they can achieve survival and fulfillment. Only Max is the ever estranged and wandering loner.<br/><br/>The truth is that this film is not about the depth of its plot, or the growth of a character in it. It is about the unique world in which this survival story is set. It is about the weary road warriors who battle each other over the only true and meaningful things left in the world - water, gas and procreation. Because there is no Green Place, no end destination, no other refuge than the one of the mind. And as the main character is driven by his guilt and the ghosts of his lost relatives, the world in which he lives and wanders is driven by the mad desire to survive, to live, to prevail. This may seem and sound crazy (as crazy as the man with the flame- throwing guitar), but more or less I'm used to see this same battle over and over again in our daily life. We may fight over more elitist values, but survival of the fittest is the most common theme in each argument, in each battle we fight in our lives. Because one can leave his/her legacy only as a victor.<br/><br/>No matter how primal it may seem, the message behind Mad Mad is vigorous - through the ecological collapse and moral decadence one can survive only through constant refueling of the inner values and fighting for them. We can truly see the family metaphor with Max, Furiosa and the five wives and War boy Nux in one truck. And the dream of reaching home as a journey back to the beginning after escaping from it.<br/><br/>It is very important for me to note the excellent soundtrack and colorful visuals. I very much like this post apocalyptic desert world of Mad Max. The desperation is tempting, the solace is futile. In order to achieve something better, one has to accept the gritty nature of this aggressive world and fight it in every possible way he/she can.<br/><br/>This is a weird but grandiose roller coaster journey for the eyes, the ears and the mind. A long expected treasure for the road warriors out there."

The visuals of the move where great, they looked like real art, the music, characters, the world, everything was perfectly crafted.

A reference to Australia's Aboriginal children who were taken from their parents, perhaps?

","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a one big, breathtaking, lunatic car chase through a surreal looking Australian desert; <br/><br/>it's mad, it's madder, it's f*ckn Mad Max! <br/><br/>George Miller surpassed himself 30 years after he had let Mel Gibson fight in the Thunderdome for survival and he reclaimed the very essence of the franchise which is furious Speed, violence, freaky characters as well as rough, handmade action scenes with extraordinary vehicles and amidst all this accelerated ferocity, he still found one or two quiet moments for character development, narrative depth, and beautiful, even poetical imagery.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is an excellent replacement for Mel Gibson who would be too old for the role by now and Charlize Theron gives a worthy female counterpart as ""Furiosa""; she is smart and strong and not the only woman in this movie, who steps up to the men in a harsh, misogynic, post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br/><br/>The score, the drums, the electric guitars, it's bombastic! <br/><br/>This is how an action movie should feel like!"
"elystonhayden","10","3","9","19 May 2015"," New Classic
","Simply outstanding cinema experience, worth the 3D admission! Beautifully shot by Miller and acted by cast, the special effects are breathtaking and the films scope operatic. I really enjoyed Nicholas Hault, Abbey Lee and Riley Keoughs performances and the villain Hugh Keay-Byrne was decidedly bonkers. The desert chase sequences are truly jaw-dropping and should be watched on the big screen to take it all in. In the last decade not since Nolan's Inception has the the blockbuster format been so well utilizer as a visual art-form, Fury Road will be mimicked for years to come. Highly recommended, I am looking forward to a repeat viewing."
"sid-chem-iit","10","3","9","18 May 2015"," Oh what a day, what a glorious day!
","Fury Road starts off with an insane view of the now-barren landscape, and that is perhaps the only point during the film where you can take a breath and soak in the sights. What follows is two hours of breath-taking action and surprisingly coherent layer of drama that ties the movie together. <br/><br/>Other reviewers have written about the creativity and novelty exhibited in the action sequences, so I will not get into them. They are all memorable and top-notch. What George Miller has possibly achieved with this film is far more greater- focusing on the strong core elements of the story that make this much more than a $150 million summer blockbuster. The Mad Max franchise is about a post-apocalyptic earth where there is little reason to hope and precious little means to survive, but it is also about the consequences of human greed and the power struggle that overcomes a person beyond the cost of his or her existence. Why share something when you can control it and rule off of it?<br/><br/>The acting from the female cast is brilliant and is ably led by Charlize Theron in her second post-apocalyptic outing after 'The Road'. Tom Hardy exudes a quiet intensity through his eyes, but unlike the Gibson movies, is given precious little to do in terms of acting. Maybe the plan is to save his role for a future sequel. The background score is pretty intense and never feels out of place in a crazy movie experience. Full marks to this one, and let a summer of moviedom commence!"

There are a lot of little water eggs from the previous movies that are great additions. Also, this is the most gun-accurate movie I have seen in years! I'm pretty picky when it comes to firearms in movies and get peeved easily at them. This movie did everything right! Proper nomenclature, gun manipulation, and no added cocking sounds! Whoever managed the firearms on set knew what they were doing. They clearly shoot guns and know how to use them. It's refreshing to find a movie that does it right!"
"patricio-53898","10","3","9","15 May 2015"," If you like fire and wreckage, this is the movie for you.
","I think I'll begin with what Mad Max: Fury Road gets wrong, because there's not much. If you're looking for a film that contains thoughtful and provocative themes, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for character development and plot exposition, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for motivation in your villain that you can relate to on an emotional or psychological level, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for a swaggering, charismatic hero who spouts one-liners (not that there's anything inherently wrong with that), you're in the wrong place. <br/><br/>But, honestly, who's looking for that in a Mad Max movie?<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Mad Max: Fury Road delivers exactly what was promised: incredible, long, pulse-pounding action sequences, frantic cinematography, gorgeous, yet practical visual effects, and steady, stable performances by Hardy and Theron juxtaposed beautifully against the unbridled, over-the-top madness of the horde that relentlessly pursues them.<br/><br/>In short, everything you could ever possibly want in a Max film.<br/><br/>In terms of the performances, I must admit that I had my reservations in regard to how Theron and Hardy would fare in this film, particularly with Theron, as I had never seen her in a film like this. I have to say that I was pleased with both. Theron's portrayal of Furiosa as a tough, yet sensitive warrior for basic human rights, while a bit of a clichÃ© these days, was more than adequate for this film, and endearing in its own right. As far as Hardy's portrayal as Max, or more specifically the role that was written for him, I felt it was both different and fresh, yet true to form for the iconic role. Max says very little, mostly mumbling throughout the scenes, in fact spending a surprising amount of the film's time literally muzzled. His cold stare across the desert sands is really the main prerequisite for Max, and Hardy does it well. He won't win any Oscars for the performance, but he does the role justice. It's kind of refreshing really, to watch the hero play second fiddle to his female lead, and just kind of stand to the side and let the action speak for itself.<br/><br/>What really impressed me the most about the film was the fact that I think it's very clear exactly what kind of movie George Miller wanted to make. It's 85% action sequences, basically being equivalent to a two-hour long car chase, an apocalyptic demolition derby in the desert. And although the action begins to peter off by the third act of the film, or rather seem less profound, perhaps, for a film to go as hard as it does for as long as it does is definitely noteworthy. Our hero speaks mainly in mumbles, and takes a back seat, in my opinion, to Furiosa, and the film uses mostly practical visual effects, which, I'm sad to say, is against the norm in today's film making. A welcome change that I hope echoes into other films. It doesn't really break any new ground, but its operation within the parameters of the kind of movie that we would expect is nearly flawless.<br/><br/>Bottom line: George Miller takes risks delivering a movie like this to the cynical film audiences of today, and it pays off big. This film is long on action, visuals, and bone-crunching sound, and short on pretty much anything else. And that's perfectly fine with me. It's been thirty years. Welcome back, Mad Max. We missed you."

So this is all about our probably future if we are continue doing dirty things to the earth.."

"tates77","4","2","5","14 May 2018"," Furious disappointment
","First of all, I must say that I am a fan of Mad Max, both the decline of its social ecosystem and the artistic aesthetics of each of the films. Fury Road clearly try to be part of that post-apocalyptic ecosystem, but the great disappointment is in the poor development of the characters, if not because everyone knows that Tom Hardy is Max, could perfectly be a character surviving a poor script , a Max full of visions but without personality or history or humor. Two hours of chase with stuntmen jumping from one truck to another and many faces painted white are not enough to convince us that we are watching ""Mad Max 4"", or are simply selling us a trailer for the next ""Mad Max 5"", alredy announced.<br/><br/>It is not a bad action film (just look at the nominations and awards), but it is not Mad, it has no history, or the little history that surrounds Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) does not catch. It is surprising that having Miller as director, the focus has been lost so widely."

","A real pity that such a huge and epic saga with so amazing resources came out that empty, the film is soulless, the argument is pretty bold, my sensation was that they invested and bet in the visual aspect, which is great by the way, and in the constant action scenes which I've found too long leaving the story completely aside. Another issue that not many people realize is the music score, which for me is very important, in this film just didn't glue with the dynamic of the gesture. The lack of development of the bad guy character who had a lot of potentials was also not exploited as it could.<br/><br/>I did love the production design, the costumes and makeup are amazing, the photo is very good indeed, the cars rocked, and the cast is to dream of.

"tarekshabana","9","2","5","28 August 2017"," An Uncompromising Action Movie
","Mad Max is probably the greatest action movie I have seen until now. Its over the top action sequences, beautiful camera work, the setting, the cars and the fire breathing guitar truly create a post apocalyptic world of humans reduced to savages. <br/><br/>George Miller gives you no time to adjust or comprehend the world he has created. The frames are hyperactive and the scenes are accelerated, the dialogue is barely audible and you're left on edge 10 minutes into the movie, and it doesn't slow down from there. The lighting and colors give this movie a different, more exotic feel than other post apocalyptic or action movies. Some of the action sequences were over the top, but others were very intelligently made. The performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron gave the film even more drive. The movie never side-tracks or brings anything that isn't essential to the full on action film that it is. <br/><br/>I don't believe this film (alone, not including the prequels) was meant to introduce 3D characters with depth or have a philosophy behind it. But it does demonstrate, through its madness and chaos, that humans' most basic instinct, survival, creates this chaos and in that chaos eventually comes some form of civilization. I also couldn't help but relate the people in Mad Max's world to the ones in ours. I found many similarities, the core instincts of greed, power, need, survival, faith, loyalty, they're all there, they've always been there. The only difference is in the manifestation, the more the world progresses the more complicated is the manifestation of these instincts and emotions. But again this movie was probably not meant to demonstrate these things, but that just adds to my point."
"mjsmjs-46362","9","2","5","18 June 2017"," great new addition to the Mad Max franchise
","People who are critical of this movie I'm guessing in large don't understand what a Mad Max movie is or were never fans of the original franchise in the first place. If you're expecting a deep, profound study on human behavior and richly developed characters, you'll have to look elsewhere...Max Max was never this, nor does it pretend to be. <br/><br/>Mad Max is a hit you in the face roller-coaster ride of an action movie set in a sci-fi post apocalyptic future world. The elements of this movie are quite simple, just like the first 3 installments. Fast paced, violent action centered around situation survival. Complex character development and rich dialogue aren't needed here, nor does the film suffer from it. Mad Max Fury Road, like it's predecessors, doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it simply is. And that's the beauty of this movie. In a cinematic landscape full of thought provoking, profound films that often tend to be too highbrow for their own good, Fury Road was a welcome breath of fresh air. A guilty pleasure I loved every minute of.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that the special effects, action sequences, editing and cinematography here were top notch...the Academy agreed as well, giving this film nominations and awards in many of those categories. Frankly, based on the weak competition that year, I feel the only reason Fury Road didn't receive Best Picture was because the Academy didn't have the stones yet to give it to a film like Mad Max.Sure, this wasn't any thoughtful film with a deep and profound message, nor was it claimed to be, but it was a damn good movie that blended all of its own elements together flawlessly to create an amazingly entertaining viewing experience. And in my opinion, it did so far better than any of its Beat Picture competitors.<br/><br/>George Miller went out on a limb casting somebody other than Mel Gibson in the role of Max. Max is certainly a movie character that is very strongly tied to the actor who portrayed him. Using Mel in this film wouldn't have worked for a large number of reasons, and Miller knew this. Having said that, the character of Max isn't a particularly complex or deep one (Max had fewer than 20 lines of dialogue in The Road Warrior), any number of actors could have pulled the role off reasonably competently. But Mel Gibson did bring an important intangible quality to the role that made the character strong. Tom Hardy was an excellent choice to replace Mel Gibson as Max, he succeeded in bringing that same intangible value to the character. If Miller would have chosen a different actor who lacked this subtle quality, he wouldn't have been able to pull it off nearly as well as he did, nor would fans have been as accepting of the new lead. Hardy did a wonderful job as Max, and I hope we see more of him in this role in future films.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron delivered her typical outstanding character performance here, stealing every scene she was in. She demonstrated why she is considered such an amazingly talented character actor, able to handle such a wide spectrum of parts. <br/><br/>If you're a Mad Max, action, sci-if fan, or if you just enjoy very well done films, Fury Road is a must see"
"magscadar","8","2","5","14 March 2016"," Bring a seat belt. And leave your brain at the door.
","I work in the South African film industry and I'm also an award-winning screenwriter, so I have the insider's perspective on film. It's with an industry professional's perspective that I sat down to see Fury Road.<br/><br/>A lot of my friends worked on this film during most of a year of principle photography in Namibia, on both sides of the camera, and what a hell of a film it has turned out to be. It's a slapdash, rip-roaring, runaway, balls-to-the-wall, anarchic roller-coaster juggernaut that rides roughshod, ruthlessly and deliberately, over pretty much every hallowed scriptwriting rule in the book. Then it throws them the finger in the rear-view mirror as it roars away, yet somehow it manages to get away with all of it. It's less of a film than a cataclysmic event, and make no mistake, it's highly entertaining. In the way of far too many Hollywood blockbusters, you might want to leave your brain at the door, and don't worry about such niceties as sense, or a plot, because there is none (yeah, that's a major spoiler right there). Having said that, there's no denying the entertainment value of Fury Road.<br/><br/>The downside, of course, is that if you begin to make a habit out of creating films with essentially no plots by shooting a bunch of footage and then trying to make a story out of it when you get to the editing stage, then someone might start to think that scripts are redundant, maybe even decide they don't need scriptwriters at all. Which couldn't be further from the truth, but let's face it, that has never stopped people in the past. Unfortunately I think this might be the beginning of a new phase in the film industry, and I'm afraid that we might start to see an even greater dumbing-down (if that's possible) of Hollywood film in general. Which is a crying shame, because despite all the ways in which Hollywood craps on film as a higher art, and their habit of aiming their releases at the lowest common denominator, they are still the biggest single influence on the medium, and the Hollywood 'tentpole' films tend to define the genres in which they're released.<br/><br/>So my 8 out of 10 is scored for high production values, good performances, decent music and high entertainment value, but not for intelligent writing or direction."

","Following a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for a sick War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants, is sent in her armored semi-truck, the ""War Rig"", to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realises that his five wives—women selected for breeding—are missing. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.<br/><br/>Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max sees Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the Wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag and Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with Joe's child. Max steals the Rig, but its kill switch disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the Wives accompany him; Nux, left behind, is picked up by Joe's army.<br/><br/>Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage; however, with Joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe's car, with Nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad falls off in an attempt to protect Max and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and her child.<br/><br/>Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the ""Green Place,"" an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition.<br/><br/>They drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, but Furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognise Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.<br/><br/>The group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joe's forces, and Furiosa is stabbed by one of Joe's men. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, but she distracts him long enough for Furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini to successfully escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa to help her survive her injuries.<br/><br/>At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of Joe's corpse. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys, but Max walks away, sharing a respectful, understanding glance with Furiosa before disappearing into the crowd.<br/><br/>If you guys like action movies, this movie could be a 9/10 or 10/10 for you but for me its a 8/10.Nevertheless its sill a good movie.Go watch it!! :))"

"mockfilmreviews","9","2","5","24 January 2016"," A near perfect action movie
","In the not so distant past, Mock Films Blog put up a trailer for a film set in the not too distant future, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Feel free to go check it out. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) (NR)- Official Trailer I'll wait—Welcome back. Up to speed? Excellent.<br/><br/>In the post apocalyptic wastelands of the near future, tribes of savage men are ruled by sociopathic tyrants. Gas and water have become the new currency. Control of either means power as vehicles mean life. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), an ex-cop haunted by the loss of his family, wanders the desolate earth struggling to survive. After being captured by a cultish dictator named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his followers, Max is dragged along as the villains chase down Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, who owns this picture), a transport driver who has turned on Immortan Joe. Then, well, it all got a bit blurry from there. This movie is an unrelenting, unapologetic, fireball spewing, big budget work of art. Not usually the words one would use when explaining art, I know, but it will all make sense soon enough.<br/><br/>As I began to write this review for the critically acclaimed Max Max: Fury Road, I was met with a twinge of writer's block. It had nothing to do with getting the words down. It came from trying to process the theatrical experience I partook in hours earlier. Just as I felt my mind was made up about this film, the recollection of a small detail or a well written B character added more heat to the five alarm chili that is Fury Road. One would think when most of your movie is a car chase, it might get a tad tiresome. Not with George Miller at the helm. Creator of the original three films, he has not missed a step, rather Miller is flat out sprinting (Fun Fact: He also directed Babe: Pig in the City (1998). Yeah, the adorable pig sequel). To conceive and pull off this level of action at seventy years old; this might be the coolest man alive—"
"kevin-38242","6","2","5","26 January 2016"," Not as bad as it might have been
","Modern remakes of thirty-year-old movies are often disappointing, for many reasons. One of those reasons, I'm sure, is that our expectations are higher -- we want a movie that is not just as good as the original, but better by thirty-years' worth of improvement in the art and science of cinematography.<br/><br/>In this respect, at least Fury Road confounds expectations: it is better in almost every way than the originals; there's no question that it's thirty years ahead, at least in the technological aspects of film-making. Problem is -- the originals weren't all that wonderful themselves. No, really, they weren't. To be fair, Mel Gibson did a decent job, given the constraints of the writing, and managed to make his character at least slightly believable -- something that can't be said for Tom Hardy, but that's probably not his fault, given what he had to work with.<br/><br/>Aside from Mr Gibson, however, the original Max films were pretty so-so: not the worst movies I ever wasted my youth on, but not all that memorable, either. So it shouldn't be all that hard for a modern, big-budget movie to improve on them; and mostly it does.<br/><br/>Realizing that the original Max movies didn't have much of a plot to start with, Fury Road seems to have decided not to bother with one at all. What we get instead is a riot of fast-paced, brutal violence in what seems to be a computer-enhanced version of the Australian bush. The cinematography is utterly captivating -- it's impossible to look away, as one all-too-convincing act of gratuitous violence follows another.<br/><br/>There are some interesting, peculiar touches however, that suggest that this is a bit more than the usual big-budget, macho bullshit fandango. First, there's a measure of symbolism. The white-faced, stunted characters that operate the tyrant's machinery are strikingly similar to the subterranean workers in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis."" Lang's workers depict the drudgery and soullessness that modern industrial society imposes on ordinary men and women; Fury Road's mutants -- or whatever they are -- could be seen as playing a similar role. Like Lang's workers, they are utterly disposable, nothing more than a sacrifice to the great machine Moloch. In the characters' search for the lost 'Green Place,' the film hints at our quest for a utopia that we know can never be achieved.<br/><br/>Second, the female heroine (or anti-heroine) Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, has a physical disability. This is shockingly rare in a mainstream movie, even set in an environment where such things might be expected to be commonplace.<br/><br/>Third, the attention to detail is incredible. It's so good, in fact, that you don't notice it. There are (so far as I can tell) none of the distracting continuity errors that plague most blockbuster movies that are made for audiences with a five-second attention span. If a character gets a bruise in one scene, it's still there in the next one. Props don't just appear out of nowhere. This may seem a small point, but in a cinema industry that is increasingly complacent and contemptuous of the audience, it isn't.<br/><br/>If fact, given what it is, it's a great movie. Unfortunately, what it is, doesn't amount to all that much. Relentless fighting with no underlying human interest gets old very quickly. I wouldn't have minded if the movie had been an hour shorter -- everything it has to say, could be said in an hour."

The story line kept my interest. Lots of the crazy in it too. Hardy is almost too silent and not enough content from him. Theron is the enduring hero though....wholly crap!

","Fury Road is the definitive sequel to Road Warrior that Thunderdome should have been.<br/><br/>The true star of the show are the vehicles. All of which are practical and built for the purpose of the film. And the world the survivors inhabit. The visual style and aesthetic is beautiful to behold. All of the characters are unique and well designed. CGI is minimal, reserved for the radioactive weather and a few shots when the road battles are taking place Even the story, which is more or less just a reworking of road warrior fused with Thunderdome but on a much bigger scale, is well executed too. The imagery and imagination behind it is fantastic. very inventive. The dialogue is pretty good too. <br/><br/>Hardy's Max? He's very subdued and underplayed here. He takes a back seat in this film. But the MM series was never really just about Max. He was just the relatable conduit into the post apocalyptic world for the viewer. So in that respect, it's definitely in keeping with the tone of the O.T. Hardy does a good job of conveying the tortured Max, but, I will always prefer Mel. One thing I disliked was the Batman voice Tom uses. Seems all films try to copy that, now. The Furiosa character, very strong female lead,, even tougher and ballsy than Max, She's the real hero of this movie. In one scene she almost kills Max twice. And if it wasn't for pure luck, she'd have killed him. There's a really great moment when Max wrestles the gun off her and he shows her that he too could have pulled the trigger, but doesn't. It's my fave part of the film. Max had her in a position where he could have killed her and taken the War Rig...But he was the bigger man. Refusing to kill, unlike the heroine. Who as no qualms about killing. Which shows that Max, despite his original quest for revenge, as grown, matured and evolved as a person, even though he is tormented, through his years in the post apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>The terminology used in the film is vintage MM. Phrases such as War Rig, War Boy, Half Life, Full Life, Mothers Milk, Gas Town etc. Max fans will recognise it and it fits perfectly with the world already established in the original films.<br/><br/>Compared to most Hollywood films I've seen in what?, oh, at least the last 5 years, it's a masterpiece. If there are flaws in it, I couldn't spot them. <br/><br/>I think what makes it a cut above the average Hollywood fodder that comes out now is the fact they got the original creator on board. George Miller, a guy who can actually write a 3 act script and ensure that it's directed properly. All the scenes are executed flawlessly, too. The pacing is spot on, none of the scenes or character interaction feels forced, and there is no fast cut edits, which give people headaches, it's just left to naturally unfold, as it were. There's no sloppy forced love sub plots here (well, there is a smallish one, one of the Breeder girls sort of gets the hots for one of the albino Half Life War Boys that falls into their company, who then sacrifices himself for them to escape at the end. <br/><br/>My one gripe, because, I need to find one, is that the main villain, who is the most original and unique villain of the whole MM universe, Immortan Joe (had to look that up on Wiki, thought it was ""Immortal"") at least in the way he looks, is killed off pretty easily at the end by Furiosa. That guy should have definitely been in the next movie, which has been confirmed by Miller to be in the pipeline. <br/><br/>And if that doesn't convince you to watch this film then I have three little words that will sway you to do so......<br/><br/>Flame Throwing Guitar.<br/><br/>Yes! A flame throwing guitar! And there's a war Drum vehicle that is a huge sub-woofer! And most amazingly, the vehicles are all real, built for the film. Outstanding design and workmanship in their realisation. <br/><br/>In closing, Fury Road is an excellent and well made addition to the Max universe. It fits perfectly alongside Road Warrior. In this age of rehashes, reboots, and rubbish CGI infested sequels and prequels, Fury Road is a cut above the rest. It's great just to see a film that actually just tells a three act story and is paced correctly. A piece of story telling that is well thought out, and executed on screen to pitch perfection. Don't be expecting The Lord of The Rings, plot wise, it's a simple tale, but just the fact it is done right, gives it an 8 out of 10 in my book."

","I would recommend this movie to everyone it really is like nothing I've seen at the cinema before. The movie is just a 2hour long car chase but its so much more than that. Tom Hardy gives a brilliant performance without actually saying much and Charlize Theron who is the main character in many ways is equally as spectacular. The plot is very simple the god guys are being chased by the bad guys but the action scenes are shot beautifully and watching Hardy and Theron in action together really is amazing.<br/><br/>This is such a unique film and there's no doubt it will be remembered for many years to come. Easily in my top 10 favourite films of all time already, do yourself a favour and see this unbelievably brilliant film."
"Argemaluco","10","4","14","18 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road
","Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly what I expected from a prequel/reboot of the Mad Max saga: action from the beginning to the end, with a dense emotional core which brings substance to the chases and creates interest for the laconic characters who say little but express a lot. Mad Max: Fury Road basically consists on a 120-minute chase, in which the vehicles rarely stop; however, the perfect screenplay creates a fascinating dramatic arc for the main characters, offering them emotional moments which end up being as memorable as the magnificent action sequences. Some examples: Max's ""thumbs up"", the bag of seeds, an old lady's hussy smile... they are very brief details, but their accumulated impact makes the film hugely more satisfactory than other blockbusters full of special effects. What takes me to the amazing chases and stunts from Mad Max: Fury Road. Director George Miller has wide experience with these frantic chases through Australian outback (even though they were shot in the Namibia desert this time), having made the three previous Mad Max films. However, it is possible that, until now, thanks to the invisible fusion of digital effects and practical stunts, Miller could finally translate what he had imagined many years ago... and the result is truly extraordinary, not only due to the explosions, body-machine combats and exuberant vehicles design, but also because of the beautiful cinematography and absolute clarity in the flow of the action and the development of car battles... even though we might have to call them otherwise, because the only ""automobile"" recognizable as such is Max's Interceptor; all the other vehicles are insane mechanical frankensteins, each one of them more bizarre than the previous one... and even like that, beautiful in their twisted primordial aesthetic. And then, we have the excellent performances. It can be said that the authentic leading role belongs to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, with Tom Hardy in the supporting role of Max, but I don't see the point of establishing hierarchies; their characters are equally essential to the narrative, and their perfect performances immediately capture us into their adventures (and dis-adventures). Hugh Keays-Byrne brings an appropriately grotesque attitude to the villain, and I also liked the performances from Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Zoë Kravitz; on the beginning, they seem to be employed as mere ""eye candy"", but eventually, the actresses make those characters feel like credible human beings with well defined personalities, something which hooks us even more into the narrative and makes this ""2-hour chase"" a genuine tale of freedom and personal redemption... not to mention the strong feminist subtext which is apparently bothering some people. I don't understand them, but they are entitled to their opinion. In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is a violent and somber movie, but with abundant spirit and humanity which compensate the cruelty of post-apocalyptic life. This is definitely one of the best films I have seen in recent years, not only because of the action and the characters, but also because it triumphantly re-establishes a fascinating world, which is simultaneously simple in its needs and complex in its evolution. I hope Mad Max: Fury Road earns the necessary money to make the planned sequels become reality; there is a lot of dramatic material to justify them. Besides, I need more doses of visual poetry with claws and a flamethrower which never runs out of fuel."

"Jovan_Dojcinovic","9","4","14","18 May 2015"," An Action Masterpiece
","THE GOOD: <br/><br/>Out of all the 263 titles that I have rated on my IMDb page, only 8 of them have earned themselves a 10/10 rating from me. Those movies are (in no particular order): The Matrix, Back to the Future, Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (My #1), The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Cloud Atlas, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. ""But Jovan ol' jolly ol' chum, why do you say this?"" Because, my beautiful amigos, I have a 9th to add to that list. I really didn't think that this film would reach such a status. You guessed it, folks.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece of cinema.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot believe it myself. I am still speechless when I talk about it. I don't know what to say first, I can't even begin to describe what I even watched. Now that I can actually write my review and elaborate on what needed to be elaborated on, I can finally put my thoughts to words. Not only is this probably movie of the year (Star Wars is a top contender) but it could be movie of the decade! The action was mindblowingly awesome! And the best part about it is that most of the stunts were practical! As a film guy, I always appreciate anything done in practical form (also awards bonus points) but for what I saw, it was almost hard to believe that the stunts that were practical, WERE PRACTICAL. Of course there was CGI when it really called for it, but if things could be done practically, they were done so. George Miller is around 70 years old and he puts the WHOLE ENTIRE Fast & Furious films to shame with these stunts! Everything was also shot excellently, and I must add that Fury Road continues to prove that there is no need for shaky cam WHATSOEVER to create a MEGA-AWESOME, PULSE-POUNDING action scene (unlike Bayformers). Of course when the action stops, there needs to be dialogue and character development to further the plot, and the characters were terrific! Not a single hollow character was seen in this film, every character, main and supporting, protagonist and antagonist, had at least one bad-ass moment. Nobody was neglected for a SECOND. I also must start talking about the new spotlight character, Furiosa played by Charlize Theron. She stole a lot of scenes from Max but I had no complaints whatsoever because she was one of the coolest heroines in a film to date (Ripley from Alien is still #1).<br/><br/>This films visuals are some of the coolest, most bad-ass, most grotesque in any film to date. Character designs were excellent, top notch, and definitely Mad Max worthy! And the car designs, OH MY GOODNESS THE CAR DESIGNS, are the coolest to date. Nothing beats these cars, not even a fully pimped out, fully-upgraded-anything car in any video game can beat the designs in Fury Road (Unless the Mad Max game coming later this year can rival them). I mean, there's a literal stage on wheels fully rigged out with speakers with one guy on a custom electric guitar that can shoot flames out of its neck! HOW MUCH MORE METAL CAN YOU GET?! The soundtrack I almost forgot to mention but now that I've been reminded I cannot get it out of my head. The soundtrack is also fantastic! It's composed by Junkie XL and he did a fantastic job capturing the pulse-pounding action of Fury Road.<br/><br/>The pacing was great, sound design was excellent, trailers were some of the best in a long time and I LOVE THIS GODDAMN MOVIE.<br/><br/>At this point I'm just gonna start rambling. So onto...<br/><br/>THE BAD: <br/><br/>No film is perfect as many of you may know and there probably never will be a perfect movie with ZERO faults. My main concern is Tom Hardy's portrayal of the Mad Max character. I don't know if he was trying to pull off an Aussie accent, but at some parts I could feel a Bane-ey tone coming from him, thankfully, this wasn't consistent. I'm actually happy with Tom's Mad Max, but he could've done better, A LOT better. Mel Gibson still stands as the OG and best Mad Max there will ever be. Speaking of Aussie accents, I am happy to at least hear more than 10 characters speak in the 'straya tongue, but the mains like Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult should've at least try to go for an Aussie accent. I really hope that this can be addressed because we're in the Aussie outback for Christ's sake.<br/><br/>THE CONCLUSION: <br/><br/>Mad Mad: Fury Road is now marked as the best sequel and return to form of any franchise ever and it more than deserves this 10/10 that it gets. I saw this film in IMAX and I cannot recommend enough that you go see it there too. The movie was MADE for 3D."
"asha-albert","10","4","14","17 May 2015"," Buckle up those seat belts!
","Intense, visceral, perverse, brutal, exhilarating – Mad Max: Fury Road is all of these and much more!<br/><br/>A simple storyline without any frills or back-story, the movie grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go. Set in a dystopian future, where wars are being fought over water, the movie follows Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as she attempts to escape from the clutches of the despotic Immortan Joe (Hugh Keys-Byrnes), taking his harem along with her. Of course, Immortan finds out, and proceeds to unleash an all-out pursuit of Furiosa and his harem of Five Wives. <br/><br/>So where does Mad Max come in, you may ask? Well, the fact is that the titular Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) actually plays second fiddle in this movie; it must have taken Hardy a certain amount of courage to play an iconic role that ends up being secondary to that of the female protagonist. The movie has a strong, yet non-strident feminist tone that does not detract from the rest of the action, and seems like a very natural extension of it. <br/><br/>The movie opens with a high-octane chase when Immortan Joe's War Boys take Max captive in the Citadel. On finding out that he is a universal blood donor, they hook him up as a blood bag to Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a War Boy afflicted by tumors and therefore running on ""half-life"". Max, still hooked up, is taken along in pursuit of Furiosa, during which he is able to escape. Antagonists at first, Furiosa and Max become allies in their quest for the Green Place, her homeland. <br/><br/>Every high-intensity chase sequence is immediately followed by a higher-intensity one. Every time you think that it can't get any better, it does. Every time you feel that you can now start breathing, something else comes along to knock the breath out of your lungs! The best part is that there is no shaky-cam or in-your- face-cam, which is what passes for action nowadays. The action sequences actually seem credible and effectively tread the fine line between glorious spectacle and complete insanity. There's actually a pretty good reason for this – it seems that the use of CGI was kept to a minimum, and stuntmen were used as far as possible. <br/><br/>The movie is not just high-octane action and incredible pursuit vehicles; the themes of freedom, sacrifice and redemption form a strong emotional core for the movie. Stellar performances from Theron, Hardy and Hoult elevate this to much more than a mindless action flick. Hardy's monosyllabic Max is tortured by a past he cannot forget, while Theron is splendid as Furiosa, willing to kill (and die) for a childhood utopia she can barely remember. Hoult is unexpectedly able as Nux, in a role that calls for equal amounts of viciousness and tenderness. No matter how high your expectations are, believe me, this movie will meet them all, and then some!<br/><br/>""What a day, what a lovely day""."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","15","18 August 2015"," A riot: Gwar meets Pasolini meets Cirque du soleil
","Okay, no reason to mince words. This is a riotous success in what it does and how it upholds the legacy. How unexpected that the original filmmaker came from animated penguins and obscurity a few years back to barrel through superhero-dominated Hollywood with all this verve. Where others see no story and just another action fest, I see exhilarating freedom from the formulas of Marvel and Nolan. <br/><br/>How samey for example to have dragged our feet through another origin story, setting down some convoluted saga. How boring to have turned Max into another 'chosen one' saving the world. We get instead a man spat out by the dust, a schmuck buffeted around, a grunt along for the ride; Hardy's reimagining of Max is great. Instead of the same dishwater look as any other apocalypse these days, we get colorful swirl. We do get a few plaintive looks and music, but few. <br/><br/>The new Terminator we got this year, the latest stab at an Alien with Prometheus, they miss the whole point thinking we wanted someone to smear some more with the mythology. It was never the myth and explanations, always the immersion in a world. Mad Max benefited from never having a sturdy mythos, a Skynet or Weyland Yutani, we just roamed around the sands and came upon odd bits of world. Another enclave here, a Gas Town somewhere, things that just exist around for no deeper point.<br/><br/>And the same sense of avoiding the trivial extends in another way. The film is a long chase practically, they could have just made a Fast and Furious rig crashing through desert. Instead the film is a pendulum that swings to the edge and back, and in the movement we soak up different tribes, worlds, oddities of custom and ritual, details that show someone lovingly tinkered with its world. How great e.g. that we don't need to have sophomoric explanations about Valhalla or the spray paint, we see all that we need to know in action.<br/><br/>Sure, it's what GWAR is to music, provided you only look at it as a piece of gnarly show business. For me it evokes a bit of Pasolini; exhilarating spiritedness as a way of moving beyond the familiar limits of vision, toothless peasantry flocking to divine water.<br/><br/>It's important for me to see works that jolt from the routine of fictions, enliven. It's why I seek Herzog and Pasolin. And there's a whole flying circus around the chase this time, chainsaw-wielding acrobats on poles et al. It's what Verbinski tried for in Lone Ranger. And those vehicles! It's all very wondrous to me even in this gnarly shape. I can appreciate the work it took, actual work you do with your hands and have to choreograph around bodies (instead of a Marvel team doodling away on computers), to construct all these rigs and film in Africa.<br/><br/>How do you go from this to staid Tarantino in a few months? Only bringing him up as someone who likes to skirt the absurd. I imagine him, Verbinski, Scott, Snyder, the Marvel makers, paying their respects to this guy. This is the most furious comeback of a franchise I have seen."
"xbigdogx","10","4","15","13 August 2015"," An incredible action masterpiece, crafted as a love-letter to all things film.
","Whether it is the beautiful cinematography and stunt work that fuel the incredible action sequences, or the surprisingly well-done dramatic content infused among the on-screen insanity, you simply cannot take your eyes off of Fury Road. George Miller's labor of love was released earlier this year in May, but due to extremely unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to see it as intended: in cinemas. Shrunken down onto a 55"" television with a suitable surround sound setup, the film manages to offer an incredible experience nonetheless. Considering the genre at hand here, you know what to expect. Or do you? Miller has created one of the most exquisite action films I have ever seen, easily rivaling the likes of classics like Die Hard or T2. I'm being absolutely serious. I credit my intense appreciation of the film to many things, the first of which being the absurd amount of practicality. <br/><br/>That beautiful explosion you just saw was real, and it lends to a feeling of rawness and authenticity that very few other action films have achieved. This man knows that a wide-angle shot of a practical stunt is much more engaging than an actor interacting with a green screen in your typical blockbuster, resulting in lifeless ""action,"" and he pulls it off effortlessly. Watch as a Warboy throws a dynamite-tipped spear into a rival car, and it be destroyed in extravagant fashion, with a beautiful color filter highlighting the billows of fire and smoke that fly from within. Action bliss. But amidst the incredible sequences of fury and fire, there is a strict moral compass for the main character. <br/><br/>While this is a ""Mad Max"" film, this is Imperator Furiosa's ride, portrayed rather brilliantly by Charlize Theron. She is a fiercely independent woman, with a rebellious and righteous mindset. She will not continue to stand for the oppression that our main baddie, Immortan Joe, has placed upon the people of the wasteland, and this is seen through her desperate protection of a particular group of the oppressed. You really care about this mission as you learn about her motivations, and it places a great amount of thematic drama at the center of the action set-pieces. There is a sense of urgency to her actions, heightened by the incredible spectacle placed into the film.<br/><br/>As for the title character, Max Rockatansky, he is done justice in more than a few ways. Obviously, it hinges upon Tom Hardy's performance, and although the script does not demand too many lines of dialogue from him, he does a fantastic job, mostly dependent on excellent use of emotion from simple facial expressions. This film appreciates the image. Speaking of the script, it had the bright idea of Max being at the short end of the stick. Haunted by his past memories of failing to protect those he loves, he has become mostly broken and destroyed, and is rarely firing on all cylinders. Without any sort of advantage throughout the movie, he is a very vulnerable and human hero, and the film is much better for it. The tension is ramped up to an all-time high due to the constant adversity Max faces. By the time Max is granted a moment to catch his breath, he is pitted with the decision to either join Furiosa's cause and continue to deepen the consequences termed by Immortan Joe, or return to the madman's clutches who may grant him a small possibility of redemption into this wasteland.<br/><br/>This movie simply does not break the immersion into this world, making the trip one you will remember, and one you will compare to future action titles. The rather seamless pacing, despite a minor hiccup in the second act, keeps the experience going along at a fantastic pace. Simply put, the action is exhilarating and rich, the performances are much more grounded and subdued than any typical action film has the right to attain, and the passion for filmmaking put on display for our action-hungry brains is absolutely impeccable. This is what action movies are meant to be. This one shows us the impostors that have hidden in plain sight for years now. At least someone in Hollywood is listening to our pleads and cries for action that returns to the roots of its once-remembered ferocity. Mr. Miller... You are that someone, and I couldn't be more excited for the future state of action filmmaking. As for right now, though, we can enjoy this modern classic, in all of its relentless, mad glory."
"groomeschase12","10","4","15","7 June 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)
","Mad Max: Fury Road stars Tom Hardy in the title role of Max, along with Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. This film features a fairly simple premise: two rebels unite in order to escape the tyranny of an evil ruler who goes by the name of Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy has long since established that he can be an action star in great films like Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, but as Max, we get something a bit different. Hardy's character requires him to become believable to us without an overload of dialogue or the use of flashbacks mid-movie, and yes, it is a success. Through the use of ""actions speak louder than words,"" we follow Max in a chase scene from the beginning and we are immediately invested in how his character will fare against ""the bad guys,"" no thirty-minute epilogue required.<br/><br/>While Tom Hardy may play the title character, this is truly Charlize Theron's film. Much like Max, we aren't introduced to Furiosa through the long and time-consuming usual process, we are just dropped right into her story and she takes the movie over rather quickly. From the first moment that the villain is introduced, we completely understand why Furiosa is taking the course of action that she is. Theron has always struck me as a fine actress, and definitely an action star, but her role in this film took her to a whole new level on both counts.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road features a great deal more than two fine acting performances with likable characters though, as it will, without a doubt, be one of the most visually beautiful movies to enter theaters all year. Yes, it is greatly in a wasteland, but it isn't just any boring green-screened desert you'd find in some other movies. Something about the way that the scenery and landscapes are shot just adds so much to the film as a whole because it draws the audience in in a way that almost feels like its members are also in search of a place unharmed by the wasteland along with the film's characters. Along with the scenery, the action sequences are wonderfully shot also. A complaint that many people, including myself, have with certain action films now is that there's no possible way of following what on earth is happening during action sequences because of the way they are shot. They are difficult to follow, and you have no idea where anything is exactly taking place. In Fury Road, with the way the sequences are shot, these problems are not present. With quite a great deal going on in each action scene, it's very difficult to get lost with what exactly is happening because of how the film is presented to the audience.<br/><br/>While the action sequences alone are enough to get just about anyone excited, another excellent puzzle piece this film has to offer to amp up the excitement is the music. It is nearly impossible to not feel the tension build as the antagonist's group of vehicles are in pursuit of Max, Furiosa, and company, but that tension is coupled with intense blood-pumping music that is being played on a vehicle with drummers and a guitar player by itself, insane. The purpose of this was no doubt to also excite Joe's pack of vehicles, but instead does just as much for the audience.<br/><br/>While everything in this film is unbelievable, the main thing that is absolutely breathtaking is that the effects are, for the most part, practical. To see just ten percent alone of the things in this film and think ""wait, that was not a computer doing all the work?"" is mind-blowing. Even more mind-blowing is the fact that it's far more than ten percent of the movie. Finally, no CGI fire effects or a computer taking the place of make-up artists.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is made with a feel of dedication. Both with that of the franchise, and that of the obligation to give the audience a well-earned, great film. In a world full of reboots and sequels, Fury Road will stand alone as not one fans of the original series will have to ignore later because it let them down. George Miller has brought his franchise back to life in a major way and created, quite possibly, the action-spectacle of the decade. Tom Hardy sales yet again that he is a great action star, and Charlize Theron shines in one of her grandest performances to date. The involved created a magnificent action film that will, without any doubt whatsoever, be one of the most intense and gripping experiences that audiences will have in theaters all year."
"andrewshieh0712","10","4","15","4 June 2015"," Explosively stunning and beautifully filmed
","Okay, I'm just going to be honest that I didn't watch the first three installments of Mad Max and I wasn't too enthusiastic with sci-fi movies (though it's actually not), I just prefer more realistic movies. However, after I finished Fury Road, I enjoyed it very much. <br/><br/>Fury Road barely has a plot. It's actually very simple. The characters travel from A to B then returns to A. However, it's the visual effects that explain the whole story of Fury Road. All of the little things in the movie are made delicately and is designed uniquely. This highlights that things can still be beautiful even though it's set in a wasteland. I can guarantee that everything in the movie is exclusive and can't be found in any other movies. <br/><br/>The character development in Fury Road is done extremely well, though there is not much on the talking throughout the movie. You can see the development through their decisions, actions, and even through their facial impressions. And that's what makes the characters stand out, because every character has their own personalities. <br/><br/>I have nothing to doubt on the credibility of George Miller's directing. It's incredibly and beautifully filmed. In most action movies that I have watched, most of them failed on using shaky cam which is just a lazily filmed technique used in action movies. However, in Fury Road, you cannot find a bit of shaky cam, every shot is either filmed from a distance or set in a point. It not only highlights the massive view but clarifies on every action of the characters. <br/><br/>The sound effects sound magnificent just by themselves. It's explosively loud but in a good way, though it's filled with heavy metal, it applies to the soundtrack extremely well. Overall, Mad Max: Fury Road is action- packed and explosively stunning. Fury Road is so beautifully filmed, that it's close to flawless. This is absolutely a masterpiece constructed by Director George Miller."
"svanlijnden","8","4","15","2 June 2015"," Witness Imperator Furiosa! (Oh, and Mad Max too.)
","'Mad Max – Fury Road' is a very good action movie that makes you realize that physical stunts give a kick that special effects just can't quite match, no matter how good they are. Not that there isn't CGI here, but during the chase that makes up the majority of the movie, there is a sense that you're watching something real and tangible, even if it's taking place in an obviously fictional and far-out context.<br/><br/>The context is a trek through the dusty post-apocalyptic world seen in previous Mad Max movies. The original director returned for this (George Miller) but thankfully the titular role is no longer filled by the deeply unsympathetic Mel Gibson, who has been replaced by Tom Hardy. Funnily enough, it's not Max who takes the lead though. He's mostly tagging along and ultimately helping out in a story revolving around 'Imperator Furiosa' (Charlize Theron), whom he begrudgingly becomes an ally to. This has made some of the fans of the series grumble, but works really well for the movie. It remains to be seen if Max could carry another movie by himself unless they go a lot deeper than simply painting him as a traumatized loner, unable to move on.<br/><br/>Theron has received a lot of praise and it seems her role is headed for iconic female action star status, on par with Ripley from the Alien movies. I would be surprised if they don't make her part of the inevitable sequel, assuming she doesn't get her own spin-off. Hilariously, the focus on her and a few other strong women has made some insecure males get into a huff. They don't like that someone has taken what should have been a total sausage fest (in their opinion) and has turned it into feminist propaganda (again, their opinion). Still, as critics and audiences have embraced the movie in droves, I doubt Warner Bros will care much about this wacky minority.<br/><br/>The movie is not flawless. Since it is basically one long chase, with a few short breaks in between, it does feel like there is some repetition going on. But the trek gets peppered with enough variety that it doesn't really get old. As said, the reliance on stunts over special effects for the majority of the time, makes the action more involving. Add some sly humor and weird Viking-like cultural proclivities ('Witness me!') and the mix keeps you intrigued and entertained for the duration. You may like or dislike some of the campier elements. My personal highlight is the Evil Camp's soundtrack truck, which has four large drums on the back and a Metal-playing guitarist on the front, with a flame-throwing guitar suspended on bungee cords.<br/><br/>The ending seems a bit naive, resolving things more neatly and faster than makes sense. But because of the goodwill that the movie has created by that time, by being thoroughly enjoyable, you won't really care."
"PureLombardi","9","4","15","2 June 2015"," Consistently Thrilling
","From the moment this relentlessly paced film begins, it never lets you go. The rapid editing and pacing makes the whole experience, from start to finish, invigorating. George Miller's trademark method of speeding up fight scenes has never looked so good amid the gloriously bombastic set-pieces. The tumultuous and cartoonish personalities the characters embody are very pleasurable, rectifying any over-seriousness that the film may inhabit. And the action scenes are...well...revolutionary. <br/><br/>Most of the action in this film mixes itself up and tries to take fresh turns. I was very surprised at how varied the deaths were. Crazies perish by explosions, crushing, falls, gunshots, and stabs in magnificent scenes that comprise most of the film. <br/><br/>People complaining about the plot is very silly. This is a film to *experience*. Much like Gravity or Birdman, it feels like it's got the fluidity and excitement in its one scenario, while adding emotion to their unwantedly twist-filled stories. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron's character adds emotion to the mix, and Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max adds a gritty and mysterious depth that Mel Gibson couldn't bring to the table. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an intense, visceral and highly entertaining film that may be the year's best so far."

","Saviour of the summer action movies! This movie totally blew me off. I had zero expectations and I have to confess that I have seen original Mad Max so many years ago that I barely remember anything from it. After being hugely let down by Avengers - Age of Ultron, I also didn't have much hope for this one. Trailer looked like one boring chase across the desert and I usually don't like any car chases.<br/><br/>However this movie is pure rock and roll, pure raw energy. If you are looking for some great conversation and deep thoughts from a movie, then this one is not for you. But you feel that you just want to buckle up and ride the ride then go for it. Probably the best action movie of the year even if there are some good candidates coming up."
"VeeHarshu","4","4","15","19 May 2015"," Mad Max : Except Max everybody else Mad!!
","Just as my title suggests, I felt everybody else in this movie was mad except Max (Tom Hardy). His character was just plain & over-shadowed by Furiosa's character (Charlize Theron). She seemed to be the main character in the entire movie out to save the day with Max playing a supporting actor. Seriously, except a couple of dialogues and plain fighting (that too over-shadowed by Furiosa) there is nothing that Max did in the movie to consider him as 'Mad Max'.<br/><br/>Weak storyline but enjoyed the music and the desert chase of vehicles (that is the only thing you will see in the entire movie).<br/><br/>Overall I feel this is a one-time watch movie so you can give it a shot!"
"Maguilerag","10","4","15","17 May 2015"," Years not seen such a good movie
","Wonderful photograph, an electrifying story, characters who steal the film, but they know to share the screen. Miller: You're a master you can do Happy Feet and this masterpiece. Charlize has a fascinating performance and Tom Hardy is a more humane Mad Max that Gibson, has very good looks and seems to have improved his performance every days. The film does not let you rest and two hours fly by. I really recommend it for those who enjoyed the first three films, and for the young people who come to know the universe of Miller. I went with my daughter aged sixteen and was fascinated. A world that can dream but the film shows what a surreal grandeur and rawness that can not imagine."

","Avengers was decent, but Mad Max was amazing!! I left the theater wanting more Mad Max! Explosions, blood, killing, non-stop action. Amazing stunts and driving scenes. Explosions. Soundtrack as awesome matching up. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. No idea what was about to happen next... Great character development. Great make-up and costume designs. Action scenes were some of the best, if not the best, I have ever seen. Cinematography was phenomenal. You left as feeling you were there in each location!! Go 3-D if you go...it was made for the effects. Great ending. I hope George Miller comes back for another round of 'Madness'."

","There's no way to give less than 10 stars. If I would do that, I would be unfair, because movies are getting hard to made as almost all stories had been told before, in all imaginable ways . <br/><br/>So, when you watch, in 2015, a movie that made you feel some heart pounding, and that movie made you enter a new, believable, stylish, amazing, surreal, barbarian but beautiful world, you have to surrender. I didn't felling that for some time, I would say.<br/><br/>It's a kind of Indiana Jones, Star Wars mixed up with the best of Road Warrior.<br/><br/>I am amazed by how some people are complaining that there's little dialog, because it's part of the beauty. It is a painted picture, a story told by images. And there's a lot of subtext over the images. <br/><br/>I like Mel Gibson as actor and director. But the new guy has the sight, the ""madness"", the biotype of Max. <br/><br/>What I feel more happy is for George Miller. The man fought against the odds to bring this to the screen. Some time ago, this movie was destiny to fail. And now, the reviews put it into classic status. <br/><br/>Well, this is not a broad audience movie. I recommend if you are fan of Robocop, Mad Max, Conan the barbarian, Heavy Metal, cars, adventure.<br/><br/>Now the film is a cult, I just want not to wait many years to see the next."

","What a beautiful piece of modern entertainment. Although George Miller decides to completely abandon any narrative structure, and apparently didn't even have a script but just a storyboard when he started the project, he has crafted an energetic, character driven story that simply interests you from the first to the last minute. Charlize is absolutely brilliant. But it's not the individuals, it's the powerfully orchestrated summary of all players and elements that makes Fury Road an instant classic. I especially loved the music. The original Max Max films somehow got lost in the style and stardom of the 80ties. Fury Road translates the franchise into a 21st century context, while at the same time preserving the essence of the original. And probably good choice not to re-cast Mel Gibson. Chapeau!"

The action is breathtaking and visually stunning. George Miller's directing is beyond superb, deserving of his Oscar nomination. The cast is pretty solid. Tom Hardy was the right actor to taking over the iconic character that is: Mad Max. Originally portrayed by Mel Gibson. Charlize Theron portrayal of the female truck driver 'Imperator Furiosa' was very well handled. <br/><br/>Although I can't really find a major flaw in the film, I wasn't always invested in the overall the plot or in the characters.

"nmholland","10","3","10","4 February 2016"," One of the Best Action Films of All Time
","Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller, the director of the original Mad Max trilogy, and stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. This movie hit theaters on May 15, 2015, and I made the stupid decision of waiting until February 2 of 2016 until I saw it, after renting it from Redbox. I really regret not seeing it in theaters. This was definitely one of the best movies of 2015.<br/><br/>To start, Fury Road was beautiful. The cinematography was absolutely amazing, especially combined with the amazing wide shots that George Miller used throughout most of the movie, to capture all of the action, while still focusing on our heroes. The second great thing is the acting. Tom Hardy definitely lived up to Gibson's Max, however didn't exceed it, which interested me. He did as good, yet Gibson is still Max. Charlize Theron also did really good, which surprised me, because I've never seen her in a role like this before.<br/><br/>Another thing great about this movie is the action factor. This movie lives up, or even exceeds action movie legends such as Predator, The Matrix, or The Dark Knight. Although there are breathing points, the action is nonstop, edge of your seat material. I truly feel that this movie will later be compared to movies such as T2 or Die Hard.<br/><br/>Although I've done nothing but praise it, there is one bad trait about this movie. It's substance. I would say this film's equal to The Road Warrior, but not better. The reason being is the substance. Although Fury Road has much better and more action than The Road Warrior, you don't get the relationships in it. Yes, Max befriends Furiosa, and you can feel their friendship their, but it isn't much when compared to the relationship between Max and The Gyro Captain from The Road Warrior.<br/><br/>Out of the best picture nominations for this year, I hope either Fury Road, The Martian, or The Revenant wins. These three movies are all great, and I'd be fine if any of them won the award they all really deserve.<br/><br/>Despite it's one problem, Fury Road is a near flawless movie, and I would give it an A+ or a 10 out of 10."
"usmcloar","9","3","10","9 December 2015"," A visual masterpiece
","I am a fan of the first two entries of the mad max franchise, but I went into this one not expecting too much beyond hopefully good car action sequences. This movie was visually quite amazing, the way the wasteland isn't muted in color and is vibrant and almost bright fit better than I could have ever expected. Some of the camera techniques used I was also a fan of, I thought they did well to fit the context of what was happening on screen and the score helped to emphasize that. The score was another highlight, very high octane (forgive the use of octane) and loved the drastic change from heavy riffs to heavy drums from one sequence to another. I picked this film as my first review on IMDb because it was that amazing to me. It's a very simple plot, just as simple dialogue but the movie speaks volumes with it's visual style and distinctive score. The performances were top notch, the one thing that I think stood out as maybe a universal negative were a few bad shots of cgi, that stuck out in contrast to the practical effects used and to my knowledge cgi that was mostly used to enhance those beautiful backgrounds. This is my first review period, something to do to pass the time. I will try to be as practical as possible, if I don't understand something I won't pretend to, I just won't write about it. I will write about the things I enjoyed or didn't in films, hopefully without winding up being someone who compares a fantasy film to a dramatic novel. These are my opinions, if you disagree cool, if you agree cool I really don't care either way. These reviews are to pass time, not appease people who goto movies making an assessment before seeing it. I'm also not a film expert, and I don't care if you think you are, just because you study film, and the process of creating one does not make you an good at it, plenty of people are horrible at their jobs they have been doing their whole lives. Thats why this is to pass time, I don't think I'm that good at it but I enjoy films and I'm bored. That said enjoy....or not."

Miller's choice to use practical effects pays off well, as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast. Tom Hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for Mel Gibson.

","I love Cinema,and Fury Road is an undiluted example of the form,pure visual language,like a painting. I see here there are plenty that argue ""there's no story!"", sure there is, but it's a sentence long,which is just perfect for me,I also love silent movies and one of the reasons I love this flick so much is that you do not need to know what anyone is saying,the direction does it all for you,much like Kubrick and Hitchcock. This is pure action cinema,it's rare that the genre gets turned into Art,but make no mistake,that's what is going on here,the color choices,framing,layers of costuming,vehicle detailing,every facet of the production is pure art,beautiful and astounding. This story is not about Max,but about an adventure he was caught up in,I loved this approach,really refreshing,why can't Furiosa be the star? Max is still there,what's the big deal? I see the negative reviews and feel sad for those that were unable to get behind George Miller's vision,I think it's a masterpiece,arguably the greatest pure Action movie in history,no talking,just movement,pure 100% cinema, and it's F****** glorious!"
"pfs-150-951923","9","3","10","2 July 2015"," Isn't it a bit dull??
","That is what my friend wrote to me when i proposed Mad Max as a good choice for ""a night at the movies"". And on our way out he said it was one of his favorite movies of all time! I have already seen all the previous Mad Max films and will try to compare them with this fuel pumped masterpiece!<br/><br/>One of the downsides is that you really don't follow Max as much as i thought. Compared to the other films this was quite a change. Instead it lays a lot of weight on Furiosa, who i would assume was going to be the second main character of the film, but it seems more like she is the main and Max is some sort of sightseer who is really just around. And then again. When has he not been that since the first movie? Of course he always does his part ,but think about it. Road warrior is about a group of survivors trying to fend of a gang of crazy or ""Mad"" people. And in beyond thunder-dome It is about those weird cave kids who don't have parents for some reason. Unlike the first movie Max has always been some kind of mysterious figure who shows up when he is needed. And from that point of view i think it is very well delivered in Fury road. But we would like to see more of him in upcoming sequels. AND PLEASE MAKE SEQUELS!!!<br/><br/>That is not to say that Max's character is badly delivered. That is a completely different talk! Watching Tom Hardy delivering the role of Max was an amazing experience! The body language is done so well i wouldn't be surprised if he could explain the theory of evolution through it! Anyway jokes aside. Tom Hardy knows how to be Max and it is great! Chalize Theron acts out Furiosa as a very cunning, thoughtful and tough character. To be fair everyone in the movie are tough. No one are downright cowards. Just as you would expect from people in the wasteland.<br/><br/>Now i have heard a lot of people coming up with stuff like ""Bad Character development"" ""Stupid plot"". And to be honest probably yes, but that was the first thing i knew on the way out of the theater. People would say stupid plot. And of course it is. It is about ,(as Max kindly informs you over the start of the movie), people reduced to the basics of humanity. They are desperate. That is why they go on a hell-ride through the wasteland and back again. They hold onto whatever tiny bit of hope they got! And that is a plot worth a watch!<br/><br/>And in terms of Character development it is Awesome! We have Nux the war-boy striving for Hero status! And developing his character from there through the story, learning about other things such as freedom and love, and what is worth fighting for. Furiosa was born in some sort of green eden, and that is where she wants to escape to with the women sex slaves. She is determined. It is this or death. Something inside her says it is justice in a world where it is needed the most. <br/><br/>The pace in the movie is simple and awesome! It is a hundred miles per hours through the entire thing! One thing can be said. This movie is the wildest action movie ever produced! It goes fast with stunning visuals, fire and madness everywhere! And it is brutal. The movie has a very different character. So maybe many people think it is overrated, but i cannot imagine anyone going out of the theater without being a little impressed over the action it delivers. <br/><br/>Because it is f**king great! 9 out of 10!"

","Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie about a post apocalyptic earth and Max Rockatansky (Hardy) reluctantly joins Imperator Furiosa's (Theron) crew to have a chance of survival against the relentless Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne) and Nux (Hoult) Immortan's former slave just increases the intensity of the journey.<br/><br/>It is a fun, thrilling and adventurous movie possibly my favorite apocalyptic themed movie with suspense at every turn. I really enjoyed how Mad Max would be classed as an insane person in today's society but he was the most grounded character in the film and the producers very subtly showed us that Max was psychotic but simultaneously sane which is a very difficult task to achieve. The chases with the trucks, lorries and heavy artillery were very fascinating to watch. Since we are all used to the car chases with Dodge Chargers and Bugattis in urban streets, it was very refreshing to watch vehicle chases with hefty vehicles which don't move very quickly and cause lots of damage to its surroundings in the middle of the desert. Also the soundtrack and costumes were perfectly crafted everything felt authentic and suited the genre. <br/><br/>However a weakness in the plot was that we had no introduction to the Earth before the Apocalypse we have no idea of what happened and why the apocalypse occurred.<br/><br/>Mad Max is a Fantastic movie and would recommend it to any movie-goers. Grade - A+"
"siderite","8","3","10","26 June 2015"," Better story, fantastic special effects, completely impossible to suspend disbelief
","The reason why Mad Max was great was because it was all new. Low budget film created in an era that just started getting over movie censorship with completely unknown actors by completely unknown film makers and in a different style. It shocked the studios, it brought Mel Gibson almost accidentally in the film business and shot George Miller through the stars. The reason why it all happened in the desert was that it was an Australian film and because it was cheaper. It showed guts, originality and created true art in an otherwise classic revenge scenario.<br/><br/>The sequels were different, better budgeted, more post- apocalyptic, more action packed, with more action and, frankly, that is what most people remember about Mad Max, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road is better acted, better written and better directed by the same George Miller. The huge budget allowed for all types of wacky things. But it was nothing but a rehashing of the two sequels. It was not a reboot of Mad Max, but a reboot of the mad tribe car chase wacky races.<br/><br/>All the well designed characters, all the wonderful scenes filled with tension and nitro, all the epic scenes of people worshiping the guy who gives them water by pouring it on the dry rocks, they all fail when one imagines Dastardly and Muttley in one of those cars chasing ""the war rig"". The various weird vehicles and attack methods were just rehashes of scenes from Mad Max 2 and 3, even the bad guy was a rehash, from the original at least. This might have worked back then in '81 and '85, but it doesn't work now. It all looked so over the top that it was impossible to feel any real thing. It was just like watching cartoons.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the movie entertained me and it was better than average, but I have to penalize it for wasting obvious talent in writing and acting on pointless scenes of ludicrous road carnage and on rehashing the silly part of the Mad Max universe. It gave people what they wanted, but not what they needed and turned Mad Max into yet another comic book character."
"skradji","6","3","10","2 June 2015"," Wacky Madnees on Wheels
","Both good and bad.<br/><br/>That's how I define this Remake.<br/><br/>The film is visually a joy, it can not be denied. His photography, staging, installation, chase sequences are shot with force and showmanship by George Miller, no doubt its commitment to offer adrenalin pace and tone really delusional, crazy and wild.<br/><br/>But in counterpoint I have to say that history is guilty of being extremely simple, he says pointless.<br/><br/>The film itself is silent. A succession of stunts, explosions amid a deafening noise, but here it's all over, there is no real storytelling, a sense of adventure, emotion is as if they had been too afraid to be sliced ​​head with an original story, some witty dialog and situations that really impact, no, the whole film is a continuous evolution of sterile action, the end usual with the dead and the living and bad heroes end. Not that I seek a philosophical film not a melodrama or anything like that, but at least a story to tell me something, I could get involved with the characters or with which they could identify, but has not been well, everything is pure artifice, circus show for the masses. A film seeking our approval with blows of effect, as if to hypnotize us with their action tirelessly to not see the disturbingly empty content that really treasures.<br/><br/>The performances ? Charlize Theron is notable for its makeover but his performance is all horrible, poor lighting, with little charisma and strength. Tom Hardy is a flat actor head to toe, is cold and not transmitting anything, and certainly not reach wing Gibson and soles of shoes.<br/><br/>But I can not stop this new Mad Max. Because the truth is that his delusional and crazy visual style of futuristic western, his furious and wild rhythm, well shot action gets my approval, a very entertaining and estimable B series, but nowhere near the I consider, as they are already doing hundreds , a work of art.<br/><br/>No way.<br/><br/>But I like it, mind you."
"PrashunChakraborty","8","3","10","26 May 2015"," What a ride!
","Long story short, this movie is fun, the story is too simple in fact it's just one car chase stretched over two hours but it's still fun. Detailed review for those who are interested, this movie is an absolute visual treat, the images of the film will stay in your head for weeks if not years, if a world were ever to witness an apocalypse it will not look like the one in Mad Max, and muscle cars will probably not make it but don't think too much and enjoy the ride, Nux driving around Max as his bloodbag on his car is both hilarious and disturbing but these images stick with you, this movie has what it takes to make that visual impact and even make smartphone addicts stop and look up. Most people would think that Fury Road is Furiosa's story and Mad Max has no contribution to the film on an emotional level. But this is not true, the bedrock of this movie is the relationship between Max and Furiosa, I found this the most appealing aspect of the film, I was afraid that there was going to be some unnecessary romance but their relationship is so much more than that, it's one of mutual respect, admiration and even need of each other, they have something bigger than romance they are truly comrades in war, brothers (or sisters?) in war. Of course this is Hollywood and they may just screw this up in the sequel but right now I was just pleased to see such a platonic relationship between the two leads. Both Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are in peak form in here. However, my personal favorite was Nicholas Hoult's Nux. Max and Furiosa seek redemption and are tortured by it, and Nux achieves redemption faster than them both. He is a great comic relief which is surprising since he is a homicidal hormonal teenager but it works. Nux is also the medium through whom the director is communicating to the viewer how screwed up the wasteland of Mad Max is, he is the craziest character among the good people who are all normal he is the constant reminder to the viewer that this world has gone to hell. Also he says the iconic line- ""What a day, what a lovely day"". almost every time he attempts to kill himself to achieve glory in battle, what a nutjob, I like him. The villain Immortan Joe is visually intimidating and some parallels /analogy may be drawn about him being an abusive pimp who is trying to reclaim his ""property"" as he puts it, this simple motivation is enough to make Joe a bad guy and be hated. Sex trafficking is a theme quite prevalent in Mad Max but it's understated, it's upto the viewer to figure out in an otherwise starightforward movie. Joe on top of being all that is greedy too but the film doesn't focus much on that. One of the things that really bothered me was that how easily Nux turned on his former boss, all it took was a red head supermodel. It was quite lame, why is Furiosa even attempting such a wild mission? Warboys and the entire army of Immortan Joe are hormonal young men, Furiosa may just as well say - We got supermodels, the best women for breeding on this wasteland here boys, let us up. BAM Immortan Joe dead, the boys let the girls in. Overall I liked the film, my personal favorite Mad Max film still remains the original Mad Max (1979) because it's still to date the only Mad Max which shows character development, Max's wife and child die in that film and it's referenced all throughout Fury Road via PTSD nightmarish visions of Max. Also, Mel Gibson just does a better Mad Max than Tom Hardy who is quite good himself but he doesn't portray enough of Mad Max like Gibson did over three movies."
"pressboard","8","3","10","25 May 2015"," Is it post-apocalyptic or just Las Vegas
","Charlize blows me away as Imperator Furiosa. This was a great reboot of the earlier Mad Max movies which met and exceeded the high speed mayhem of the earlier trio of movies. The major difference to me was that the earlier movies had Max as the primary focus while Fury Road gives Charlize, Nicholas Hoult and many of the other actors a chance to shine and it works! I was on the edge of my seat through most of the action, which included most of the movie. I'm guessing that if this makes enough there will at least be one other. It might be interesting to see more of the destroyed world and some of the sharp contrasts that must exist."

","One thing I noted while watching Mad Max: Fury Road was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was over-stretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding script.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a follow-up to the hugely popular Mad Max series in which Mad Max is captured by cult leader Immortan Joe. He gets the chance to runaway when Joe's imperator Furiosa rescues wives imprisoned to Joe. <br/><br/>It has been 30 years since George Miller directed the high-octane Mad Max series and he switched to kid flicks like Happy feet and Babe. Probably the inseparable love brought him back to the popular franchises and he gave his best as both director and writer. The opening scene is probably one of the best scene with well-executed chasing scene will take away your breath away. The story unfolds showing the desperate post-apocalyptic phase with weird and crazy characters you would not even imagine in your life. Once the action rolls out, there is no turning back. This is probably nerve- breaking , ears splitting and eventful action stunts which is jaw dropping. Hats off to both action director , stylish camera work and astounding art direction capturing the rough and tough terrain of Namibia Desert. Screenplay is engaging and will not let you blink for a second. Charlize Theron carries the film on her shoulder. She is indeed amazing and will be loved for her tough role. Tom hardy as Max is wasted. An actor of his caliber should have better characterized. Nicholas Hoult was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>A kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin.

","Mad Max: Fury may just be my new favourite film mainly because it has epic action battles along with explosions and a fantastic plot that really didn't match the previous films. This film only uses two special effects and they are for the dynamic weather in sand storms. Tom Hardy did a very good performance (again) but that wasn't performance, the best performance came from Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and the fact that this film has strong women makes me like it even more because I just love when a woman can fight her own battles. <br/><br/>If you don't know the plot basically it is an Australian post- apocalyptic film series set in the desert so many years after civilization. The first three films with Mel Gibson were just as good as this was. <br/><br/>When I first watched the trailer I saw all the action that it had but I never thought that seeing on the big screen could be so epic, but it would have been better in 3D. Three points on why this film is awesome and spectacular and well a must watch (warning spoilers).<br/><br/>1. Epic story and scripting: The script in this film couldn't have been any better and it fit in well with the post-apocalyptic setting. George Miller wrote the script just right for this film I also love the fact that there isn't much dialog in the film but the dialog you do get is just wonderful and story driven in such an amazing way.<br/><br/>2. Setting: The setting of the film is in the desert around 45 years after civilization has ended and there are just a few thousand survivors left and they must do their bit to survive and also fight. The people in the film are starving and thirsty and ruled by a kind of dictator who keeps most of the water for himself and his five wives.<br/><br/>3. The third and final point is wonderful and brutal action sequences: The action sequences in this are one of a kind with beautiful explosions and actors doing there own stunts and it all just looks very real. The short dialog is definitely worth while because then you see five epic action sequences all ending in a few peoples deaths mainly from explosions, the action sequences can range in time most of them very long but they are glorious to watch in full spectacle.<br/><br/>Those are my three points on why this film is absolutely awesome and a must watch. There is a reason why critics loved it all in all this film is excellent and action packed in every way. 10/10 a must watch in all it's action packed blood filled glory."

While the Film keeps it's insane speed, there is some humor sprinkled in.<br/><br/>Very strong female lead and a epic soundtrack - when you can hear it because of the loud engines.<br/><br/>While world of Mad Max is very sandy, this movie is full of beautiful scenes and images in orange and blue.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this on a big screen - go into your favorite movie theater because this needs loud speakers and above all, a very big screen. I watched in 3d, which was fine, but not necessarily better I believe."

","I loved all the trailers for this movie. In fact, they were so good I was beginning to suspect that the actual film was going to sub-par. Boy was I wrong. This movie hit every button promised in the trailer. Stunts, over the top action, choreographed car chases and a small but engaging story line. (Let's face it, if you were going for a heart- wrenching, deeply moving story about a misunderstood man ------THIS AIN'T IT!) This is cars, Max, cars, Furiosa, cars, explosions, women who can stand up to bad men, cars and a killer storm thrown in. Even Mel Gibson would be approving this upgrade. While it is rated R, it's on the tame side of R. And that DOES NOT mean you can take your kids. It's still R. Be the responsible parent and enjoy this with your friends now, with your kids when they are 18. I plan on seeing it a second time with some more friends."
"tdowne","9","3","10","18 May 2015"," Mad over Fury Road...but in a good way.
","**Thematic spoilers!!** It has been 30 years since Thunderdome and Max still roams the desert...but he is plagued by flashbacks, visions, and voices. Tom Hardy plays Max (formerly portrayed by Mel Gibson), and Charlize Theron takes second billing as Imperator Furiosa. The majority of this film involves vehicle chasing, which most die-hard Mad Max fans will appreciate. Dozens of souped-up, industrialized, militarized, and modified vehicles tear up the desert with a mix of explosions, gunfire, and flame-throwing. The ongoing train of mechanized war machines are painted against a picturesque desert scene filled with dust storms and lightning flares. As with the earlier Max films, craning and tracking camera shots keep the action up front and intense. Even though Max is the title character, the film's secondary themes are those of fertility, paternity and maternity. Max has very few lines in the film which allows time for these secondary themes to take shape. Much like Thunderdome, Fury Road deals both with the innocence of the young as well as the desperation and conflict of the old. This latest entry is probably the best of the series. Highly recommended. Do you smell that? It's aerosol inhalant and diesel fuel...and this is Fury Road."

","Honestly speaking, i wasn't going to go to theater to watch it but the initial ratings had me wondering, how can a movie, which looks so full of wild looking people, whole trailer filled with sand and other things mainly of the shade of orange and brown and every scene of the trailer shout at the top of its voice that it is just a chase, can have a rating like this, and also the meta score.<br/><br/>Out of respect to meta critics and the trust over the people who rated it before me, i went to check it out. Nobody in my circle for ready for this so i have to practically force some people to go with me and then they came out of the theater with satisfaction and respect of the idea.<br/><br/>The idea behind this movie is to convert a car chase into a high octane, thrilling, jaw dropping and applauding sequence of action packed masterpiece.<br/><br/>The actors were good like Tom Hardy has done a great job with a handful of dialogs given to him. But the movie belongs to Charlize Theron. Her expressions were too good. <br/><br/>This movie from start to end present a chase on the road and nothing else, but i have never experienced this feeling of satisfaction and admiration after watching a movie with such a little story. I don't mean that there isn't anything worthwhile to follow during the film because their was, but it wasn't the center of the movie. The movie revolved around the action and violence every scene contained and not the story.<br/><br/>I am glad that i watched it in theater and you should do so too. Mad Max would always be suggested in the greatest action movies from now on."

","In a world desolate, arid, populated by horrible freaks driving amazing machines, only the divine beauty of five women can redeem us. Or get us irremediably lost. ""Mad Max: FuryRoad"" could be the most powerful feminist manifesto ever done by a man. In fact, in the last, frantic George Miller's movie we have time just to give a glance at the beauty of all kind of women: mothers, accomplices, lovers. Without them men are only arid souls in the wilderness. Exactly like Max Rockatansky, who lost the women he used to love: his wife and daughter. For the rest of you guys who love pure action, crazy crashes, amazing FX and unbelievable stunts: don't worry, Mad Max has got all of it too. And it rocks. The picture is technically flawless and it try to give to a new generation of audience the same strong, crazy visual impact that the original movies gave in the early 80's. In that way, we can say: mission accomplished. Bravo Geroge Miller."

","MM:Fury Road has no pretenses of being anything other then what it is, a non-stop, over the top, completely ludicrous thrill ride and very possibly the longest continuous car chase ever filmed. <br/><br/>With the early establishment that the enemy warriors travel with their own engine-enabled rock band Miller makes it clear that you are supposed to just suspend any hopes of plausibility and come along for the ride. And if you do that, its a great one.<br/><br/>The movie does make some brave moves. It dares to open with an easily defeated and clearly insane version of Max. Its a rare movie where the title character spends his first 30 min of movie time as a helpless victim.<br/><br/>In many ways, however, this movie isn't really about him. He is just the traveler, traveling through the situation while what plot and character growth there is all centers around those actually in the situation. <br/><br/>And if Miller wants to make this a franchise, that might be a good way to go. Make Max the perpetual outsider/observer and let the stories be about the situations he discovers as he travels.<br/><br/>If you are looking for deep story or characters though this isn't your movie. If what you are looking for is goofy high octane violent spectacle, the movie delivers in spades."

Only ""problem"" for me was that it was almost about to go Hollywood, over the top ridiculous all the time. It kinda did too, and it was also legitimately funny at times, but somehow the rest of the package redeemed it and the goofiness made ""sense"".

Why so many critics and viewers here, alike, are so enamored over the film is beyond me. Miller CAN still hold his own when it comes to apocalyptic carnage, whether dealt with a front fender, a sawed-off shotgun, or a hideous looking blade, but that's all I can recommend to potential viewers of this film. Save your time and money, folks, and rent/stream some of the previous Mad Max films instead. Better yet, have your kids dress up in some old rags and face paint and ask them to re-enact a scene or two of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. That would REALLY be entertainment!"

"pepelabrew","6","4","16","15 May 2015"," A very good summer blockbuster that had Max become Furiosa's sidekick
","Saw it in 3D. As someone whose absolute favorite movie growing up was the Road Warrior, I felt disappointment in the direction Miller took with this movie. By itself MMFR is a very good summer blockbuster, but it really had nothing to with the character of Max or the world Max occupied in the previous 3 movies. The movie came off to me as a bit too cartoonish in regards to many of the characters and action sequences. In my opinion Miller could have completely removed the character of Max and it still would be a very successful movie without the Mad Max franchise tagged to it. <br/><br/>In the first two movies (MMBT gets a pass, since Byron Kennedy's death affected Miller's enthusiasm on the project) Max was in my opinion a far more layered character, someone who used his intelligence, reflexes and resourcefulness to help prolong his own survival or to exact his revenge. A man who in a classical sense was wronged and had to walk his own path in order to make peace with himself. I felt there was a depth in those films, largely due in part because Gibson had the incredible ability to express how his character was feeling to the viewing audience, using a broad emotional spectrum with virtually no dialog, which greatly enhanced some beautifully composed scenes. It was so refreshing to see this pulled off successfully in films that had some of the greatest action sequences in movie history.<br/><br/>Due to the extreme rapid pace of MMFR, their was no place to demonstrate those prior characteristics. I cannot tell if Hardy has the chops to do what Gibson did because when he is asked to lend emotional weight to his character we the viewing audience are bombarded by cut scenes of people we have never seen before chanting his name, haunting him in an over the top, movie shortcut kind of way to show his emotional damage. This new interpretation of Max in my opinion is displayed as more of a surviving castaway who is stranded in a deserted wasteland continuously seeing the crying ghosts of those he could not save as the ship went down. This Max seems to be losing his grip on reality, behavior which was never exhibited in the prior films. In MMFR he lacks the emotional subtlety that was shown in the previous films as much as he lacks the screen time in this movie. He is literally along for the ride in Furiosa's story. Hardy then grunting through half of his lines did not help either.<br/><br/>Once again I just want to reiterate that Miller made a great popcorn summer blockbuster movie. I am just disappointed that I felt it really did not have to have Max in it to be successful. It was Furiosa's story. <br/><br/>I went to a Mad Max film because after 30 years I wanted more Max, more V-8 Interceptor, more of him surviving alone in the wasteland. Basically more depth of it's title character. <br/><br/>I think the younger generations who did not see the original movies will love MMFR, but those who grew up with the originals may feel the wanting disappointment I experienced. Great action movie though and I am glad I saw it. Love George Miller."
"ClaytonDavis","8","10","57","12 May 2015"," George Miller's reboot is full of action, technical marvels, and a badass performance in Charlize Theron...
","Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)<br/><br/>The slickest, coolest ride you can take this year has arrived in the form of George Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" starring the talented Tom Hardy and the impeccably magnificent Charlize Theron. A reboot that blows every aspect of the original away with stunning cinematography by John Seale, luscious production design by Colin Gibson, and the most vivacious score of the year so far by Junkie XL. ""Mad Max"" kicks ass and takes names.<br/><br/>As action-packed and lively as ""Mad Max"" is in its gargantuan shell of fire and music, there are some shortcomings that Miller's film exhibits. From a narrative standpoint, it presents some of the most surprising and endearing female characters seen in some time. Everything about the women, particularly Oscar-winner Theron, is excitingly refreshing. You come to think that the title of the film should have been called ""Furiosa"" rather than ""Mad Max."" ""Max"" feels completely secondary to everything that's going on around him. He doesn't envelope the same presence that Mel Gibson's character did in the original, and that's both a positive and a negative. Is it intentional or is the far superior and interesting work of its female heroins just easier for an audience member to latch onto. The script by Miller, Brendan McCarthy, and Nick Lathouris is rapidly inconsistent in the film's first 30 minutes. With no clear directives or plot devices, it almost comes off as a road trip movie with no set destination, at least in the first quarter. Once the speed picks up, boy does it just thrust you from your seat. There are also some abrupt and sharp turns from explosions to emotions that don't exactly feel natural. There was a time or two that I rolled my eyes at certain attempts of emotional reaction.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner John Seale, who has continued to explore his narrative lenses in his career, takes on a new world of artistic capture. He makes the viewer a passenger and an active member of the action at hand. The sound team rises to the occasion in this post-apocalyptic world of gears, guns, and fire. The greatest achievement of the film's psychedelic roller coaster is the potent and passionate music of Junkie XL, whose previous scores on films like ""300: Rise of an Empire"" and ""Divergent"" could have never hinted at the masterpiece composition he would create for George Miller. The score echoes past works from Bernard Herrmann (""Psycho"" in particular) and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It'll be a travesty if at bare minimum, the film isn't recognized for Best Original Score at next year's Oscars.<br/><br/>There have been rumors that this is Charlize Theron's version of Ripley in ""Aliens."" While the comparison is somewhat apt, I find it more in line with someone like Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" ""Furiosa"" is Sarah Connor reincarnated into a one- handed death machine, and she's freaking awesome. It's the badass performance of the year, perhaps the last few years from an action star. A performance that hasn't highlighted her abilities as an actress this well since maybe ""Monster."" As the villainous ""Immortan Joe,"" Hugh Keays-Byrne dominates with stature and aura that's palpable in nearly every scene he inhabits. He isn't afforded many opportunities to stretch out the boundaries of his Bane-like mask and become intimate with the viewer. Nicholas Hoult maintains a fun, comedic vine that slowly wraps around you as his story progresses. Finally, Tom Hardy is as cool as ever. This guy makes it look so easy to just be a part of something and blend into a canvas such as this. As mentioned before, he's surprisingly secondary to the story but what he does get a chance to offer is vividly real.<br/><br/>Seeing the film in 3D didn't offer anything more than a few dizzy spells from some shaky camera syndrome. It's another example of 3D being utilized more as a gimmick, and not an additional asset. Admittedly, I'm not the hugest fan of 3D films with the exception of few I've encountered. I say save the 3 extra dollars and see it on regular full-size screen experience. It will more than suffice.<br/><br/>From a summer blockbuster standpoint, you have to move ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Furious 7"" aside to make way for something that stands on more of solid foundation of action storytelling. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an audacious and visually striking endeavor that is sure to stand out all year in some capacity. A technical marvel. I'd be excited to see where they'll bring the story from here. A franchise that has been successfully rebooted. Good job Hollywood."
"Idiot-Deluxe","10","3","11","7 May 2016"," Best Post-Apocalypse Movie Ever.
","And I thought The Road Warrior would remain the best of the Mad Max movies. Wrong. Enter FURY ROAD!<br/><br/>Just saw Fury Road for the 6th time.....and once again when watching this insanely amazing action film, a full spectrum of adjectives flows freely through my mind. I'd say ""overwhelming"" is probably the most appropriate of them. <br/><br/>No plot run-downs here, if you want to know that then watch the freaking movie. I will say that it's plot is an extremely simple one, that even 6 and 7 year-olds should have little difficulty in understanding. That being said, this movie is really not for 6 and 7 year-olds. Oh, and to the Legion of Soccer Moms of America, take little Timmy to a screening of Bambi instead - the nation's tired of frivolous lawsuits.<br/><br/>Firstly, the most prominent aspect of this film is, obviously, it's amazing levels of violence (and surprisingly minimal amounts of gore). It's mostly one big ongoing series of the most mind-bending vehicular stunts ever to hit the screen. Director George Miller is a verifiable genius (even after a 30 year hiatus from such films) and his wife, Margaret SixelI, who handled the editing (well over 2,000 cuts, no doubt an extremely involved painstaking process) won an Oscar for her contributions. The level of expertise that's evident in its cinematography, is probably the most impressive of the films technical aspects. This was no easy shoot, filmed almost entirely under a blazing sun in the deserts of Namibia; the sheer amount effort (and stamina) it must have taken to capture all the high-speed, dust-covered, fire-spewing action is well, an effort that's rarely undertaken - AND NEVER ACHIEVED SO BRILLIANTLY! With great technical aplomb, Miller and crew artfully capture the vast desert expanse of a brutal and gritty world and Margaret SixelI's award-winning editing shines with much spit and polish. I saw a preview for this film 10 months in advance of it's May 15th 2015 theatrical release and never had I gotten such buzz from a movie preview - as a whole Fury Road, not only met, but exceeded that grand initial buzz.<br/><br/>Fury Road stars Tom Hardy as Max, Charlize Theron as Furiosa, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, and 6 foot 11 Nathan Jones as Rictus. As some others have said, I also didn't find Hardy to be quite as charismatic in the roll of Max as Gibson was, but ultimately everything gels so perfectly it doesn't really seem to matter. Theron may have actually acted out her role better then Hardy did - in any case they were a great duo. No doubt about it, for Charlize Theron this proved to be the role of a lifetime. Now speaking briefly about the hardware, I happen to love all the auto-motive modifications seen throughout this film and in that respect Fury Road is easily the best of the series. Some of these vehicles qualify as characters in and of themselves - see Oscar win for Best Production Design.<br/><br/>As for it's Oscar tally, Fury Road was nominated 10 times and won 6 - and should have won several more. Including Best Picture (which usually goes to lame movies - as it did in 2015) and Best Director. And to all the idiotic trolls and brainless, blabbering jackasses that claim Fury Road is ""over-rated"", not hardly, and if a movies overall gross is anything of a reflection of a movies quality - then Fury Road is in fact, under-rated, as it pulled in only $375 million - well below what Warners anticipated.<br/><br/>And so not to pontificate too much - I'll wrap up this review with this: Fury Road is a bombastic hyper-kinetic thrill-ride, that's VERY well worth seeing at least twice and is a treat, a triumph and a treasure for (non-pompous) film aficionado's and adrenaline junkies everywhere. Except for China, where it's banned.<br/><br/>Thanks a million to George Miller and Warner Bros."

","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the continuing saga of drifter Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in a post-apocalyptic world. This time, Max comes across a vicious warlord and aids in the escape and plan of a rebel called Furiosa (Charlize Theron).<br/><br/>1. George Miller goes above and beyond in this much-anticipated sequel of the beloved franchise. If you were expecting a movie filled with drama, romance or even a compelling story-line, this really isn't that type of film. The action is wall-to-wall the moment the movie starts in a sequence where Max tries to outrun and is eventually kidnapped by the 'War-Boys'. There are three key action sequences that blows your mind; starting with the Sandstorm, the desert Gorge escape and the final chase back to the Citadel.<br/><br/>2. The plot is simple, so there's no confusion. Furiosa smuggles the beautiful sex-slaves/wives of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) out of the Citadel, and the war parties hunt them down after finding out the wives are missing. The only downside of this film comes when things slow down. Near the beginning of the last third, the characters take a pit-stop (basically) and try to gather their thoughts when they realize the place they were looking for isn't actually there anymore. Talking about philosophy and future hopes really isn't a strong point for these type of films.<br/><br/>3. I can understand if people won't like it due to all the madness, but it's surprisingly tamed enough to where things never feel like it's pushed to a breaking point. Unlike Tarantino or Bay, Miller knows exactly the right mixture to making a near perfect adventure film. Hardy and Theron are the key players here, although it feels like we get a bit more character development of the latter. This film won 6 Academy Awards, and it's well deserving of it. From the cinematography, editing, artistry, costume and production design, it all blends in a spectacular fashion. <br/><br/>'Fury Road' is a long chase sequence from beginning to end, but I guarantee, it's a ride you'll never forget;)"

","Every once in a while you come across a movie which redefines a genre. Mad Max Fury Road is one of those films which change the way you look at action films. After 30 years George Miller revives his action franchise with the same thrill and excitement. Mel Gibson hands the reigns of the role of Max to Tom Hardy, who plays the titular character effortlessly. Max is a drifter captured by a tyrant ruler Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays - Bryne) as a blood bag for Nux, one of his war boys who're people with ghastly white skins and devout worshipers of Joe. Then we have Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, brilliant) who goes in her war rig secretly taking Joe's 'prize breeders'with her under the pretext of trading gasoline and goes off route. Joe gets to know this and along with his War Boys sets off to catch her. And what begins then is just pure action, all through the barren landscape, devoid of greenery and civilization. Beautifully shot action sequences, with most of them being practical stunts make it even more exciting. Nicholas Hoult as the ill psychotic worshiper Nux is pretty good so are the wives. To sum it up, Mad Max Fury Road is a perfect summer blockbuster for movie buffs to enjoy. If you don't like it, then get your head checked."

The soundtrack is incredible, the cinematography is amazing and once again, Tom Hardy vanishes into a another great role. We all love Mel Gibson, but, well, y'know...he went a bit too far beyond Thunderdome... Charlize Theron was amazing, she almost stole the film from Hardy, Nicholas Hoult was fantastic and Hugh Keays-Byrnes as Immortan Joe was such a scary villain! And the Doof Warrior! Rockin' hard!

"Clockwork_Orange55","9","3","11","9 November 2015"," ""It is one of the best action picture ever made, and now a modern masterpiece.""
","Not many would expect it to be this good. Sequels/prequels to classic trilogies are at times bad, and deemed to be pale in comparison to their pasts. But ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" developed differently. It is one of the best action pictures ever made, and now a modern masterpiece. ""Fury Road"" is not just a great action movie; it is a great movie in general.<br/><br/>The world is nothing but a desert wasteland, and fresh water which lives in it becomes scarce. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is one of Immortan Joe's (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a tyrannical cult leader, biggest associates. She is sort of like a knightess of an empire. Joe sends off Furiosa with a great truck in her control to collect gasoline, but she goes off-route only to betray her leader by attempting to smuggle his five wives for their freedom. Joe unleashes his army, the classic Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) allies himself with Furiosa and thus, the great battle of 'Fury Road' begins.<br/><br/>George Miller creates a picture that never heavily relies on dialogues but actions to tell a story. ""Fury Road"" is already a masterpiece in that artistic aspect, and obviously it opens up for more open-minded intelligent views of the film. Furiosa's possible love interest, the chemistry between the two lead characters, Joe's cleverness and the relationship between the five wives are being uncovered through showings but not words. Instead of single-mindedly telling audiences, George Miller challenges them.<br/><br/>Just like Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity"", ""Fury Road"" is short on content but excels fully on filmmaking. The film is an energetic, high pitched and thoroughly detailed masterpiece. There is no chance of it being a bad film. People who never understand movies would despise ""Fury Road"". Mighty action sequences, sharp editing and beautiful cinematography move run through the running of the film. Charlize Theron's strong performance as the damaged heroine mainly helps to maintain the significance of the picture. Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne too did fine as the delusional young soldier and the evil lord respectively.<br/><br/>I really hope that ""Fury Road"" will at least be recognised for its editing and cinematography in the upcoming 2016 Oscars, although a nomination for 'Best Picture' is near impossible. With this triumph, my anticipation for its sequel grows strong. It is being written not inexplicably in history that ""Fury Road"" joined the greats. George Miller exploited his admirable visions that it surpasses his classic movies. George Miller, with his ""Fury Road"", has brought us to a stage of ideas that have given in unparalleled motion pictures"

","Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.<br/><br/>The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.<br/><br/>After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.<br/><br/>Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.<br/><br/>Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history What a Lovely Day and What a Lovely Movie! This is just beyond expectations! There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster. There is gargantuan excess here, to be sure - and no shortage of madness - but there is also an astonishing level of discipline. Come for the blistering, full-tilt action, stay for the thought-provoking consideration of the post-apocalypse. The world of Mad Max has always been welded together from bits of whatever was lying around, and the films' brilliance has always been in their welding - the ingenious ways in which their scrap- metal parts were combined to create something unthinkable, hilarious or obscene, and often all three."
"friscolver","10","3","11","19 October 2015"," One of the best of its kind. Excellent! Loved it!
","Very few movies attract my attention where I must watch over and over again, like Terminator 2, Aliens. But this far surpasses those, this one takes the cake on everything. The setting was like a post holocaust, in my opinion a huge meteoric impact, not nuclear war. Definitely some looked like they suffered radiation burns. Be that as it may, this movie had very believable characters. Both protagonist and antagonist had depth, sensitivity, emotion. Even though the main bad guy was tyrannical leader Imortan Joe, you could kind of empathize with what he was doing. I especially felt moved when he held his dead wife (one of them)in his arms and he was genuinely saddened. I felt for Imortan Joe, his cause was noble, he was a family man (a dad,) he had to make do with what he had, he had to ration and control the water, he had to maintain and harvest the crops, he was trying to produce superior human beings so that they may have the strength to lead. In order to establish a society emerging from a wasteland, to speed things up, you don't have time for democracy, you need slaves. These slaves all seemed like happy slaves. Probably because there was food, shelter, they seemed cared for. The backgrounds in this movie were so believable, the action sequences top notch edge of your seat non-stop. I'm ready to watch it again and hopefully they will make a sequel!"
"MrDHWong","9","3","11","15 October 2015"," One of the best action movies of the decade
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth installment of the Mad Max franchise and the first film in the series in 30 years. To call it the best action movie of the year would be an understatement. This is easily one of the best action movies of the decade. It successfully breathes new life into this classic action film series, and brings it to a whole new generation.<br/><br/>In the year 2060, Australia and the rest of the world is in ruins after a huge apocalyptic event occurs. As a result, humanity is broken and food, water and fuel is scarce, so much so that violence and murder is common from those seeking out ways to survive. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson) is still adrift in the desert many years after the events of the third film when he meets Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a tough, no- nonsense woman of action who is searching for her homeland. Furiosa has captive with her the five wives of King Immortan Joe, a vicious military leader who rules over the desert kingdom known as the Wasteland. Reluctantly, Max and Furiosa, along with one of Joe's former soldiers Nux (Nicholas Hoult) ally together to fight back against Joe to free his wives from his clutches and try to restore order to the Wasteland and its people.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the most bad-ass movies I have ever seen. The car chases are extremely well filmed and choreographed, much better than any of the ones in its predecessors. I also liked how it kept its gritty atmosphere, which I felt was very lacking in the third film. Tom Hardy is a decent replacement for Mel Gibson playing Max, as I feel that Mel would be too old for some of the stunts required in this film, although his accent did keep drifting between Australian and British throughout the movie. But the real surprise was Charlize Theron as Furiosa. She channels some of the more bad-ass female film characters like Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise into her performance. There's never a dull moment.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10."
"ghostjunk","9","3","11","21 September 2015"," 150% Beautiful Insanity!
","Hunted by scavengers and haunted by his past, Max lives on the run like a lone wolf reduced to the single instinct of survival. Things, however, take a turn for the worse once he finds himself a prisoner of a citadel tyrannized by an evil warlord and must join a group of strangers in hopes of escaping out alive.<br/><br/>From director George Miller, the original mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise, comes a new post-apocalyptic tale of vengeance and solidarity. Fueled with stylistic chaos and amped with 150% beautiful insanity, Mad Max: Fury Road is like a nitro-boosted adrenaline rush straight to the head! Every shot was flawlessly staged, lit and framed like an artistic photograph that simply screams pure genius. This goes without mentioning the awesome, heavy metal-infused orchestral score by Junkie XL. Now some viewers might feel a little awkward accepting some of the steam-punk attire, eccentric props and unquestionably weird characters, but they shouldn't be too quick to judge. Everything in the film, no matter how odd, has a sense of logic and a functional purpose to support its existence. Not only does this sensible approach make things feel more realistic but it also couldn't look more genuine, thanks to the abundance of practical effects and real stunt work. Even more impressive is the clear dedication from our leading actors who performed the majority of their own stunts. One fight sequence even resulted in Tom Hardy breaking his nose, but judging by his interviews, it's pretty clear that everyone's proud of what they've accomplished.<br/><br/>Putting the film's obvious strengths aside, one of Fury Road's most impressive aspects is the technical brilliance behind the cinematography and editing itself. Regardless of how fast-paced some of the scenes were and how many quick cuts they included, I never once had to struggle to process the visuals. It's safe to say that the director knew exactly how to frame the characters in each shot to ensure everything flowed together without nauseating the audience, regardless of its high-paced action. Too bad most modern action movies aren't competent enough to film and edit sequences this way. Maybe Taken 3 rings a bell? Keep in mind, viewers may find disappointment through the film's relatively thin plot and lack of dialogue, but one could easily argue that Miller effectively makes up for this with his clever use of visual storytelling techniques. I for one felt the characters' actions spoke for themselves and am confident his storyboard- based script had a lot to do with why this approach worked so well.<br/><br/>This might be the 4th chapter in a pre-established saga, but Millar has proved his concept is far from dead and Fury Road completely justifies all the critical appraise it's receiving. With just enough nods to the originals to please die-hard fans but more than enough fresh material to engage new audiences, anyone getting on board is sure to enjoy the ride. If its unique style or genuine originality isn't enough to catch your attention, the high octane and unquestionably explosive action sequences are sure to blow you away!"
"NancyNazari","8","3","11","26 August 2015"," Kickass Female Lead...
","In a movie where the expectation would be that only the men or leading man would be the star, the movie surprised me by showing the female(s) as bad asses, even more so than the men in this film. Equality! Love it.<br/><br/>In addition, I was expecting or hoping for some similarities to the original Mad Max. After watching this movie, I found this not to be true. It kept my attention by showing a very different story line, one being that the woman were equally as compelling as the men, as I mentioned above.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm looking forward to a sequel. I was left hoping to see more. The more being that the lead female would come back as the leader of the people (not a grotesque man, as was in this movie..though, he was grotesque I was thrilled at what happened to him in the movie)."

","I'm one of the few people who wasn't a huge fan of the original Mad Max trilogy so i didn't rush to see this movie. However, i started this movie intending on watching the opening scene and it hooked me for the entire movie! Action, action, action!!! It's a chase movie, surrounded by chaos and madness! The colours bounce off the screen like a comic book. The golden day scenes to the blue night scenes are beautiful!<br/><br/>Contrary to what people say, there is an exciting story and plot with heavy character development. Max (hardy) is a solemn character similar to Leone's man with no name; it's his actions and decisions that define him. As always, Theron goes above and beyond and truly holds the film together. For me, Nichols Hoult was the biggest surprise. I've scene Hardy and Theron over the years, always delivering, but i was only familiar with Hoult from Skins and X-Men. This is without a doubt his best performance to date. Fury Road is more than a popcorn flick so treat yourself and watch it!"

George Miller created a world that feels like its alive, and above all else it looks incredibly cool. The movie uses a lot of practical effects and they look stunning, there's some cgi in there but its barely noticeable. the details in this movie are mind boggeling, the bigger the screen the better the movie gets. don't get it on DVD or watch it on your phone, get it in HD and watch it on the biggest screen you can get your hands on."
"midas-jacobs","10","3","11","15 August 2015"," Best movie of 2015 so far!
","Mad max: fury road is, obviously about Max. The story is pretty basic, and not hard to understand at all. Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) have to get a truck filled with women to one place, the green place. But these women were important to Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Immortant Joe is the leader from a gang. So now he has sent a big group of his people in cars to get the truck with the women and kill Max and Furiousa. THis movie is basically just a long chase scene, but an amazing chase scene...<br/><br/>The directing of the movie was so pretty. Sometimes I just sat there stunned by how pretty it was. Really everything was just beautiful, I also really liked the colors they used. Even the fighting scenes were good, no shaky cam, just wide open shots of the people fighting. Another thing about the fighting, it was very well choreographed. I think that the fight scene in the beginning between Furiosa and Max was one of my favorite fight scenes. The car scenes were very well shot too. But here is a thing that I didn't really liked, that they sped up the camera movement. If you know what I mean, I don't really know how to express that in English. I enjoyed when they let things fly in the direction of the camera for example: When someone (spoiler) sacrifices him/herself there fly a steering wheel and a guitar in to the camera. I think it would have been cool if you watched it in 3D. (no spoilers) The use of practical effects surprised me. I knew that there would be some practical effects but there were a lot. And I think that it was really cool that they used them, because now a days you only see CGI. These practical effects added something more to the movie, in my opinion. The special effects were also very well done (the mechanical hand of Furiosa. George Miller (the director) made good use of slow motion. <br/><br/>Now something more about the acting. Tom Hardy was very good as Max. First you don't really know a lot about Max (of course if you have seen the previous 3 movies you know who Max is), but then with the short flashbacks of this little girl you start to see that Max is a damaged man who has been trough a lot. A short thing about these flashbacks, I thought that it was very creative that they switched between the faces and the skulls of dead people when they blame Max. And that the little girl had impact on Max. Max begin narration was very good. Charlize Theron is just a total badass as Furiosa, I very much liked her character. And I loved that they didn't make her invincible. Also liked her dedication by shaving of her hair. My favorite character is Nux, he is played by Nicholas Hoult. I like Nux because he is this interesting character. Nux is so interesting because he shows that his people care, and that they weren't all weird, violent people. The writing is overall very good.<br/><br/>Here are some more things that I liked about this movie. I very much enjoyed the realistic sense to it, it felt very realistic, and I think that is due to the use of practical effects. The sound and music was nice to listen to. The costume and make-up design is just amazing. And maybe the thing that I loved the most about this movie is that I wasn't bored for a second. Now last but not least there is a freaking guy playing the guitar which spits flames, if you don't think that that is cool, there is something wrong with you. <br/><br/>And here are some individual scores:<br/><br/>Directing: 9.8/10<br/><br/>Writing: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9.6/10<br/><br/>Action: 10/10<br/><br/>that is a total of 38.6/40 which is a 9.7/10. And if I would round it, it would be a 10/10. I would definitely recommend watching this movie it is just pure fun."
"lanna-sousa","8","3","11","21 July 2015"," Pure action
","I confess that the movie plot didn't get me going, but the action scenes are spot-on and beautiful to watch. Every action scene is detailed in an impressive way, making it impossible to find a mistake in it. Of course the movie is not realistic, but I think that's the purpose. The makeup artists were amazing and all the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. It's fun to watch and to appreciate the art in it. One thing I would criticize is the lack of deep emotional scenes in the script. The story is actually good and the flow of the events is great, but somehow it was not possible to connect with the great characters. I don't know why I felt that way, but reading others reviews, I realized that I'm not the only one. Anyway, I recommend the movie, because it is admirable, but is definitely not even close of being one of my favorites."
"alindsay-al","9","3","11","1 July 2015"," A fantastic action film that is a great watch
","I have finally got the chance to see the much acclaimed new mad max film fury road and I must say that it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees max get kidnapped by a warlord and tries to escape with a group of refugees. Tom hardy plays mad max and he is great in the role, he doesn't have allot of lines but I see that as being true to the mad max character and he nailed all the action scenes that he had to do. Another great character is that of Charlize Therons character of furiosa, she was an interesting character and she was an even better fighter then mad max which made her the real star in this film in my opinion. Nicholas hoult plays a crazy in this film and this is really unlike anything he has ever played before, he was crazy as you expect but he was also a really interesting character and his development throughout the film was one of the best things in this movie. The villain immortal Joe also had some character to him and was cool even though I do wish they gave him a little bit more to do. The narrative is simple yes but it works and the character development really is good in this film and makes these characters really interesting and fun to watch. The script is the one negative as some of the dialogue feels one dimensional and doesn't hit the emotional impact that would make the characters really stand out, but there are some fun and emotional dialogue that does help. The style is fantastic, this film is crazy but it makes sense in this film and makes it great. The action is all insanely cool and is easily the best part of this film and the use of practical effects mixed with cgi really worked and makes all the stunts look fantastic. Overall this is a fantastic film and if you are looking for an action film to watch this is one of the best around."
"DJAkin","7","3","11","7 June 2015"," If you like action, this movie is for you
","This movie was really big on action and had a lot of explosions and violence. I read that all of the stuff in this movie was actually stunts and very minimal CG. I just hate it when a movie hides behind CG. Now onto the movie. There are a lot of things I wonder about. Like the warboys and what their deal was. It seemed like the really loved Joe. How did Joe get his first name? What does immortan mean? I am so curious also as to the back story of Joe. I'd like to see the next movie maybe be a prequel and talk bout what Joe's back story was and what he used to be like. Could be really be Goose? I am not sure. But his horse tooth mask was really neat. As for Max, well let's just say he didn't talk too much. I like his way of speaking though. Kind of reminded me of Bane from Batman actually. haha. The rest of the movie was good. I noticed that they never really stopped almost ever. Even to fix the vehicle they would just keep driving. This was really neat. Did you notice that there was a big difference in color between night and day shooting? This was a nod to the old school which I really appreciated. So, if you like your movies packed with action, you will like this movie. There are also some new techniques of fighting introduced into the fold in Mad Max. I am talking about the pole vault fighters. That was neat. So was the scene were the motorcycles were jumping and throwing bombs. So much action. I give this movie to gas tanks of guzzling up!"
"larry.launders","8","3","11","7 June 2015"," Long Time Coming....
","As of this writing I still haven't decided what vote to give it. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, let's start with that. <br/><br/>As expected, there is a lot of 'ridiculousness' in this movie: the vehicles, the people,....well there's not a lot else in the movie beyond those two! <br/><br/>Like many Americans, I suspect, I saw The Road Warrior first. I fell in love with it. Then I saw Mad Max, and that helped some other things make sense in The Road Warrior. <br/><br/>As I understand it, Fury Road is supposed to fall somewhere in- between the two. <br/><br/>Well...OK. <br/><br/>I still enjoyed the vehicle chases/action/combat stuff, the very odd community from which it all starts, and the fact that I think this movie had a lot more story resolution in it than The Road Warrior. (trying not to add spoilers)<br/><br/>The Cirque de Solei folks were wonderful of course. The ""Doof Warrior"" was a very interesting touch (he's the guitar player), as a nod to throughout our history, troops in the field communicated with drums and horns and so on, this just seems a modern extension of that. <br/><br/>And knowing that the vehicular stuff was not CGI, but real. I really appreciated that part. <br/><br/>So the story focuses mostly around A woman and a decision she makes (Charlize Theron's character). From there, we get to see everyone else spring into action in some form or fashion. And with that, ultimately they kept the story fairly simple, and it made sense.<br/><br/>It is at least an engaging story and a cohesive telling of it. <br/><br/>For myself, I didn't read a whole lot into the 'plot' but I'm sure if you really went looking for anything from ""save the planet"" types to militant feminists, you could probably find it. To me, in context, it all made sense.<br/><br/>For things I didn't particularly care for, there aren't many. However: 1) Just like in Road Warrior, apparently nobody who makes these movies believes that stack-style exhaust pipes get HOT!! Both movies have people crawling around them after they've been running a good while....<br/><br/>2) Hardy's Max, particularly near the end with Furiosa, just doesn't seem as....detached....as Gibson's Max, when he tells her his name. At the end of Mad Max, Gibson's Max had already snapped like a freeze dried rubber band; but he still had a code he worked by. Hardy, while taciturn, gets some flashbacks here and there but doesn't seem as 'damaged'. He's brutal, yes, and by necessity. He just didn't come across as being as damaged as he should have been. But then that's simply my opinion. <br/><br/>So sit back, and enjoy the ride!"
"ffmskyline","9","3","11","30 May 2015"," One of the best action movies in a long long time!
","You know an action movie with a budget is good when the stunt credits roll longer than the cgi-department does at the end!<br/><br/>Basically its all you want in an action movie: cool stuff happening on screen that gets you exited -and that you can tell whats going on. A story that makes you actually care about the characters. Oneliners. Fury Road is absolute fireworks just falls a bit short on that last aspect, but has a few subtle and not so subtle chuckles in store for you that are delivered non-verbal.<br/><br/>Overall Fury Road forms a very believable world with incredibly love to detail and practical effects and fitting music.<br/><br/>Go see!"

","Tom Hardy. Nicholas Hoult. Charlize Theron. Three reasons I went to see this film but very little of the reason I absolutely adored this masterpiece. The action is second to none. One majestic and massive chase sequence running two hours long is difficult to perfect and there is only one action genius that could get it right- George Miller. His absence from live action has finally ended. His return is, what I hope,is also the return of good action films.<br/><br/>The visionary directing is delightful. The screenplay was written around the storyboard. That's right, George Miller story boarded the movie and then based the script about it. Clever is a understatement. Miller has taken the idea of a predictable action film and twisted the concept into something special.<br/><br/>The story is very emotionally engaging which (once again) is rare for a action film. The story revolves around Legendary warrior Furiosa (Charlize Theron) freeing the oppressed wives of of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Taking a beast of a tanker, Furiosa goes off against Immortan Joe's whole army of Joe's Half-Life warriors. Furiosa's goes on a massive car chase but is later joined by the road Warrior: Mad Max. The Half-Life warrior Nux (Nicholas Hoult) betrays his master and eventually joins the team. They race to the 'green place' to find salvation.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult was the stand out actor in the film. His crazy, off his rocker betrayal of the effects of the apocalypse are unbelievably convincing. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theon also break rank with completely engaging performances. No acting in this film is bad. For me, every actor fits in beautifully with the style and atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The biggest visionary aspects of the film are:<br/><br/>the cinematography- to have such a bright and vibrant world for a apocalypse film is interesting and incredibly clever.<br/><br/>The Directing- the long takes and absolutely abnormal angles of the directing are transcendent to almost all other movies.<br/><br/>The concept- to think up the whole one long chase sequence takes time and creativity that almost all action films lack and most films altogether forget about. Also, thinking of the storyboards before the screenplay is difficult and hard to master yet, Miller does it perfectly.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film is the lack of dialogue but the movie manages without it. I love how they managed to put so much character development with very little dialogue. The hidden meaning of empowering women and never bowing down to dictation are expressed strongly without too much dialogue. I do love long conversations in movies but I was deprived from that feeling in this film. Still, minimal dialogue and Nicholas Hoult showed off a higher quality of acting that actors in films with nothing but talking still do not manage to show.<br/><br/>To finish, I found this film a instant classic that can never be forgotten and can truly compete with the originals. I do not know whether it is better than the old Mad Max films but it is easily as good but more visionary and more meaningful.<br/><br/>+the action: nothing like anything you have ever seen.<br/><br/>+the concept: original and has good, interesting deeper meanings.<br/><br/>+the acting: Hoult is sensational and manages to stand out against Hardy and Theron who also blow you away.<br/><br/>+the screenplay: may not have dialogue everywhere but when character speaks it is meaningful and incredibly important to the strong development the story has.<br/><br/>+cinematography: not cliché for a apocalyptic movie. Usually dark but here it is bright and vibrant.<br/><br/>-little dialogue: meaningful when used but I wish there was more.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>Acting;10<br/><br/>Action;10<br/><br/>Screenplay;9<br/><br/>Music;9<br/><br/>Pace;8<br/><br/>Story;9<br/><br/>Cinematography;9<br/><br/>Overall;9.1/10"
"drqshadow-reviews","10","3","11","28 May 2015"," The Most Intense, Electric, Absurdly Rewarding Ride I've Taken in Years
","A triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guilt-free indulgence of the early '80s action/adventure bubble. Max puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up, somehow topping itself over and over again, even when it seems like there's nowhere left to go. It's joyous anarchy, a world that thrives on all of society's dirty secrets; completely post-apocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than we'd like to admit. Of course, it's a visual powerhouse - a glowing example of art direction, stunt driving, cinematography and character design that's damn near unrivaled in modern cinema - but it's also an audio behemoth. Like Inception's deep bellow or Terminator's ominous rumble, Fury Road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent, effective use of bass. You feel that rumble? The ride's starting back up again. Junkie XL's accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match, the right blend of fuzzy, maxed-out guitar licks and incessant, pounding tribal drums. Perhaps most impressively, the film doesn't feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line. If anything, it revels in leaving that to the viewer, whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad, wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway. It's a raucous success, a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a two-hour surge of adrenaline. I loved it, constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first R-rated movie. Loved every minute."
"The Grand Master","7","3","11","28 May 2015"," Mad Max makes a spectacular return onto our screens with a big bang.
","Following the underwhelming and disappointing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Mad Max makes a spectacular comeback with a big bang 30 years later. This time Tom Hardy takes over the role from Mel Gibson as Mad Max. Director George Miller returns in the director's chair having directed the previous Mad Max movies. Mad Max Fury Road was a exciting action packed bonanza from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Set in an unspecified period in the future, the world has turned into a desert wasteland and all civilisation and humanity has collapsed. One of the survivors, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) continues to roam around post-apocalyptic Australia. Max is later captured by a group of scavengers called the War Boys, imprisoned and kept as a live blood bag to keep the scavengers alive. Immortan Joe, (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter from the original Mad Max) is the leader of the War Boys and also the ruler of the community of survivors struggling to keep alive. At the same time, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has been sent out in a huge War Rig to collect gasoline from Gas Town but unbeknownst to Immortan Joe, Furiosa is smuggling out his five wives that he has impregnated. Immortan Joe unleashes an all out pursuit to take back his five wives and to take down Furiosa. Amongst the pursuers is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones), and The People Eater (John Howard). After Max manages to break free, he assists Furiosa and the five wives which include The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast The Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), Cheedo The Fragile (Courtney Eaton), and The Dag (Abbey Lee) in order to make it safely from Immortan Joe's clutches.<br/><br/>I found myself a bit cynical when Mel Gibson was not going to return as Mad Max. Unfortunately, far too much time has lapsed and Mel Gibson is too old for the role not to mention all the controversy that has plagued Mel Gibson's reputation. Tom Hardy did an excellent as Max Rockatansky. Charlize Theron was also suburb as the one armed female warrior Imperator Furiosa. I honestly could not recognise Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, having always thought of him as the infamous Toecutter from the original Mad Max.<br/><br/>The entire movie can be described as a spectacular, non stop, fired up car chase from beginning to end. I enjoyed that a lot. Now that's what an action movie should be like! While Mad Max: Fury Road may not be a classic compared to Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max 2 (1981), it certainly erased all the underwhelming disappointment of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). A sequel to a violent franchise should not be a watered down children friendly movie. Mad Max Fury Road was certainly a spectacular comeback in the series. George Miller should be commended on resurrecting the Mad Max series.<br/><br/>Here's hoping there will be further sequels and Tom Hardy will return as Mad Max.<br/><br/>7/10."

","It has been nearly 2 weeks since I saw Fury Road, and I'm still trying to recover. It is the sort of film you forget to breathe through, much like Interstellar, but for an altogether different reason. Unrelenting from beginning to end, this post-apocalyptic saga is virtually one, long, explosive chase sequence, albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap. The action (i.e. the whole film) is utterly bonkers, conceptually and in execution. That writer-director George Miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough, but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work – augmented by gritty CGI – is simply awe-inspiring. Visually it is vivid and spectacular; the searing desert landscape offering a dirt-filled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds, whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous. The heart-pounding score by Junkie XL, in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music, accompanies Miller's on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears. The vehicular carnage may be the drawcard, but the committed cast elevate the overall product. Tom Hardy is savage as Max, Charlize Theron is compelling as Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult (Remember, X-Men???) is gonzo as Nux, whilst a plethora of recognisable Aussies show up in deranged cameos. There's an intensity here you just don't find in majority of the big- budgeted blockbusters; an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing. Miller hasn't played in the Mad Max world since the dreadful Beyond Thunderdome back in 1985, but by God he has redeemed himself, and then some. Fury Road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself. Considering the wave of terrible 90's Sci-fi sequels/remakes we've had fired our way in the past few years (Terminator Salvation, RoboCop, Total Recall etc.) Fury Road's success has been more than a pleasant surprise. In short it is a grungy masterpiece."
"kaitlynmail","10","3","11","26 May 2015"," Surprisingly Great
","This was a truly amazing movie. It surpassed all my expectations and left me with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Tom Hardy slayed as Mad Max, and Charlize Theron as Furiosa kicked major bad guy ass. 10/10 <br/><br/>(Okay, there were plot holes, like a lot of plot holes. Some things definitely didn't make 100% sense, like the weird bog men in the 'greenplace' that were never explained, the chrome spray applied to mouths/teeth during battle was also never acknowledged, nor what exactly Furiosa was seeking redemption for. A lot was left open ended and unexplained, such as the 'greenplace' becoming polluted; is it to be assumed that the fertile land was poisoned by the people who kidnapped Furiosa and her mother, as the land only started to decline after they had been taken? Was Furiosa's arm a natural abnormality, not an obvious conclusion considering none of the other women from the 'greenplace' had similar abnormalities or any discernible abnormalities at all, or did she somehow lose it during her upbringing at the citadel? What was her relationship with Immortan Joe? How did she become an Imperator, and was the intent behind her becoming one always that she would rescue the girls from sex slavery? <br/><br/>There was a lot of background information and world lore missing that could have added a whole new depth to the movie and I found myself afterwords wanting to know their back stories, wanting a prequel.<br/><br/>But more so than any of that, Mad Max Fury Road had a recognizable and complex plot that action movies just don't typically have. It had an actual story to go with the flaming car race from hell and it was so completely refreshing that I honestly couldn't complain about the minor faults in this movie.)"

","Stunning action film which pretty much does everything right; visually striking, great cast, great motivation and development of characters, the main characters face real danger and that shows, excellent effects and dream action sequences all completed with a great thunderous sound track.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of story here but you don't really need this I think to make a great film. In a sense it is a chase that this film is about and in that way similar to Terminator 2 and of equal quality I would say.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only thing missing was Max driving his car but I'm sure there will be some of that in the sequels that will follow. I can't wait to see more of this vision and hopefully of similar quality. Much better than previous Mad Max incarnations and has brought the series completely up to date. One of the best films I've seen at the cinema this year. Fans of the series and new comers should both enjoy."
"KineticSeoul","8","3","11","22 May 2015"," One heck of a thrill ride
","So when it comes to the story, it might seem like there really isn't anything special when it comes to the story. The plot is about going from point A to point B and back to point A again. Now the ""Mad Max"" franchise is considered cult films and although I am not a big fan of this franchise but I thought it does have certain imageries that make it stand out. Although the third installment was the weakest and is probably why there wasn't a new ""Mad Max"" movie for many years. I will say ""Fury Road"" is one heck of a insane experience, filled with chaos and madness. Again what makes this movie stand out is the crazy imagery and atmosphere. If you are a fan of steampunk style genres than you will probably have a blast with this one. This movie is wild and crazy and yet there wasn't really any shaky cam and yet the cinematography is really well done and super cool. Now I still think Mel Gibson did a better job of play Max, mainly because of the insane look in Mel's eyes, but Tom Hardy bring something new. He sort of reminded me of his character from Lawless a bit. Which is this confused badbass. Although the title says ""Mad Max"" the really title for this should have been ""Badass Chick with the Metal Arm"". Because Charlize Theron seemed to be the main protagonist throughout most of the film. And she is badass as a badass female lead can get. Call me blind, but I never really found Charlize to be attractive, sure I could understand why she is known to be one of the most beautiful actresses in the business. But man she was really hot in this one. Which shows that sometimes more than appearance how you carry yourself can really bring out the attractiveness. This is a exploitation film for the mainstream audiences, that is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end without it dragging out. Overall, this is a film that almost every movie buffs can have a good time with. I usually don't watch the same movie twice in theaters, but I did for this one. Once in regular and the other time in 3D.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","The fourth film of George Miller's Mad Max franchise, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' takes the action genre to an all new level! This is a summer blockbuster that's been made with passion & true effort! <br/><br/>'Mad Max: Fury Road' Synopsis: In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.<br/><br/>Despite its stunning spectacle & astounding stunts, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' rests on a very thin plot. Its not an innovative story & even the sequences, minus action, though barely any, aren't engaging. In terms of Screenplay, which has been Written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy & Nico Lathouris, isn't foolproof. It completely relies on action to deliver & luckily that department, is super-strong! <br/><br/>Miller deserves an ovation for his sheer imagination & for the execution of the film. He has envisioned an all new Mad Max Legend ingeniously. Visually, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is simply spectacular. I was engrossed & mesmerized by the action-sequences, which undoubtedly, are incredible. The fight between the Good & the Bad, is superbly done. I have never seen a film as action-packed as 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. <br/><br/>John Seale's Cinematography deserves a special mention. Each & Every Frame has been captured with utter brilliance. Margaret Sixel's Editing is sharp, although the first-hour, is slightly slow. Junkie XL's Score adds more madness to the narrative. <br/><br/>Though I thought I would never accept anyone but Mel Gibson as Mad Max, Tom Hardy dons the part, most engagingly. Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, is in true bad-ass mode. She kicks ass & how! Nicholas Hoult as Nux, is outstanding. His best work to date. Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, is terrifying & mean as hell! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad & Zoë Kravitz as Toast the Knowing, leave a mark.<br/><br/>On the whole, despite its thin plot, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' offers visual dazzle, like you've never seen before. Definitely, worth your time & money!"
"dglink","10","3","11","18 May 2015"," Maximum Max
","Wow! Non-stop action that starts, accelerates, and never stops. ""Mad Max, Fury Road"" is not for the faint hearted or those looking for a cerebral film experience, but definitely for action seekers who still want a movie with intelligence and a sense of style. Although the fourth screen appearance of Mad Max and the first without Mel Gibson, director George Miller, who helmed all four Mad Max movies, ups the action quotient this time out. As before, the plot is irrelevant, but serves as a vehicle for violent chases and clashes between a savage group who hold survivors of an apocalypse hostage for water and a small band of women fleeing sexual enslavement. Escaping his own imprisonment, Max joins the women, headed by the one-armed Furiosa, in their flight to a green area, where Furiosa grew up.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is a solid Max and dispels any nostalgia for Gibson; tough, laconic, yet human, Hardy recreates Max in an updated image. Refreshing in an action movie, the plot revolves around women, and Imperator Furiosa is Max's equal, both physically and intellectually. With head shaved and her usually porcelain complexion soiled, Charlize Theron is captivating and mesmerizing as Furiosa, a leader in every respect; she holds the eye in every scene in which she appears. Furiosa is a dimensional action character with depth and a past. The vast supporting cast of colorful characters with shaved heads, powdered torsos, and deformed bodies are all professional to outstanding, with a special mention for Nicholas Hoult as Nux, whose loyalties shift over time.<br/><br/>The music by Junkie XL is pulse-pounding, to use a clichéd term, and enhances and punctuates the action. John Seale's brilliant cinematography of Namibian deserts creates an otherworldly apocalyptic universe, and the use of 3D is arguably the most effective yet; not only do objects fly from the screen, but rifles aim into the audience, and armored vehicles sail overhead from behind. The kinetic editing by Margaret Sixel screams for an Oscar and creates a kaleidoscopic montage of images that is literally eye popping, to use another tired, but appropriate phrase. The art directors had a field day and also scream for Oscars; the vehicles are mobile sculptures assembled from old VW Beetles, rusted oil tankers, and vintage finned sedans; a heavy metal rocker perches in front of a fantasy truck, while enormous audio speakers blare the beats of a half dozen drummers riding in the back. Bandits strapped atop long flexible rods dangle over the fleeing vehicles to snatch the escaping women from the truck cabs. Skeletal beings with dark flapping cloaks walk across an eerie landscape on stilts. A dictatorial ruler flashes an evil grin with a leering mask of huge animal teeth. Skulls abound everywhere.<br/><br/>""Mad Max, Fury Road"" may have been conceived for action junkies, but the creative art direction, impressive special effects, stunning landscapes, a newly embodied Max, and, above all, a riveting turn by Charlize Theron as arguably the best female action character yet, broaden the film's appeal. Wow! The best of the Mad Max series. A movie to be seen in theaters, because it will never have the same impact on a small home screen. Highly recommended."
"foaadsm","9","3","11","18 May 2015"," Perfect Theater Night with Mad Max
","OMG! Two days later and I'm still buzzing from this spectacular sensory feast. As a person who grew up watching Mad Max movies in my childhood and early teens, I went into this movie full of confident knowing George Miller would not let us down; and he didn't! In my humble opinion, this is the best installment of the Mad Max series. I was entertained from the beginning to the end. the sound affects and music are done brilliantly. the visuals are memorable. the story is simple but you are given plenty of time to understand the characters; even though, there is not a lot of dialogue. half of the story is in the characters eyes. there is a lot happening in this movie. I will be watching it a second time. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"silenceofthesheep","10","3","11","17 May 2015"," Best Action Movie I Have Ever Seen
","Read the title. It is my honest review. This movie acceded my mountainous expectations by delivering me an action movie without equal. Fury Road does not try to be a great action movie, it just is. Instead of Max saying ""I don't say much"", as he did in Road Warrior, he simply does not say much. Instead of giving us a protruded flashback into Max's past, it is told in PTSD jumpbacks. Instead of Furiosa saying that she can do it (being driving, using the sniper, fixing the engine, etc.), she just does. Instead of delivering silly jokes like the Road Warrior, it is just funny. Instead of fleshing out characters through long dialogs, flashbacks, or exposition, the characters are naturally fleshed through actions. You get it. All of the character do have distinct, unique, and likable personalities. Even and in some cases, especially the villains. This movie functions as a character arc for some, while a character study for others. The sets and locations also set this movie apart in my mind. The long, Outback vistas, the canyons, the dunes, everything. The distinct, burnt orange color palate enriches the hues of the blue water, green foliage, and humanity in their eyes. All of the acting was really top notch, too. The camera work was also solid, with jumpy cuts and speed up moments that really got the heart racing. Oh yeah, the best part, though, is the action. The majority of the movie is chase scenes and they are absolutely intense! The whole time, I was totally juiced on adrenaline. The weapons, the costumery, the vehicles; it all seems so authentic. The creativity is just bonkers! And even though there are TONS of explosions, it does not feel like a Mike Bay wet dream because of the well grounded camera work and the focus on practical effects. I literally can think of one four minute scene and one ten second scene that I noticed CGI. Not bad CGI, but definitely CGI. The rest of the two hours felt very real. There were also some cringe-worthy grindhouse moments, which felt right at home to me. It is all so much fun if you enjoy this kind of movie. Overall, if you want some nonstop, pulse-pumping, badass fun with the subtlety of an exploding spear, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"scottshak_111","8","3","11","15 May 2015"," Madness rules
","""Hope is a mistake.""<br/><br/>Madness Unleashed! Two hours of orgasmic insanity taken up on the vanguard by mind numbing action, melting music of high-octane engine revving, breathtaking inane takedowns, colossal beastly war machines that only speak of destruction, flying rad bikes that skim the dunes with pizazz and the unceasing adrenaline rush that doesn't let you settle down even for a sec! Ice that with crazy visuals, top-notch 3D and exceptional score and ""Witness""!<br/><br/>There is madness in the air and you could literally see it. It is the right amount of dark that doesn't touch gore but still goes on to show a lot of death. With dope visuals and swell 3D, Fury Road becomes a rare coup. It breathes on an outstanding plot, deadly stunts and constant punishing annihilation. Right from the prologue the movie starts packing in exquisite action. It further inches into more lunacy with its unique storyline that would beat your imagination. George Miller's beauty is less Max and more Furiosa. Max just happens to run into her muck. Primarily the tale of the furious Furiosa who is on her way towards her origin, driving a charging War Machine, hatching a secret in the beast and keeping her greasy eyes of hope wide open for redemption. Charlize Theron imparts Furiosa an apt depth, something that only she could have done justice to. Nicholas Hoult does a memorable Nux who is downright nuts. Tom Hardy sways in the Max boots with his laconic act that entails kicking a lot of ass.<br/><br/>Miller's subtlety plays extremely well with the score, as suddenly the vibrant beats stop for Max to reveal his name. You can also perceive the adroitness in his direction when he shows things from Furiosa's perspective by manifesting Max's return after taking care of The Bullet Farmer. ""It is not his blood."" With the flick being an action feast, a lot of things remain unsaid. However, Miller makes sure that people still fathom and connect with trivial things like nods and gestures by slipping in the right amount of gravity.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best action films I have seen in ages which not only carries an awesome storyline but also a throbbing joyride into mechanical awesomeness on the relentless Fury Road. I am planning on watching this beauty again. Loco stuff!"
"jatzel09","8","3","11","15 May 2015"," The best possible revival
","A lot can happen in 30 years. The world of 2015 is a vastly different one from what was the reality of 1985 when the last Mad Max was released, let alone 1979 when the first one first hit theaters down under. During that time, came a noticeable change in what film audiences expect in front of their screen. While the 1980s was arguably the peak of action packed films (The early 90s being a top contender), the movie going public today is much more comfortable with zany comedies or drama. The constant bombing (no pun intended) of action film after action film at the box office gives only further evidence. Of course there are exceptions to this and one could point at super hero films but that is quickly becoming a genre in itself. But pure action, is nowhere near it's peak.<br/><br/>So in this new world, three decades later, how does Mad Max speak to the public? That's where Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult lead by George Miller come in. <br/><br/>Just as our heroes are in constant movement away from Immortan Joe, the movie never stops going. There is not a second wasted during the two hour run time. No filler or throwaway scenes, everything is part of the story. Even when there is no dialog, there is narration be it in the form of a gaze, deep breath or fight. Miller, who returns to the franchise that made him famous, proves to be just as much a visionary at 70 that he was at 35 giving us remarkable direction that uses the talents of the cast to it's fullest potential. <br/><br/>For all the non-stop action that this film carries, the characters are never over looked. Hardy is proving himself a highly versatile player who can believable adapt himself to what the story requires of him just as Hoult fully embraces his role as Nux while Theron as Furiosa keeps the whole story together. <br/><br/>Music of course plays a fundamental part in every film and this is no exception. I have always considered Hans Zimmer the best in the game and no doubt that JXL's work with him in many other films, including The Dark Knight Rises has been a big influence. Every piece of the score accentuates the adrenaline rush that is Mad Max: Fury Road. <br/><br/>An adrenaline rush that will leave you questioning yourself if you really just spent two hours sitting in the theater as it was so entertaining and engaging that you will hardly notice time going by."

"mgd_m","8","2","6","18 June 2019"," Masterpiece
","I watched this for the second time yesterday, and it was as satisfying as the first time. Fury Road is a little masterpiece (for those asking why my rate is just 8, I think that higher ratings should be reserved to era-defining movies and such).<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of action flicks, nor I am of the Mad Max series; but this is a jewel in film making. Here are some notes:<br/><br/>1) Action, action, action. Fury Road is an adrenaline bomb from start to finish. While, as I stated, I'm not fond of action itself, when a movie keeps you on the edge for two hours I like it. The problem with most action movies is that you have seen it all before, more or less; in Fury Road, 90% of the action is something new: funny, over the top, superfast, acrobatic, and surprising. It's obvious that the sequences are written with sincere passion, rather than with that ""let's stun the audience with special effects and milk their money!"" mood, that's ever increasing nowadays.<br/><br/>2) While the photography deserves a mention itself for the over-saturated colors and the beautiful landscapes, the most important aspect about it is the action again. Photography is in service of action, and it does a wonderful job. Lots of scenes have a weird, fast framerate, that gives the movie a distinctive, funny, and obviously ""speedy"" look. Dozen of takes filming the explosions are made through old-fashioned fixed cameras mounted on the vehicles, so that you're thrown into the action for real - not like in today's movies, where odd and complicated digital camera movements take away all the emotions.<br/><br/>3) The story. It's original and surprising, something of a ""move on from the same old tropes"". It starts and ends in an old-fashioned way, because it has to stay in its roots, but all what's in between is absolutely fresh. Characters are funny, deep, and all enjoy their personal arc.<br/><br/>4) Max himself. Tom Hardy is a great replacement, and I'll say he's even better than Mel Gibson (or, something more on pace with the times). His grunts, short lines, and facial expressions (often subtly ironic) are just perfect. I'll also add that the rough, sharp way he moves and walk is a subtle and perfect rendering of that character, a man whose only goal is to survive.<br/><br/>5) The design of sets, costumes and cars. Beautiful.<br/><br/>6) The old-fashioned way: practical effects, little CGI, and the old way of shooting, as I mentioned. It's definitely better.<br/><br/>7) The last and most compelling aspect of this movie in my opinion is that it's totally over the top. Exaggerated characters, sequences, and language (""blood bag"", ""witness me"", ""shiny and chrome""). The guitar player, the models, the fight with the car door, the gun wielding blind man... everything in this movie is just mad. I like this a lot, it's some kind of post-modern, pulpish cinema.<br/><br/>Edit: I watched it for the third time, and I'd like to add,<br/><br/>8) It's built like a comic book, really, and I like this very much. The three villains are straight from a comic book in their characterization. Lots of sequences are edited like comics, with interconnected shots and wide angles opening and closing them. Some obscure details like the missing shoe, the jacket, the bullet-teeth and so on get their brief screen time and help build the sequences, that's another thing you find in comics."

","Remarkable for its stunning visuals, ""Fury Road"" is part of the Mad Max canon that started with Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy plays Max in this film, but his role is overshadowed by Charlize Theron's performance as Imperator Furiosa, a driver for a tribal warlord. She goes rogue, stealing his property and dashing through the desert, hoping to find freedom and sanctuary.<br/><br/>This is an action film that is nearly nonstop action. The story has twists that prolong the suspense so the chase never becomes boring.<br/><br/>With stylistic references to ""Snowpiercer"", ""Star Wars"", ""Dune"", ""Star Wars"" and gladiator films, ""Fury Road"" is basically a retooling of the classic western. Imagine the wagon train speeding for safety while being chased by the Indian war party.<br/><br/>The dystopian setting for the film is a brutal world where those who control the resources have all the power. Theron does a great job of portraying the tough warrior who can survive in such a world. Her physicality is totally believable and the product of months of training (undoubtedly aided by her dance training).<br/><br/>Hardy provides a strong performance, but the script, especially in the beginning, inhibits his ability to express himself. <br/><br/>The mythology of this film is pervasive and convincing. The settings, costuming, and the design elements, combined with a dramatic and impressive soundtrack, make ""Fury Road"" a beautifully choreographed dance of death. The editing is tremendous, deserving of the Oscar (one of six awarded to this film)."

","After a disappointing 3rd entry with beyond thunder-dome, George Miller had interest in the series again and he created a film that might as well have been a massive middle finger to CGI.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is the new Max and he delivers a performance to rival Mel Gibson as the leading man, His Characterization as Max is based on The Road Warrior, with Max being silent most of the film, but this is the best part as the series is visual imagery and not dialogue heavy.<br/><br/>Whilst the last film was ruined by having American funding and having an American headlining the cast in that cast Tina Turner, who isn't an actress, this film has Charlize Theron as Imperotor furiosa, someone who is worthy of sharing the top billing, Playing a large part of the movie and a great Character whose on a Journey of redemption and is a strong female lead who doesn't need a man to defend her.<br/><br/>A real treat for the fans as the returning actor from a Previous Mad Max film is used to the best ability and his Name is Hugh Keays- Byrne who played the Toe Cutter in the Original Mad max 36 years prior, he's back and playing the New Villain Imortan Joe, and whilst delivering a menacing performance and unlike most action movie villains who are shown to be super human in someway, Imortan Joe is shown to be the opposite needing an air filter to breath.<br/><br/>Since Miller is again interested in his work The action scenes are top class, each scene is Practical effect and actual cars getting blown up and destroyed with the minimalist CGI used, the stunt work is fantastic with it being practical effects and the Only CGI is to remove the equipment.<br/><br/>The supporting cast whilst comprised of lesser known names creates a better performance than if it was made of better known names, as Miller chose ability over a top name.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone if you're not a fan of the series you will be after this film."

","Mad Max Fury Road was my most anticipated movie this year. The Mad Max franchise has always been best known for its atmosphere and car battles. Mel Gibson made the first movies classics and made the role iconic (We don't talk about Beyond Thunderdome). So Tom Hardy has pretty big shoes to fill with Fury Road. This film is one of the anticipated movies this year and did it live up to expectations, oh yeah it did.<br/><br/>Mad Max follows our hero Max Rockatansky who is captured by an army of men called war boys who torture him. The war boys leader The Immortan Joe is in control of the biggest water supply in the wasteland. He also has a many wives, who with his ""help"" produce more war boys for his army and mother's milk. But he is betrayed by one of his war rig drivers Furiosa who steals some of his wives and makes of for the promise land and eventually meet up with Max. They decide to work together in order to reach this land of green. The film's story is amazing and is easily the best in the franchise with twist and turns and many different moments that are iconic make this the best story out of all of the films. The story is also propelled by great performances from Tom Hardy who plays the Mad Road Warrior and Furiosa who is played by Charlize Theron. They both bring great life and emotion into the characters which is hard to do in such a chaotic move. They are also supported by a great supporting cast. Immortan Joe might be the best Mad Max villain yet with his menacing voice and skull mouth. <br/><br/>The star of this show is the action scenes and boy are they amazing. When the trailer was revealed most people thought they used way too much CGI but, as time went out we found out that 80% of the film was practical effects with CGI being used for the Furisoa's arm and the sandstorm. Yep real stunts, REAL explosion. These stunts are the most insane stunts I have ever seen in a movie and definitely help this movie have some of my favorite action scenes ever. <br/><br/>My number one worry I had about this film was if it would feel like a Mad Max movie. This movie feels like a Mad Max movie just as much Road Warrior was. It has the perfect blend of crazy and action and puts them perfectly into the best action movie in the past decade. I am not kidding when I say this. Mad Max Fury Road is not only a amazing movie worthy of the franchise,it is the best movie this year and is one of the best action movies in history. This movie has everything everyone wanted, a great story,great main characters and amazing action scenes and the score is one of the coolest scores ever in a movie. This movie truly is a masterpiece and when you are done watching it you will truly feel that you say an action movie like no other. <br/><br/>+Amazing action scenes +Great story +Fantastic +atmosphere +Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron 9.5/10 Masterpiece."
"The_Film_Anorak","9","2","6","26 October 2016"," Stonking, blood-pumping action classic
","Cinema audiences are getting sick of all the reboots, remakes and recycling of classic films and franchises, with good reason. They are equally weary of CGI-laden effects for the sake of it, and endless safe, homogeneous blockbusters.<br/><br/>Add to that the way even venerable film series like Die Hard have been reduced to PG-13/12A fodder where the hero can't even say his own curse-laden catchphrase any more, and you would be forgiven for not expecting too much from 70-year old George Miller returning to his old Mad Max character after a three-decade absence. The film industry today can't do justice to the adrenaline overload of the Road Warrior, right?<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>Somehow George Miller got One Hundred and Fifty Million Actual Dollars to make an R-rated action film, filled the screen with insanity and grotesques, and delivered on all the empty words other filmmakers have used before like ""breathing new life into a classic franchise,"" ""genuine reboot,"" ""practical effects instead of CG weightlessness"" and ""great action, great story."" Just for good measure, he made it into something of a feminist action film and picked up 6 Oscars. In another year he might have had a shot at two more, Best Director and Cinematography. By some utter anomaly it lost out on Best Visual Effects as well. So you can safely say this has been a success.<br/><br/>The film plays out as more or less two unbroken hours of full-on action, mostly on fast-moving machinery, the likes of which you will never see elsewhere. Amid the flame, dust, flying bullets and broken bodies flying through the air you also get a coherent story, told mostly through the kinetic forward motion of the action. This is pure cinema, absolutely brilliant, succeeding on every level. It's not everyone's taste to be based around extended car chases, and some complained about the minimal dialogue of Max who some thought was sidelined by the other lead characters. But in my humble opinion it is entirely consistent with Mad Max 2, where Mel Gibson had just 16 lines of dialogue and the story of the other characters' struggle was seen through his eyes.<br/><br/>This is absolutely essential viewing, if nothing else just to wonder at the thrills, violence, apocalyptic worlds and cannibalised motor vehicles flying across the screen. It's so wild, at a preview screening a member of the audience stood up in the middle of an action sequence, turned to Miller and shouted ""How the hell did you do that?"" It was fellow action director Robert Rodriguez.<br/><br/>You really can't afford to miss this film."
"BillSims28","9","2","6","13 March 2016"," Five-Word Review: Jaw-dropping, Perfect Action, Creative, Different
","Director George Miller picks up his 30-year dormant trilogy for a fourth instalment which replaces Mel Gibson with Legend star Tom Hardy as 'Mad' Max Rockatansky. Co-starring are Charlize Theron (Monster) and Nicholas Hoult (Kill Your Friends).<br/><br/>If you, like me, have never seen any other Mad Max films, the basic idea is that, in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, fuel and water are scarce commodities and humanity has regressed to a tribal, dangerous race desperate to survive. As Fury Road begins, hideously scarred dictator Immortan Joe is ruling the desolate populace with an iron fist and cruelly controlling their water access, indoctrinating men to become cannon fodder known as 'War Boys' and stealing healthy young women as 'breeders'. When Furiosa, an 'Imperator', saves 5 of these women, (called Toast the Knowledgeable, The Splendid Angharad, Cheedo the Fragile, Capable, and The Dag, these are some of the most normal names in the piece.) she attracts the full force of Joe's war crew, including a prisoner named Max. This plot setup all happens within 10-15 minutes, and from there the action begins, continues, continues, and continues, and never lets up. It is, in effect, a gargantuan car chase with a few short act-breaks in between. And it's the best goddamn car chase I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Calling Fury Road mad is like calling Lord of the Rings epic fantasy. Well, yes, it is, but it's also basically the definition of the word. It's been in development for many a year, and it shows: the intricacy of every aspect of this film is mind-blowing. With 6 deserved Oscars including editing, costume design, and production design, the look of the film is unique and spectacular. Instantly iconic, characters will be cosplayed for years to come, and images such as Max with the muzzle, Furiosa's shaved pate, Nux's emaciated visage, and Immortan Joe's classic appearance will not be forgotten soon. The effects, largely practical and stunt-based, with appropriate and non-distracting CGI, are top-notch and, despite the Academy's decision, are simply better than those of Ex Machina. The wasteland is flawlessly depicted as harsh, ruthless, and an environment which demands that only the best survive. Acting? Top-notch. It says a lot about Theron's performance that she overshadows the title character, but as effectively the main character, she carries both her in-film cargo and the actual film itself, conveying her pain and desperation expertly, and she was definitely passed up for Best Actress by many awards. Not that Hardy is bad - he is truly mad, with few lines, yet that makes them better, with his sub-woofer voice and unexpected comedy (""first they take my blood, now they take my car!"") in addition to increasing his serious survivor's instinct. And speaking of quotes, those from Fury Road are truly magnificent. Predictably mad, yet often wonderfully, darkly funny, there are far too many to list. They're certainly not MEDIOCRE. But the best part of the film is undoubtedly the action. This is quite possibly the greatest action film of all time, with octane going through the roof and edges of seats sat on more often than not. A visual feast for the eyes, ears and general senses, with an unexpectedly progressive feeling that the new Ghostbusters could only dream of: female characters are represented properly and fairly, without making it the sole focus. You really can't rave about it enough.<br/><br/>I feel there's very little bad to be said about this film, though due to the incredibly high pace the slower moments make the pacing seem slightly off, though only trivially. And while it is marvellously quotable, the dialogue amongst the brides is less inspired. There's not a great deal of character development, either. However, these are small complaints in an otherwise flawless masterpiece, which Mad Max: Fury Road is. Also, shout-out to musician iOTA as 'The Doof Warrior', my new favourite character, who redefines what it means to be metal, playing his awe-inspiring flaming guitar through thick and thin and leading Joe's war charge along with the drums of war, adding to a fabulous, pulsing soundtrack. Overall, it's a 94/100."

","When you see 97% on the tomato meter than you're expecting a bit. Every previous Mad Max had at least some sort of plot. Not this one. They are just fleeing from the mean boss in order to save his wives. This one takes place on the road for 99% of the time. Sure it's still fun and interesting but you expect a whole lot more after it was hyped so immensely. The 3D is decent but as for the movie, it's only mediocre. Worth a Blu Ray? Yes. Because it makes a great Demo Disc. But mostly for that reason only. The movie itself really feels like a B-Movie. Or rather like a movie where a B-Movie Director was handed $150 Million, which is how much this one cost. And he didn't know what to do with it so he made the exact same movie just better looking."

","Great visuals, great production values & lovely detailing that fleshes out (literally) life in the future-desert-world-thing. It's very ludicrous but fun. The action-staging is as good as ever but there are only echoes of the earlier heights of suspense because we don't care too much about the characters, particularly Max - once a clever and resourceful character, now just... sullen. Despite frequent flash- back cuts to show him as haunted, he's more one-dimensional than ever as portrayed by the sparse and strangely accented mumblings of the usually reliable Tom Hardy. Charlize Theron gets only a little more to work with and it's Nicholas Hoult who gets the stand-out character which could be parodying our current preoccupation with religiously radicalised youth. The plot is very simple and calculated only to provide maximum chase scenes. Visually inventive, accomplished and well integrated with effects ...but the film is missing it's usual humour, any basis in drama and perhaps therefore our engagement with the non-stop action."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is admittedly a pretty tricky film to analyze post-viewing. I will preface this review by saying this is one film to see on the absolute biggest screen possible. The action alone merits an eight-star rating. I will admit that most times I take the meticulous CG effects and practical wizardry of movies nowadays for granted, but it's worth saying that my jaw physically dropped during two or three of the film's action sequences. No doubt, it would be an understatement to say that George Miller has an eye for staging action. My only gripe, and it certainly doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, is that the movie is mostly lacking a compelling narrative hook. Before the inevitable comparison is made to 2013's Gravity, which was almost entirely propelled by the absolutely out-of-this-world action, I should say that the characters are much more interesting this time around. Charlize Theron is very good as Furiosa, even while her arc feels a bit forced. Nicholas Hoult is lots of fun as Nux, and Hugh Keays-Byrne plays a very solid villain. But, I must say it was Tom Hardy who really stole the show. I don't think I've every heard less lines from the supposed main character, but that's what really made him special. Otherwise, Junkie XL's score was absolutely electric, and it makes me very excited to see what he's got planned for Batman V Superman. The cinematography was very good, and perfectly captured the on-screen excitement without having to resort to the ""gritty"" hand-held style favored by lots of filmmakers nowadays.<br/><br/>So, while the story is not entirely serviceable, George Miller's confident and 100% competent direction elevated this from a fun but forgettable actioner to a potential Oscar candidate."
"kislaykaushal22","Null","2","6","23 May 2015"," Tom Hardy! The name just keeps proving itself.
","I didn't watch the earlier Mad Max movies. I just went with an empty page and brought back a lyrical note with George Miller's signature all over it. <br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic era, when mere survival is a luxury, an ex- policeman, Max (Tom hardy) tries to evade a pack of blood thirsty, demonic destructive men who work for the most formidable of all warlords named Immortan Joe. Max, haunted by his past humane memories fails to escape and gets embroiled in a heist led by a revolting commander in chief Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). What follows is an intense, thrilling, real steel (by real I mean real) battle between an atrocious, seemingly invincible army of scavengers and a handful of strong willed and not so scavenging people. The magic of this movie lies in depiction. It beautifully brings alive the horror of apocalypse. That palpable vigor to kill evident among all characters suggests the utter desperation to live and yet feel the agony of it. All action sequences are superbly crafted. While watching this in 3D, I ducked a couple of blows to avoid getting hurt. In this absolute mayhem, the least mad of all, Max nonchalantly deals with the worst physical blows a person can imagine. Hardy's intensity is a treat to watch. Charlize Theron portrays a role of a fierce warrior with a woman's heart. Occasional sights of water and Rosie soothed the eyes in an otherwise dusty and violent story of Max."

","Finally, here's a sequel for Hollywood to be proud of. George miller, returning with his mind child, promised us an action packed movie, and god, what he delivered was the apex of action. About two hours of mindless ass kicking with eye-watering visuals. The only problem I had with this movie was that it never gave me a second to catch my breath!!! Once again, we are invited to the post-apocalyptic Australia, where there is no Cricket or kangaroo. We are introduced to a long haired Max besides his beast of a car that was destroyed in the second part. He gives us a monologue so that any new viewers won't get confused. From there on, it's hard to explain what was happening. Probably, the best action movie ever produced in Hollywood in the past decade, Fury Road actually showed it's middle finger to all those comic-book movies that we thought were delivering action. We got ourselves a new metric to scale them with.<br/><br/>On the acting department, quite frankly, I miss Gibson as Max. Hardy may be a badass, but Gibson was cool as well as badass, like a whole package. If anyone I'm so impressed with, that will be Theron as Furiosa. Ms. Theron proved herself to be more than a pretty face with movies like Monster. Theron's portrayal of Furiosa was strong and subtle. After Ripley and Sarah Conner, we might have found our new kick-ass female protagonist through Furiosa.<br/><br/>Max is a character that needs to be in a complex situation. Miller knows this fact more than anyone, so he structured this movie in the same way he did with the 'Road Warrior'. He gave him conflicts, and let him to solve them his usual way: explosively. Sure, this movie may not be a masterpiece, but it's sure is entertaining, and it is loyal to it's characters....."

"dgranger","8","2","6","20 May 2015"," One long car chase with little or no story to it.
","Warning: Spoilers ahead. Specially in the third paragraph. Actually, make this a seven and 1/2 stars because the action and special effects are that well executed. The acting was not that bad ether. In fact, the acting was rather good. Other than that, the title of this review basically says it all. What little story there was, was mostly contained in the garbled section of the first few minutes of the film and starts to develop only a little more and slowly after, I guess, the first fifteen minutes of the car chase and then only to set up the next section of the chase. And the chase begins right away. The film is wall to wall action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>What is nice about this film is that it ties the previous Mad Max films together by having Gas Town reappearing in this film (""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior""), the masked warlord Immortan Joe closely resembling the insane masked Humungas from ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"", and Mad Max being haunted by the memory of his dead daughter or child of another Mad Max film (there is at least one kid in every film) (""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome""). I even think, but not sure, Bartertown from Thunderdome shows up on a map Max is making in the film. The first few garbled minutes of the film is basically that Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by a band that fallows the insane and sick (physically and mentally) orders of a masked warlord named ""Immortan Joe"", (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and is taken to a fortress called ""The Citadel"". Max is branded as property and is used to provide blood (called a 'blood bag' in the film) to a young warrior named ""Nux"", (Nicholas Hoult), who believes Joe's twisted theology based on Norse mythology and cars. Nux was led to believe he is dying and wants to go out in a blaze of glory in service to Joe. Immortan Joe controls the people of the Citadel by controlling and rationing out the abundant the water supply at the Citadel. He tells the people not to get addicted to water and to do without. Isn't he a nice guy??? ... NOT!!!! Joe keeps a harem of wives because he wants a son that he can rise as a warlord and heir to his kingdom. The wives do not want to live with him and had arranged to escape in a secret compartment inside a tanker/war machine driven by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) while on a supply run to Gastown. Joe finds out about the escape and decides to give chase. Nux convinced a friend to let him join In and let him take his blood bag with him. Well there you have it. The first five to ten minutes of the film as best I could figure it out. From there on, you are on your own. I will say that there is one inescapable silly element in the film. It is that one of the chase vehicles that Joe has with him is a rig with a group of drummers pounding war drums in the back with a heavy metal rock guitarist in front playing a guitar with a flamethrower attached to it. It looks great at first but it becomes a sick glitch as the film wears on and how the director spends way to much screen time on it. And all it was for was to give Max a chance to get his hands on the flamethrower. I have seen this movie in 2d but I can tell you, if you are planning to see it in 3d, a lot (and I do mean a lot) of things are thrown at the audience. If you like that in 3D, enjoy."
"moviewizguy","9","2","6","19 May 2015"," Why Practical Effects Matter
","I won't say anything new about MAD MAX: FURY ROAD that hasn't been said before, so I'll just be preaching to the choir. While Tom Hardy is good and all, it is Charlize Theron's Furiosa that ultimately trumps the titular character in an unexpectedly significant role that is handled with grace and gravitas that one can expect from Theron. The character of Furiosa herself is a revelation, someone you don't normally get to see in a big budget action blockbuster: She is on an equal level playing field as Max, both important, and one helping the other when the situation calls for it. She's also the more interesting character, going through a deeper change and a more emotional journey. It's a good thing, then, that Max is resorted as a background character, which may anger some people, but it works here.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the action scenes are something to behold. In a era over-reliant on CGI, director George Miller's throwback to practical effects makes the action scenes come, quite literally, to life. There's a sense of verve, wonder, thrill, and rhythm that you don't usually get from modern action movies, save for Tarantino's DEATH PROOF and the FAST AND FURIOUS movies. Even then, those films look insignificant in comparison. Maybe FURY ROAD is Miller's way of reminding us what we've been missing out on for the past several years. Maybe it's his plea to get action movies back to their roots. Or maybe Miller just wanted to show the world the visionary he really is. After all, THE ROAD WARRIOR had inspired many action films since its release, and one can expect FURY ROAD to do the same...again."

","I will say up front that I am not the biggest fan of the Mad Max Trilogy. I didn't grow up with it and saw it way too late in the game for me to fully appreciate it. I see what it did for it's time, but I can't really say I enjoyed it that much watching it. Yet, I could not be happier to have seen Mad Max: Fury Road opening day, in all of it's glory.<br/><br/>It's really hard to start pin-pointing the positives of such a fluently put together film. It plays with such a fast pace you aren't giving time to catch your breath and that is what made it absolutely stunning. There are a couple, maybe three moments of character talk, but they are brief and stitch together a narrative that uses action to it's advantage: the film molds storytelling and action seamlessly and that is why every single frame works so well and had me on the edge of my seat. That is the difference between great and good action films, you don't fell you are watching action, you feel as if you are watching the story unfold, you there with the characters rooting for them and the fact that the action is the medium through which you experience it makes it all the more riveting. There is really no two ways around describing the spectacle Miller pulls off here. It is modern action at it's very, most extreme best. There are no fast cuts, there is no shaky cam it is all there for us to witness alongside the beauty of the cinematography, the mouth dropping set pieces and obviously the George Miller post-apocalyptic weirdness that is back and better than ever; if you thought the first three movies were weird just watch this and forget the other three. It also manages to pull off some surprising dramatic storyline which has many different aspects to enjoy and gives a very, very big emotional punch at the end. This is thanks to an all around great cast with two central performances that are some of the best acting of the year across the board. Tom Hardy by now doesn't even need for me to talk about him, I was a fan of his before people even knew who he was and he once again proves his talent here with some fantastic non-dialogue acting. He really proves he is simply a star and one one the greatest actor of our times. Yet, I think that the better performance and actually the best thing of the whole movie is Charlize Theron. This is Oscar-worthy work in my opinion. Every time she is on screen she owns that, this isn't just some throwaway side role, this is some stunning acting that elevated the film to another level. She sets the screen on fire from the first time she appears on frame and throughout the whole duration of the film she adds subtext to her character with very little quips that I absolutely loved! <br/><br/>There isn't a negative that can be pointed out. There isn't a gawping hole than detracted from the experience. The film satisfies every single thing it wants to do and does it with absolute excellence. I will even say that this film deserves both Oscar nominations for best picture and director. The reason it simply doesn't rank higher for me is the fact that as much as I wanted it, I didn't have the experience I was expecting. Now granted, my idea may very well change, but what I'm saying is that there is nothing that made me jump out of my seat or make me physically engaged. That is in no way a negative as I said, it is just what I search for with higher ranking movies and it simply (and unfortunately) did not to that for me, it didn't reach that level of absolute, mouth-on-the-floor, sweating experience. This may be due to the fact that it isn't doing anything revolutionary with the action medium. There are some very original ideas, but there isn't nothing that hasn't been seen or exceeded before. It is doing action at the very best excellence someone could ask for, but it didn't reach for anything more and it didn't give me that chilling, physically engaged experience that I crave for when watching masterpieces. Moreover, there are very little things dispersed around the film that keep it from being the masterpiece it could have been. For example, the storytelling is great, it simply lacks that edge that could have elevated everything around it. <br/><br/>Yet, that is really enough. I don't want to give the sensation that I still didn't have an amazing, riveting and exciting time. I look forward to checking out this one again and suggest for everybody to see this film. Go watch real action and not the fast cutting crap we are generally served."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is the next installment in the Mad Max franchise after a thirty year gap. In this film a damaged man named Max runs into a group of people trying to escape an evil cult leader and is forced to help them escape. Before I enter the review I want to mention that I have never seen any of the previous films in the franchise. From that perspective I found the film kind of exhaustingÂ… From a technical standpoint, it is just about flawless. The action scenes are absolutely incredible to behold. The visual style is unique and the character design that goes along with it is perfect. The world building of the post-apocalyptic wasteland is really good. The film clearly shows an in depth society of people that have rallied together to not only survive, but to live. Most of the action looked practical which only made the action even more enthralling. The problem I had with the movie is that there was so little plot and character development (and what was given to us was given way too late) that I begin to ask why I should care about these people over the other survivors. Sure, their adventure might be more exiting, but I know so little about them and what I did know was so generic that I just didn't connect with them. This might not be an issue if you have seen the other films. A possible exception to this is Furiosa, the main character of the film. Do not let the title mislead you; Mad Max is not the main character. He just shows up and helps out. The entire plot is driven by Furiosa and all of the big characters moments where with her. There were some interesting moments dealing with a cult member, but it felt like all of that character development happened off screen. Most of this development is done though body language, grunts or generic responses of questions I had been asking myself for more than half an hour. The main villain was well designed, but other than being an abusive cult leader, I know nothing about him. I don't even remember his name. Some might praise the minimalist plot but since the other two hours of the film was pure action, I began to become desensitized to it. I love to eat chocolate, but if I only eat chocolate for a week I'll get sick begin to want healthier food. The same goes for action in movies. Action scenes mean more if there was build up. Again, this is not a bad movie, but I just could not get invested in what was happening enough to really care. While this might be a landmark in terms of visuals and action, it is lacking substance in its plot and characters."

There is just so much going on.<br/><br/>From the opening scene you get propelled into this world. This world of survival. This world of no breaks in action. This world of pushing forward. I don't know how else to describe it except to say that in a 2 hour movie there is 1 hour and 45 minutes of solid action. You don't get to take a break. It is exhausting.<br/><br/>I could talk to you about the great cast, Charlize Theron is her usually fantastic self. Shaved head, arm missing, covered in dirt and she is still just the definition of beauty. Tom Hardy as usual puts his own spin on the Mad Max character, where mad max is almost more animal than man. More mad than sane. He is a perfect fit for this world that exists at the end of humanity.<br/><br/>But the real star of this movie is not the actors and actresses but it is the dessert. It is a world in which everything hurts. Everything is a struggle. Existence is pain. The action sequences just help to highlight the fact that there is no life at all in the dessert it is just you and your car.<br/><br/>In the end Mad Max is short on pot. Short on dialogue. Every word seems to be a struggle coming out of the characters mouth. But I think that is by design. Because in this world there is no small talk, there is no joy, there is only survival. And to survive you must keep moving. And that is exactly what Fury Road does. From the opening scene to the closing credits. It keeps moving."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is an excellent action movie. It's visceral, beautifully shot, and has a heart-pounding soundtrack that perfectly matches the off-the-wall action on screen. It is not a great Mad Max movie, however, despite all the high scores it's received from critics and fans alike. In fact, I think it's overrated. Leave it to me to be the one who picks it apart--I have no allegiance to the Mad Max franchise or advertisers.<br/><br/>Fury Road starts with a flashback accompanied by voice-over from Max (Tom Hardy) as he provides a quick rundown of his haunted past and the post-apocalyptic world that he lives in. Water and resources are scarce. The world is a desert wasteland filled with packs of psychopathic bandits running rampant in supercharged custom-built muscle cars and buggies. If you've seen the previous Mad Max films or played any of the Fallout or Borderlands games, you've got the idea.<br/><br/>At the center of this wasteland is the Citadel, the kingdom of skull-faced warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), which runs like a well-oiled machine of human slavery powered by Joe's cannon fodder minions, the pale ""War Boys"", who are indoctrinated to believe that the greatest glory is to die on the fury road and meet Joe in Valhalla.<br/><br/>After a caravan led by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of the fiercest warriors in Joe's legion, embarks from the Citadel on a seemingly routine mission, Max and War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) join forces with Furiosa as she attempts a rebellious plot to flee with Joe's five wives and escort them to safety to her childhood home known as the ""Green Place"".<br/><br/>Of course, this plot enrages Joe, and he immediately calls his banners to take down Furiosa and recapture his wives. The rest of the movie is basically a huge chase scene, as we watch Max, Furiosa, and company traverse the wasteland in pursuit by Joe and his thugs.<br/><br/>So, what are the problems with this movie that I alluded to above? The main issue lies with Tom Hardy, and the second is with the action-to-story ratio.<br/><br/>I am personally a big fan of Tom Hardy, but he is honestly characterless in this movie and lacks charisma. Yes, he was written to be a man of few words, a true strong silent type, but I never believed that he was this legendary hero named Mad Max. Sure, Tom handles the action fine, but there is nothing noteworthy about his performance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, he lacks chemistry with Charlize Theron, which is not surprising, considering the two stars apparently had major problems on set. I'm not sure if this was Tom Hardy's fault or George Miller's (the writer/director), but overall I found his performance to be underwhelming, as he mumbles his lines in an unintelligible non-Australian accent and comes off as a mindless brute, not a good guy who used to be a cop and had a family, but resorted to violence because it was necessary, like Mel Gibson's portrayal in the previous Mad Max movies.<br/><br/>To put it simply, this movie may have taken place in the Mad Max universe, but Mad Max never showed up.<br/><br/>However, despite my problems with Tom Hardy's performance, I have the exact opposite opinion of Charlize Theron's. I thought she was excellent as Furiosa, a skilled and strong-willed woman with just enough vulnerability to make her human and not just a man in a woman's body. She is the real star of the movie, and Max is just kind of there to fight bad guys. He has no real purpose or motivation.<br/><br/>Also, Nicholas Hoult's performance as Nux is excellent, and he is the only one who has any real character development, as he transitions from being another countless minion to a man with a soul.<br/><br/>My second issue with the movie is the lack of background story for newcomers. You're never given much context to understand the motivations of the characters and what is going in the world. You're basically just thrown in and expected to go along for the ride, which makes it difficult to care about anything other than Furiosa and Nux's arcs, the only interesting characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult's performances are excellent.<br/><br/>-The visual effects and music are great.<br/><br/>-The character development occurs through action rather than words, which is refreshing.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max is flat and underwhelming, and he lacks chemistry with Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>-There isn't enough background story and context to give the story much gravitas, thus there isn't much to care about other than Furiosa and Nux's arcs.<br/><br/>-A lot of the lines are inaudible.<br/><br/>-While the action is well done, it becomes excessive.<br/><br/>-The violence is PG-13. For all the killing going on, you never really see any blood or gore, which lessens the impact.<br/><br/>So with all this said, do I recommend Fury Road? Yeah, absolutely. It's a damn good action movie, highly entertaining, but if you're looking for another Mad Max movie, this isn't really it. If it was called Mad Maxine: Fury Road, that would have been a lot more accurate.<br/><br/>People are giving this movie 9's and 10's on IMDb, and it's now #25 on the IMDb Top 250 list, right under The Silence of the Lambs, The Usual Suspects, and Se7en. If you're seriously telling me this movie is as good as those classics, then I think you're crazy. Fury Road is fun, but it has nothing on those movies, which are all Oscar winners and nominees. I give it an 8/10.<br/><br/>Lastly, I saw it in 3D, and I don't recommend it. See it in 2D instead."
"digitalhat","7","2","6","15 May 2015"," Mad at Max - But it's a dry heat
","First of all, I loved the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior - not so much Thunderdome. Miller has a unique vision and really knows how to amp your adrenaline button. I am going to divide this review up in what I liked and didn't like about the new film. I will keep the content vague enough as to not give spoilers<br/><br/>First of all, I loved the creativity and art direction, you really do feel pulled into this world. It doesn't matter where on Earth this takes place, you recognize the pieces of the machinery and it screams ""apocalyptic assimilation"". Five stars for the creative vehicles, traps, weapons, etc. This is what the Mad Max universe is all about. <br/><br/>I really loved the fact that the trailer contained mostly scenes from the first 15 minutes of the film, so there is a lot of new footage to behold. I hate when trailers give away all the best parts of the film that leaves you just wanting to watch the trailer again and skip the full feature price. <br/><br/>Miller can direct an amazing sequence of action. Time and time again through the film, I could feel the adrenaline rising and my heart pounding - it is rare to get such a rush from films these days. There are a lot of surprises in the action, classic Miller unpredictability. <br/><br/>As for the violence, yes there is plenty of guys getting shot, blown up and run over. However, there isn't much graphic carnage. I am not complaining, but I not sure how they got the ""R"" rating. Granted there is a little bit of boob nudity, but no cursing that I could make out. I have seen more carnage on The Walking Dead, so not sure what the R was protecting teens from. Don't take your kids FFS!<br/><br/>Max loses points for poor script and character development. As to not spoil anything, I won't go into explicit detail, but you really don't care much about the characters. Max is plagued by visions of the dead throughout the film, and there is a lot of talk about redemption, but it never really resolves. There are many attempts to inject some sense of humanity into characters, but for the most part the audience doesn't care. Shouldn't we be blowing something up right now?<br/><br/>The film score is often right on the mark and then way off track. The beating drums and wailing guitar will hit their marks and then all of the sudden we are not doing anything terribly exciting and the score sounds like the Excalibur theme. It's like they decided that when the action is brought down to a calm, we had better amp the music up somehow. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy was terrible as Max. Honestly I don't know if it was the direction they were going or the lack of dialogue for Max, but Vin Diesel has shown more emoting as Groot. The film didn't even seem to need him all that much, it could have easily been called ""Furiosa's Wild Ride"". This was either poor casting or poor script/directing because I love Hardy's other work.<br/><br/>This film was geared for 3D and although I prefer to see films in 2D, I could tell there was too many attempts to feed the 3D machine. Can we agree that 3D is dead and just make films for audiences to enjoy now? Stop making everything come at me bro! I was also a little disappointed by the clearly excessive use of CGI. I loved all of the practical vehicles and stunts, so when I see crappy CGI, it takes me out of the moment. Keep it real, don't get lazy.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a heart pounding thrill ride. I enjoyed my experience but it did not leave me wanting to see it again. Once you see the action sequences, you are pretty much done."
"alex-b-katzmann","9","4","17","9 June 2015"," A movie about details: Mad Max Fury Road
","The devil is in the details.<br/><br/>Mad Max is one of the first movie franchises to have shown audiences gritty and original post-apocalyptic scenarios that have now become cult classics. Since the first installment in the franchise 'Mad Max' in 1979 made with a small budget of 400 000$, many movies and games have been inspired by George Miller's vision such as Escape From New York (1981), the Fallout game franchise.<br/><br/>The new movie had to face a lot of scepticism before its release. Many pointed out that it would do what most action/sci-fi reboots do, that is to come up with a mess of blend CGI playstation action, have poor character development and a stereotypical storyline. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) does not tackle all these issues entirely, but at least proves that it is still possible to witness original and meaningful big-budget movies for R-rated audiences.<br/><br/>How does it do it? By caring about the details. George Miller grants us the thrill to have practical effects instead of CGI in almost all the action scenes, he is not afraid to leave the audience ''out-of-ease'' by not having the characters explain or showing what is currently going, rather by giving us the chance to try and piece it together. The movie is stylish, but that is not the main focus. The action scenes are gigantic, but everyone is expendable as the protagonists are not invincible stereotyped superheros. There is also no doubt that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were great casting choices, as their cold-minded characters have very few flaws of performance.<br/><br/>There would be only reason why this film would not be remembered as great, if it was all about the explosions, action and sex. There is indeed a message underneath the madness and it can interpreted as a fear of what's to come. Post-apocalyptic movies warn about the dangerous survival nature of man and about how tyrants would yield all the power and use what's left of man for their benefit. This movie depicts this as the villain and his source of power over the masses: water. Fury Road does give us enough to think about, enough so it doesn't feel like a waste of thrills.<br/><br/>The only hick, there is too much in one movie to be only 2 hours long.<br/><br/>4.5/5"
"jokullepix","10","4","17","2 June 2015"," Simply a masterpiece
","I've never written a review before, since no movie has been worth it, but maybe interstellar ;)<br/><br/>Well I had never heard about mad max before it launched this year, and I did watch the trailer as I was on avengers 2. And didn't really think it would be that awesome since I thought they had revealed all in the trailer as most movies do today.<br/><br/>Men, was I wrong, This movie has the perfect ingredient's for a movie which really leaves you so speechless of awesomeness and surprises, even is funny how crazy things get, and that kind of makes it so much more real since its all build on the foundation of broken people running big ego's and what not.<br/><br/>I cant stop thinking about how a star-wars movie would be if it was in this intense form of epic style as Mad Max: Fury Road. I really hope that directors from now on will stop whining and making a drama movie about feelings all over again and start to make movies that is not a broken record on the same subject like all the 1000s of movies who really suck because they lack true originality. This movie is a form of art. <br/><br/>9.7/10 from me"

"alexpitt-345-971699","10","1","2","9 April 2020"," Mad Max: Fury Road - Movie Review
","I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the original Mad Max films, especially the first two, but George Miller returned to the franchise thirty years after Beyond Thunderdome and made the best entry yet. Not only is this the best film in the Mad Max franchise, it's one of the best action films of all time.<br/><br/>I can't reasonably say that Fury Road has the best plot out of all four films. In actual fact, it probably has the weakest narrative, but that's not what this film is about. Miller was trying to create a fast-paced, high-octane thrill ride, and, on that level, he managed to craft an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes over the reigns of Max for this film, and he did a great job. Max doesn't have many lines of dialogue, but Hardy still did a fantastic job at portraying the character. Joining him is Charlize Theron as Furiosa, and she is easily the best side character in all of the Mad Max films. There's even an argument that this film is about her instead of Max, and I can definitely see that.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned, the narrative is a little thin and the villain is under-developed, but Fury Road still has a serviceable plot and I loved being back in this world. It also helps that the film is directed incredibly well, and the cinematography is breath-taking.<br/><br/>Overall, although I mentioned a couple of negatives, I am not taking anything away from my score because Miller executed the film he was trying to make to absolute perfection. Mad Max: Fury Road was an adrenaline-filled, fast-paced, incredibly entertaining two hours and I absolutely loved every single minute of it.<br/><br/>SCORE: 100%"
"TOT_EchoofGlory","9","1","2","9 April 2020"," A cracking wasteland
","Yeah, I'm punning here. Some movies abuse of CGIs can take a lesson from Fury Road. The car and fuel cult adds illusion to this movie. Immortal Joe's army, their words are also based on the cult, like throttle and hi-octane. Furiosa deserves full score."

","Initially when first seeing this I was a bit underwhelmed. I mean I thought it was cool but it felt very ""style over substance"". Years late I've watched it countless times and I definitely have a different opinion of it. Its without a doubt one of the wildest, creative, pulse pounding, unique films ever made. The star of the movie is of course Furiosa played by a fierce Charlize Theron whom justly won an oscar for it. Nicholas Hoult is the second most interesting character and his journey is truly emotional and engaging. And well the title character Mad Max is the third most interesting character. Tom Hardy does a solid job of playing him crazy but the role is underwritten and mostly depends on his impressive physicality. Set years after the third film and Max has failed to help the tribe of children. He's constantly haunted by them and finds himself suddenly thrust into a harrowing situation in which Furiosa betrays her boss and decides to help his wives to escape. The action scenes are thrilling and have a real raw energy to them. The score is wonderfully intense and epic and the cinematography and stunt work are something truly magical and need to be seen to be believed. In the end it's not completely able to shake some thin spots but overall it's one of the best films ever made."

"postsenthil","9","1","2","27 October 2019"," A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
","Three decades (1971-85) after presenting the Mad Max trilogy which enjoys a cult status among action movie aficionados, Australian writer-director George Miller has returned with a fourth film seeking to reboot the series with Mad Max - Fury Road.<br/><br/>
Set in a post-apocalyptic desolate desert-lands of a dystopian future, this movie find the protagonist Max (Tom Hardy), an ex-cop and road warrior, trying to survive the feral forces controlled by the tyrannical warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who controls the precious resources of water, fuel and blood. He joins forces with renegade warrior Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is trying to escape the clutches of Joe with five of his slave wives. What follows is a long chase where Joe with his army of warriors in monster trucks and myriad malevolent contraptions try to hunt down Max and Furiosa.<br/><br/>While it is true that story line is wafer thin and the characters lack any semblance of depth, Miller is successful in using them to create a powder keg of an action package which brims with raw energy and is sure to blow the mind of the viewers. Miller mounts humongous adrenaline rushing action set-pieces which are highly original and chaotic in wreaking their hyper-kinetic havoc by seamlessly melding the old world action elements with contemporary CGI wizardry.<br/><br/>While a noisy thumping heavy metal score that elevates the impact of the action set pieces to a level unprecedented in recent times, brilliant cinematography captures the desolate desert-scapes in beguiling beauty and the well mounted action spectacles with rare clarity which is amiss in junkyard jamborees like Transformers series as well as several superhero movies. Charlize Theron, the real hero of the movie, is in kickass form as Furiosa and Tom Hardy does justice in reprising the gritty titular role of Max with a quiet intensity.<br/><br/>While I've never been a fan of loud music or mindless mayhem, Miller brings them together in an hypnotic concoction that would engross the viewers as never before. There is craft in the chaos of these jaw-dropping stunt sequences which set the bar for action movies high and could teach a lesson or two to the Michael Bays who pride themselves as makers of mighty blockbusters.<br/><br/>A veritable treat for action and auto junkies that could be best enjoyed on the BIG screen with 3D (IMAX 3D, if possible) !!"

","Back when this film came out there seemed to be a big love affair with it. The critics loved it and those who I talked to who saw it in the theatres loved it and said it was the best MAD MAX film yet. I sort of couldn't believe it. You mean it's even better than THE ROAD WARRIOR/MAD MAX 2? After my dad and I rented it and watched it we were both blown away and yes I must say that this film is the best in the series. Everything that was great about THE ROAD WARRIOR is amped up even more in this entry and done even better.<br/><br/>This time Tom Hardy plays the title role in Max. He does very well in the role and I have no complaints about him in the role. Just personally and this does not take anything anyway from this film, he does not outdo Mel Gibson in the role. I think I liked Gibson more in the role. But, there is so much action and other characters that you should enjoy that mixed with the fact that he more than fills the role I never really compared the two during my two viewings of this film.<br/><br/>Within the MAD MAX timeline I think this is supposed to happen before THE ROAD WARRIOR. Anyways, there is action right from the start and it does not let up. The beautiful and ever so talented Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa and she has been given the task of driving gasoline for the bad guys. But, she has thwarted their plans and is on the run from them...along with the wives of the main baddie Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who returns, but don't really now it is him under the mask he wears). More than enough story to mesh with the truly spectacular action.<br/><br/>This film also has some great modern music from Tom Holkenborg or Junkie XL that really goes well with what George Miller is putting on the screen. Really it is just a giant chase that in the end shows that Miller has out done himself incredibly and if you enjoyed most importantly THE ROAD WARRIOR/MAD MAX 2 you MUST watch this film. Written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris."

","In yet another post-nuclear-apocalyptic film, an unlikely group of rebels gradually join forces to escape across a desert from a brutal tyrant and his forces.<br/><br/>Regarding action and special effects, this movie is a fun ride and admirable as well. The trouble is that the action is almost non-stop. The scenes aren't repetitive or dull but their excess seems to put the film out of balance and in need of more breaks for other story-related elements like character development and letting the audience know why people are doing what they are doing.<br/><br/>The film editing also seems less than stellar during these action scenes. Improvements might have helped viewers in keeping up with what was being done by whom against whom. Also, as most characters in the chase scenes are white, bare-chested men with shaved heads, it was almost impossible to tell them apart.<br/><br/>There was an interesting addition to the story of a small tribe of women of various ages, most of whom were over fifty. To include such a group is a step forward for a big-budget Hollywood film. But overall, the flaws and lack of balance left an incomplete feeling."

","Mad Max: Fury Road has been an aficionado to the predecessor, but we can not deny that it is dynamic, nostalgic and thrilling, but it has given very little to an AAA movie. The budget was also the cradle based on historical details that George Miller and Mel Gibson have embedded in a steam-punk atmosphere and have a good actor in Tom Hardy.
But you did not come up for something, you're the story of the first twenty minutes of an AAA movie, flat and nothing to say. It's great to be able to reconsider that our hero gets from A to B and then returns. In 2015, this is little, it does not have the plus of less money and the worse actors could have brought such a quality. It was good for her to be happy with Tom,
let's continue our saliva on the nostalgia train and into a seemingly long journey through which a stomach asthmatic old man runs. In sum, Mad Max: Fury Road 6/10, can be viewed and endured once, but nothing more.

"foxhound-37781","6","1","2","30 July 2018"," A fun action-packed ride but lack of plot is very noticeable
","Literally the only thing that holds this movie back from being truly amazing is the fact that it's got such a weak plot and script. Couple of rogues travel out into the middle of nowhere to the woman's homeland, then basically head back to where they started out from all the while being mercilessly harassed by the various hunting parties/clans or whatever you want to call them. That's pretty much the long and short of it. Hardly any character development to go with it which just makes the plot even more redundant. The two main actors, Hardy and Theron, are dreadful on screen. No chemistry whatsoever between the two and apart from some occasional (and weak) dialogue, the main interactions they tend to have with one another is either fighting or pointing guns in each other's faces.<br/><br/>James Cameron said it himself, ""When you're making a movie, if you have a good enough story, everything else will fall into place and you'll have a great film"" and that's not just coming from any ordinary film maker, that's coming from the guy who directed Titanic. George Miller should definitely take notes!<br/><br/>Obviously the one thing this movie will shine for is the visual effects and the action sequences. I admit they are ridiculously well done and it is a very entertaining movie to watch if a bit of mindless fun is what you're after. In terms of action, Fury Road hardly lets up for a minute and is entertaining as hell from start to finish, but falls short due to its dull plot and a complete disregard for character development. Fury Road is very much one of those Yin and Yang situations, you're either going to love it, or hate it. Check it out anyway; it's definitely worth seeing at least once."
"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Exciting action/pursuit film. Beware driving after watching - ""road rage"" is a given!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' doesn't - to the best of my recollection - pick up from where the third film ended, which is fine, seeing as 'Beyond Thunderdome' came out the year I was born! I don't recall too many specifics from the original trilogy, other than it was a post-apocalyptic desert (Australian) wasteland and motorcycle and car gangs reigned supreme. 'Fury Road' keeps that tradition alive - at its core, it is a road/chase film, and is relentless throughout with everything it does, from the scenery, soundtrack, stunts, cars, violence and explosions.<br/><br/>The over-the-top-ness serves the film well, though - much in the same way '300' was hyper-visualised, this is the same, but instead of heaps of slow-motion, some of it is sped up, keeping the pace of the chase buzzing. It also has the same silly-ness, in that none of it is remotely realistic, but it all works within the universe the film inhabits (except for where all the fuel comes from!). Miller must've dreamt up most of the car/truck hybrids when he was a kid - and kudos to him for making them a reality, especially the pole-swinging guys and the main rig - certainly great to watch.<br/><br/>Hardy is satisfactory as Max (there's not many lines for the brooding hero) and Theron is good as the vengeful Furiosa, trying to protect a group of women from the evil Emperor (or whatever his name is - played by Keays-Byrne, with Billy Connolly hair). Not sure why Hardy had to have a Bane-like face covering for some of the film, after 'The Dark Knight Rises' - detracted a bit from the film. Favourite bit - the guitarist on the front of the truck! Loved how the drums and his riffs only came to the fore when the camera panned to them."

A lot of it is more than a little exceptional. The action scenes, especially the final chase, are incredible. It's pretty much everything else about it that I could do without. The story and characters are pretty dumb. That's not a new thing ... it's pretty much true of all the films in this series, and it's what really buries the 3rd one. But in past films, none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive CGI and a ridiculously frenetic pace. If you consider ""The Road Warrior"", that film's grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives it's broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes. It's like a post apocalyptic western. This film feels like a cartoon, or maybe a video game. A really really good one, but still ... a video game."

Isn't it amazing how much fun can still be had with a movie that isn't much more than trucks chasing each other (and, here and there, explode in a big ball of fire)?! It goes to show that a dreamlike quality - in this case a nightmarish one - can go a long way compared to so many movies nowadays that are too talky or that are just too much like literature or even more often like the comic strips they were made of.

He gets mixed up in the fate of Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a rebel woman looking for her home-land. A group is formed with these two, seemingly, as the leaders among a radical worshipper and a group of female prisoners. The party of misfits travel across the Martian looking terrain, coming across hordes of criminals under the tyrannic ruler, Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>While Mad Max is a really fun and enjoyable experience, it most certainly has its flaws. My first and main problem with this film is the paper-thin plot. While most viewers across the nation are satisfied with the brilliant action sequences and lack of story, I am not so easily pleased. I admit that I am a huge sucker for a great story (who isn't?) so I may have somewhat of a bias on this topic of conversation, but Mad Max falls extremely short of any sort of intricate plot. The film sprinkles bits and pieces of plot points among the influx of action scenes, but leaves way too much time in between plot points to really connect them and form a flowing story line. Story aside, the characters themselves seemed a bit transparent as well. With his name headlining the title of the movie, you would think the camera would shine the spotlight on Tom Hardy This is not the case. Hardy stays extremely quiet throughout the whole film. Now, I understand that Max's character is a big, bad, silent, brooding tough guy but why would you waste Hardy's immense talent on such a role that would have sufficed with almost any other tough guy actor?! It just seems like a ploy to have a popular actor as the lead role in an effort to fill seats in the theaters. With Hardy's performance fairly wasteful, Charlize Theron as Furiosa seemed more like the main character than Max. Furiosa's character is explained in much more detail and she is given somewhat of a backstory. While Max has these visions throughout the movie that are literally never explained! It's simple things like that which make the plot feel very choppy and superficial.<br/><br/>With my plot-rant out of the way, it's time to begin my praise for how magical the visuals, setting, and action sequences are in this stunning film. I'd like to start with the amazing setting in which this journey unfolds. The landscape shots in this film are an absolute treat to the eyes and leave you wanting to explore this barren wasteland in your own killer vehicle. Since I already brought up the vehicles, I must say they are one of my favorite parts of the movie. Every car and truck brought on screen is designed to be an off-road fighting machine! Mad Max focuses more on practical effects than CGI, much unlike other action films these days. This somewhat risky approach absolutely pays off in originality and creativity, making this movie a bright example of what action films should be in the future. As far as the actions sequences go, they are second to none. With stellar editing and proper framework, Mad Max showcases the action exactly how you want to see it. While there are an obscene amount of explosions, (it's an action movie, what do you expect?) they are a bit more tasteful than some of the other movies we see these days *cough* Stahhhp Michael Bay *cough*.<br/><br/>Personally, Mad Max: Fury Road didn't really cut it for me. The lack of development for the plot did not sit well with me at all. With more attention to detail, I think this could have been an amazing film. That being said, I can't say I didn't enjoy the beautiful landscapes, creative costumes and the rugged vehicles. With stellar visuals and unprecedented action sequences, it's no wonder Mad Max was a huge hit and undoubtedly one of the best films in the genre. Mad Max: Fury Road sets the foundation for how action films should be made in the future. If you enjoy action movies or just like seeing stuff blow the hell up, go watch this movie! If you really liked it, get ahold of me and I'll sell you my copy!"
"arthur_nonimus","6","1","2","19 October 2016"," The titular character is the only one lacking character development
","This film is an okay entry into the action film genre. It has lots of fights and things blowing up. There is also enough of a balance of slow points to advance the characters development and keep the audience interested. The problem is, and it's a big one, the titular character doesn't seem to share any of this development. If you're going to title a movie Mad Max, it seems obvious that the Max from the title should share in the character development.<br/><br/>The titular Max gets captured by a group of warriors led by a psychopath warlord and used as a blood donor for the troops. Meanwhile, Furiosa, a driver for the same warlord, takes a bevvy of women being transported to a nearby warlord off toward her homeland. This is an excellent setup, which could allow for many and varied opportunities for character development for both Furiosa, Max and supporting characters. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the character development seems reserved for Furiosa, the women being transported and a member of the warlord's soldiers. We learn of Furiosa and the women being transported's past. We see the soldier coming to the realisation that he has dedicated his life to a lie. We see the women change from frightened and defenceless to fighters and the soldier from villain to champion. Even Furiosa grows from a runner into a leader when she learns her homeland is gone. <br/><br/>Max, on the other hand, stays the same throughout the movie right up to the very last few minutes when his character is thrown a meagre scrap of a bone in the form of trusting Furiosa enough to tell her his name, and give her a transfusion. He has unexplained visions and nightmares, nothing else from his past is revealed. Those not familiar with the franchise are left wondering who this Max is and where he came from.<br/><br/>There is a gaping hole left in the story. Max, the one who opens the movie and who's name is in the title is a mystery. We learn almost nothing about him and see almost no character development from him. This ultimately leaves the film feeling unfinished to the uninitiated viewer.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is good not great. The visuals are impressive, the stunts amazing and the CG, where used, seamless. The same cannot be said of the story which, unfortunately, should have been sent back to the drawing board a few more times."

","Already guns have started to talk in Wasteland USA (remenber Wasteland is a video game, not reality)... but still, Miller tries his last film, with the last same tools, filming the last fellow and last girl u imagine u can live with in the dry Wasteland, before the real huge strike begins...<br/><br/>This is another appetizer of what's coming in every one's garden. So 30 minutes is what we shall look at before trucks and morons start destroying everything in our saloon. So... enjoy.<br/><br/>Many things we have seen in these last fifteen years show up in a funny way here. The pleasure is mostly to see them painted again, with dramatical talent and action.

","I remember as a kid watching the old Mad Max movies the ones with Mel Gibson and Tina Turner and they were pretty good fun and entertaining with a lot of action and adventure good guys against bad guys. A thrill ride thru a wasteland of a desert universe of different people in a different time. So just recently I watched the new entry ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". And I must says it was okay for a modern day action film a journey of action and adventure.<br/><br/>Director George Miller goes to great measures to show this film as a battle of the different classes of rulers a story of rich against poor and a rebel class of female warriors who come to save the day! Tom Hardy is Max the renegade who's captured by the evil and dangerous people of the desert land only to be rescued and joined in battle by a pack a group of female rebels all lead by (Charlize Theron).<br/><br/>This film may not be everyone's cup of tea as I didn't find it the greatest still it entertains with action and shows the new class of rulers being females which makes a strong gender statement and I guess if your a fan of the Mad Max series it's one to watch."
"TdSmth5","7","1","2","1 October 2015"," Cool but so empty.
","In some post-apocalyptic desert a guy is captured by a bunch of guys. He's kept as a source of blood for ill citizens of the citadel. In charge of it all is some old guy who's wasting away. He's controls the water in the area and keeps the population below the rock in misery and thirst. Occasionally he opens the floodgates and lets water run down to the masses who adore him, at least that day. One day he sends some select few to gather weapons in exchange for water.<br/><br/>But on the way to this exchange the girl driving the truck (a Charlize Theron ruined by a super short haircut) changes routes and goes rogue. The rest of the entourage is confused until they realize what she's doing and go after her. Among those driving after her is a sick guy who has the guy from the intro chained the the front of the car. Eventually the guy has his chance and frees himself. This is at a point when he and the other rogue truck are by themselves. Turns out the girl is transporting a bunch of nymphs to safety. The ruler enraged, goes after them himself with a convoy of crazies.<br/><br/>The girl aims to reach 'the green place' and our hero joins forces with her of sorts after they realize that they are no threat to each other. First they have to escape the the other gang with whom the deal was going to take place. More violence ensues. The girl meets a couple of girls to whom she's related. And they decide that the best course of action is to drive back and take over the citadel and eliminate the ruler.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so of Mad Max are quite exhilarating. It could have been even better if our lead character weren't bound and wearing a mask that won't allow him to speak but only grunt. But dialogue is definitely not a strength of this movie. There is very little of it, and what there is, is rather adolescent. Story-wise it's absolutely mind-boggling how 2/3 of the way into the story they decided to turn things around and basically repeat the first 1/3 making a good chunk pointless. For a moment things do pick up as for a while the movie had lost plenty of steam. So we have a movie that's 30 minutes too long and completely wastes a character that should have been a lead. What you're left with is wondering at the visuals and this neat world they created. For an R-rated action movie this one is rather mild and could have benefited from gorier sequences and some nudity."
"magnuslhad","6","1","2","28 September 2015"," Mad Furiosa
","Mad Max trips you up because Max is not the centre of the movie - Furiosa is. Once you figure that out the film is much easier to digest. Max just really goes along for the ride but doesn't seem to drive the action in any meaningful way. Technically, the cinematography is very well done and the bendy poles swinging in and out of the frame was inventive. The electric guitar shooting fire was wonderfully bombastic and signals that subtlety will play no part in this film. Immortan Joe was a little too derivative of Batman's Bane, and the romance sub-plot between the harem wife and the fanatical War Boy pushed credulity to its limits. It's a big, loud, sumptuous post-apocalyptic opera of a film, and pretty much delivers on what it promises. Pure escapism designed to sell popcorn, and does it very well."
"esperleas","4","1","2","4 September 2015"," Poor old Billy Connolly
","I felt sorry for Billy Connolly's character. He looked after those nice young ladies, kept them fed and watered and all babied up. Then they reject the high life style , race across the desert in search of something that isn't there, wasting fuel, water and milk along the way...and loads of people die as a result of their ungratefulness... They kill his unborn son... and wife... and then rip his face off. Billy Connolly is well loved in the British Isles ... I don't think he deserved such a harsh outcome. The film does have some extraordinary action sequences. Its a testament to these aging actors that they can pull off such high octane stuff."
"toddshiells","4","1","2","1 September 2015"," Looks great but left me a little flat.
","First of all before I get to the movie itself, some of reviewers here call this a ""reboot"" or ""remake"" and it is not. It is the fourth movie in the series. One earlier review stated ""I saw the original, he is supposed to have a dog.."" etc. By original I assume the reviewer meant the second (ie the most popular in the US) The Road Warrior. He/she is missing the continuing story and the point entirely.<br/><br/>Anyways, on to the movie.<br/><br/>First off the visuals are excellent as you would expect in this day and age with such a budget. Unfortunately the story itself follows the trend started in The Road Warrior, and continued in Beyond Thunderdome. In the first movie Max started out as a Police officer in a lawless but recognizable time. I personally cannot make the logic leap from that movie to the ridiculous dystopian world portrayed in the followups. I have enjoyed watching the second movie (not the third, it was just a sad Tina Turner 80's vehicle, complete with her singing the theme song) as a mindless romp, but I could never suspend my disbelief as good fiction should allow you to do.<br/><br/>That said if you loved Mad Max: The Road Warrior (as I know many people did) then you will probably enjoy if not love this movie. It feels a lot like that move with better effects.<br/><br/>I give it 4 starts because it does fit the franchise and look good, but it lost point on this story writing, some silly effects (flamethrowing guitar!?) and the lack of good character development."
"gazmar62","10","4","18","4 June 2015"," Mad Max re-imagined with a big budget ! Fantastic !!
","With a budget of nearly £100,000,000 (or should I say nearly £100,000,000 more than the original 1979 Mad Max) you would expect this to be pretty good ?! so just as well its absolutely fantastically brilliant (and barking mad) then. Tom Hardy is becoming one of my favourite actors, he is so versatile. Charlize Theron is brilliant as usual! Nicholas Hoult (yes you might say I recognise him from something) shows he has come a long way since About A Boy and there's a great bunch of baddies. The assortment of vehicles are the real stars though, they have taken the cut and shunt to a whole new level ! wacky racers look like normal cars in comparison !. I think the 3D effects were pretty good too, not overdone and well worth seeing in this format. Doesn't really compare to the first Mad Max which looks quite dated and cheap now but does resemble the better MM Road Warrior. So if you looking for nearly 2 hours of action packed fun set in a deserted dystopian future you must go see this. Defo one for the Blu Ray list this crimbo. My new favourite of the year so far."

","I am not an action movie buff. I prefer movies about average human experiences, mainly foreign movies, like the ones Iran makes.

I could not forget the movie for months, went back to the cinema and watched it 4 times. The world and the characters who inhabit it are all believable and relatable. The cinematography, the speed at which the film raced, the music, costumes, storyline, character development, it all blended perfectly. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie was seeing physically challenged characters on the screen with Furiosa and one of the sons of the Overlord. You rarely see that in todays movies. Thank you for acknowledging their existence.<br/><br/>In my 40years I have never watched a movie, any movie that has affected me the way this movie did.

"rjsf96","10","3","12","1 January 2016"," The Crowning Jewel of 2015
","For many years it appeared that George Miller had retired the Mad Max franchise which had fallen into disrepair. Well leaving the series for thirty years is bound to make it all the more difficult to return. With Fury Road, the fourth and now greatest film in the franchise, Miller is firing on all cylinders and the film is cinematic spectacle of the highest order.<br/><br/>""My name is Max; my world is fire and blood"". The opening line delivered with gusto and grittiness by Tom Hardy tells us all we need to know. A) The character's name B) This is a world we are familiar with and C) It has collapsed as a society. But enough about the ins and outs of the film, what does Mad Max: Fury Road offer in way of plot? I can sadly imagine many unengaged viewers mumbling something to the sum of ""nothing"" yet that's not at all true.<br/><br/>Remember that 80s action film? The one you loved when you were an adolescent and as an adult still do. It had a plot. A simple one, which is all that is required. Not garbage a la Resident Evil or gibberish and confused drivel with its own agendas like recent deluge White House Down. The film that was succinct, straight to the point and did not wait for any man; Die Hard, Predator and The Terminator. Chances are if you're an action fan you have seen all three or at the very least heard of them. Fury Road abides by the same principle. It's not dumbed down and it's also not a bloated mess, running at a streamlined 120 minutes. It's not three hours long because it doesn't need to be.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is the story of Max, Furiosa and the tyrannical leader of the oppressed people, Immortan Joe. The crux of it all; Max is enslaved, little more than a blood donor to the sick dying war boys of Joe's Citadel. Max breaks free and begrudgingly teams up with Furiosa who is stealing Immortan Joe's five prized wives, in search of the fabled ""Green Place"" to find rest, water and food. On this journey they attempt to outrun Joe and endure the heat of the ravaged Australian wasteland. But what makes Mad Max: Fury Road stand out from the crowd? What stops it from being the next embarrassment to cinema like Hit-man: Agent 47 or the Robocop remake? Is it at all worthy of a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, Empire's highest grade and my recommendation? In short yes. But let me explain. What's wrong with action films nowadays? <br/><br/>1. No character development. When was the last time you cared about the fate of a character? Good or evil? The emotions they harbour, the chills they give you, the love you inhabit for them. Fury Road ensures that every character counts. The five wives have their own traits and definable personalities, Furiosa is the strongest female character that Hollywood has given birth to and despite so called evidence to the contrary, Max is never overshadowed and all the characters work in harmony with one another, building upon and breaking relationships throughout the natural progression of the story.<br/><br/>2. Too much CGI. The best example; Superhero films, they look so fake that you wonder, is this what passes for realism? Miller throws CGI out of the window and pours gasoline over it for good measure. 99% of Fury Road utilises the limits of what practical effects can do. The other 1%? Colour grading and the melding of several key shots together. What you witness on screen is all real. From the rusting metal trucks down to the very dust that settles as they whizz past in and out of frame.<br/><br/>3. Sub-par acting. Or as I refer to it – The Sam Worthington Effect. Whereby the action overshadows the performances. Not that they were terribly great to begin with anyway. It's not the case here. Charlize Theron excels as Furiosa, Tom Hardy grumbles with gravitas as Max and Hugh Keays-Byrne (Toecutter from Mad Max '79) is as riveting as he is horrifying as Immortan Joe. There is no way that Miller allows this trio to get lost in the mix and he handles the performances with due precision.<br/><br/>4. Frenetic Editing. The killer of any hope of an excellent action film is all in the editing. Too many; Tak3n, The Expendables and Transformers, live or die by the hands of the edit. Fury Road doesn't just live, it breathes new life into the action genre. We can tell in any given shot, space of time or singular moment what is going on, when and why. Each frame is sped up or slowed down ensuring we never lose focus and the film throttles along at a considerable pace.<br/><br/>But wait there's more! The music is loud and hefty in the thrilling action set pieces and quiet in the subtle character driven scenes of which there are a great many. The cinematography on the other hand deserves its own review. It's a cinephile's wet dream with John Seale capturing the expansiveness of the seemingly never ending desert and the tragic note of hope that Furiosa so desperately clings to.<br/><br/>Hold on. Somethings not right. I haven't mentioned the action. Think of the most heart thumping scene you have experienced from a single film; times that by twelve, subtract awful editing and add enemies on nitro powered trucks, bikes, polecats and throw in a guitarist operating a flamethrower for good measure. That should give you an idea of what awaits you and how much adrenaline will be coursing through your veins after witnessing George Miller's action masterpiece that's the cinematic jewel of 2015 and one of the greatest action films of all time. The review ends here. There's only one thing left to say. See the movie. <br/><br/>A+"
"rasheed-abid555","10","3","12","13 December 2015"," A real man in a fictional world, supported my outstanding characters.
","When Mad Max first started off you can see the wasteland and a man. The only things you really need to see in a Mad Max film. I am going to be honest. I have never seen a full Mad max movie until this one came out. It was the stars and action that drew me into the film. Stars such as Tom Hardy( The Dark Knight Rises), Nicholas Hoult( X- Men: Days of Future Past), and Charlize Theron( Men of Honor) are this day in age necessities. When I saw the trailer I was instantly involved with the landscape of the film. When those poles had those people just hanging on and along with the intense sound its enough to buy this film on DVD. I just loved it, its a movie you can't miss."
"duh-31582","8","3","12","30 November 2015"," Modern action with old school charm.
","In today's world, action movies are chock full of bad acting, worse dialogue, and overused computer effects. Now don't get me wrong, this film has its fair share of cringe-worthy lines and some computerized embellishment, but what it brings from the long gone days of action is substance within the high octane thrills. <br/><br/>I came into this film knowing very little about the history of Mad Max and where this film fits into the timeline. But the opening scene paints enough of a picture of the dystopian world it is set in that you don't feel lost on the journey. The blinding orange of the desert makes you almost feel the dry air and blazing sun and the roar of the engines is so intense you can almost smell the exhaust. This film is a sensory immersion from start to finish.<br/><br/>The best part about the film is how deliberate each action sequence is. Too often do I see random explosions and destruction that just seem to be thrown together for the wow factor. But like a carefully choreographed dance, Miller's action sequences and fight scenes grab you and hold you all the way through. It reminds me of Fight scenes and action sequences from Indian Jones and the epic battles from Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations. You can look back and recall specific moments from these sequences that make you say ""Now that was cool."" Each high impact scene holds its own yet flow perfectly together, while still making you wonder how did they plan this out? The intentionality and thoughtfulness put into the choreography of actors, effects, and sets with the almost perfectly framed shots and fact that primarily practical effects were used make for an truly awesome visual spectacle. <br/><br/>Taking traditional action archetypes of the rebellious hero, the deformed madman dictator villain, the traitor, and the lone-gun, Fury Road fills all of the expectations you would have going into a film like this while at the same time breathes new life into them. Furiosa becomes the unexpected hero of the film and Charlize Theron's performance brings female action leads to a whole new level. Like Matrix's Trinity without the male character obsession. Immortan Joe has some of the most original villain design I have seen since Darth Vader himself, and like Vader his costume and overall design beg for his backstory to be told. Max on the other hand remains a very static tormented character throughout with really no overall effect on the plot. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of spectacles and fresh action this is the film for you. I hope this film leads to a new trend in the genre that doesn't have to do with superheroes, and inspires studios to give visionary directors the budget to pull off visual masterpieces like this more, and stray away from the stale summer blockbusters we have become so accustomed to see."

There is quite a lot of story. 1 - In Citadel you've got the haves and the have not's 2 - The military who are brainwashed and drugged up think they are working towards Valhalla, they are being used, this creates relevance and empathy for them 3 - The woman are owned as breeders, a lot of people in this society still want that 4 - A strong female lead who outshines the male lead in nearly every way but he does perform well, a good egalitarian balance overall 5 - Totally bad ass and great cinematography 6 - Guitarist was very cool 7 - Disillusionment, redemption, development of religion, comfort lies, and courage This movie had quite a lot of substance, more than I expected.

The moment the credits started rolling, however, I knew I had to see it again. I sacrificed seeing two other films so I could go to this a second time.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie that, in my opinion, everybody should see at least once. From my point of view, it is a metaphor of the world we live in today; there's violence and chaos everywhere, people fighting and killing each other over the most ridiculous things, and evil power-hungry men who claim to be messiahs and to whom the demoralized masses flock. But no matter how grim and bleak everything is, people can remain decent human beings, other more damaged people can improve themselves, and they can unite in common humanity to improve the world, even if only in a small way. The film signifies this in a subtle but powerful way, and it is some of the fastest two hours I have ever experienced in my life. I would recommend it to absolutely anybody, even the people who believed certain misconceptions of what it's about. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time."

I too would bet my money on such statement. The cinematography in this movie is out of this world. I am not kidding you, the creativity involved in filming the high-action scenes is something that will leave you impressed for days to come. The acting is superb, Tom Hardy's performance comes as a surprise in a very busy year for him. The characters and story are once again top-notch, the development actually takes a deep and philosophical route, despite the incredibly intense action , which is present in about ~85% of the movie's runtime.<br/><br/>If you like action movies even moderately, I highly recommend watching this gem, it's worth your time for at least 3 repeated viewings."
"sime-taras","9","3","12","4 June 2015"," George Miller is the the king of post apocalypse
","I have to say I could write for hours about the geniality of this movie, but I'll try to be as brief as I can.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is the new, modern Mad Max, so forget about the old sequels. The movie itself, unlike the previous sequels, doesn't go that much into the story, but instead is based on variety of characters and crazy non-stop adrenaline action. The very detail and the sickness of the post apocalyptic world is beyond comparison to any post apocalypse movie I have ever seen. I mean, nothing comes even close. The dialogs, the antagonists, the action scenes and every detail in this movie is absolutely crazy, sick and therefore perfect for this kind of a movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, I have to praise Tome Hardy. Although he is not Mel Gibson, nor is he trying to be, Tom Hardy is perfect for these kind of roles, and does very well, accompanied with Charlize Theron, a little younger version of Max, in seek of a somewhat redemption, which makes the story involve more around her and Max is a silent helper in that mission. Also, Hugh Keays-Byrne(the legendary Toecutter) is back in a new arch enemy role, and he is equally amazing as Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Thirdly, cinematography is absolutely incredible and I honestly don't know how the half of the scenes were even filmed. During the movie, somehow I remembered Stanley Kubrick's legendary Dr. Strangelove, and it seems to me that this is exactly how he imagined the post apocalyptic world would look like after the end of Dr. Strangelove. <br/><br/>To sum up, if you're a Mad Max fan it's a must see, and if you're not you're gonna have a tone of action and fun, so I encourage watching this movie to everyone.I have to say that I honestly don't believe that there will ever be a better post apocalyptic world than the one created by the amazing George Miller.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up!!"
"Joseph_Gillis","6","3","12","4 June 2015"," Great ride - shame about the script!
","Well, it looks great - and there's even more of those marvelously costumed and made-up bad guys that helped make 'Road Warrior' so memorable, albeit that, there, it was done in moderation. Naturally, it being a George Miller-helmed Mad Max movie, the editing and shots of vehicles powering down that outback highway are to marvel at, although as with a roller-coaster-ride, the best rides are when you get some relief, even if you know thrills are just split-seconds away. Cinematography-wise, it rivals Nic Roeg's 'Walkabout' in its use of barren desert - except Roeg employed thousands less people to tell his story - and more tellingly.<br/><br/>I don't know: 'exposition' is considered by many to be a four-letter word and, in cinema's case, its absence is often justified with the dictum 'a picture tells a thousand words': I'm a great believer in exposition, though, in both film and written storytelling: blanks need to be filled in, and an optimal harmony can be achieved, of show and tell. I'd read about the film's 'feminist' subtext and been somewhat wary of it, particularly when its defenders had cited Charlize Theron's 'Furiosa' heroine as being more critical than Max, himself: now, having seen the film, I don't see that as being a particular problem; at least hers is a more plausible characterisation than Sharon Stone's turn in 'The Quick and The Dead', for example. My main problem is with the basic script itself - and the somewhat muddied/half-baked feminist agenda/sub- plot: like what, really, was the journey really about, and why did they ultimately make the decisions they did; how critical were the 'travails' of the rescued Supermodels, and their pouting and dress-sense; and, especially, what was the deal with those hold-out female warriors - what, exactly, were they holding out for, and from whom; how did they survive for as long as they did. <br/><br/>With regards to basic plot elements I was put in mind of the 'Animal Farm' mantra: 'four legs good, two legs bad', in the films divide of men and women characters; and, indeed, of the nursery rhyme, 'The Grand Old Duke of York', as regards the journey; is that, really, all there is? And then there's arch-villain, Immortan Joe (a welcome return for 'Mad Max' chief villain, Hugh Keays Byrne - albeit in a different guise): How did he survive as long as he did; and surely there would have been at least one ambitious successor, waiting in the wings.<br/><br/>It looked great: it just needed even a half-decent, half-thought out, semi plausible screenplay to make the ride that bit smoother. I'll be returning to 'The Road Warrior' and 'Mad Max', but I'll pass on re-watches or the DVD of this one - unless the Director's Cut gets to tell the whole story."
"bunja-77202","9","3","12","1 June 2015"," Amazing
","i kind of had set myself up to like this film as most films of this type i like what i didn't know is how much i would like it , why did i like it so much ? simply because this is HOW! you reboot an old film series, you get the original producer/writer. all the madness of the old films is here captured superbly with the war boys and Immortan Joe, i think some people are saying this film is bad because of Tom Hardy's performance ( i disagree) while i don't think he is anything spectacular as Max, he does what is said on the tin(to convey an image of a broken man who is just surviving), what was really brilliant here though was the performance of Charlize Theron ,she outshines Tom Hardy and the film is all the stronger for her being there , the only downside to this movie is i wanted more more more!!!!"

","The timing is excellent. Social issues discussed focused on equality and the fight of the feminist movement are very well worked. Also criticism of religion and the industrial society are very strong.<br/><br/>A film that shows a couple without any sexual tension, women protagonists and sisterhood is a slap in the face of society that has its macho roots.<br/><br/>It is also necessary to point out that the symbolic language is stronger that written language not underestimating the viewer. The fast pace leaves us restless to watch fulfilling the action movie function.<br/><br/>Excellent film. Witness me."
"henryhalewood","9","3","12","30 May 2015"," 99% action - 100% awesome
","This fast paced, post-apocalyptic movie is a welcome change to your standard nowadays, cliché shoot em-up. <br/><br/>With creative vehicles, equipment and screen writing this movie is truly rather hard to fault. The movie also consists of over 90% of the effects being practical and includes multiple stunts being performed by real people that could actually be believable. Unlike having a man jump from a falling train onto the back of a Mustang with a 10 metre jump being the 'only' thing in his way! <br/><br/>This movie is directed by same man (George Miller) that directed the previous 3 Mad Max's, and helps give Fury Road that wacky, outside the box style to the action genre. As touched on briefly the vehicles themselves in this movie are a reason alone to go and see this film, with modified cars that still have the retro feel of the original movies from the 80's.<br/><br/>There have been reports from multiple fools that 'this film promotes feminism', which I must thoroughly disagree with. I myself entered the studio to watch this film with those words in mind and yet as I try recall anything in the movie involved with feminism, there was nothing at that could justify the statement. Those that say that this film promotes feminism, are only butt hurt chauvinists that would burn a poster of Lara Croft or hate someone that is Team Kahleesi in a heart beat! The second main character in this film is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who is a strong willed woman that is second in command to the main antagonist and can kicks as much ass as Max in this movie. She is the only reason that this film has been unfairly targeted for such accusations.<br/><br/>My only concern with this movie (and I must stress this is only picking at straws!) is that there is so much action in this film that there isn't really a true climax at the end of the film! I'm not saying that there's no big fight at the end (trust me there is!) it's only that in some ways you become so used to the literally MAD action in this film that you still want more and more, better and better explosions and fighting.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anyone that is considering watching this. To anyone who has seen the original 3 Mad Max's I can describe this film as, The part in Road Warrior where they're driving and escaping from the antagonist but with much more action and the driving is for the whole movie. A definite 9/10 and a congratulations to George Miller, I only hope he can keep this up and better Fury Road with the next THREE Mad Max's on the way! A hard task but certainly a possible one. Thank You for reading, I hope this has helped!"
"PeterKorcek","8","3","12","29 May 2015"," One hell of a ride!
","The cars we drive say a lot about us...<br/><br/>The recreation of the Mad Max series caught my eye by accident and after watching action-packed trailer I had to see the movie. Not only the experience was completely worth it, it also brought forward a rather unusual way of presenting a movie. Two hours lasting car chase with exploding bikes, people and twisted and tuned-up vehicles from hell interwoven with displays of hot chicks running from rotten despotic socio-psychopath, crowned by the performance of Furiosa and Max - could it get any better than that?<br/><br/>If you are a fan of experiencing new ways of film composition, or a fan of Max from the older times or just love exploding cars, heart-pounding action and post- apocalyptic crazy worlds, then this movie is highly recommended to you.<br/><br/>Ride eternal, shiny and chrome!"
"randm-09520","10","3","12","22 May 2015"," Wicked Science, outstanding MOTION picture achievement in storytelling
","Yes that is right, storytelling. In full use of his genius, i'm serious about that, George Miller created what i believe should be syllabus to anyone who is interested in the art of motion picture.<br/><br/>There is one director i put above the rest, this is personal opinion of course and that would be Stanley Kubrick. Now i have to reconsider my personal best. That alone is fantastic.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road was the first movie since A Clockwork Orange where i was a mess afterwards. On the contrary while watching both movies i was in cinema heaven. A long wait since A Clockwork Orange to encounter something like it. I never thought that an full scale action movie would give me the exact same experience. One precious surprise. Both movies are not made for everyone, but at the same time for all of us. That's my view.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road has very little exposition, most of that is in the very first minute alone. For an action movie i think this is groundbreaking, because it works perfect. Winding Refns Drive comes to mind where i think this is kinda similar. <br/><br/>The difference is Mad Max: Fury Road is constructed and filmed in a way it appeals more to the mainstream action fan. More worldwide accessible i believe. The cinematography and edit are key, they are following a plan. The camera tries to focus on the main point of interest at any given moment and while the action is really going, there are no cuts longer than 3 seconds. The frame rate is adjusted and most of the time you won't notice, it all serves a purpose. To engulf you. It's like a painting technique. If that is working you can concentrate on a lot of other things, like emotion, story and character. <br/><br/>The story is not driving from A to B and back! That i would call the linen, the canvas. The story is about a mislead man who just wants to be approved or loved, for all the wrong reasons he brings the two anti heroes of the movie together, as he crumbles he encounters something unexpected. A human, who happens to be a female, who gives him what he needed the most, just like that. <br/><br/>Big Spoiler: At first the only thing that felt forced to me was Nux falling so easy in love with Capable. After talking with my girlfriend about that scene, i feel that it is the only acceptable reaction from someone like Nux in that situation. Brilliant. Love on first sight/touch. The first time i could buy that in a movie as a guy, i can understand it completely but it needed time to click. <br/><br/>This young man stands up again, the approval of his being gives him energy, he is the one who saves all and more than one time. At least 3 times and the most important is of course his last one. He gives the movie the title after all while he foreshadows his intentions in the beginning, the result is the same, but not the meaning.<br/><br/>The sound and music is really important to here, you can hear that this is not done in hurry. It's like a high tech action opera.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are a perfect match to my view, they should both be able to acknowledge that. I'm sure there was tension while filming but you can feel the mutual respect. Out of this i believe comes only the best. I think they are fantastic together. I have seen everything from Tom Hardy so i was really exited about him being cast as Max Rockatansky and he delivers.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is outstanding here. This women doesn't need an Oscar anymore, i have the feeling she is above that nonsense and you can see that in her work. Of course no one is ever above approval(after all that's the story here), but Oscars are just business. The movie will be a classic and the actors immortal just because of this motion picture. Same goes for the team behind this masterpiece and last but not the least George Miller.<br/><br/>Chapeu 10/10"

","As big Mad max film lover. This film had everything you wanted and expected from the franchise. Apocalyptic world, Big car chases with lots of destruction, crazed lunatics creating and using some truly barbaric weapons. The film shows the different types of people living in this savage world, different tribes which makes you want to explore this world that max lives in more. Good acting all round with no annoying characters like screaming helpless girls. Same Max, same look as we left him (although new actor) and some great little nods to the original films.

"jboothmillard","8","6","34","6 June 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road
","From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated original Mad Max trilogy director George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe: Pig in the City, Happy Feet), the character originally played by Mel Gibson had been off screen for thirty years, so I was most excited to see the franchise reignited. Basically in the future the world has become a desert wasteland and civilisation has collapsed following a nuclear war. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), a survivor and loner, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to the Citadel, Max is designated a universal blood donor and used as a ""blood bag"" for sick Wild Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) meanwhile is driving an armoured war rig to collect gasoline, she drives off- route, and Joe realises that his five wives - women selected for breeding - are missing, so he leads his whole army to chase after her, with the aid of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Max continues to supply blood strapped onto the front Nux's car who is also in pursuit, Joe's forces and Furiosa's rig ensues in a battle, but she is able to evade the pursuers driving into a sand storm, except Nux who is prepared to sacrifice himself, the car crashes and Max is able to escape, dragging an unconscious Nux by his chain. Max finds Furiosa accompanied by the five wives: The Splendid Angharad (Transformers: Dark of the Moon's Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Capable (Riley Keough), Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), Toast the Knowing (Zoë Kravitz, Lenny's daughter) and the Dag (Abbey Lee), who are repairing the rig, he attempts to steal it, but the kill switch disables the truck, so he reluctantly allows Furiosa and the wives to accompany him, Nux returns to Joe. Furiosa has agreed to exchange gasoline for passage, and drives through biker gang territory into a narrow gang, but Joe's gang are in hot pursuit, the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block the path, Max and Furiosa defeat many of the bikers, but Joe's vehicle evades the blockade and attacks the rig, Nux manages to board it. The rig escapes, but heavily pregnant Angharad falls from it and is run over, killing her and her child, Furiosa tells Max that she is heading for the ""Green Place"", a location she remembers from her youth, Capable finds Nux hiding, she consoles him as he is distraught for failing Joe. At night, the rig gets stuck in mud, Joe's approaching forces are slowed by explosives, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter) continues to pursue, Nux helps them get away and Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer, Max walks away for a moment to confront them, and returns with guns and ammunition. Dawn breaks and rig travels through swampland and desert, eventually coming across a naked woman trapped in a high cage, Max suspects a trap, but calling out her former clan affiliation she summons her group, they recognise her as part of their clan, but Furiosa is distraught to be told that they have already passed the Green Place, now inhospitable. The group agree to ride motorbikes and the rig across the immense salt flats in the hope of finding somewhere to live, Max was originally going to stay behind, but following visions of his dead daughter he convinces the group to return to the Citadel, because of its ample water and greenery that Joe keeps from the survivors, and they plan to trap Joe's gang in the bikers' canyon. The group start their journey back to the Citadel, Joe spots them and realises what they are doing, they are attacked by his gang and Furiosa is badly wounded, the rig is slowed by Joe's car, while Max fights with Joe's son Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones). Toast gets captured and put on Joe's car, but Joe is distracted by her, and his mask hooked to his car's rotating wheels, tearing his face off and killing him, while Nux sacrifices himself by destroying the rig, blocking the canyon, killing Rictus, and the group are able to escape in Joe's car. Max transfuses his blood to save Furiosa and help her injuries, at the Citadel the surviving citizens are overjoyed that Joe is dead, Furiosa and the wives are raised on a platform by the War Boys and allowed to open the water gates and rinse the people, Max stays below, he and Furiosa share a glance before he disappears into the crowd. Also starring X-Men: Days of Future Past's Josh Helman as Slit, John Howard as The People Eater, Iota as The Doof Warrior and Angus Sampsonas The Organic Mechanic. Hardy gives a magnetic performance as the man who only utters a few words, Theron with her shaved head is terrific, Hoult is unrecognisable as the pale and scarred freak, and the supporting cast all do very well also. The story is simple enough to keep up with, the special effects and makeup throughout is fantastic, and the chase sequences accompanied with over-the-top violence is exciting, it is a thrill ride you will absolutely want to get on, a brilliantly entertaining futuristic action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","What made the original Mad Max great was that despite the violence and shocking moments, there was heart! You could see the motivation and the specific moments were evident that were going to change the man forever. We could understand why he chose to channel his rage and we also saw glimpses of the man that used to be.
Despite the shocking violence we still routed for him and we understood his personal pain, the evolution to MADMAX unfolded and we could relate to how a good man could go down this path.
So what happened here!! We have a character that is mute and apart from being Tom Hardy has little else going for him. There is a story, but it lacks any depth and isn't really related to our main character. It might aswell be called Ladies being chased! My advice stick to the original and Hollywood don't do a sequel!!"

","INCREDIBLE. so different, weird and creative. action is impeccable, not only great but had a very real feel to it probably because of how much practical effects and real stunts were used. surprisingly deep for this kind of movie. phenomenal original score, might be my favorite. so many intense, suspenseful and epic scenes. I was on the edge of my seat throughout. I said ""that's the coolest thing I've ever seen"" about 47 times during the movie. so much about this movie is elite: the directing, the action, the score, the cinematography, the acting by the three leads (Hardy, Theron, Hoult), the imaginative world that was created, the creativity of the characters. on my 8th viewing i was so blown away that i decided to give it my imaginary 11 star rating. only other movie i've given that to is interstellar. as of now, mad max fury road is my second favorite movie of all time. it makes me happy :) (10 viewings)<br/><br/>

","This is one of these movies that you cannot rate objectively. What I can say is that I in a long time haven't seen such masterful execution of action scenes. It's like a big puzzle which is put together rapidly in front of your eyes. Action in this movie is so great, that you sometimes can't register all that's happening on screen. Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson and Charlize Teron is great and deserves her share of praise too. In fact, far more than her ""Atomic Blonde"" 2 years later. Miller knows what he's doing and there is something passionistic in this movie. The whole idea which carries through the series of Max roaming the wasteland like some sort of a limbo, looking for redemption and hope. This is how you make a GOOD action movie. Everything is in it's place and you care for the characters. And the action will give you wet dreams. I give it 10/10 and I'm not exaggerating. It deserves it. If you haven't, go watch it and see for yourself. If I was being a nitpicker, only thing I can think of is little ""blah"" are the 3D effects, which are not needed, but like I said, it's just nitpicking."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the vivid movies of 2015. The cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel- showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime, contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night. All this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere. The score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as non-diegetically. The action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect, furthering its case as a masterpiece. Finally the acting especially that of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa is top-notch and no character is left needing further characterisation. Tom Hardy's Max is a man of little words, but the performances are so strong that the movie doesn't need dialogue in order to flourish. This movie is definitely not hyped up- go see it and then go see it again. This sequel and reboot of the classic action franchise brings Mad Max soaring vigorously back to life with a two hour action extravaganza that puts everything attempted in the original trilogy to shame. The original Mad Max trilogy was gritty and violent, but compared to the colorful landscapes"

","Mad Max – Fury Road is the best action thriller I have seen in a very long time. Apart from its unique story plot, the movie delivers to its audience something worth watching. It can be gruesome for those who do prefer soft romance and chick flicks to actual horror and adventure movies but nevertheless, it has created something exciting. And what a cast, the Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy combination is really spectacular to watch on screen. I have not seen previous Mad Max instalments so I am judging this movie purely on its own originality and performance. My praises for this movie is not enough, for those who love action and thriller movies this one should not be missed."

","Okay okay, I understand how some people are immensely disappointed in this film. It doesn't have much of a good story and the acting is dull at times. So if that's what you're looking for, move on. However, the entire movie is a spectacle, an enormous AV experience. The cinematography is top notch, with absolutely gorgeous scenery, explosions, etc. The main reason I applaud this film is for its portrayal of a whole, post apocalyptic, gang ridden world. There are leaders and armies and territories and whatnot. There is a unique cast of characters in intriguing looking costumes riding in ridiculous cars with massive weapons. In terms of the culture of the film (and the whole underlying premise and cast of characters) and the visuals, it bleeds creativity. It's stunningly beautiful. But are all the visuals and weapon/character/vehicle design worth a ten? No. Which is where the final piece comes in: the score. Junkie XL has crafted a deep, moving, EPIC score to accompany the action. The pounding drums and searing guitars melded with the string section creates a wonderful atmosphere. My favorite aspect of the movie is the giant truck with war drummers and ""The Doof Warrior"", who is a blind, monstrous guitar player strapped to the truck with bungee cords world in a giant flame throwing guitar. The whole movie is just creative genius all around."

","The five out of ten rating for Mad Max is based solely on the stunningly beautiful visuals of the desert sands which are featured almost continuously.

The pair spend two hours being chased by numerous evil bald men with a variety of weapons and exotic vehicles with gigantic tires for easy navigation through the off road terrain.

Mostly, it made it look like a cheap, direct to DVD foreign action flick.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, for a lot of the film just grunted. Throw that in with the jerky and very obviously sped up film and it was painful.<br/><br/>Finally, about 45 minutes in, the story became more interesting and compelling, but the homages seemed to cry out ""creatively"" tired. I'm referring of course to the Jawas on Motorbikes, which seems like bad fan fiction, rather than an original creation. Other images seemed lifted from ""The Dark Crystal,"" and were strange retreads of Miller's own work.<br/><br/>The few moments of real excitement and adrenaline only made the rest of the films flaws more pronounced and sad."
"luke-a-mcgowan","7","2","7","1 June 2015"," Would have worked better as a video game
","Sometimes a movie comes around that thoroughly entertains you and you've forgotten most of it when you leave the cinema. Last year, we had John Wick. In 2013, Thor: The Dark World. 2012, Taken 2. The pattern goes on. These films are endlessly entertaining, and they make for positive experiences, but they can't help but feel a bit empty, a bit video-gamey.<br/><br/>I do not mean to diminish Mad Max off the bat - its wildly entertaining and well made. But its no masterpiece and I will be firm with that from the start. I made a video game comparison with John Wick, and I feel that the comparison is even more appropriate with Fury Road. It would have worked a lot better as a video game than it did as a film. The film is relentless with its action set pieces, every single character is an interchangeable badass, and the non- action sequences play like cut scenes. Leading up to the third act, the titular Max stops Furiosa from fleeing across the desert and insists instead they should go back, through all of Joe's forces. At this point, I thought to myself ""yep, gotta go back towards the plot and the action, or this would get boring quickly"". Sure, there was a couple of bits of justification for it, but I couldn't help but feel that the action, not the story, dictated a lot of this film's direction.<br/><br/>OK, onto positives. This film excelled in every below the line category it could. Stunt action was epic. Production design was off the charts. Cinematography was unreal. Costumes and make up were world class. And those visual effects - boy those were something special. The explosions were unbelievable, and the sandstorm was truly spectacular to behold. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy did a superb job in the lead (?) role of Max. His back story is well handled and Tom Hardy brings a quiet, ruthless, crazy efficiency to the part. I also really enjoyed Nicholas Hoult as Nux, probably his finest performance to date. Charlize Theron's Furiosa was polarising for me - she displayed real grit and proved herself a capable action star, but I didn't get any sense of her as a character. She seeks redemption, but doesn't tell us what that even means. I choose to blame the writing over Theron herself, because she proves herself quite capable when the occasion calls for it. The various collection of models and strongmen who make up the supporting cast do adequate jobs, more than you'd expect of them based on their resume, but a lot of the time they don't do much more than look good. One thing I did wish is that they'd all stuck to one accent, or at least explained why some are Americans and others are Australian.<br/><br/>Much like John Wick before it, Mad Max Fury Road wasn't the most engaging of films, but the action is really superb and even more importantly, I'm very excited about the world it built. This wasteland full of post apocalyptic tribes, fanatical barbarians and crazed vigilantes is one I'd love to revisit. A sequel more focused on story and less dictated by the most action may be a less visually sating but more satisfying overall."

Like in many action movies these days, the editing just just ultra-fast, to the point you can't really understand what's going on and your eyes get really tired (combined with the theater's air condition). I can see why someone wrote that it's better to watch it in 2D before watching it in 3D.<br/><br/>The grotesque angle reminded me of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's style, mixed with ""The Name of the Rose"" (Jean-Jacques Annaud), ""Judge Dredd"" and ""300"".<br/><br/>All the audience had the same look on their face: ""WTF did I just watch???""<br/><br/>All in all, this is a decent movie. Just put your brains in neutral (no pun intended) and enjoy the visuals and the rush."

","George Miller didn't invent the post-apocalyptic subgenre. He refurnished it with the 1979 Mad Max, a low-budget piece of Australian exploitation cinema. Two sequels followed, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunder Dome, given the success and popularity of these films in Hollywood. Yet in cinema the apocalyptic genre predates Miller, tracing back as far the 1950s, if not earlier. One of the most famous examples of the post-apocalyptic genre would be Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957), which is about a knight who returns from the Crusades and faced a plague riddled medieval village. Similarly, the Japanese wastelands in Akira Kurosawa's samurai epic Throne of Blood (1957) visualise a dust laden, smoky aesthetic, which is fitting for a film made after the nuclear warfare of the Second World War. These are apocalyptic movies, Biblical in scale and tone, and along with the Western genre they undoubtedly influenced the Mad Max series. The character of Max was originally played by Mel Gibson, who himself has made numerous films about righteous vengeance. Set in a future Australian wasteland of scarce oil resources and rickety land vehicles, Max was a cop out for revenge against the men who murdered his family. He's been compared to knights, samurai, cowboys and Ronins as he travels the wasteland for work and defending villages.<br/><br/>It has taken an age for a new Max film to be developed, thirty years exactly, in which time Miller has delved with vastly different genres including children's films like Babe: Pig in the City and Happy Feet. The delays for another Max are due to both politics and personnel. Miller envisioned making a new film back in 1998 and was set to shoot the film in 2001 but the September 11 terrorist attacks and the War in Iraq canned the project. A new Max would also have to be found once Mel Gibson was deemed untouchable by most studios. Health Ledger was to replace him until he died. Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises and Locke) is the new Max, a role which tests his physical abilities but not his acting range. Hardy is an extremely diverse actor, shifting between action roles of raw physical power and independent character pieces. Last year he soared in Locke, utilising almost nothing but dialogue, and proving the power of his voice against the physical limitations of a moving a car. His version of Max is a troubled brawler, who says little even once he doesn't have a mask on his face, and is plagued by visions of his dead daughter (who has a clear Australian accent). But Hardy isn't served by interesting dialogue or personality, which puts the breaks on how much character or depth this star can employ.<br/><br/>In an unusual but welcome move for a blockbuster, the female characters here, both young and old, are constantly active and more dominant than the male star. Max's role in this episode is helping the Five Wives escape from Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), an overlord who had imprisoned them for the sole purpose of breeding. The Five Wives are hidden away in a War Rig truck driven by the powerful and gritty Imperator Furiosa. This one-armed warrior is played by Charlize Theron in an unapologetically gritty and resilient role, fierce enough to lead the film on her own. The group are pursued in the desert through a convoy and eventual collision of vehicles belonging to Joe and his cult army. One cultist is a young suicide soldier named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who later becomes an ally of Max. Pleasingly, the film is free from verbal exposition, particularly the opening scenes, where the images and the camera alone dramatise the tyranny, like the control of the water supply over the peasants. But it's far easier to tell a film through images when the entirety of the film is action and chase scenes, which leads to George Miller's filmic style: a clash of microscopic details and adolescence. There are incredible visual effects, using mostly practical stunts instead of CGI, and Miller's eye for tiny details in the costumes, vehicles and general feel of the world is admirable. But it's also visually and audibly an over- pumped movie that blares continuously at you like an unstoppable fireball. Truthfully, some set pieces are genuinely exciting like when the group must use a sniper rifle to fend off crazed bikers jumping high into the air.<br/><br/>Some have taken the time to state that the film is a masterpiece or meaningful. At most we can suggest the film is trying to be Biblical because it is about the raging fires of an apocalyptic nightmare. It could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the end of tyranny as we've seen in the Iraq War given the way a dictator is overthrown and the liberation of females. The action is praiseworthy but this isn't a new benchmark for cinema. Miller is meticulously redecorating and redressing the already existing action and apocalyptic genre or formula with his own spin or vision. A lot of imagination is on display but he's also confined by the limitations of the action genre. The villains will get their comeuppance, henchmen will die and the heroes will survive. Fury Road is all technique but sometimes you want more or in this case, maybe less."
"Geeky Randy","6","2","7","26 May 2015"," Ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money, despite its obvious flaws.
","One long battle of car chases and explosions set in a futuristic outback. Gasoline and water are apparently very valuable, but we see no character treating them like scarce commodities. There's not a whole lot of dialogue to establish what's going through the minds of these underdeveloped characters in a fictional world, but here goes a shot: At some point during a scuffle within a scuffle, Hardy and Theron team up to help the five wives of cult leader Keays-Byrne flee his wretched wasteland (no, they don't bother with trying to save any of the children or old people we saw for some reason, just five beautiful women). However, it is commendable for using CGI sparingly. Director Miller intended to make the film feel like one continuous chase, and his accomplishment is at the price of establishing interesting characters; not to mention that it's impractical for the audience to be pumped the entire time—a roller-coaster has to go up and down. The flame-shooting guitarist was undeniably savage though. There ends up being too many unintentional callbacks to Hardy's performance in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES: a mask covering the nose and mouth, blood transfusion tubing, the weakness of hope, use of a sawed-off shotgun, etc. Ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money, despite its obvious flaws.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

"craigleeburket","7","2","7","25 May 2015"," Dryworld: redemption through alliance and equal partnership
","I liked it... okay... It's visually stunning (I would expect nothing less from George Miller), and has some powerful moments, but it seems like the writers and director love their mechanical engineering and intricately choreographed mayhem more than any other parts of movie-making or storytelling. It's mostly (epic) car chases and blowing stuff (and extras) up, with occasional scraps of plot, dialog and character development tossed in 'cause somebody told them they had to.<br/><br/>But I like the idea of a character who starts out having given up on hope, love, kindness, mercy, altruism and justice, but who nonetheless discovers that ""doing the right thing"" provides him with an opportunity to quiet his own inner demons. And Charlize Theron's character (Imperator Furiosa) is great, though by now, the trope of the ""anti-damsel-in-distress"" is becoming very familiar in our ""post-hipster"", ""many-layers-of-I-see-what-you-did-there"" era. <br/><br/>I can see why this film has the Men's Rights groups' panties all in a twist, and I like it a lot better for that. But of all the Mad Max films, I still like Thunderdome (for all its flaws) the best. And of course I identify with Max, and I really like the idea that he also discovers that he can be a trustworthy ""reliable"" ally (rather than just a partisan) even in a fight that isn't really ""his"", and without being a ""white knight"" in the process -- his equal partnership with Furiosa is what I like best about the whole movie. And the very last scene, between Max and Furiosa is truly great. <br/><br/>But seeing Tom Hardy as Max, rather than Mel Gibson, is a little like seeing Chris Pine (rather than William Shatner) as Captain Kirk. Hardy and Theron are very good, but I spent the whole movie thinking things like, ""Daniel Craig? Naw... Scarlett Johansson? Naw... Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana? Hmmm, maybe..."". <br/><br/>But seriously, I think MMFR is entertainment for the damned -- for an audience that knows that we are, in real life, complicit in torture, murder, war crimes and enjoying our wealth while others starve. And we know perfectly well that the answer to the question ""Then who killed the world?"" is ""We did."". We have set the gears of climate change irrevocably in motion and now all that remains is the shouting and screaming. <br/><br/>The prospect of a nightmarish near-future ""economy of scarcity"" and dystopian society where desperation routinely brings out the very worst in human nature is no longer a stylishly cynical cautionary tale -- it has become a sort of coping mechanism -- the difference between knowing that you MIGHT get some terrible terminal illness and finding out that you actually have it."

","I went to watch this film buzzing with expectation. All the internet buzz, all those great ratings and reviews had me expecting that I'm going to watch a modern day masterpiece. Although it was a visually astonishing film, it falls short in many other aspects. It will in all probability be considered a landmark work in terms of visual effects in future, but it wasn't a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I know too much expectations always leaves you unsatisfied, but even hours after watching it, when I think about it with an open mind, my opinion about the film doesn't change. The movie is filled with amazing action set-pieces, brilliant locations, cinematography, but is that all you want from a movie? No. The biggest letdown is the story. It is disappointingly dull. Absolutely nothing interesting happens in the story. It's a century old formula; Group A trying to go from Point A to Point B and Group B is trying to stop them. It is so awfully simple that it feels like a R rated movie with a PG story. The actors didn't really have much to do, they are all good actors and did what was asked of them, but none of the performances from this film will ever be remembered for anything other than the cool actions they did. <br/><br/>If you're going to watch this film, don't make the same mistake I did.

","I have to say that Mad Max: Fury Road was not a film that excited me. After a run of similar action adventure movies that failed to deliver wasn't really expecting Mad Max to stand out. But thankfully Mad Max proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.<br/><br/>What really makes the film stand out is the fact that you have a connection with the characters. This is sadly not the case with so many of todays action adventure movies. In Mad Max you obviously have Max who lost his family in the apocalypse and wanders the world alone. It is also great that the film has a really strong lead female character Furiosa who wants to leave the citadel and head east to where she was born. To be honest Furiosa is really the lead character and Charlize Theron is brilliant in the role. The leader of the war boys is Immortan Joe who is suitably horrible. There are a host of supporting characters who are also very well explored and the great thing is that you care about what is going on during the frequent heavy duty action sequences. If you see one action blockbuster this year make it mad Max as you'll have a blast!"

But then we meet the ladies! Suddenly all begins to make a kind of sense and a ferociously enjoyable movie unfolds. I liked the action, the costumes, the pathos, the humour, the violence, the whole unstoppable caravan of carnage. Girls and even old ladies in prominent roles was a nice touch and if this sidelined Tom Hardy so be it. Charlize Theron was surprisingly good and the young ladies effective enough. Apart from my own problem with the opening, this is very hard to fault and is a most spectacular and brash addition to the Mad Max portfolio"
"spacejords","8","2","7","21 May 2015"," Basically a 2 hour action scene
","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie as my score indicates, but I don't think it's the masterpiece that people are saying it is. If you are looking for an engrossing story to go along with the action, you've picked the wrong movie. This movie is basically a 2 hour action scene.<br/><br/>There is little to no character development at all. I almost found it hard to care about the characters on screen because, well, the movie never really GAVE me a reason to care about them. The main plot is driven by the Villain's five wives, who are fleeing his captivity and abuse. But we never see the Villain actually abuse them. Perhaps if we saw something like that, saw what the wives were really going through before trying to flee, it would make everything more real and important.<br/><br/>Also, throughout the movie, Max is haunted by the ghosts of people he couldn't save but we never find out who these people are or what happened to them. Why is he so haunted by their deaths? Who exactly IS Mad Max? I think a flashback would have greatly benefited this movie.<br/><br/>That being said, the action was some of the best I've seen, and most of the movie is action. The incredible tank-like cars, huge explosions, amazing choreography for a car-based action movie, It was all very well done and exciting. The action definitely got me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I would give the story a 5/10 and the action a 10/10, averaging the total score to an 8/10. (IMDb doesn't let you give a 7.5)"

",". . . as its events take place in an alternate reality located on an unnamed planet in an island of time unconnected to any we know. This Parallel Universe seems to have a few things in common with Life As We Know It, such as men, women, and gasoline-powered vehicles. But the Laws of Physics discovered by people such as Newton and Einstein do not apply here. Nor do the Economic Principles of Malthus, or any precepts of the Natural Sciences as taught in America's public schools. (Maybe they dove-tail somewhat with Creationism and Global Warming Deniers--I wouldn't know about that.) In MAD MAX, children are only seen in nightmares, but non-pregnant women are ""milked"" by machines for so many gallons that milk baths are the preferred way to clean up. This planet's gravity is such that 100-ton trucks seem to get about 500 miles per gallon of gas. Though the landscape has less vegetation than any desert on Earth, the common folks appear to be well-fed (but are told they do NOT need any water to survive.) For entertainment, artificial waterfalls are allowed to soak into the parched landscape at the drop of a hat. The original MAD MAX trilogy made some attempt to maintain an internal logic connected to our world. This remake simply tries hard to be over the top, all the time. Some people fancy themselves to be visually oriented--this film is for them. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is ""Beyond the Thinkingdome"" for everyone else."

","Within the first 15 minutes i was hooked. I mean, what a rush. The stunts, the action sequences... mostly all in camera. Undercranked framerates that made you feel insane just watching. And then... the momentum rarely let up! It's mostly one long action scene. While the premise is simple, the dialog minimal, the acting was spot on and despite it being a Mad Max film, i think it was Charlize Theron that stole the show. Great work from the props department as those vehicles were just outrageous and wardrobe and make-up planted us firmly in George Millers post apocalyptic world and this is where the cinematography came in. Some of those shot looked gorgeous. Steering away from the rule of thirds and planting the main actor or action center frame with a backdrop of beautiful locations. Biggest credit goes to George Miller though... he has made action films feel exciting again and that amid a slew of superheros, fighting robots, hobbits and their epic battles. It really felt heartpoundingly refreshing."

","What a ride! What a lovely, demented, full-throttled, high-octane, pure adrenaline, ass- kicking, batshit crazy ride! It has taken George Miller 3 decades to come up with another chapter in the franchise that didn't just catapult him into the league of the finest action filmmakers alive today but also went on to change the entire landscape of all things post- apocalyptic.<br/><br/>And with Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth instalment & a possible reboot of the Mad Max series, Miller has crafted something that's destined to go down as one of the most electrifying, exhilarating & explosively entertaining action films of the past few decades for the frenzied madness that explodes from every single frame of this vehicular carnage effortlessly makes up for those 30 years of absence.<br/><br/>Set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland where civilisation has broken down completely, Mad Max tells the story of Max; a drifter in the desert landscape who's taken captive by the War Boys; Army of the God-like tyrant Immortan Joe & is used as a 'blood bag'. His only chance of survival is Joe's Imperator Furiosa who has gone rogue with what Joe considers his most prized assets. And so begins the chase that only the craziest can survive.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by George Miller who returns to the genre he validated with Mad Max Trilogy, Fury Road proves that despite after 30 years of gap, Miller remains the undisputed mastermind when it comes to vehicular mayhem. And by upgrading the post-apocalyptic elements for the new generation of filmgoers yet retaining the unprecedented charm of old- school action, Miller's kinetic direction succeeds in keeping the legacy of its franchise alive.<br/><br/>The screenplay doesn't involve much of verbal exposition for it's the non-stop action here that handles the storytelling part & defines the characters inhabiting this picture. The visual narration is carried out so well that it doesn't even require its audience to be well-versed in English to understand what's happening in the film. The story also has a surprising level of depth but it requires the viewers to do a bit of digging themselves if they want to find it.<br/><br/>The themes of oppression & feminism is strongly highlighted, human objectification attitude is heavily criticised, plus women in this story are no damsels-in-distress and these elements are incredibly refreshing to see since they're rarely found in action flicks. The subversion to sexism in Mad Max: Fury Road does mark the beginning of something new in action cinema & it's going to be really interesting to see where it journeys from this point onwards.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Mad Max: Fury Road is a marvel of action filmmaking. Art Direction team wonderfully brings to life Miller's vision of the desolate future, Camera-work is absolutely breathtaking for the chosen angles, movements & slow-mo shots enhance its action, use of vivid colours defies the usually desaturated look of post-apocalyptic films, every frame is captured in extensive detail & all of it is as its best during moments of action.<br/><br/>Editing also keeps the momentum going in its favour by fiercely pacing the picture & knows when to kill the switch to prevent it from exhaustion. Adding more refinement to its premise is its expertly conducted sound design that further enhances every explosion, gunshot & crashes present in the film. And finally we have Junkie XL providing the background score that keeps the film on the verge of explosion at all times with its adrenaline-rushing, pulse- pounding & dynamic tracks.<br/><br/>Still, the best thing about Mad Max: Fury Road remains its groundbreaking action for the story puts on screen some of the most dangerous, inventive & jaw-dropping stunts ever committed on film celluloid. In a time when most blockbusters rely on excessive CGI which adds nothing to the emotional content, this is one cinema that makes every bit of its $150 million budget count by embracing the old-school practical effects over CGI & keeping the presence of the latter to its bare minimum.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, the cast is led by Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron and the contribution from the supporting actors is pretty solid. Stepping into the shoes of the iconic character that once belonged to Mel Gibson, Hardy exhibits a magnetic screen presence but as far as his work is concerned, he either tries too hard or too little & whatever accent he was going for, it never works out. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron delivers a truly badass performance as Furiosa & in most ways, she's the real lead of this film.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Mad Max: Fury Road is a deranged masterpiece that does total justice to both the Mad as well as the Max part of its title and is the most complete, fully realised & unadulterated action flick of the past few decades. The insanity, chaos & destruction it puts on the screen is in a league of its own for this picture is the most action-packed, viscerally thrilling & emotionally rewarding cinematic experience any action aficionado can ever hope for. And if there's one thing Mad Max: Fury Road guarantees, it's that 2015 belongs to the mad!"

However, what reviewers seem to be forgetting is that visuals alone do not make a great movie. The only thing we know about the two main characters is that they lived a bad life and were being used as slaves. The movie follows these two characters which we know nothing about on a car chase for 2 hours, that's it. That being said, the movie felt like a car ride to the beach with relatives. Little dialogue, and not leaving the car for two hours. I believe they may have left out a back story to the characters so that they have material for a prequel in coming years.

It takes place in a post apocalyptic world sometime after the last film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It was pegged as a sequel with a loose connection to the first three, and the first to star Tom Hardy playing Max Rockatansky as opposed to Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>""In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.""<br/><br/>George Miller when asked what first came to mind for him to explain the film said its a ""2 hour chase scene"". He sure wasn't joking, besides 10-20 minutes the entire film is one giant chase scene. Its non-stop action, with different beautiful real scenic shots of landscape and some death defying real stunts. From an action standpoint its perfect even better when seen in 3d, it feels like you're apart of the heart pounding action.<br/><br/>When you dig a little deeper there are a few flaws, the big one being a complete lack of any real character development. If you saw the original three films there was a decent amount of character development, along with a polarizing of Max Rockatanskys actions, going from kind and caring to downright cruel, Fury Road lacked all of that. <br/><br/>The second big flaw is its R rating. With minimal more cuts it could have easily dropped to a PG-13 rating and it would have been fine and more widely viewed(Don't worry anyone who's timid, its barely an R). However since it was rated R already they certainly left some possible scenes that would have made the film seem more real off the table.<br/><br/>What I can say for sure is the best way to go into Mad Max: Fury Road is with an open mind, an expectation of great action, great landscape shots, and a disconnect from the original trilogy. When viewed in that light the film becomes so much more enjoyable, it almost made me wish its title and its main characters names were different, so this film could stand on its own merit and not be compared or likened to the original trilogy.<br/><br/>That being said it was a solid 8/10 as a film, but based purely against action movies as of late I would easily give it a 10/10, its non-stop, and its great. Its defiantly worth seeing in theaters, as I'm sure its viewing power will decrease when not in 3d, and certainly in home theaters. Happy Viewing!"

The reaction varied with some mockery at a few weird scenes.<br/><br/>My opinion is it's a good movie for what it is. A few scenes are out of place that make absolutely no sense. There's a weird scene that should have been cut as it isn't relevant to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Director George Miller, an old dude at 70, typifies with his style going for the weird and the grotesque. It shows up again like in the latter two old Mad Max movies.<br/><br/>I almost hesitate to see the movie because of the reports and critic reviews that reported injection of feminism especially with the author of The Vagina Monologue, a staple of college indoctrination tour (my first sister was brainwashed with this grotesque/misandric/empowerment feminist bullshit). <br/><br/>I express disappointment in George Miller for the move. Not surprising as he pulled the similar bullshit espousing atheism in Happy Feet. I saw the movie and felt that feminism is minimal so not to be detracting. Almost subtle. <br/><br/>The movie was fairly intense and riveting with constant action. Sometimes a little too much and over the top. Deserves an R rating for restrained gory violence and also the rarest R rated movie that does not utter any profanity.<br/><br/>I look forward to more Mad Max sequels, if it makes some money. But I judged the audience's reaction with my astute observation and the reception is mixed, almost muted, because of how weird the movie is. <br/><br/>I noted the underage boys (under 14) accompanied by their fathers upon exit after the movie. <br/><br/>If I were the father, I will make exception provided the child is at least 11 and able to handle the violent content.

Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a loner, drifting through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, apparently trying to avoid getting caught up in all the end-of-the-world lunacy since he's had a few too many close acquaintances die on his watch. It's ruined within moments of the film's opening when he's chased down and captured by a party of War Boys from the nearby Citadel, a desert oasis set inside a massive rock formation that's ruled through cruelty by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). When Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's prized Imperators, betrays him, Max sees his opportunity to get out.<br/><br/>FURY ROAD is insane; it's nearly two hours of mind-blowing action and car chases. We spend the first half or so of the movie on a massive car chase into the desert and the second half on a massive car chase back, with a few pauses at the very beginning and the middle for straight exposition. With no context, that sounds absolutely horrible: just two straight hours of guns and explosions and cars flipping and revving engines. On the contrary, George Miller (and this is where I feel he got robbed on the Best Director loss at the Academy Awards) tells a coherent, engaging story in a world that, while it is still Earth, is near unrecognizable to our own. I don't know what Immortan means. Or Imperator. But it's not important because I learn enough from film that I'm not bogged down with questions. Immortan Joe is the villain; Furiosa was some sort of lieutenant. She hates his guts and formulates an escape plan where she can steal his five beloved wives and they'll all run away together to this mystical ""green place"" where they can live happily ever after. Fortunately, Max becomes involved and uses his skills at murdering people awesomely to help them on their quest. You would generally assume movies of nonstop action to be mindless spectacles (*cough* Michael Bay *cough*) but Miller never forgets that an action movie is still a movie, and movies tell stories that will draw audiences in. In that sense, this isn't really a ""Mad Max"" movie<br/><br/>Furiosa is, to me, the actual protagonist of FURY ROAD. It's her journey. Her mission. We sympathize with her; we cheer her on. Max is just along for the ride. But that isn't to cheapen Tom Hardy's role in the movie. Hardy does a fantastic job with a character who's motivations are delivered through haunting flashes of memories and who's main form of communication is monosyllabic utterances. He is a major supporting role in FURY ROAD but this is Furiosa's show 100% and Charlize Theron nails it. Really, everyone does. No one in this movie is giving less than 110%, cast and crew alike. Even Rosie Huntington-Whitely, whom I've only ever seen flashing skin in the third TRANSFORMERS movie, proves that she can do wonders with the right material. She can act! If only certain other directors utilized her as more than eye candy (*cough* Michael Bay *cough*). Enough of the cast, though. Seriously, the action in this movie is bonkers. And there's none of that shaky- cam, ""can't tell what's going on"" camera style here. We're talking wide shots, full view, of practical stunts with metal beasts. There's a reason FURY ROAD won pretty much all of the production awards for which it was nominated. This movie looks amazing. The stunts are amazing. The cast are amazing. And it's a total blast to watch. If I would muster one complaint, it's that the movie pauses oh-so-briefly in the middle to let us catch our breath. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD was the biggest surprise in 2015 and a must-watch for all."
"inyz","9","3","13","12 July 2015"," Sheer action
","I was surprised to see that Fury Road was directed by George Miller, the director of the franchise's previous movies. I haven't see Mad Max 3, but the first two movies, whilst having long chases and action scenes, have nothing in common with Fury Road. This one's action is on totally different scale. The film is basically one long crazy chase with a few moments of rest for the characters, and for the spectator too.<br/><br/>Miller removed from his movie all the bullshit other action movies suffer from: romantic subplots, pointless dialogues or complicated ""origin"" stories. This results in an insane pace where the 5% of non-action is just what we have to catch our breath. The action is heavy, with explosions and destructions galore on the screen. All of this is very well-crafted and readable.<br/><br/>Another surprise was that Max isn't the main character in the movie. Furiosa, very well played by Charlize Theron, is. She's a strong and quite attaching character, who could have made for a successfully feminist movie if only all the other female characters weren't half-naked for the whole thing.<br/><br/>I also particularly liked the photography, which I found offered stunning visuals. There are different hues for different scenery, and they really give a unique visual identity to the movie. The only thing that bothered me was one scene at night which I suspect was shot during the day and then was filtered to look like night. This scene is very bright for a night and characters in it are watching the stars, which is contradictory, because you really need darkness to be able to see the stars correctly.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is clearly one the best heavy action movie of those last years."

The notion of people flocking like sheep to be lorded over by the messianic tyrant Immortan Joe is a perfect statement of people's willingness to be led even if the leader is a cruel maniac.

"gbee30","6","3","13","16 May 2015"," Meh...
","After seeing this, it apparently doesn't seem as if much has changed in 30 years. OK, It obviously has a bigger budget than any of the last 3 movies combined, and it looks visually stunning. Unfortunately this movie comes across as a standard Mad Max adventure and really isn't much different from Mad Max: The Road Warrior (1982) or Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) with Thunderdome being the most ambitious one of them all. The story to this one is very similar to the Road Warrior, starting pretty much in the same way. As the story went on, with the movie essentially being just one big chase scene, I found it rather boring and I saw myself dozing off since all the visuals I've seen done before much better in the Road Warrior 33 years ago with real practical effects and no green screen. Most of the movie to me was just a regurgitation of old visuals and ideas I've already seen. I would've preferred to see Mel Gibson return and see the evolution of the character 30 years later. So to me there was nothing new about this movie. Now even though people say this is a reboot, there is obviously a sense of continuity from the last 3 films, it just comes to figuring out where this fits in. It definitely appears to be a direct sequel to the original Mad Max (1979) since he still has a working Interceptor, the one sleeved leather jacket and the leg brace. Even at the end of the movie you can believe that he somehow recovers the Interceptor and restores it before the events of The Road Warrior since the Interceptor is totalled halfway through it. Anyways, final word, even though I was pretty psyched to see this movie, my overall reaction is meh..."
"robsta23","9","4","20","10 June 2015"," The Most Entertaining of the Bunch
","This has to be the most action-packed movie I have seen in a long time regarding movies I have seen at the theater. After watching the original three of the franchise I have to say this is my favorite ""Mad Max"" to date with the 2nd one falling closely behind. The 2nd one may overall a better movie in terms of its themes and the development of Max as a character, but I definitely enjoy this 2015 release the most.<br/><br/>Fury Road opens with Max mentioning he used to be a Road Warrior (an allusion to the second film) and we see jolting flashbacks to what seems to be his son dying in a road incident in this post- apocalyptic world. In this sense, the film seems to combine a sequel with a reboot since Max lost his family in the first film, yet the film does not reference specific moments from the earlier films other than this. With the style more focused on the action, a fast pace throughout, and more modern cinematography, I would classify this more as a reboot.<br/><br/>This movie has received a lot of hype, and while I enjoyed this movie very much I would not be so quick to judge it as one of the greatest action films of all time; I may have to see Fury Road a few times because of this. The plot is ridiculously simple at face value: one side character even sums it up perfectly by asking ""all this over a family squabble?"" Max is a loner captured by a community that resides at a place called ""The Citadel,"" and he is forced into the middle of a battle instigated by Furiosa wanting to bring the leader's several wives to a land of safety. When they realize this land doesn't exist anymore, they decide to go back to The Citadel, fighting the warriors of the community who have been pursuing them the whole time. That's it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of Tom Hardy's performance as Max. The opening voice-over sets the tone of the movie perfectly, and the voice Hardy uses even makes him sound like Mel Gibson from the original trilogy. We don't get much dialogue from Max throughout the film - which is perfectly fine - but his body language seems to only say one thing for a long while: mistrust. Max is so paranoid of Furiosa and the women she is protecting at first that he threatens them with an unloaded weapon, watches them constantly and disarms them as soon as he gets the chance, and actually fires warning shots that end up getting one of them injured. His grief is represented by the jolting flashbacks to the death of his son, which could have been handled with more subtlety as in the 2nd Mad Max.<br/><br/>Other than this, what is there to say about the action in the film other than high praise? I don't know how he did it, but George Miller was able to create many well-choreographed and carefully thought-out action sequences with little CGI and involving many various vehicles. I'd have to say the best road-based action I've ever seen takes place in this film.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films the first half of 2015 has to offer, but it is not a perfect movie. If you love action movies, then it probably is the perfect movie for you. Go see this film if you want the experience of a roller coaster."

A virtual sell-out (roughly 400 in the house), but 1/3 of the tickets were Film Society waivers, Press passes and promotional giveaways.<br/><br/>I saw only perhaps 20 minutes of this, and, it was what I expected, a noisy, frenetic, cartoonish exercise in special effects, gratuitous violence and shock value. Ridiculous, lightweight premise and totally unbelievable characters. Visually compelling, but, that was about it...<br/><br/>In this, the flick will make some good coin, because such is what puts meat in the seats these days.

I asked these patrons what they didn't like about the film, and, the general response was a ""waste of production money and talent."" All right, this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but most of these folks were Film Society people, and, as a rule, they have higher standards and more informed taste than your average moviegoer.<br/><br/>At the end of the show, some departing patrons were enthusiastic about the film, but, most who I spoke to indicated that they felt it was merely a somewhat better-than-average actioner, nothing more. <br/><br/>Caveat emptor.

","Seeing the teaser of this film I rolled my eyes at the thought of another reboot offending cult classics and violating nostalgia with over the top CG and mundane acting. Charlize Theron; one of the best character actors of my generation, brought me to give this film a chance. Ironically, redemption being a driving force in Fury Road, redeemed the negative stigma I've attached to reboots. Fury Road seamlessly pays homage to all Mad Max films while standing as a separate entity for those who aren't familiar with the previous films.<br/><br/>Furiosa: Charlize Theron, and Max: Tom Hardy are both trying to escape a tyrannical leader, Immortal Joe. Max is taken to be used as a ""bloodbag"" for ""war boys"", most likely unhealthy because of the toxicity left in the land. Furiosa is introduced as the leader of a war boys attack convoy, and at the plot point shows she's smuggling away beautiful women used as sex slaves for Immortal Joe and his top men. Max eventually commandeers her war vehicle and together they must escape the ridiculous amount of road warriors sent to retrieve Immortal Joe's ""breeders"".<br/><br/>Fury Road is nonstop action from start to finish. The imagery is absolutely amazing. The road warriors/war boys weapons, vehicles and costume design mesh cult and industrial wonderfully. There is very little dialogue between characters and somehow they still pull off a strong character arc and semblance of a deep back story. The Male/Female roles are blended well. Furiosa is androgynous with her war torn body and shaved head but didn't shove the feminism theme in our face. Survival overshadows those themes, they help each other equally. The war and action can be over the top and unrealistic but It is done so well it works. I was very impressed by Fury Road. It moves in a straight line but still manages to have some depth.

"rcolgan","9","3","14","8 June 2015"," What a lovely film!
","It's been 30 years since George Miller last showed us the insanity of his post apocalyptic Australian wasteland, with the long gap partly being due to the film's production being almost as chaotic as the world the film is set in with the film is set. It had many difficulties including being stuck in development hell for years, filming being repeatedly delayed, and difficulties in securing locations to shoot the film. Miller had plans to do the film as far back as 2003 with Gibson intended to reprise his role but took a further 10 years before tuition. But fortunately Miller persevered through all this turmoil to once again to return to the driver's seat of the franchise and create this masterpiece that is his best film yet.<br/><br/>At the start of the film we watch as Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by an army known as the War Boys ruled by a dictator known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Shortly after being captured one of Joe's soldiers called Furiosa (Theron) drives off in an armoured fuel truck with his wives so that they do not have to bare the children of a monstrous man and tries to drive to her childhood homeland. Because of this Joe sets out with an army to chase her down and Max is used as a blood bank attached to one of the chasing cars. Eventually after freeing himself he joins Furiosa and helps in fighting off the legions of War Boys sent by Joe in a non stop chase spanning the entirety of the film. <br/><br/>And when I say non stop chase, I mean non stop chase. From the very opening of the film to the end they don't go 5 minutes without some exciting action sequence with almost the entire scene being part of some chase or fight scene. Whilst under a lesser filmmakers control such action could be repetitive, Miller keeps it original by varying the action sequences and the beautiful scenery making it a masterpiece to watch.<br/><br/>Also the action is all so well made. In contrast to a lot of recent blockbusters like Fast and Furious, most of the film is done with practical effects and stunt work with CGI used very sparingly making for a much more high octane and realistic action sequences. They pull off everything in this film flipping cars, people dangling from or even jumping between speeding cars and even being engulfed flames. It's hard to tell who's more insane, the people coming up with these incredible stunts or those who take part in them. The scale of the stunts alone is impressive, but the consistent creativity and range of the stunts within the chase should keep any fan of action gripped to the screen. <br/><br/>On top of the mayhem of the chase sequences, the entire world is absolutely insane. It's strange to think that the same mind to create the likes of Happy Feet and Babe: Pig in the City also creates a world like this with the likes of woman having their breasts milked as a resource, a legion of pale thrash metal dressed soldiers and vehicles ranging from a tank plated gas truck to a barge led by a guitarist who shoots a flamethrower out of his guitar. It's a compliment to Miller's imaginative style that he can create such a bizarre whilst progressing the story and having constant action. <br/><br/>Beyond carrying out incredible stunts, the cast also give some impressive performances. Tom Hardy does a great job filling in the dusty leather jacket as Mad Max. We're quickly reintroduced to him at the beginning of the film so newcomers to the franchise are familiar with his back-story with Max explaining how he lost his family and blames himself, with their loss leaving him with nothing but the instinct to survive. Oddly this short explanation of his character is the most that Hardy speaks in the film. Instead of dialogue Hardy conveys most of his character through his look of exhaustion as a man who has been through far too much. <br/><br/>Then there's Theron as the metal armed and strong Furiosa who is amongst the likes of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Michelle Yeoh in Supercop as one of the best female action heroes. She often steals the show in the film as a more human character than Max, although just as dangerous as he is at one point even brawling him and showing herself to be just as deadly and resourceful as he is. There's a great deal of mystery to her back-story, with most of her history just being hinted upon. Also similarly to Hardy, Theron communicates so much through her hardened look showing herself to be the product of the destroyed world in which they live.<br/><br/>I just love everything in this movie. I love the detail in the way that all of the cars are adapted for the desert environment. I love the beautiful bright cinematography. I love that the chase lasting from start to end never for a second loses steam. Miller's imagination mixed with an incredible crew has created a glorious Symphony of madness and violence unlike any that had come before it. Apparently Hardy has already signed on for three more Mad Max films and with Miller's creative mind behind them they'll definitely be something to look forward to."

","A master-work of visual story-telling, Fury Road tells its exciting, satisfying tale with intense, emotional action, very little dialogue and almost no exposition. It's been so many years since I saw the original trilogy that the only things I really remember are Mel Gibson's hair and sand. Because Fury Road was meant to stand alone, there's no need for the audience to know all of the nuances of the Mad Max mythology to appreciate or understand the story here. This is a ""long chase"" movie, but it's also a legend about a man who has lost it all, been driven mad, and has to find his way back to himself. See the movie for the story, the characters, and for the feeling of immersion into this wasteland of a world."

","This movie was amazing. Great use of both CGI and practical effects. You get to see Toecutter's eyes bulge in a flashback. Story is fairly simple, but doesn't try to be more complex than it is. Lots of characterization through actions as opposed to endless amounts of dialogue (looking at you, Avengers and Nolan Batman movies). Makes the over the top scenes seem fairly normal, which is amazing considering some of the crap in there (namely a freaking flamethrower guitar which is used not only in the scene shown in the trailer). There are breaks in pace in the movie; however, they are welcomed as you sit through some very long action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. These scenes act as a breather and a chance to get to know more about the characters. The action is well done and intentionally over the top. It was a great experience and I would go see it again given the chance."
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","8","3","14","2 June 2015"," An Absolute Joy
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth film of Miller's Mad Max franchise and the first film of the franchise in 30 years. Fury Road stars Tom Hardy as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, replacing Mel Gibson in the title role. Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, and Hugh Keays-Byrne also star. <br/><br/>Stunning, explosive, non-stop post-apocalyptic action for 120 minutes is an accurate yet perhaps slightly misleading description of the film, as with Fury Road, writer / director / producer George Miller has achieved far more than mere action proficiency. So rare with contemporary action films, the relationship between practical effects and CGI is balanced faultlessly, the like of which I haven't seen since Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. There's an equilibrium between the two and at times they both appear to blur the lines between one another – on multiple occasions I assumed that certain sequences simply had to be CGI, yet I now learn many sequences were just incredible pieces of stunt work and loving production design. The greatest testament to this balance is that all of the these conclusions have been drawn much later after watching the film, as during my viewing of it my mind could function little except from being simply blown away by the incredible spectacle Miller managed to create.<br/><br/>Paraphrasing Hitchcock in 2014, Miller light-heartedly suggested that he wanted Fury Road to be understood in Japan – without the use of subtitles. Now, writing as a teenager in rainy North-East Hampshire, I can offer little to demonstrate if Miller has been successful in his aims, yet I find little to suggest he failed. Compelling performances are universal, it doesn't matter if the language is spoken in English, Arabic, Cantonese or Portuguese, a good performance can transcend any language barrier, and Miller certainly has that in his ensemble cast. It seems impossible for Tom Hardy give a disappointing performance recently, but the true star of the film is Charlize Theron who gives a wonderful performance as the character Imperator Furiosa, combining raw physical strength and brutality with a core of emotional sensitivity.<br/><br/>Beyond performances, I feel like the film will be universally understandable simply because of the themes which are explored so delicately and overtly. The themes of survival and family are universal and are the driving force beyond a narrative which doesn't stop for a second's breath. The film pays homage to some of the classic American Westerns of the past, yet the comparisons I've seen comparing it to Road Runner seem just as astute to me. For me, it's somewhere in-between."

","Having seen the trailers that described George Miller as a ""mastermind"" (he, the same director as Happy Feet), I was a little sceptical to say the least. And this film had been so long in the making, beset by so many production problems, it made you wonder what on earth was going on. Worryingly endless re-edits left fans thinking whether, at best ,they could come up with something worthy of all the hype and anticipation or at worst if the whole project was to be doomed. Don't know. And don't care. Because in the end Fury Road has turned out to be, for me at least (a big fan of the original and its first sequel, not so much Thunderdome) one of the greatest action films I have seen in 10 years. Forget any unfair comparisons with Michael Bay's formulaic churn and the like, this 'mastermind' has - and I'm not saying this lightly - completely and utterly re-written the rule book on big screen action and sheer crazy spectacle. I was aghast, thrilled and ultimately exhausted by the end of this film. Some of the set pieces, coming across like a strange mix of classic Max, a French circus, Duel and the Air Cavalry attack from Apocalypse Now, were astounding. But knowing that all were crafted without the help of CGI, something you can really 'feel' across this raw untarnished vision - left me even more bewildered with delight. True, Tom Hardy's Max isn't central to the piece in terms of dialogue and probably actual minutes on screen - I reckon Miller has, quite rightly, let the Max 'world' take centre stage. There's so much to see; new bizarrely wonderful things combined with clever evocative icons and nods to the past trilogy, that to have the-always-bloody-brilliant-Hardy dominate might have overshadowed our re-introduction (sequels? yes please now!) to this Miller universe. In any case, what Max does have to say or has to do is so flipping cool, its all a case of very well written less is more. Ultimately this is a film that deserves to be watched again and again - big screen, very loud. There's only a small band of directors who make films that I can watch again, again and again, and yes I would call the likes of Tarantino and Scorcese masterminds. I think George Miller is one of them too now."

"Acrix","4","2","8","5 February 2017"," An abundance of mindless action, and that's it
","Ah! Fury Road! This movie was received with a lot of acclaim from both the critics and the general public and was hailed as the best movie of the year. And the thing this ""masterpiece"" does right is to drive across a desert and back using practical effects instead of CGI and have lots of explosions around. Apparently that's all it takes for a movie to be called great nowadays. Yeah, just show a real piece of sh*t on the floor instead of having it be a computer graphic and voila! It's no longer sh*t anymore! Sorry, but it takes a lot more than that to call a movie great, or even good, at least by my books. When I sit down to watch a movie people call 'good', the things I at least expect are a good story and characters (that's my main requisite). Aside from that, I expect to see some good acting, some nice ideas, variety in individual aspects(such as action/comedy, etc), or something different from the norm! Mad Max Fury Road has none of any of these things.<br/><br/>Now, I am willing to buy the excuse that this was a pure action film and things such as good story were not that important and what was more important was the action. The action was fine but there was nothing too amazing about it. It mostly consisted of blowing sh*t up thereby causing some big explosion here and there. A few guys come, attack with some guns,crash vehicles into each other, boom, and repeat. I'll give the film credit for it's use of practical effects and that definitely enhanced the experience but there was never much else for me to care about. Especially because the villains were mostly faceless moo-ks and the whole thing could have been over if they had just opened the oil tanker, put a lit matchstick inside it and run away.<br/><br/>Now I am normally okay with things such as plot conveniences as long as they are not overused and the characters reach some catharsis in the end or the story ends in a (at least) decent way. But, there was none of that in this entire movie. In fact, what threw me off was that they didn't even bother to introduce anything to us properly before rushing into the action. We are told that there is this guy called Max who was taken and there is this Joe guy who is a king of some sort and he mistreats his people (and yet has some incredibly loyal servants, never explained why) and then one of his soldiers kidnaps his...damsels in distress, I guess and then they all give chase to him with a huge amount of cars. All this happens in less than fifteen minutes and then they dive straight into the action.<br/><br/>I seriously wish that they had spent at least some time in fleshing out the setting or helping us get to know the characters and give them some personality, but all we know is that Max has a bad past, the soldier is rescuing those women and the Joe guy is evil just for the heck of it. Now I don't know about you but that is just not enough to get me to root for them. Even so when we know nothing about the damsels of distress (I didn't even know any of their names!). Another thing about them was that one could change their genders aside from the pregnant one and it wouldn't make a difference. And I'm talking about all characters, by the way.<br/><br/>Which leads me to this great theme of feminism everyone was talking about because Charlize Theron's character plays the soldier and she fights a lot and she is the actual main character (instead of Max who's just kinda there, I expected more from him given that the title contains the words Mad Max). She's the one who does most of the things and is like a leader figure and she's really praised for it. The problem? You can't think of her as a woman. She is stripped of everything that makes her a woman. I really don't see how any of that can be called feminism when you strip a woman of her femininity. Same goes for all women in the story.<br/><br/>So, if you don't dig the constant explosions that are happening every few minutes, you won't enjoy this movie and you'll probably be looking at the clock, wondering when this whole ordeal will end. The performances were alright, although nothing too noteworthy. The plot was basically a group of people being chased across a desert(that sums it up!). The characters were lifeless and forgettable. The themes are either a mess or are unexplored. There was very less effort placed into setting up the world or anything in it. Honestly, the only credit I can give this movie is for it's effects.<br/><br/>For all I care, Mad Max Fury Road is overrated garbage. I could keep going on about it's problems but I'll stop right here. I can't really say I hate it, but there is no way I can recommend this movie to anyone who wants more from a movie than mindless action."

"rblenheim","10","2","8","4 March 2016"," George Miller's full-throttle magnum opus is one of the finest films of the action genre
","Mad Max: Fury Road"" is 70-year-old Australian George Miller's magnum opus, and the crowning achievement of his ""Mad Max"" saga which previously comprised three earlier films made between 1979 and 1985 with Mel Gibson playing the lead. The first two, ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" were rather cheap independent films that built a cult; the third one, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunder-dome"" was a misguided expensive film that aimed but failed to do what ""Fury Road"" succeeds at. This one is a totally mad adrenaline-rush of an action film that will not only leave one breathless by its over-the-top stunt-filled explosive sequences, but, whether a fan of the older films or not, viewers should be blown right out of their seats in awe at the poetically-perfect execution of its filmmaking brilliance.<br/><br/>But what makes it even more special, and what truly earns it the masterpiece epithet, is the creation of the richest and most memorable female action character since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa. Standing statuesque and sporting one metallic arm, she is a macho man's wet dream of an amazon warrior, but underneath her fierce exterior is a sensitive woman with a heart that beats with compassion. What's more, she is the film's true protagonist, and leaves the character of Mad Max (played this time by Tom Hardy) as a second fiddle. Half way through the drama it should be apparent to most viewers that this movie, purportedly a violent, super-action testosteronic spectacle displaying more snarling body-painted warriors and explosive pyrotechnics than a Hell's Angels' nightmare, is actually a hyperbolized portrait of an independent woman's rebellion from a male-dominated world. In that sense, Miller has created a Trojan horse that puts down the very values it pretends to espouse, and helping to confirm this is a little-known fact that Eve Ensler (writer of ""The Vagina Monologues"") was consulted in the film's portrayal of its female characters. What's more, every aspect of this film, from its film editing, production design, costumes, sound editing & mixing, is on a par with the greatest action films of all time. But, believe me, this is not just for violent action fans -- it's for every one who loves great filmmaking."
"Tweekums","9","2","8","24 January 2016"," Completely bonkers non-stop action!
","In a post-apocalyptic world ex-cop Max is captured by a group known as the 'War Boys' who work for the tyrant Immortan Joe. Taken to their Citadel he finds himself used as a blood supply for Nux; a sick War Boy. When one of Joe's senior lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa, frees his 'wives' and drives into the desert in her war-rig the War Boys give chase accompanied by Max who is chained to one of their vehicles. After an initial confrontation Max frees himself and joins forces with Furiosa. Together with Joe's wives they head east hoping to find the Green Place. It won't be easy as Joe and all of his War Boys as well as their allies are in pursuit; he is determined to get his wives back and punish Furiosa for her treachery.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something deep and meaningful this isn't the movie for you however if you want non-stop adrenalin-pumping mindless action then prepare to have a great time. Little time is wasted on exposition before we are thrown into the action which barely lets up till the film is over. The plot is fairly basic but that doesn't matter. The film looks great; I was immediately stunned by the burnt orange desert landscape in which the action takes place. That action is thrilling as it constantly looks as though things go badly for our protagonists. Tom Hardy does a fine job as Max but it is Charlize Theron who dominates the film as Furiosa; her character is more interesting than Max as it is her motivations that drive the narrative; Max is a victim of circumstance who finds himself along for the ride. As one might expect there is a good variety of strange vehicles and even stranger characters. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for insane non-stop action; it is certainly a welcome addition to the Mad Max series of films."
"kjarvis1212","10","2","8","10 January 2016"," ""Perfect In Every Way!""
","When it comes to George Miller's rip roaring, pedal to the metal action powerhouse Mad Max: Fury Road, the question truly is whether or not it's the greatest single action film ever made. Miller, who of course directed the original Mad Max trilogy that helped launch Mel Gibson's career into orbit, picks up right where he left off by creating a barren, unforgiving desert wasteland, inhabited by a variety of gangs and tribes in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world. The movie begins with our hero, Max (Tom Hardy in a brilliant, likely career-changing role), looking out over the desert, thinking about his former life as a cop, and how he's haunted by the souls of those he wasn't able to save. Without warning, Max jumps in his rig and speeds off into the sand, only to be chased by a pack of shirtless, skin-headed marauders, or ""War Boys."" Max is captured and brought to the Citadel, where the larger than life, scary as hell ""Immortan Joe"" looms over his clifftop perch to deliver a booming message to thousands of peasants. He's sending crews out for supplies, bullets, and so forth, and he wants to see them off in style (apparently). This is where we meet Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who is leading one of the convoys in her imposing ""War Rig."" But as the journey begins, Immortan Joe discovers that Furiosa has taken something from him that she does not plan to return, and all hell breaks loose. Before long, Max and Furiosa become reluctant partners as they struggle to survive a full- throttle, fuel-injected game of cat and mouse. To call Mad Max: Fury Road an action picture isn't even really doing it justice. Consider the most intense action film you've ever seen. Now multiply it times 10. I'm serious. I love me a good action flick, but I've never seen anything like this. Of course there are some effects that are undoubtedly CGI, but from what I've read about the production of the film, a surprising number of the unreal, heart-pounding action scenes were actually performed by actors and stuntmen. Take for example the scene in which Immortan Joe's posse has just about caught up to Furiosa. Leading the pack is a knucklehead war boy named Nux, who we're led to believe is dying of a fairly common but deadly blood disease. In order for Nux to do this without getting sick, he needs a ""blood bag"" or, in this case, Max, chained to the front of Nux's rig with a blood line literally intertwined through the chain links. Furiosa sees a sandstorm up ahead, and heads straight for it. The buildup to this scene, and the way the action unfolds on the screen as the chase rockets into the storm, are film making at its finest. Action cinema does not get better than this. Now, it would be one thing if we were simply lured in by groundbreaking action sets and scenes. But where this film really delivers is the emotional connection it creates between the viewer and the protagonists. There is a cautious but healthy respect between Max and Furiosa, especially as they each come through when the other needs them most. By the end, we believe in their bond, and perhaps our throats even tighten up a little when our two heroes acknowledge each other with the simplest of gestures. The cinematography is also of the highest order. We get a real sense of place and scope of the environment the story takes place in. Ariel shots that gradually pan downward upon a frenetic chase scene are extremely effective, especially aided by a thundering soundtrack that in some cases is literally part of the action. Make no mistake; Mad Max: Fury Road is that rarest of rare treats, a landmark film that will undoubtedly set the bar for the action genre for years to come. To put it simply: ""perfect in every way!"""
"zordmaker","10","2","8","1 January 2016"," It finally happened
","OK. here we go again. Reviewing a movie to which I was a bit too close.<br/><br/>Never have I seen a movie that so polarizes the viewer. You will either love or hate this flick.<br/><br/>Lets set the scene. This movie was largely dreamed up in the late 1990's,when George was producing the Babe sequel in Sydney. Working alongside him on the pleasant ""Babe Pig in the City"" were the other two notables that laid the foundation of Fury Road: Production Designer Colin Gibson and (while some may argue with me on this) Chief Mechanic (and partner in crime) Mark Mc Kinley.<br/><br/>By the early '00s the location had changed to Namibia (which put it out of my reach) and production had actually commenced over there. Then came ....9/11.<br/><br/>The Mad Max project was immediately mothballed. It was felt that such a film would not be critically accepted so close to such a cataclysmic loss in the US. It took another 10 years before Fury Road would finally rise to the top of the pond again.<br/><br/>As much as you read MM:FR as George's film it was always Gibson's baby. Colin had done so much for George in the past. He stuck it out with Miller when everyone else had long lost patience and left. MM:FR was George's way of finally letting his kids into the lolly shop.<br/><br/>MM:FR has Gibson and McKinley written all over it. So much so that some times I wonder if George even had anything to do with the film at all. That could be why the film polarizes viewers so easily.<br/><br/>MM:FR is what happens when the crew get to make the film THEY want to make while the director sleeps it off somewhere. And it stands as testimony to that and that alone. From the earliest days of Gibson's work on ""Reckless Kelly"" and ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", MM:FR is the culmination of all those pub discussions that have happened since. The 'Wouldn't it be cool if we could do this..."" moments.<br/><br/>And now they have. In Mad Max, Fury Road.<br/><br/>It's perhaps no coincidence that the abbreviation MM:FR is so similar to another one of Gibson's early films, MM:PR (""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers""). Viewers of one are likely to like the other. They both represent what happens in film making when you pull out all the stops, let things freewheel, and just allow everyone to go mad..<br/><br/>When it comes to Mad Max Fury Road my advice is to go into the cinema with the same attitude that the film makers had when they made it.<br/><br/>""Go hard or go home""!! <br/><br/>P.S. I met and first worked with Colin Gibson on the aforementioned 1995 vintage Power Rangers movie (which at the time was the film that I WANTED TO MAKE). Now Colin you finally got to make the film that YOU WANTED TO MAKE.<br/><br/>Well done mate.We can all retire now.<br/><br/>Paul M"

","Mad Max Fury Road is by far the best movie of the year and one of the best movies in history of cinema.An insane movie filled with amazing looking action,great acting and overall very intense.This movie has it all. Everything about the way that the action is directed is perfect,all the time the main character is in danger and you never know how it will end.There's a guy playing the guitar during all the action,that's just freaking insane. Tom Hardy does such an amazing job here,he fits on the movie perfectly and Charlize Theron is also very very good on the role.Also there's a certain amount of heart to the characters that makes you love them even more.It's not just brainless action,it makes sense and it's done beautifully. George Miller is back to show us how to do action in the best way possible.He built this movie in practical effects and I appreciate that even more.Cars flipping and real explosion over the top makes the movie even more insane. I really can't think of a negative about this movie so I'm definitely going to give it a perfect 10/10 rating and deservedly so. Go see this movie if you still haven't,I personally can't wait to re- watch it and experience this amazing craziness all over again."
"jeldridge-28771","10","2","8","17 December 2015"," A Great Film in a Cult Series
","First and foremost, I assure you that this film definitely deserved the ""Best of 2015"" award. Not only because it was a special effects and action epic, but also because of the story that it tells.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the fourth installment in the infamous and critically-acclaimed ""Mad Max"" series. At the time of this posting, I haven't been able to find justification for this assumption, but I believe that the film takes place between ""Mad Max 2"" (AKA ""The Road Warrior"") and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" Tom Hardy (Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises"") stars as the title character, ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky. If there's anyone that I can imagine taking over for Mel Gibson for the film and character that made him famous, it would honestly be Hardy.<br/><br/>The film is an absolute epic of action film making, with high-speed chases, explosions, gun fights, and an apocalyptic electric dust storm. Despite some of the scenes being enhanced with CGI elements, the ""making of"" featurettes of the film showed that there were not that many CGI sequences in comparison to actual on-camera stunts and effects. That proves that the best films are honestly made not by computer generated effects, but with real in-camera effects. It actually made the film seem more dangerous just to watch, almost like you're participating in the chases and fights.<br/><br/>What was the best part of Hardy's acting performance is the fact that he did not have that many speaking parts. He almost had no lines in the first 45 minutes of the film. Rather, he was attempting to battle his internal madness (no pun intended). I think that this subtle portion of Hardy's performance is what ties it in with the first film, when Max tells his Main Force Patrol supervisor Fifi that he feels like the only thing separating the bad guys from the good guys is the badge on his chest and that he's starting to be in tune with the madness on the streets. This is a powerful non-verbal statement that's expertly portrayed by Hardy.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, the piece of the film that was most surprising was the integration of a mainstreamed Hollywood powerhouse actress like Charlize Theron. Even though she is no stranger to big budget independent-style films (i.e.: ""Monster,"" ""Aeon Flux,"" and ""Prometheus,"" to name a few), her appearance shows that she still has what it takes to step outside of the Hollywood main-stream and make a great film that not only marches to the beat of its own drum, but doesn't need a main-stream storyline to be successful. Her character - the bald-headed Imperator Furiosa - had depth of her own right and was a great character for a great character actress like Theron.<br/><br/>In all, this film deserved all of the nominations and awards that it was presented. The film is a standard example of in-camera effects movie making and should be looked at as a great action film with a lot of depth in the characters. If you are a fan of the ""Mad Max"" films, please go see this film. If you've never heard of ""Mad Max,"" my strongest suggestion is to get acquainted with at least ""Mad Max"" 1 and 2 before seeing it so you know what's going on. But, nonetheless, this film needs to be viewed by anyone who has a love with good ole, unadulterated action."

Even the actors who made up the rest of Immortan Joe's War Boys done a fantastic job.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot praise this film enough, and if you have not seen it then what are you waiting for?!

It is action packed from start to finish. Constant battles and chase scenes for 2 hours. It has an identity and it stuck to it.

","I'm going to start by saying that if you've read one 'Mad Max: Fury Road' review, then you've read them all, so feel free to skip this, but I will do my best to prevent the words 'adrenaline', 'rush' and 'action-packed' from appearing often.<br/><br/>That being said, what can you really say about 'Fury Road'? The story and characters are so simple and immediately understandable that there's nothing to say other than 'it was amazing'. The action sequences were beyond incredible, especially considering the lack of CGI used. The atmosphere is beyond indescribable, invoking emotions without even needing to say anything. The film can simply show you an image and you'll have an emotional reaction.<br/><br/>Actors: Tom Hardy does a masterful job as Max, with Charlize Theron being equally masterful as Furiousa. The other actors do their jobs fine, with Nicholas Hoult being a surprisingly tragic character, and Hugh Keays-Byrne being a perfectly grotesque villain. Story: as said, simple and understandable, a desert-wide chase of epic proportions. Visuals: Visually, I can't think of another film that looks quite like 'Fury Road'. It's a post-apoc world, sure, but it's so colourful and so bright, it almost looks happy. The sand is yellow, the sky is blue, the blood is red, it all stands out so perfectly from everything else. Sound: cleverly mixing an actual soundtrack with the in-world music of drums and electric guitars being played upon entering battle, 'Fury Road's soundtrack. Genre: As said, the action in this film is incredible. The majority of the stunts were practical, which makes certain scenes even more entertaining."

The film looks wonderful, almost like a beautiful painting which moves. The cinematography and the use of colour is wonderfully excited and made me feel like I was in the world this movie created.

The action in this movie is intense and adrenaline field with fantastic stunt work that keeps your eyes fixed on that screen. This movie is fantastic and I would recommend to everybody, if you hate this movie, shame on you.<br/><br/>The ""reasons"" people seem to ""hate"" this movie are as follows. ""The acting is bad"" They say. ""Just because the actors use their body movement to express emotion in this film requires tons of skill from talented actors, you can't just a character say 'I'm sad' to show that they are sad, it is shown with their body movement and their facial expressions"" I retaliate with. ""There is no story"" They say. ""There is a story, it doesn't have the a million subplots like every Hollywood feature ever. Also it is told in movie language which involves using images to tell a story. The only people who don't understand this are either really stupid or are blind."" I retaliate with. ""It's just a bunch of explosions"" They Say. ""Don't all action movies with guns and cars have explosions in them."" I retaliate with. ""There is no character development"" They say. ""What are you, blind? Their is plenty of character development, it's just not done with a 30 minute monologue like in every movie ever *Cough* Avengers *Cough*"" I retaliate with.<br/><br/>This movie overall is a fantastic action movie and the only reason people ""hate"" this movie is because the want to be cool and they want attention.

","Super Film Ever they exactly show us the what will the world be in future. but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. Miller is the real star of the film -- in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style, and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants, however he wants.Great film, so fast-paced it makes every other film out there look slow and old-fashioned. Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad,"

"thecinematicaddicts","9","2","8","12 September 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road (SPOILER FREE)
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the forth installment in the Mad Max franchise and is directed by George Miller, who directed all of the previous Mad Max movies. This movie stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult.<br/><br/>In a post apocalyptic world where water and gasoline are scarce, Furiosa (Theron) kidnaps a crazy warlord's ""wives"" to set them free. She is pursued by hordes of the warlord's followers, called War Boys. Along the way, she encounters Max Rockatansky (Hardy) and together they struggle to escape with the newly freed wives.<br/><br/>Full of nonstop action and mind-blowing practical effects, Mad Max: Fury Road was an incredible film. George Miller returns to continue the franchise at age 70 and still creates a thrill ride of a movie. The director's use of practical effects, caused the movie as a whole to be elevated. Visually, this movie was perfect. There wasn't one flaw. Audiences were pulled into the world of Mad Max and didn't relax until credits rolled.<br/><br/>This movie should have been titled ""Furiosa: Fury Road (and Mad Max is there too)"", but audiences got Mad Max: Fury Road. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the backbone of the of this film. She the most interesting and driven character in the film, even more so then the title character. Charlize Theron perfectly displays the Furiosa's desperate drive for freedom. Female audiences finally have a strong female bad-ass character that doesn't take crap from anyone. But the writing for this character doesn't form her as a stone cold killer. There is a scene where Furiosa breaks down and Charlize Theron is given a chance to express all the rage, depression, and conflict that has built up inside her character. Furiosa is a breath of fresh air in the action genre.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes over the role of Max Rockatansky from Oscar Winner Mel Gibson. There was a lot of anticipation to see if Hardy could live up to the shadow cast by Gibson. Although Max wasn't the main focus of this addition to the franchise, Hardy delivers a convincing performance that stays true to the character created by his processor. Max's character in the movie acts as great support for Furiosa and deepens her for the audience. The main attraction for Max in this movie is that he is a familiar character that fans of the previous Mad Max films can recognize and root for.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult plays the War Boy Nux in this film. Hoult's character is a new and innovative idea: the audience gets a clear view of the enemies Max has been fighting for all these movies. Nux (Hoult) had a great development as a character and we could see him change throughout the film. Hoult managed to display conflict inside his character with very limited dialogue. He created a whole new side of the villains that the previous Mad Max films couldn't. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece of practical effects and amazing stunts. The action in the movie is unparalleled. George Miller created the most intense and reckless action packed film of 2015 so far. Where most movies settle using CGI and green-screen to create their action, Fury Road uses amazing stunt work and actual explosions. The movie is essentially one giant chase sequence, but a chase has never been filmed so well. All the driving is shot from beautiful wide shots including all the important elements to the scene. Even during the brawls, the movie hardly had any ""quick cut sequences"" that change the shot. Better yet, shaky camera was avoided entirely in this film. The audience is sucked into this brutal world of chases, gun fights, and brawls, because the entire film is enhanced by the high quality action. <br/><br/>Although the action was perfect, this movie as a whole isn't faultless. When you break down the story, there is no real plot. Granted the action of this movie manages to overshadow the lack of story in this film, but under it all the plot is still missing. The entire plot is based on Furiosa (Theron) taking a wrong turn. That is it. This movie was insane. There were War Boys jumping onto cars while swinging chainsaws and blind people shooting twin machine guns. The craziness of this movie can be a negative thing for some audience members. The audience that disliked the previous Mad Max films, won't find much if any joy from Fury Road. It stays true to the roots of its franchise as well as tops it off with more insanity.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing film whether you are a returning fan of the franchise or a newcomer and gets a 9.0/10 stars."
"mvd102000","9","2","8","12 September 2015"," I Don't Know What You Were Expecting Either..
","I'd like to preface this review with a statement to those who found this movie to be overrated, underwhelming tripe. What exactly was it that you were expecting? Did you want a film that flowed along the same lines as the very dated original film? Did you expect a wry, sophisticated thriller that generated line after line of unforgettable genius? Honestly, I'm unsure of what a well-versed movie-goer would have wanted and expected from this film upon admission to their local theater.<br/><br/>Those of you who live in the present will understand that this is a high mark for this generation, in action and stunning visual creation, that need not be taken for granted. The acting was not at all legendary, and it didn't need to be. The story was not at all realistic. And it wasn't supposed to be. The film, as a whole, was pretty much void of deep character progression. And it HAD to be. This is one of those films that you watch, and as it all unfolds and comes to a close, you sit there in your seat and think to yourself, ""I hope to God they make a sequel so that I can further explore this vivid, raw, and highly imaginative world."" That is, in my opinion, an obvious mark of fantastic storytelling. Everything about this film demanded descriptions like 'high-octane' and 'thrill-ride' like no movie before it. Its entirely unique, yet somehow comfortable enough to the common moviegoer rather quickly, and connections are made without the need for forced complexity or cadence. This film is bold and assertive, and unapologetic. A landmark; an absolute masterpiece."

","Furiosa's (Charlize Theron) job is to drive the War Rig and siphon off gas from outlaying towns, but she rebels and tries to save 5-women from the dictator, Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has convinced his minions that he can guarantee them a place in Valhalla when they die on his behalf. Of course Immortal Joe gives chase. He wants his property back as he considers them more valuable than oil or even gas mostly because they can have babies. Max (Tom Hardy) is strapped to the front of a vehicle during this chase and somehow gets free and joins up with Furiosa who doesn't trust him at first. <br/><br/>Basically, this is a 2+-Hour car/truck chase in the desert. The stunts and CGI are the real winners in here and are so good, there are no words to give them their due. They are spectacular. You will come to believe this is all very real and you will cringe or avert your eyes often as I did. Kudos. <br/><br/>Since Max is not really mad, but angry that he got caught, the title should have been FURIOSA and MAX mostly because Furiosa is the real hero in here and Max was along for the ride. There are some good moments when we get to relax somewhat and learn about the characters and, believe me, we needed those breaks. Furiosa has a prosthetic left arm and we keep looking to see how that was done. (movie magic) <br/><br/>In time, the looks Max and Furiosa gave each other were pure gold and we had hoped this pairing would go somewhere. Good chemistry. <br/><br/>All in all the stunts and CGI are ones for the ages and it will be difficult for anyone else to top them. (but they will try) This was filmed in Australia.

","I enjoyed this movie. It was non-stop action but the action was really well done. They kept out-doing themselves with how many ways they could bring down or blow up the opposing vehicle. And for some reason, I cared about Charlize's character as well as Max. The bad guys' costumes were so bazaar they added to the fun. The bad guy leader . . . . didn't he ever get too hot for that getup? But while watching I did have a problem with how their situation could exist: 1. There were two scenes where they gave the thirsty crowd water. They used the most inefficient method: they dumped it onto the folks nearest the cliff and wasted about 98% of it. Why? I know. For show. 2. Did they ever eat? I never saw food or anyone eating. (Except for one guy eating a bug.) 3. How did they manage to keep all those vehicles running? Gas. Where did the gasoline come from? You need a refinery for that. And auto parts. Who made those? Those monster truck tires cost about $2000 a piece. Where did the money come from? Where did the tires come from? I know, it's just entertainment. It doesn't matter. It was Hollywood. True but I enjoyed noticing all the inconsistencies."
"jeffturner1988","9","2","8","18 July 2015"," ""Mad Max"" may be the title, but Theron is the Road Warrior.
","Watched Mad Max. Keep in mind the sequel to the original ""Mad Max"" was a movie called ""The Road Warrior"" released in the early 80s which single handedly defined and ushered in the genre of post apocalyptic survival in worlds gone mad. There was always however, clearly defined lines of who is good and who is bad that the audience can cheer for, sympathize with, and as well hold contempt for, despite the ""good guys"" often having to do things just as bad as the bad guys. <br/><br/>The new ""Mad Max"" throws no pretensions of righteousness on the audience. This movie, its director, and its screenwriter understand that in such a world.. everyone is bad. This is not a ""fun"" movie. This is not a ""feel good summer flick"" ... its a two hour journey into hell with a devil on both shoulders. And its brilliant. <br/><br/>I won't give spoilers.. but had the movie been called ""The Road Warrior"" then beyond any doubt that Warrior would be Charlize Theron rather than the actor who does play ""Mad Max"" for which other than being ""who"" is in the first scenes of the movie, is no more fit for survival than any of the other characters. He is the one whose perspective is often used to relay events that Theron invokes but no one is the actual center of. Instead an array of characters collide again and again as the three primary roles fight their way across the wasteland. This eclectic mix of personalities and bizarre personas are played out relatively small amounts of screen time, but by actors and a screenplay so perfectly on target it only takes those few minutes to attach ourselves to them and realize the madness they call normal life.<br/><br/>The score transcends the movie. There are times when the most intense moments of wanton death are accompanied by passages of orchestra matched with cinematography that shows a requiem to insanity which laments those dying rather than making them prop pieces blown up for us to be ""thrilled"" by. We the audience witnesses the only reactions characters in such a world can have when hope is not the reason one lives, but the glee of dying gloriously for a cult of personality one believes will carry them after death. This readiness to die... ITS the reason we sympathize with them. The wasted loyalty is sad.. their joy at death the ultimate symptom of how truly mad the world is... our sympathy for the devil as it rears it head over and over makes us come face to face with the fact that the devil has no where else to go either when the whole world is hell."

A chase with benefits of water, fuel, and beautiful women is the theme of the movie, deadly from the start.<br/><br/>Great acting, stunning cinematography, and a unique apocalypse style them and plot come together for one of the best action films of 2015.<br/><br/>The only cons for myself personally; the length of the film could have been shaved by a few minutes, as at one point an event occurs that makes you groan a tad internally.

"ayush0793","7","2","8","17 June 2015"," Below expectations but enjoyable
","If it weren't for Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, I would never have watched this movie. Both the lead actors were as usual, great. There isn't much of a story. But you get to see great stunts with men swaying on moving vehicles, lively visual effects, most stupid cars, abuse of guns and fuel in the world where there is no water, cultivable land and worst of all, pregnant women and very old women fighting on top of moving cars and even riding bikes and cars. There aren't many dialogues and some the main characters don't even speak. Nicolas Hoult was an addition with no real need or character even. <br/><br/>The antagonist Immortal Joe owns everyone and everything as he owns a huge lame mountain of water with no visible source(that is what is actually shown) and has the only lame green piece in the 'middle' of a desert when Charlize Theron's character(Furiosa) secretly helps his wives escape, then the furious Joe pursues her and the rest of the story is very much obvious. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just for you to buy your own time to kill and be a little happy about it."

","Fast paced and gritty, Mad Max continuously tries to engage the viewer visually. The movie succeeds in doing just that but lacks emotional depth and and almost any semblance of nuanced characters. The movie's strong point is it's feminist tilt and the overpowering performance of Charlize Theron. Also you cannot help but be mesmerized but the dystopian universe that the director has created. Flame spouting guitars and all purpose war cars are just a few of it's charming features. The movie feels almost half an hour too long, and the viewer will most definitely guess what the ending will bring. Tom Hardy grunts and succeeds in looking pretty but mostly takes a backseat to Furiosa, Theron's character. CGI use is limited, which is a rarity for such movies. Overall, visually entertaining and violent with a dash of supermodel. Just be careful to not get dust in your eyes."
"tvspace","8","2","8","28 May 2015"," Midnight movie from the 80's!
","I've seen Mad Max: Fury Road twice and tried to see it a third time tonight. (They were only showing 3D screenings after 8:30 p.m. so I had to pass... who's with me on this? 3D is for kids...)<br/><br/>Since I very rarely watch movies twice in a theater, this is an odd impulse, which I don't entirely understand, made more odd by the fact that I didn't like the movie too much the first time I saw it. I didn't like it, but I also felt I was in the absolute wrong frame of mind to digest what was being thrown at me on the screen. So I went back.<br/><br/>What I found on second viewing is that Mad Max: Fury Road is the filmic equivalent of an unbelievably great, if slightly challenging, hard rock record. The pleasure in watching it isn't really story and suspense (there's little of either), but just soaking in the craziness, the out of this world textures (cars, costumes, weapons), the awesome soundtrack (music and effects). During the second screening it seemed for most of the show I had a huge smile plastered across my face, because I felt so in tune and aware of all of these elements intertwining. When I wanted to go back a third time tonight, it was with the same impulse that I might want to listen to a great record again. To take that journey once again, and to capture even more nuance and subtlety in the compelling vision being played out on the screen.<br/><br/>In the end I feel like this movie captures something lost about my teenage movie-going in the 80's, when we used to go see stuff like A Clockwork Orange; Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii; or Texas Chainsaw Massacre Pt. 2; and (not always of sober mind) have really extreme audio-visual experiences in a movie theatre. That kind of filmmaking to my mind has largely been lost in an era of, on the one hand, incredibly dumb Hollywood movies, and on the other, extremely self-consciously ""arty"" films made to impress critics. <br/><br/>For me, it's great to see George Miller, for at least one shining moment, explore other possibilities with the medium."
"thomas-w15","6","2","8","28 May 2015"," Mild Max
","I have only seen bits and pieces of the original Mad Max films so I won't be making any comparisons between the two. Without a doubt, this was one of the most unique movies I've seen. I have never been able to say about a movie that it was the weirdest and darkest, but very well-made films I have ever seen until I sat down to watch Mad Max: Fury Road. Still, I felt very mislead because it didn't advertise the fact that there would be less than 150 lines of dialogue in the whole that definitely resulted in the lack of character depth and acting in the film. Despite some of it's shortcomings, Mad Max: Fury Road delivers in it's promise of a movie that is ninety-nine percent action with some of the most realistic effects ever seen on the big screen. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy. I think he is a great actor whose best films still lie in front of him. But, if you are going to hire a great actor in a big budget action film, give him something to work with. It is pretty hard to act in an action movie when you get virtually one line of dialogue ever five minutes. I would not be surprised to learn that Charlie Theron(who has the most screen time) and Nicolas Hoult had more lines that Tom Hardy. I understand, I understand this is an action film, but that is not an excuse for lack of character depth and development in the movie. Yes, Max is just a ""Road Warrior"" whose mind will always be the same, but that does not mean he has to be a static character throughout the whole movie. The only person whose character changed during the movie was Nicolas Hoult, a supporting actor. I feel that any good movie needs a good amount of character development to make the story interesting and exciting, especially for an action film. <br/><br/>Enough about the bad aspects of the movie. Now, we are going to talk about the without a doubt best part of the movie, the action. So basically, the whole movie is one giant car chase with minimal breaks in between. Naturally this calls for some great action sequences. From what I read on the movie, George Miller(the director) wanted to use CGI very sparingly and use as much on-set action as possible to give the movie a very realistic style. He achieved action filmmaker Hall of Fame by using so. Never have I quite seen explosions and action sequences in a film quite like the ones in Mad Max: Fury Road. So many times during the movie, I kept asking myself ""how the hell did they film that?"" The answer even if told to me, I probably still wouldn't be able to comprehend. <br/><br/>The screenplay as I said before is mainly just one incredibly well-filmed car chase and since it is based in an apocalyptic desert wasteland where a warlord is hunting the main protagonist down, there can't be much clearly outlined direction says the plot is as Max said in the first few seconds of the movie, ""Survival.""<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this movie is very dark in it's action with incredibly intense action sequences not for the faint of heart. If you can handle that though and like to see good action movies, I recommend you see Mad Max: Fury Road while it is still in theaters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"printzr","8","2","8","27 May 2015"," Mad Max was bat sh!t insane
","The movie was inanity, madness, and chaos, but the directing and premise did not need to be. Having not watched or heard about Max like many of us, there was no basic sense of what was going on other then the sense that people were blowing each other up. Only did a few subtle frames or one line sentences hint at a possible premise, but it was so subtle that I was left confused throughout the action scenes. Mad Max's intro did not reveal who he was, or how he got there as it was only about 5 sentences revealing that the world was chaotic. Sure, I get it..but why was it chaotic? The post apocalyptic civilization and culture was little appreciated because the director failed to establish the premise of their existence. Hence, I could not appreciate the deeper philosophical introspection of the author's depictions of the end of the world. Only until after doing research did I get to understand the deep characters, but without the research I was left to wonder what exactly what I was watching. The rest was just madness.<br/><br/>And madness was the obvious motif of the movie. The world ends and this post apoc culture is unstable, insane, but for the most part fun to watch. Action sequence of trucks driving up rocks, getting stuck in mud, while a death metal guitar strapped to a flame thrower is blasting music through all the fight scenes. I just wish I was given more information about Max, and the end of the world culture that developed. The movie could have used a 20 minute synopsis of the past 3 movies, like in Superman."
"flyermay","9","2","8","27 May 2015"," Saw it 4 times already, and I still want to see it again.
","My summary says it all. I don't usually rewatch movies, unless I lost the plot or missed something important. I only rewatch movies that I really like when enough time has passed for me to start forgetting parts of it. However, with this movie, I'm simply dragged to watch it again and again.<br/><br/>It totally took me by surprise. I was rather expecting another awful reboot with the sole purpose of cashing in the name ""Mad Max""; so I began to watch it without much interest. All that change two hours later, when I returned to reality at the end of the movie and found myself completely flabbergast.<br/><br/>I think that more than the action scenes -which are so good and so often that keeps you immerse in the movie for its full length- what I most liked and what really hooked me was the world that Miller created; the society surrounding Immortan Joe, and how Miller masterfully reveals it all visually, without using the typical exposition scenes. I found that aspect of the movie so interesting that I simply wanted to know everything about it; and that without even taking into account how cool everything looks, from the landscape and the citadel to the vehicles and the characters. You can clearly see that a lot for effort and thought has been put into this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me was Charlize Theron's characterization of Imperator Furiosa. I didn't look at the credits before watching it -just knew that Tom Hardy was substituting Mel Gibson- so I didn't know that she was in it until well into the movie. My image of Charlize Theron is the perfect Miss Vickers from Prometheus, in which it even makes you doubt whether she is human or an android, so to find her as someone as Imperator Furiosa, the complete opposite of Vickers, was something quite difficult to believe; it kind of seemed impossible to reconcile the fact that Furiosa and Vickers are played by the same actress. I don't think many actresses as good looking as her could have achieved such a convincing transformation. Tom Hardy was also quite good as Mad Max; I didn't miss Mel Gibson at all; which is something that rarely happens with this type of franchises.<br/><br/>The only reason why I didn't give this movie a 10 is the plot and the end. The plot was rather simple -which seems to have been done in purpose, as Miller was after the road chase from Mad Max 2 but as long as a full movie. Given that premise, I think it couldn't have been done any better; so it's difficult to predict how it would have turned out if the plot was more complex. And regarding the end, which I'm not going to explain: well, it simply didn't convince me.<br/><br/>Resuming: it is possible that if you don't like good action movies then you won't like this one. But if you do, this one is definitely for you. I would go as far as saying that in my opinion it is one of the best action movies of all times."
"elise-algernon","8","2","8","26 May 2015"," Unapologetically Absurd - But Fun
","An accurate (and funny) description I heard of this movie: ""If war broke out during Burning Man - this would probably be what it looked like..."" Super-elaborate costuming - including for the vehicles, which I heard were all carefully crafted and engineered (much more effort than I would have expected - but great that it wasn't all CGI!). I heard innovative stuff was done with the cars in order to fuse vehicles together - but still making them roadworthy and safe (I suddenly want to know more about ""the making of"" for the cars for Mad Max) And that's where it is trademark Mad Max - with a hero (who obviously doesn't want to be a hero) who is really good at getting out of almost-impossible situations and really weird cars that have been bolted together from the remainders of other cars - with lots of extra armor and spikes.<br/><br/>It was a 2 hour chase scene - and unapologetically so. It was a bit contrived when Max was insisting that they had to go back from where they started - so the entire movie is spent driving pointlessly in one direction and then (after picking up a few more people) driving pointlessly (and needless to say - recklessly and homicidally) back in the other direction.<br/><br/>And while they definitely delivered on spiky cars driving back and forth in a brutal death match - fighting over very limited resources in a post-apocalyptic world - I have to admit that it would have been nice if it made any bloody sense at all - just as an extra. I know that's not what this movie was for - but it would have made it so much more better if we had any clue what some of this was all about. Why were those guys painted white (with black eyes and a sort of skeleton zombie appearance) and what was the deal with the suicide fighters spray-painting their teeth silver? There's obviously some kind of cult-religion going on here with the lead-baddie being the icon of this strange pseudo-religion - but not much is explained except in bits and pieces that never quite come together.<br/><br/>The tanker full of breast milk makes no sense at all. I guess it could be a source of protein - but far more protein could have been cultivated in growing beans or keeping domesticated animals than in taking the time to pump all that breast milk.<br/><br/>And that guitar dude - seriously? I know it's just showing off and is kitschy as all get-out - and it was almost laugh-out-loud funny. But what is this guy supposed to be? The main baddie's minstrel? And why waste fuel or flammable substances on making a guitar into a flamethrower? (just to look cool?) And that's not even mentioning the whole ark of drum-beaters that were following the entourage. When going to battle - I guess you'd want scary-sounding drums - but I would have thought all the flame-throwers, exploding bombs, hand grenades, bullets, grinding engines and exploding cars would have drowned the drums out really. Or were they just trying to explain the soundtrack? I heard a rumor about complaints over a ""feminist agenda"" in Fury Road That being said - the seemingly all-women's tribe on motorcycles in the middle of the desert (but previously in some special ""green place"") was about as unlikely as the rest of the movie... It was nice to see a female heroine who wasn't weak - and a bad-ass amputee at that. And it was also nice to see older women (talking all-white hair would-be granny types) all suited up in leather and kicking ass. It was a refreshing change - but I didn't feel it was anti-men.<br/><br/>Some complained about Max not having many lines... When has he ever? He was never known to be a talker. I actually thought that the actor playing this version of ""Max"" did a good job of seeming almost-too-traumatized to really do much talking - as if talking was too troublesome. He had a jerky, hesitant way of talking that sort of fit with someone who probably never gets much of an opportunity for civilized conversation.<br/><br/>In a Game-Of-Thrones crazy world - where every other show seems to be copying them - it was nice not to have some exploitative and disturbing sex scene in this version of Mad Max - which was almost surprising. They show an awful lot of violence - but not much nudity and zero sex. Everyone is too busy driving for that, I guess. Were it not for the all the gun play and people being run over in cars - it could have been rated as PG-13.<br/><br/>For a good portion of it - I felt like I was sitting through a rather long music video - especially with the white make-up of the main baddie (resembling the 80's rock band KISS) and he had this strange breathing apparatus that reminded me of Darth Vader - except with big teeth on the breathing mask part. I guess that's one way of making it look cool to be on oxygen. But why is this guy like this? Why did that one guy need to be hooked up to Max for a blood transfusion in the first place? not explained. I suppose we have to wait for the next Mad Max movie to explain all the white make up and skull cult-religion maybe - if they remember, what with having to put all those spikes on the VW microbus...<br/><br/>I just heard there's a comic book series that this movie was based on - and now all the gaps in the story makes a weird sort of sense - maybe. It's possible this made so much more sense for those who read the comic books - or maybe not. It was fun anyway though - as long as your expectations are not terribly high."

I thought this was a good movie even though the plot seemed like a jumbled mess with no real character development from some of the people the stranger (Mad Max) meets. Some of the characters such as the Vestal Virgins and the ginger Vestal Virgin's skinhead boyfriend Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) were kind of annoying at first.<br/><br/>But, the intense action scenes of cars and trucks racing against each other and the breathtaking exotic landscape made up for the lack of a real plot. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron put a pretty good effort as Mad Max and Furiosa. The costumes, the weird make of the cars and trucks, and the exotic desert landscape made the movie look like it took place in another planet rather than a post-apocalyptic Australian outback.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie to take your children and wife or girlfriend to. Even though there's a lot of combat violence, we actually don't see a real bloody mess such as limbs and heads flying out of car crash collisions. I didn't hear any profanity like in military combat movies and horror movies. There's no gratuitous sex scenes and make out scenes. The two main characters, Mad Max and Furiosa are allies only in their predicament nothing more. Hopefully, there will be more sequels to come."
"pkpera","9","2","8","24 May 2015"," In some way it is true sequel of Road Warrior
","For start to say that I watched all Mad Max movies in past, right as they started to show in cinemas. Most memorable was part 2 - theater was full, with people standing at sides. So, I watched Fury Road 2 days ago, and wrote review here, but now I feel need to edit it, add some thoughts. Because some things are more clear now, after some digesting and rewatching of Mad Max 2. I was surprised about that final tanker chase took only some 11-12 minutes. Funny is how human memory distorting things - as that chase was most impressive part, I thought that it was some half of movie time ..<br/><br/>Fury Road involves tanker almost at very beginning, and it is present during whole movie/journey. So, my theory is that Miller wanted to develop (to say so) that part to the max. , with help of modern CGI, and of course much higher budget.<br/><br/>Even title is confirming it - Fury Road suits perfectly.<br/><br/>So focus is on road action scenes, which make about 70% of running time. At begin is some car-less action too, and we have some slower and shower parts too, for allowing audience to take breath and see something lovely among all that destruction. The plot is nothing deep, but that was not to expect. Basically, all happens around huge tanker vehicle, - as it was in Mad Max 2 finish. Actually, all before it was just some shallow story, all in purpose to lead to road action. Did not like that Max wearing that ridiculous TDKR mask too long time. Don't know was it just Miller's weird humor. Now, about what happens most time: action on road: absolutely spectacular and mad. Lot of kamikaze moves, over top huge vehicles, and inventive, spectacular stunts. Surely there is lot of CGI, and that's good, because no other way to achieve such level of destruction on screen. Although almost everything is over top, I never had feeling that some scene is unrealistic (as it was in many Die Hard, Fast and F. movies). Furious is maybe word what describes it best. Speed is not of essence, but matters a bit. This movie just made what most of action movies failed: managed to make some really original action scenes. What some ? A lot of them ! More than in 10 other action movies.<br/><br/>I think that it is result of smart approach. Instead going by scenario, they gone on thinkering out scenes on location self. According to main actress, shooting in Namibia took months, and they were instructed to be on shooting all time, even if scene with them was not planned. Maybe there will be interesting to see dropped scenes on Blue Ray ... (if it can fit on single disk :-) ).<br/><br/>For action blockbuster this is pure 10. But there are some weaker parts. like plot, some ridiculous things, fluids. Would say that this was first ""road movie"" in this road action franshize - they were basically on journey all time.<br/><br/>Sequel is inevitable. I hope that money hunger will not prevail, and that will not rush with it, even if director is in dino age. Good ideas need time."
"jl-04648","7","2","8","15 May 2015"," Beautifully choreographed, theatrical, road-violence.
","The good: Very well made. Similar feel to the original films. I very much liked the subtle environmental message and plethora of powerful female characters (without being preachy), and found that truly original. All but a few side-show characters have visible vulnerability, which was again refreshing. Charlize Theron was very good, and I can understand why her character will be expanded upon in the following film. The action and machinery is, of course, epic, and reaches the level of art in of itself.<br/><br/>The not so good: This is the worst performance I've seen from Tom Hardy. His accent is weird, which I suppose works from the point of view of audience ambiguity (which means more people will potentially identify with the film). However, he is too laconic/taciturn, and needed more dialogue. Can't help feeling Max's character is a dinosaur, which possibly explains why he won't feature so much in the next film(s). At no point in the entire film did any of the tyres on the rig get blown out. In Mad Max II, that was one of the first things the baddies went for (for obvious reasons). Consequently, the entire film doesn't hold up well in the believability stakes. The plot is thin, and there's even less dialogue than the aforementioned Mad Max II. Perhaps I'm becoming a fuddy duddy, but I feel Mad Max II is still a better film, overall.<br/><br/>The Irish Film Classification Office gave this film a 15A rating. I feel a 12A would've been more appropriate - there is no swearing, full frontal nudity, graphic violence (i.e. people losing limbs). Not sure what other territories classify it as, but it should be something that fathers and tweenies (or above) can reasonably happily go and see together. Alex liked it.﻿"
"thenekassyni","8","3","15","19 August 2015"," Good movie
","I couldn't resist myself after reading some of the lower scores for this film. Some of these people are nuttier than Max!<br/><br/>There is a plot, several if you want to be specific about it. People just choose to ignore it or rather they don't care for it. The main plot is Furiousa taking the wives to a better place, a place that is suppose to be alive and vibrant. The side plots are Furiousa trying to find redemption, Max finding sanity and hope along the way (which he does at the end), and the least missed of it all - the disruption in power due to the deaths of at least 4 group leaders. No plot they say, LMAO!<br/><br/>Then I read people complaining about everything being available. No, the movie makes it clear that they either go to war with other groups to obtain the needed resources or trade them as with the 3 groups. This is why Furiousa drives a ""War Rig"". :) The movie even has a scene where they were suppose to trade oil for passage through the mountains. Immortal Joe has water, oil and green. The oil is most likely traded from the friendly groups. Seriously, you have to pay attention to the movie people.<br/><br/>There were several remarking that the world was lively and not post- apocalyptic enough, with people working and I guess having fun. Immortal Joe has them as slaves, under drugs. The movie makes this EXTREMELY clear throughout and especially at the beginning. Those that are brought up serve several purposes,<br/><br/>1. Provide milk 2. Sex slaves 3. Machinist slaves 4. Drugged up War Boys to die willingly for Joe<br/><br/>Those that are not brought up live a horrible, horrible life as seen in the movie. So again, why is it that some of you think it's all so pretty? Do you want like 10 people being around only LOL!<br/><br/>I can't stop laughing reading these ignorant comments. If you don't even pay attention to the movie you won't know what's going on! Might as well throw you money away or give it to charity. You'll be doing everyone a much better service rather than your short-sighted, clueless review."
"Dsmartt","10","3","15","11 June 2015"," A completely unique cinema experience
","What is there to say about Mad Max that has not already been said? not much. By now, a few weeks after the film's initial release, you will have seen that there has been high critical praise for this movie among fans and critics alike. To dislike this film, which is subjective at the end of the day, would make you part of a small majority to say the least. I went to see Mad Max: Fury Road with little to no hype for it. Its true, i have seen the trailers and while i was enjoying each new piece of marketing material that i saw i was never truly excited. When i heard the reviews, however, i made sure to see the movie critics were raving about. It was something completely unique and awesome to behold. Not only did the director of the original Mad Max return, at the old age of 75, but it was a revival of a long dead franchise with a substantially high and risky budget that was pretty risky considering how dead the franchise is. Everything about this movie is amazing. I won't ramble on too much longer but the action, acting (Especially Charlize Theron who was the best performer in my eyes) practical effects and the world created in this movie were all amazing. If you haven't seen Mad Max: Fury Road, watch it now."
"Muttley_McLad","10","3","15","9 June 2015"," Through chaos comes order
","Max is back! Of that there is no doubt.<br/><br/>I went into this film as a fan of the originals, but also fully aware that this wasn't going to be a direct sequel of any kind. It's 30 years since Mad Max last took to the big screen, time, technology and even actors have moved on now. The film would be different, of that I was sure.<br/><br/>They got rid of any concerns about continuity pretty much right away by declaring with the appearance of the Interceptor (which the last time we saw it was at the bottom of a gully, in lots of pieces and very on fire) that there wasn't any continuity. Right from the outset too, they made it clear that this was a film that was telling you not to get bogged down with the details, just take it as a story from one of Max's encounters out in the wastelands and enjoy the action. <br/><br/>Then there is a new actor in the roll that Gibson made his own. Hardy is a physically expressive actor who uses his body to bring presence to his character's and I would think that with Max being a man of few words, this was a part of the reason he was cast. This is a more brutal world than the one we saw in Road Warrior and Thunderdome though, so what we get is a more brutal Max. Where as Gibson's Max lived on his speed and ingenuity, Hardy's Max seems more driven by brutality and instinct. <br/><br/>It's still the Max we know, the nomad of questionable morals and of few chosen words, who's given over living for just surviving. But this seems to be a Max who's been out there in the wastelands much longer than he had been the last time we saw him and is a few steps closer to complete insanity. It's a much lonelier, mistrusting and feral version of the character than the one Gibson left us with some 3 decades ago, but it's a version that works exceptionally well. Few actors do boarder line insane and have physical presence at the moment as well as Hardy does.<br/><br/>The big question for me, as it has been for many others, was how would it hold up against what many consider to be the best of the Mad Max originals, Road Warrior...<br/><br/>Well, consider this. Road Warrior was ground breaking for it's time and the real stand out scene was without doubt the final chase with the tanker. For the budget they had and with what had come before, it was astonishing! Now, take that (admittedly quite long in itself) scene and turn it into an entire 2 hour extravaganza. That's brave!<br/><br/>If you're going to do that, you've got to make sure that it is a new encounter for the new character and not just a remake of one of the most iconic action scenes ever filmed. Then if you're going to do that, you've then got to make sure that the quality of the action at least meets that of Road Warrior's, if not excels above it. With a film that's (and I'm not joking here) at least 80% action, that's a tall order.<br/><br/>So did they do it? A resounding yes! This is an action film and makes no excuses for it. There is no clever twist, no love interest, not much dialogue and not much that on paper makes it much to shout about as a great film. But purely as an action film, it's an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>The action is plentiful, beautifully shot, brutal, chaotic, relentless and merciless, but interestingly, it's as much of a plot point as anything else in the film is. A particularly nice touch were the aerial long shots showing where everyone was in relation to each other as they converged across this vast, barren post apocalyptic landscape. It truly takes center stage above all else and much like Road Warrior did almost 35 years ago, sets new benchmarks in what an action film can do.<br/><br/>The thing is, when you consider that most astonishingly of all is that the vast majority of stunt work was done using practical, physical effects in this digital age, every action film that is released from now on, CGI or not, will be compared to Fury Road's many, many excellent scenes. It is simply that much of a game changer with action film standards! <br/><br/>You've got to take this film for what it is. A no holds barred, old school action film of the very finest level. Of those, it really is one of the very best examples of on screen action ever put to film."

","Wow George miller,this movie that you made has left me breathless, still 2 days after watching it. This movie has no comparison to the original installment.The visual and stylistics in the movie leaves you gasping for air. Be warned once this movie starts rolling which is very early in the movie, their is no stopping the momentum this movies keeps building the pressure in your mind, in your head, in your whole being. Oh my God. My review is very simple when their are 3 moments in the movie where the action stops and all you can hear is an entire cinema catching their breath. That gives you the answer you need.Their is simply nothing that even comes close on how great this is. Can not wait for the 3 sequels."
"TheIronThrone","9","3","16","6 July 2015"," Great Movie, Great Allegory, Great Performances.
","What I really enjoyed about this movie was that, for the first half, I was pretty sure it was just going to be a completely prurient, vacuous action movie filled with special effects violence for special effects violence's sake; then it completely changed up in to a meaningful dramatic exposition of powerful themes and important allegorical advocacy of respect for human diversity, condemnation of unchecked abuse of power by authority, and the effects of nuclear power and global climate change. <br/><br/>I thought the film was powerful and entertaining at the same time. Charlize Theron working with Tom Hardy created a powerful chemistry on screen that only results from bringing two major talents like these together in the same dramatic exposition, which was indeed a treat. And I was equally surprised and pleased to see many new faces as well, which is a trend I hope continues casting Hollywood blockbusters. <br/><br/>Finally I have to admit, the film left me wondering whether or not Emu Oil is an effective remedy for post-apocalyptic road rash. :-)<br/><br/>Until Next Time,<br/><br/>Peace."
"dyricci","9","3","16","5 June 2015"," A Mind-Explodingly-Good Eye-Orgasm of Ecstatic Delight
","I waited THIRTY-FOUR YEARS for another REAL Mad Max flick (that 1985 monstrosity with Tina Turner does not exist to me) and I never thought I'd see the day. Well, my pain and patience was worth it in the end; I've been rewarded with a mind-explodingly-good eye-orgasm of ecstatic delight.<br/><br/>This is seriously the most bad-ass action flick I have seen in years (the word 'ever' briefly flits through my brain...). It is classic Mad Max, over-the-top, crazy-weirdness done better and badder...and even beautiful in some of the few spots it slows down enough to focus on something still. It is dark, ruthless and brutal, yet at the same time hopeful, with a powerful message of warning: Greed Kills...Everything.<br/><br/>To say that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are both brilliant in bringing their roles of Max and Furiosa to life is a given. The complexity of each of their painful pasts, along with their respective hopes for redemption (or resignation to penance), weaves gracefully through the fabric of their personas and within the fiery, desperate gleam in their painfully dusty eyes. However, it is the unexpectedly shiny performance of Josh Helman (Slit) that held me fixated throughout his screen time. His is like the bubbles in a cold glass of sparkling water; the extra tickling enjoyment that thoroughly quenches one's thirst. Slit has such blossoming, full character arc for a supporting rolesingle-minded loyalty, anger, goodness, surprise, delight, and yet, poignancyand he delivers each facet so perfectly and seamlessly one isn't sure what's coming from him next. He is that shiny bubble floating speedily through that glass of water to its inevitable destination, but the path that bubble takes around the ice cubes is unpredictable, and you can't take your eyes off of it.<br/><br/>Did I say it was good? Did I mention I want to do it again...like, right NOW?? <br/><br/>Thank you SO much George Miller. And, please, sir...may we soon have another drink of your glorious, sparkling water?"

","What can I say. I'm hardly the type to sit through a movie. Especially a 2 hour plus. But this. You cannot take your eyes off the screen. All the characters are eccentric. All the costumes are magnificent. The guns and war vehicles are completely out of this world. The ideas are flowing like mad. The filming location is so beautiful, and seeing it on the big screen is incredible. Charlize does not say much, but with her finesse, she doesn't have to. Hardy is brill. All of them play their parts excellent. The harsh desert, sweating and getting downright dirty, it is just so freakin good. I love this movie!

"jacobclark512","9","3","16","3 June 2015"," Oh, what a film...what a lovely film!
","Well, that was exhilarating.<br/><br/>Honestly, Mad Max: Fury Road might be the most fun I've had at the movies in quite some time. I spent the last couple weeks catching myself up on George Miller's action franchise after seeing how well Fury Road was doing critically. Long story short, the original films are now some of my favorite action movies.<br/><br/>Flash forward thirty years, and Miller is back at it again, making the fourth Mad Max film. Without Mel Gibson. Skeptical?<br/><br/>Don't be. If there's one thing George Miller knows how to do, it's direct an action film. Save for ten minutes in Beyond Thunderdome, he made three action films that centered around the action. In today's world, most action films try to go for emotional depth and complex scenarios only to drag themselves down with unnecessary clutter. While Fury Road does add narrative heft and some emotional backstory, it augments the action and doesn't distract from it.<br/><br/>The one complaint I have with Miller's approach in doing this is that it can leave the viewer somewhat confused about who people are, what they are doing, and why they are doing it. This is a hallmark of the Mad Max franchise, for better or for worse. The most prominent example I can think of in Fury Road is the main villain. I loved his look, I loved his voice, and I loved the character all around, but I can't for the life of me remember the guy's name!<br/><br/>Speaking of the villain, let's talk about the look of this film. Miller's franchise has gone from understated and simple with the first film to progressively more grotesque and strange as the budgets have increased. The third of the original films, Beyond Thunderdome, had a budget of approximately $20 million with today's US dollar value. Fury Road has a budget over nine times that. Needless to say, it is by far the most glamorous of the franchise. It largely retains the aesthetic present in the first three films while adding a lot of new, cool stuff possible with modern technology. The CG present is really well done; however, the practical stunt effects are what steal the show. Miller himself said that 90% of the effects were practical. This adds a realism and heightens the suspense during the absolutely jaw-dropping stunt sequences. My favorite part of Miller's direction is how he manipulates the frame rates to make the action remain coherent or seem slightly less so. That single thing made the film incredibly unique and quite fun to watch.<br/><br/>Moving to the acting, Tom Hardy is an excellent replacement for Mel Gibson. Most people say that acting doesn't really matter in action films. That's garbage. When someone as talented as Tom Hardy does any role, it's noticed. He really embodies the chaos going on inside Max's head and also that stark coldness that Gibson brought to the character. Charlize Theron is also a good choice for Furiosa, as she shows the more caring nature that her character brought to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max: Fury Road is the breath of fresh air that action films need in 2015. Most in the genre are either old, worn out franchises (Live Free or Die Hard, Terminator Genisys, etc.) or featuring old, worn out actors (The Expendables). George Miller expertly crafts a film that looks both back and forward at the same time, retaining the unique aesthetic of the original films while also integrating new technology that makes the stunts that much more exciting. Fury Road is a non-stop thrill ride that will entertain almost any moviegoer with its intensity and technicality."
"fensew","10","3","16","30 May 2015"," Best Action Movie In Recent Memory
","Going in to this movie viewers have to be on board with the ridiculous amount of action and some over the top moments. This movie simply put is for an action lover. This film has done the things other modern day action films have failed to do. The hero is not an invincible super soldier which they well establish at the beginning. Our protagonist are rarely not in danger, sucking the audience in making is scared for them. Great enemies who don't feel like balloons being swatted away, but rather people who pose serious danger. All this creates a tense, adrenaline filled, fun time at the theatre.<br/><br/>This being said I don't agree with some other reviews on the character development or plot etc. The world building was great as soon as the film began showing us the struggles of the common and the actual weakness of a self proclaimed God who rules them. The character development on Max and Furiosa was small and cliché but they did it well. The character Nux was developed extremely well showing us the the human side of these faceless troops. Finally the plot was simple, but perfect for action. Our heroes steal a much wanted resource and try to escape.Simple yet a perfect plot for an action packed thrill ride as it puts the characters in situation of constant peril."
"J-fuglen","10","2","9","25 May 2016"," Mad Max Sure Is Mad!
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the fourth Max Mad movie directed by George Miller. Different from the other Mad Max movies, this one follows its own storyline and does not have any associations with the previous movies in the franchise. I will be honest, when I chose to watch this movie, I had no idea it would be SO DAMN INSANE! I mean, I had watched the trailers and seen what I was about: an apocalyptic wasteland, where law and order no longer existed and the only thing left to do is to fight for your own survival. I was just not prepared for the insanity almost every character seemed to show. I mean, even our own protagonist Max does not think clear, which just comes to show the world really had gone mad. If you have seen any clips on YouTube from behind the scenes of the movie, you will know how little CGI that were used to film the crazy car-chase scenes. To see how much effort George Miller went through to make each scene look almost exactly like the ones shown in the movie is a big plus in my book. For the characters: Tom Hardy did a solid job as Mad Max, but he could not have done it without the assistance of Charlize Theron as Furiosa, who did a fantastic job in portraying a strong female character. The movie could have been called ""Mad Furiosa"" and I would have been fine with it. In addition, Nicholas Hoult's character also did a great job, and the same can be said for the movies main antagonist ""Immortan Joe"". Even though he had a mask on that would hide his facial expressions, it was easy to see in his eyes that he wasn't playing around. It was like watching Tom Hardy as Bane from the Dark Knight Rises – you could feel the horror from the look in his eyes. The movie is not filled with much dialogue, but the scenes in the movie that involves the most dialogue is great to watch, and shows good character development. But the movie shines the most is at its crazy, over-the-top action scenes, that are gold to watch. I just wish I had seen the movie in cinema, because this really is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed on the big screen."

","This film is the most beautiful thing you will witness. Ever. Flawless editing and an incredible soundtrack, George Miller gives us another dose of Mad Max's Wasteland in amazing style. The stunts are unbelievable, especially in an age when CGI is used far too much, and the film is basically one long car chase. There are plenty of awesome stunts and explosions to enjoy and the story can be enjoyed in a simple 'there and back again' way or on a much deeper level thanks to Miller's character development, excellent casting, and awesome world building. This film really plays with the visual side of story telling as very little speech is used, characters often using facial expressions and gestures to express their feelings and desires. There is so much foreshadowing and mirroring and intricate details (visual and auditory) that you'll only catch after watching it a few times over and the many levels make it perfect for textual analysis. 10/10 would watch 100x"
"asandor","10","2","9","1 February 2016"," Mad Max: Fury Road, fits right in with its predecessors
","Fury Road, directed by George Miller (who also directed the previous Mad Max instalments) is back. This time, Max (played by Tom Hardy) is captured by a Warlord, Immortan Joe and his subjects. Max lucks out, however, as he inadvertently takes part in a kidnapping and rescue mission by Joe and his war parties. Max helps the kidnapper, a rogue war party member Furiosa, and her ""victims,"" sex slaves that Joe keeps. Together, this crew races through the desert of post-apocalyptic Australia as they try and escape Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>This is a simple movie in a lot of ways. There is very little dialogue, and much of the story takes place through action scenes, or set pieces. I love that these scenes can often describe the world Miller imagines without any tedious narration or worthless back story. Hardy does a great job as Max, opting for silent brooding and grunting dialogue to portray Max. As was mentioned, this movie is 90% action. Think the tanker chase scene from the Road Warrior, and multiply that by about 4. It's non-stop action, and it's gorgeous to look at.<br/><br/>I have seen a few pieces of criticism for this film that describe it as ""childish or mindless action"" to improperly quote a few. I would address this by pointing out that Miller does not insult the audience with dialogue to explain the world or back story of Mad Max's universe. He leaves the scenes to themselves, and allows the viewer to see the minutia of his world, or not, depending on how close they are paying attention. This movie has flipped the Hollywood-ized action flick around. There are no clichéd moments of candid action, with jokes and laughs shared by invincible heroes. The action scenes are intense, and our heroes are vulnerable. The thrill and suspense throughout the film keeps the viewer attentive and engaged. The world develops around these scenes and often leaves the viewer to marvel much as Max and crew do themselves.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie, and on my fifth watch, have decided to write this review. A movie is excellent when it improves on subsequent watches, and in my opinion, Mad Max: Fury Road does just that. It is eye candy action, to be sure. Evens so, there is nothing wrong with a great action movie, and this one fits the bill perfectly. Fury Road is highly engaging, thrilling, action packed, well shot and directed, and a total blast to watch each time."

"gavin6942","8","2","9","17 January 2016"," Surprisingly Suspenseful and Epic
","A woman (Charlize Theron) rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper, and a drifter named Max (Tom Hardy).<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""Mad Max"" is the surprise success of 2015. While it is not surprising that a big budget reboot of a popular science fiction series would be a commercial success, how could anyone have predicted it would be a critical darling as well? And yet, it has found its way on to numerous top ten lists and picked by many as the movie of the year. ""Mad max"" even has the second most nominations for the Oscars, which is unbelievable.<br/><br/>The movie has its shortcomings. The plot is... well, more or less non-existent. There is almost no character development. And even if you know the mythology of Mad Max, it will be more than a little confusing for the first hour trying to figure out what ""war rigs"" are, and why a bunch of pale guys have Max strapped to a car. And why do we have a man with a flame-spouting guitar? What purpose does he serve? So it is not a shock that of its impressive list of nominations, none are for the writing or the acting. How could they be? While there is probably an art to scripting fights, this is really fleshed out on set. And the acting is... well... hard to say. Most of the good moments were probably handled by stunt people.<br/><br/>But the categories of costume, makeup, production design, effects and more are all clearly visible. Even the cinematography. This is a dystopian future in a desert, and yet Australia looks more vibrant than ever before. I would not expect the film to take home a cinematography award, but it is obvious why it was nominated. The best bet for a stature is in production design, and maybe in visual effects, but then they would have to fight off ""Star Wars"".<br/><br/>What will likely happen is ""Mad Max"" ends up being the biggest loser of the Oscar ceremony. With ten nominations, it has just about the most to lose... it will be lucky to go home with one or two. Because, frankly, the Best Picture nomination is a fluke. This is not the sort of film that typically gets the nomination, and it is far less likely to win when it is supported by mostly technical achievements. It simple does not have the dramatic weight of competitors ""Revenant"" or ""The Martian"".<br/><br/>The odds are better for a Best Director win. While this is unlikely, it is not impossible. Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Tom McCarthy are the front-runners, but ""Max"" and director George Miller can edge out ""Room"" and ""Big Short"", right? Seeing a cult director from Australia win would be incredible. Not likely, but possible, and certainly a nice change..."

","I finally got around to watching Mad Max: Fury Road and am pleased to say I got exactly what I was looking for: a non-stop joy ride full of amazing chase scenes and post-apocalyptic imagery. I will first say that this movie is not for those looking for strong character development. A lot of the characters develop in a ""show-and-tell"" manner and not with deep, evolving stories. On to the characters: Charlize Theron is amazingly bad ass as Furiosa. She's a great female protagonist who is not about the male fan service. In fact, this movie is full of strong female characters. Max serves as more of a side character in comparison. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Mad Max was as close as the original as I could have hoped for, but I still believe Mel Gibson captured the cynical, self-serving nature of Max's character better than Hardy. Overall the most impressive male character was Nicolas Hoult as Nux, the war boy who was raised for one purpose: to fight and die for Immortal Joe, the main antagonist and warlord of the Citadel, who goes on to betray Joe and help Furiosa and Max. Joe, interestingly enough, is portrayed by the same actor who played Toecutter, the main antagonist from the first Mad Max film.<br/><br/>Fun characters, great chase scenes, and non-stop action make Mad Max: Fury Road a must-see for anyone looking for a great action flick."
"emonaghan-64172","9","2","9","31 October 2015"," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","I saw this movie when it first came out without any expectations. I had not even watched the trailer before I walked into the theater, so I had no real idea of what I was about to see. The movie blew me away; the acting, the visuals, the soundtrack and the action were all stunning. <br/><br/>My predominant reaction, however, was to the character of Imperator Furiosa and everything she stood for. Many people are calling this movie a ""feminist"" movie, but George Miller, the director, once said that it was not his intention to make a female empowering film. He was not upset that it had feminist themes, however. That impressed me the most; he had unintentionally made a movie that had a strong female character which is how movies should be. The film industry should not be shocked when there is a movie with an action hero that is female, and that is the effect of Mad Max: Fury Road. Mad Max did not make it a huge deal that it had a woman like Furiosa in the lead, it just did. It did not sexualize her, or put her in a love triangle, she was just another hero.<br/><br/>I cannot conclude my review without mentioning the idea of ""visual music."" George Miller said that it was his intention to create a movie that could be watched in a language that you do not speak, but you would still understand it. The lack of meaningful dialogue from Max was taken by many as poor acting on Tom Hardy's part, but I think it all had to do with Miller's visual music technique. The product was beautiful, and I could watch Mad Max over and over again and still find new ways to love it."
"samfischer88","10","2","9","28 October 2015"," Wow... Amazing
","George Miller really is a mastermind! This was essentially 90 minutes of pure adrenaline rush. Tom Hardy hardly had to talk, and he still gave a thrilling performance as the new Max. He is a certified action star now! Max is taken on an adventure when he is used as a blood bank for Nicholas Hoult's character. He ends up escaping his role and meets up with Charlize Theron as she helps out the Villain's many child baring wives. George Miller and Hugh Keays-Byrne did an absolutely fantastic job developing the villain, Immortan Joe. He is this years best villain, and it won't be close at all. He is an absolute terror that is relentless in pursuit of his wives. The chase scene as Joe chases his wives is about 90% of the movie, with absolutely crazy stunts and events occurring in this chase. George Miller showed everyone what a chase scene should be (Take note Fast and Furious Franchise). There are some twists and heartbreaks along the way which really adds to the main storyline as well, just proving that Miller knows exactly what he is doing with the Max franchise. Just sit back, and enjoy the ride!"
"smmb-75867","10","2","9","28 October 2015"," Mad for Mad Max
","Mad Max Fury Road was an outstanding visual experience with relatable characters and a world that is so insane, you wish it was real. Max Rockatansky was perfectly portrayed by Tom Hardy who had big shoes to fill after Mel Gibson. Max did not feel invincible like many of the other characters in this movie. This made everything just more realistic. I enjoyed the fact that Max was again portrayed as a man who is trying to survive in the brutal wasteland created by director George Miller. Max really does look ""mad"" in this movie with the images from his past haunting him throughout the movie. Imperator Furiosa was another bad ass that really focused on trying to save the human cargo. The Immortan Joe was gross and terrifying and I couldn't love this character even more. The way he portrays himself as a god was a big part of the story and character development. The action was amazing and in my mind this is the best action movie of all time. If not that then at least the best action movie of the last fifteen years. This film definitely surpassed the previous best movie of the series, Mad Max The Road Warrior. The reality of this world was frightening, but was so awesome that I felt I wanted to be apart of it. The cars alone was something that drew me into the wasteland. The fact that so little is left, but they can make so much of it is an important part of the world. The madness of the war boys was completely insane and crazy and that is what a Mad Max film is all about. Overall, this film is a great action movie that should be watched on the big screen. I had a great time watching this movie and can't wait to return to the wasteland and for Tom hardy to come back as the words greatest survivor."

","The only exposure to the Mad Max franchise I had before this one was ""Thunderdome,"" that piece of 80s hoo-hah that was all big hair and snarly performances. So I came into ""Fury Road"" fresh, with no expectations and no comparisons to make.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. A strange claim to make about a film with such a dirty, grungy setting, peopled with characters out of a post-apocalyptic nightmare. But it is absolutely visually stunning and a reminder that beauty in film is about much more than pretty scenery and cinematography. George Miller and company turn this action film into a ballet that left me almost ecstatic with excitement and reminded me how infrequently I see a film that's truly cinematic and how much I love it when I do. The film is mostly one long sustained set piece that in the hands of a different director would become monotonous and boring, but not here. Stunt actors tumble, fly, crash, and swoop in and out of the frame while vehicular carnage is filmed with all the love of a romantic dance. There are narrative themes that tempt one to take the film more seriously than is probably wise -- beyond the obvious one of environmental crisis, the film evokes thoughts of the religious fundamentalism and tribal warfare plaguing the Middle East. But this movie is more about movement than anything else, and I was happy to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are great at what they're asked to do, which is mostly grunt and kick butt. And if the makeup artists do not at least get nominated for an Academy Award for their work, there is no justice in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"PurePolonium","10","2","9","19 October 2015"," Simple yet elegant.
","This film is no Memento when it comes to plot, and Max only makes a few appearances but I am not complaining. As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy I honestly did not have high expectations when sitting down to watch this film, considering that very few new continuations of franchises are good. However...George Miller has outdone himself, and I applaud him. The editing and pacing flows and the action scenes are so spectacular that they would make any director jealous. This movie is a simple film with an idea that everyone working on Fury Road has stuck to and improved upon vastly. This film is definitely a worthy addition to the Mad Max franchise and I look forward to future installments."
"leonblackwood","8","2","9","12 October 2015"," Great action and intensity throughout! 8/10
","Review: What an epic ride! I'm not one for remakes but this was a great movie. It's full of action, right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing. Personally, I think the movie should have been called Mad Furiosa because Max hardly said a word through the whole film. Anyway, in this movie you see Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels, she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland, Joe soon realises that his wives have escaped, so he gathers his various gang's together, so he can get them back. Max also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping Furiosa on her impossible mission. The storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie, kept me on the edge of my seat. Charlize Theron's performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant. It does end quite abruptly so I hope they come out with a sequel soon. I'm waiting to see Mad Max kick butt because there wasn't that much depth to his character. That's not to say that Tom Hardy didn't play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story. Hopefully he will do in the sequel! Anyway, it's definitely one of the best films that I have watched this year and for a remake, it makes the original look mediocre. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Charlize Theron, 40, first came on the scene in the Children of the Corn III, if anyone actually saw it but most people remember her in Two Days in the Valley in 1996. After starring alongside Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do, she played a major role as Keanu Reeves wife in the Devil's Advocate in 1997 which pushed her to the big league. Her next major role was alongside Johnny Depp in the Astronaut's Wife in 1999 and after the successful Legend of Bagger Vance, she starred with Keanu Reeves again in Sweet November. After that she had a string of average movies like 15 minutes, Trapped and Waking Up In Reno and then she starred in a leading role in the Italian Job remake. In 2004 she won an Oscar & Golden Globe award for the best leading role in Monster and she was nominated for the same award for North Country in 2005. After the disappointing Aeon Flux movie in 2005, she didn't really come back into the limelight until she starred alongside Will Smith in Hancock, which I quite enjoyed. She then got high praise for her role in Young Adult in 2011 and she also starred in the long awaited Prometheus. After that she proved that she can tackle most genres by starring in Snow White and the Huntsman and a Million Ways to Die in the West and then she comes out with this movie were she put in a terrific performance. I just hope she returns for the sequel! This movie was directed my George Miller who also made the original Mad Max movies. He also directed the Twilight movie, the Witches of Eastwick, Lorenzo's Oil, Babe and Happy Feet 1 & 2 so he definitely has experience in different genres. Its planned that he will be directing the sequel Mad Max: Wasteland so I hope that he doesn't spoil the franchise, now that this movie made such a healthy profit. Anyway, the cast was perfect and the concept was fresh and definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $375million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies about a man who helps a radical woman to bring 5 pregnant women to safety. 8/10"
"pkneer","8","2","9","10 October 2015"," A Wild Ride
","I was reluctant to see this film because I really liked the original Mad Max Road Warrior and from the trailers it appeared to be nothing more than a good remake and I rarely like remakes. <br/><br/>This movie has more action and stunts in any movie I have ever seen. Sure looked like a large majority of those stunt were physically done, without CGI - and for me, made it much more enjoyable. <br/><br/>If you want a film that throws everything at you for a solid 2 hours, then this film is for you. Don't think about whether any of it makes any sense. I stopped once and thought, ""How far can all of these souped up vehicles go on a tank of gas?"" Aw, forget it and just enjoy the carnage."
"halan-78895","9","2","9","9 October 2015"," Dark, high octane, Ruthless movie !!
","In a world where civilization has collapsed, water is scarce and humanity is broken. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the leader of a large group of survivors in a town called Citadel. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) escapes the town with Immortan's five wives in search for a better future and War boys were sent in search for them. While escaping, Furiosa meets Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) who was being held captive by the war boys who went in search for the wives. Once free, Max and Furiosa help each other and were on a path of survival. They headed east where Furiosa's childhood homeland once was, but after realizing the home where Furiosa once lived was no longer there. They decided to go back to Citadel and confront Immortal Joe. On the way back to town Immortan Joe gets killed by Furiosa giving the town of Citadel a sign of hope opening the water supply to the town. <br/><br/>Mad Max ""Fury Road"" is a ruthless, high octane movie. From its very first scenes you can feel the energy that the director George Miller is trying to project to its audience. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) speaks about how he used to be a cop and now he prefers to stay away from those who are alive than dead. Getting in his car and driving off he quickly realizes that he is being chased by War Boys, who are pale warriors with blisters all over their face due to the radiation. Max ends up being capture by the War boys after his car gets pushed sideways making him flip the car. <br/><br/>The introduction of the new Max Rockatansky as Tom Hardy was great in my opinion. A man of a few words, a lonely wolf, a crazy hard core Max. That is what I seem to remember from the previous Mad Max movies. The two hour long movie is full of stunts, explosions and car chases. The Computer Generated Imagery also known as CGI was slightly low as some of the explosions and actions sequences looked more like computer games than a movie. But you can easily forget about those details as soon as you see the types of vehicles they have with customized enormous engines and tires that not only use gasoline but also nitrous oxide to increase speed during those car chases. The director's idea of having a massive stereo on top of a truck with a guitar player who uses the guitar also as a flame thrower was mind blowing. You tend to have different perspective of where the music is coming when the action begins. This part will make you want to get in your car and drive fast while listening to a Metallica song. At least that's how I felt. The characters were great including the beautiful Charlize Theron, but it was hard to see Tom Hardy as Max. From the very few times that Max was speaking I couldn't seem to stop thinking of Hardy's English accent. Also, Hardy is so darn good looking. I felt like Max needed to be an uglier, raggedy actor like the old Max. <br/><br/>Overall this is a thumbs up movie. The movie kept me fired up to the end. Although the ending was clichéd, a happily ending story without a plot twist. I would still watch it again without a doubt."
"arthuradam","9","2","9","13 September 2015"," Read ONLY This Review
","When was Mad Max EVER about the story line? When was Mad Max EVER about deep character development? The answer is: Never. To all the whiners and soft-bodied movie critics out there, know this; Mad Max has always been about action, fuel, chrome, punks, fast cars, spikes, super-charged engines and bad-ass guns. It's as simple as that. If you want anything else, go hire The Notebook. I remember watching Mad Max 2 as a kid and walking out totally shell shocked at the roller coaster ride I had just been through. Only Star Wars came close to embedding itself into my subconscious in such a way. Back in the late 70's and 80's, post apocalyptic movies and shows were common. It was a cheap and easy setting for directors to create. All you needed were old factories, dry landscapes, a few rusty barrels and barbed wire. That's pretty much what Mad Max is, but in Fury Road you can add a dash of nitro. Mad Max is the king of post-apocalyptic adventure.<br/><br/>For those who haven't grown up on Mad Max, you really need to accept that this movie is all about non-stop, turbo-charged, over-the-top action. Once you understand what Mad Max is all about, you can sit back and just enjoy the spectacle. You won't see action this good in any movie. Just think of it as a roller coaster ride for your brain.<br/><br/>Mad Max is set in Australia, years after a nuclear war has desolated the planet. There's little hope for the human race and man has fallen back into the age of barbarians. As Max explains, ""I exist in this wasteland, reduced to one instinct: survive."" That's pretty much all you need to know. The almost non-existent plot fills in small gaps between raging, high octane induced action. The stunts are fast and awe inspiring. <br/><br/>The only gripe I have with Fury Road is that, like most movies these days, the do-gooder, left-wing, progressive dribble has seeped into this production. Here we see the need to show the world that women are strong willed, powerf... Zzzzz... Oh, yeah, you'll see 80-year old women jumping on the tops of racing trucks and Theron personally taking down an army of lean barbarians. It doesn't work. No matter how hard you try and force feed us this pre-fabricated notion that everyone is physically equal, we'll never fall for it.<br/><br/>That said, I recommend this movie if you are in the mood for action and don't really care for a deep story."
"thenewneandertalien","5","2","9","8 August 2015"," Anti white racism. Otherwise entertaining.
","The Propagandist Cabal, which also runs Hollywood, becomes increasingly anti-white racist. This ""Mad Max"" is heavily anti-white and anti- European racist. Indeed, whites are pictured as fagots, insult Valhalla. I even spotted that the degenerates have a black and red banner which may refer to the flag of Ukrainian volunteer battalions, who at this moment fight Kremlin's invasion in Ukraine. The degenerates in the movie call their paradise ""Valhalla"". I suggest the word ""Valhalla"" to be removed. Because it is used uniquely in brainwashing purposes, to engrave negative associations with European culture in the brains of the cattle-citizen. There are also other propaganda messages. Otherwise, the movie is entertaining. There is a lot of creativity in the design of vehicle and action scenes. The verdict: 1) worth watching 2) worth protesting against the anti- white and anti-European racism."

The film definitely got more intriguing as time went on and after nearly walking out I am so glad I didn't because Id of missed a great piece of film. Tom Hardy is a brilliant actor and was at his finest in this. Also Nicholas Hoult was fantastic in this he nailed the role of a half life and played it exceptionally well. Overall if you haven't seen any other mad max film it will take you by surprise at first but trust me the more you watch the more attached and intrigued you become, and you come away thinking wow that was a really good ever lasting plot.

Clearly this movie is not for everyone specially if you are into Almodovar style! This is a Romero Night of the living dead. It's a hidden gem of dirt, fire and blood.

"littleging12","10","2","9","26 June 2015"," Awesome, but what could have been...
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements of cinema captured on film in recent years. The explosive exhilarating action sequences were masterfully directed by yes, a true mastermind and genius George Miller. George Miller, creator of the Mad Max trilogy with Mel Gibson, brings his franchise back from the dead with this monster of a movie. <br/><br/>The film takes place in a post apocalyptic wasteland filled with mad (crazy) people. In the very beginning of the film we are introduced to a tortured and damaged man named Max Rockatansky. Max is our protagonist and hero of the story. He is haunted by his past and his failure to save the ones he loved. He is the definition of a loner until he is captured and taken back to 'The Citadel.' He then gets involved with the chaos when he meets Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa; a one armed woman looking for redemption. Together they team up to take the abused wives of the main villain, Immortan Joe, to find asylum out in the desert. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are perfect fits for the lead roles due to their wide ranged acting skills particularly those of Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>As every moviegoer should know a movie villain is very important to the film because not only does he or she help drive the plot but can also be responsible for the movie's awesomeness. We are in for a treat with Immortan Joe who you can tell by just looking at him that he is one evil and sinister dude. Immortan Joe presents himself as a god living amongst his people. He hogs all of the valuable resources in the wasteland and this gives him his power. His war boys are so loyal to him that they will do anything for him like the League of Shadows guys from ""The Dark Knight Rises."" <br/><br/>The practical effects of the movie create an old school kind-of-vibe throughout the movie but it pays off well because it is so realistic and looks way better than computer animated special effects. The practical effects look fantastic in this film and hopefully it inspires future filmmakers to use this technique rather than CGI. Don't get me wrong, CGI can be a valuable tool but it is overused in film today. The stunts were also spectacular to look at and honestly some of the best I have ever seen. Overall, the action of the movie in one word: Amazing!!! This movie will surely bring in Oscar nominations. <br/><br/>So aside from the cool characters, special effects, directing technique, and action: what a movie really needs to be a masterpiece is a great story. Though ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" did not slack in this category; it was just to a minimum. The story was basic and presented in a rare way without any real exposition, making it a little difficult to get a good grasp on the story. Though this is not necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Miller's clever approach to this made the beginning to be somewhat complex as it forced the audience to figure out this world without any real introduction.<br/><br/>Also Miller wanted to tell the story with the visuals, so there is not much dialogue throughout the film. So pretty much the opposite of a Quentin Tarantino Movie. Again not necessarily a bad thing because the plot still flows well; although it does not allow for a lot of development of many cool characters. Miller once said in an interview, ""They won't have to read the subtitles in Japan."" This will surely make it easier on foreigners but has no factor in making the movie better. Also the movie did not have the most memorable dialogue, but was more memorable than the old Mad Max films. Some lines tried too hard to be movie catchphrases while others worked perfectly for the scene.<br/><br/>Though as awesome as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was I cannot give it a 10 because of its basic story. I wish the movie was a little longer with more development, dialogue and focus on the story, so it would make the movie even more epic with higher stakes, purpose, and emotional appeal. Compared to other action classics like ""The Matrix"" and ""The Dark Knight"" which had great stories along with groundbreaking action; ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" did not quite reach those heights but reached farther heights than most action movies of recent years.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" had potential to be one of the greatest action movies of all time but just barely missed. At the end I found myself saying ""really that was it,"" and I wanted more. Still ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an awesome movie that most will enjoy and appreciate. Can't wait for the sequels. 9/10"

","First off, I'll start by saying I was not impressed by the trailers and immediately thought this movie wasn't going to be great. I played Borderlands so I do like this kind of setting as well (and they are almost identical; yes I know Mad Max came first).<br/><br/>As an action film that is already a sequel, this film is absolutely amazing. Once I realized it was like 98% action and 2% of the film talking, I was still impressed by the cinematography as well as the well directed scenes. This film has amazing acting on almost all parts. While the mannerisms and behaviors of the War Boys in the Citadel made me lose brain cells, I think the acting by everyone was amazing.

I think a film like Gladiator had the right balance between a good story and some great action scenes but for me personally Mad Max Fury Road misses being a classic because the plot is too simple. On the plus side Miller steps on the throttle like an F1 driver who has nothing to lose and gives the viewer a ride into the chaotic."

Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I mean, it's the closest thing to a proper Borderlands movie I'll ever get. And Charlize was a goddess as usual. But did it deserve all this? Probably not. I lost interest around half-way through the ridiculously long chase around the wastelands, but I decided to stay longer and watch more in case of a major plot-twist. But no, instead you get what I'm assuming to be failed clones of Daenerys Targaryen. And really? How convenient was it that she had a contraction right when it was critical to remain silent. I will admit that the overall execution was impeccable, but the whole thing revolved around escaping from the oppression, only to decide to go back. It really felt like a story-less movie adaptation of Borderlands. As I said, it could be just me as this is the first Mad Max movie I've watched. In Short, the overall ""battle"" scenes and the environment were absolutely stunning, and the acting was on point, but I felt the story was a bit lacking..."

"texshelters","7","2","9","4 June 2015"," It's the stupidest movie I have enjoyed in a long time.
","Mad Max: Fury Road<br/><br/>To quote Joe Bob Briggs, the world's most famous drive-in movie critic, ""There's no plot to get in the way of the story.""<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road (MMFR) is set in a dystopian future where warlords rule and fight over oil and water in a desolate, desert land outside any rule of law. That would NEVER happen. <br/><br/>It's the stupidest movie I have enjoyed in a long time. The sets aren't wonderful. And the acting what acting? The editing? Meh. The cinematography is okay, not spectacular for a dystopian road movie. The make up? Nope, not great. <br/><br/>What works in the film is the action and morality tale. And the vehicles, the vehicles are COOL! (i.e. fascinating) I'm not a gearhead by any stretch, but what they did to mix different vehicles together to make scary road war machines was very successful. <br/><br/>Like the horrendous (there are no words to describe how bad) Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (1985), MMFR is a morality tale not about saving Max but about saving the innocent. However, the writers were smart this time, giving Max few lines and making the female protagonist, Imperator Furiosa, the star. <br/><br/>If there was an Oscar category for best stunt work, MMFR would win hands down. It's fun to watch while incredibly improbable. However, because it is set in its own world, we accept that. Furthermore, there are no posturing heroes spouting diatribes from patriotic speeches (Avengers) or camp and cute but deadly, sorts of heroes (Guardians of the Galaxy) or a vomit inducing good versus evil dualism that pervade so many super hero and other action films. While violent and full of explosions, it doesn't insult us with such morality play nonsense. MMFR is pure action; take it for leave it. Rating: Matinée/Full Price<br/><br/>If action without pretense is your cup of tea, if you are sick of the simplistic good versus evil plots, if you like characters that don't easily fit into a box called 'villain' or 'hero', than you will enjoy MMFR. If you need those things or you want more plot or thought, I understand. I would recommend you stay home and watch the also entertaining ""Theory of Everything."" But you'll miss some bad ass vehicles <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

","Mad Max! One of the best movies I have ever seen! I found it amazing that they could make an entire movie about a car chase and make it so interesting. It was well filmed and I liked the style as well as the great plot. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy did the role really well and I thought it was cool that a main character could have such little line in the movie and yet still give such a character. <br/><br/>The craziness and weirdness of this movie makes it even better. I think that Nicholas Hoult did well in playing that out (Favorite line ""What a wonderful day"")<br/><br/>As someone who is a big fan of the old series, I was a little worried that this would not be up to standard but this movie definitely destroy the old ones!<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action packed adventure. Overall a fantastic movie! Good job George Miller!"

","Mad Max is great 80's action movie of 2015. This movie is great for the wide screen,the action is not CGI all real, the hero Furiosa not Max, the villain Immortan Joe awesome, and the grand scope mix it with the amazing soundtrack with the guy shooting fire out of his guitar. This movie is nuts and that's what makes it great it's different then your normal action movie. Tom Hardy is good as the character Mad Max, Charlie Theron as Furiosa was amazing, Nicholas Hold as Nux was pretty good. And the direction of George Miller is at it's best, he made a modern touch to this Mad Max world. But I must talk about the action, so great wide shots, no shaky cam, oh my god this is one of the best movies of the year and were not even done with it yet."
"caseynicholson","8","2","9","24 May 2015"," A Triumph for the Mad Max Franchise
","On the front end of this review, let me say that I watched the Mel Gibson ""Mad Max"" trilogy in preparation for seeing this movie. I was brand new to the franchise, having only seen bits and pieces of the original films as a kid. Having watched those movies recently, I'm now judging ""Fury Road"" based on both its strengths as a film in general, but also as it compares to the other films in the franchise.<br/><br/>That said, I've rated ""Fury Road"" at 8 stars, giving it a one star advantage over the Gibson trilogy, which I rated at seven stars each. I suppose that means that I found ""Fury Road"" to be the best in the franchise overall. I'm still partial to the original ""Mad Max"" in terms of storyline and the character development behind Max himself, and my reviews of ""Road Warrior"" and ""Beyond Thunderdome"" both mentioned that my biggest gripe with those films is that Max's origin story from the original movie is completely cut off from the later films.<br/><br/>That trend continues in ""Fury Road"". If you watch the first movie in the series and enjoy it at all, you may be frustrated that the next three movies, ""Fury Road"" included, have little to do with the original film. That said, I've come to peace with the fact that the franchise from here on out is going to follow the now-established formula of making Max a nomadic adventurer who happens to get into lots of quandaries in the post-apocalyptic Australian Outback. If you come into ""Fury Road"" expecting that and nothing more, then you won't be disappointed with this film at all.<br/><br/>The film's individual merits are noteworthy. The movie starts off a bit awkward, with a capture scene that gives no background and provides very little in the way of plot development. That awkwardness on the front end of the film is the main reason that I've rated this film at eight stars and not higher. <br/><br/>However, I must say that ""Fury Road"" does do something that I feel is rare in filmmaking today. It tells its story in a way that doesn't go into great detail about either the basic gist of the plot itself or any of the main characters, and yet along the way it tells you all you need to know about the story for it to be fun and well done. I found this style of movie making to be a throwback to 80's films that somehow seemed to be able to utilize this method in a better way than the industry has done since. It's the same formula that was used in both ""Road Warrior"" and ""Beyond Thunderdome"", but ""Fury Road"" arguably accomplishes its task better than either of those two predecessors--certainly better than ""Thunderdome"".<br/><br/>It's also true that the film is well made in terms of both acting and visual effects. The visual style heavily emulates ""Road Warrior"", which I personally find to be a bit out there and abrasive, but despite my personal distaste for the dessert scene mixed with beater cars and leather clad minions, I nevertheless can admit that the film is well done visually. As for the acting, Tom Hardy plays his role well (albeit it's somewhat hard not to play a severely underdeveloped leading role that could have just as easily been ""Mad Mike"" or ""Mad Mitch"", since there's so very little about Max's character that comes through in the film--but that's a script problem, not an acting problem). <br/><br/>Charlize Theron, however, is the film's real star. It's uncommon for summer blockbusters such as ""Fury Road"" to feature acting quite as strong as Theron's. It may be inane to suggest that she might deserve a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for this role, but I wouldn't be terribly surprised if it happened.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie, like ""Road Warrior"" and ""Beyond Thunderdome"", is not a film that it takes a great amount of intellectual acuity to appreciate. But in spite of its lack of depth, it's nevertheless a fun, high paced movie that is a great two hour distraction. It's doubtful that you'll want your money back, even if it's not your favorite film of the year."
"engelst","8","2","9","24 May 2015"," Great fun and somehow brilliant
","I've grown up with Mad Max. The first came out when I was 16. I have seen all the movies numerous times, I've even been to a Mad Max Marathon, to see MM I to III. So, without being a hardcore fan, I like Mad Max a lot. But after Mad Max III I decided (and a lot of fans with me, I'm sure), that it was probably better to leave it there.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema expecting a rehash of the old Mad Max, but boy was I in for a surprise. George Miller has outdone himself and created a worthy successor that may even be better than parts II and certainly III.<br/><br/>The makers have squeezed every little bit of extra fun there was in the story and managed to put all this fun into a well-balanced movie that never stops, even though it manages to have a few quiet moments. I liked the humor and the timing especially. It is the best action movie I have seen for a long, long time for exactly that reason.<br/><br/>The only bit of criticism I have is Tom Hardy or maybe his presence in the movie. Did he have a fight with the director? All I know is, for a main character he doesn't have anywhere near the screen time he should get. Nicholas Hoult (compliments to him) stole a lot of it. Looks suspicious. Now I don't know Tom Hardy all that well, but I think he's capable of a lot more than what we get to see here. Which is basically a lot of muscle and very little facial expression or dialog.<br/><br/>All in all though this has to be one of the best post-apocalyptic movies of all time and an example of how to make action fun. It makes Death Proof look old.. very, very old."
"Aylmer","8","2","9","18 May 2015"," No MAD MAX 2, but about as good as could be expected with modern action sensibilities
","In my view, writing comments on current releases is fairly pointless as they'll disappear into all the noise, but the MAD MAX franchise is one I'm particularly passionate about, so allow me to attempt at some degree of objectivity while writing this glowing review. I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to action and sci fi movies. In my view, stunt work is much less impressive when half or more of it is accomplished via green-screen and rendered human beings. Science Fiction relies on visual stimulus and often massive destruction effects (miniatures, matte painting, and stop motion) to add to the constructed universe and entertainment factor, now diluted so much by the knowledge that rooms full of outsourced nerds in Canada, India, New Zealand and China are clicking pixels around until everything is absolutely ""perfect"". So in my view, making an action and stunt-heavy science fiction film in this day and age is an uphill battle to impress a weary action fan such as this, but this film did the best job it could.<br/><br/>Was it perfect? No. There were issues with pacing, inconsistent character development, some awkward CGI (yes especially in terms of CGI humans for stunt work), and Hardy's performance and characterization not quite up to snuff. I was also put off by some distractingly gimmicky 3D shots like a steering wheel floating in the screen after an explosion.<br/><br/>Perfectly imperfect? Almost. If this film had brought back a haggard 60+ Mel Gibson finding HIS redemption and otherwise been the same I would have given it a 9. I absolutely love how The Toecutter from the original MAD MAX returns here as Immortem Joe, showing that geriatric villains can be just as threatening as any other. With each successive MAX film there has been more and more of a feminist approach to the presentation of tough women dominating men. In this film, they go a bit over the top with it, but not to the point where it's utterly unbelievable a la HUNGER GAMES where a scrawny woman has no problem defeating a muscle-bound man in a fistfight without even taking breaking a sweat. Refreshingly, a lot of the female characters are put in just as much peril and take just as much unceremonious damage and fatalities as their male counterparts. All things being equal, it's great fun and something new, though at the end of the day I can't see a lot here in this blighted dystopian landscape that would attract a lot of female viewers.<br/><br/>Reasonably entertaining? Of course. This film is loaded with a lot of carnage, stunt work, and visual stimulus including some delicious really wasteful and global-warming-contributing gasoline explosions of a like not seen since the 90's. The color palette is beautiful, the women gorgeous to look at, and some of the production design for the vehicles and sets some of the most creative of the steam-punk genre seen since BLADE RUNNER. A few moments really had me at the edge of my seat, such as the overlapping battling across multiple vehicles near the end. I only wish there was more of this.<br/><br/>What would I have changed? Max didn't need all those ghost voices following him around through the film, and could have used some character development outside of that. He could have played a more central role in driving the plot forward. The ending needed more of an impact or crazy crescendo to build up to. I'd have added another element such as a time factor on closing the pass, another tribe emerging, or a bigger explosion or mega-car-pileup to close things with. It's difficult not to feel a bit disappointed that things end on a whimper. Movies don't know how to end these days. Also, much like GRAVITY, this film suffers from protagonists living through things that would have killed anyone in real life. There's no way any human being would have lived through a couple of these high speed crashes (especially with one's neck chained to one of such vehicles), so I'd have ironically toned some of the danger down a tad to increase this universe's realism/tension level.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that an unrated release will be on its way. I'm picking this movie apart, but aside from what I mentioned, it gets so much right. It's got a crazy bald guy playing a flame-throwing guitar while wearing bright red 1800's pajamas for God's sake. It's one for the boys, but also one for anyone needing a modern big screen action fix."

","Note: I have not seen any other Mad Max films- but I intend to<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is without a doubt one of the most hyped blockbusters of the year. Featuring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron in the leading roles of George Miller's famous franchise, the movie generated a lot of buzz, and the trailer promised the uncompromising vision of George Miller. Which is exactly what we get.<br/><br/>Fury Road opens with a short montage explaining the events that create the wasteland that the film's ensemble will traverse. It's a bit choppy and generic, but it gets the point across. It then cuts to Max overlooking the quiet desert landscape, twitching at any sound before he hops into his car. The quiet is disturbed when a caravan of land vehicles come following after Max. From here on, the action is almost non-stop.<br/><br/>Mad Max isn't much in the way of character development; it isn't concerned with backstory or relationships very much. It simply places our main characters in a setting and lets them play around in it for two hours. While this may sound unorthodox, George Miller pulls it off with masterful ease. Using visuals, he establishes the rules of the citadel and the dystopian civilization they are living in a scene where Immortan Joe gives water to the people. We understand what is happening and who is important.<br/><br/>The movie soon takes us off course as Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, takes a detour from the supply run and Immortan Joe's ""warboys"", including overly- enthusiastic warboy Nicholas Hoult (in a role that is surprisingly well-suited for him), take off after her. Thus begins the epic chase. The movie is almost unrelenting in the amount of action going on at once, it is amazing to look at. There hasn't been more thrilling chase scenes in any film in years.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. With about half an hour left to go, the movie starts to feel rather monotonous. There is very little story to work with, which works great at first, but by the movie's end, it felt like my eyes took a ride, but not the rest of me. I left the theater feeling nothing for the characters, nothing to think about in regards to dystopia, and realize that what little story was there could have been told in five minutes. The movie does itself an injustice by only showcasing breathtaking action sequences and failing to dig just a little deeper. The actioner also suffers from the trope of the good guys being great shots while the goons are insufferably disposable and terrible shots.<br/><br/>Still, pretty much everything else works in Mad Max: Fury Road. The cinematography is gorgeous; the colors are saturated, rather than desaturated like most post-apocalyptic films, and the use of sweeping shots and wides give the audience a great view of the action. The editing is frenetic, but not in such a way that dizzies the audience. Jump cuts keep the tension high, and there are several disturbing inserts that represent the mental torment Max is really in. The soundtrack is thunderous and bombastic. The production design is outrageous and unique. And the actors, though they aren't given a whole lot to work with, are all believable in their roles. The one who really gets to shine here is Nicholas Hoult, a warboy on the trail of Max and Furiosa in the hopes of impressing Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Another point that should be applauded is the movie's portrayal of females; while most blockbusters are very male-dominated and often stereotype women as damsels in distress, the strongest characters in Mad Max are the women. Charlize Theron is scarred and has a prosthetic arm, but it doesn't stop her from continuously kicking ass throughout the movie's 2-hour duration. Max, as bad-ass as he is, isn't the best shot with a sniper rifle, and isn't so proud as to risk wasting ammo, and turns the rifle over to Furiosa. In a very symbolic image, one of Immortan Joe's ""wives"" removes the shackles around her crotch and kicks it away. Mad Max is liberating towards its females, and drops hints at the savage nature of men throughout the film, with writing on the walls of the citadel reading ""Who killed the world?"" and ""We are not things"". It's refreshing to see such balance in such a film.<br/><br/>Fury Road is a masterpiece of action, an uncompromising blockbuster with a unique and original vision. All the visual elements are in place but by an hour and a half, the spectacle wears off. It may not leave you with much to think about or feel after, but it's a great time at the movies and it plays to a different tune than most summer blockbusters. I know I'll be present at any future installments."

","Mad Max: Fury Road (2015): Dir: George Miller / Cast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hault, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: Explosive action packed reboot to the classic Mad Max trilogy starring Mel Gibson. This time Tom Hardy lands the role speaking less likely less than a paragraph of words. In a futuristic desert wasteland Max is captured and used as a blood bag until he makes a failed escape attempt. Hardy handles the action spending much time chained to the front of a battle rig that tears about the desert. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa who has one mechanical arm. She is driving a rig to fetch oil for the evil Immortal Joe who holds water against those in need. Furiosa is sent for gasoline but she secretly shelters fertile woman owned by Joe. When it is discovered that these women are missing, a chase is on for the betrayal of Furiosa. She is eventually aided by the resourceful Max. Nicholas Hoult steals scenes in a manic performance as Nux who seeks favour with Immortal Joe until he sees the error in Joe's vision and decides to help Max and Furiosa. Hoult is bald and completely concealed in white makeup for a ghostly affect. Hugh Keays-Byrne plays the tyrant Immortal Joe who deceives his people into believing he is everlasting. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a surprise performance playing the Splendid Angharad who is carrying Joe's baby but she refuses to reform to his ruling. Director George Miller returns giving fans the action and effects that mirror the previous films thus allowing Fury Road to journey with nostalgia for those fans of yesterday. Score: 10 / 10"

","Mild spoilers.<br/><br/>Mad max: Fury Road is an amazing action movie filled with practical stunts and a compelling story. For those who say it doesn't have one weren't paying attention to the movie. <br/><br/>First point, except for the first mad max, the character Max has been a side character. He is not the main point of the plot he is the vessel in which we get to experience this world. Which is why except for the first film the last three aren't in any chronological order.<br/><br/>Second point, for those screaming feminist this and that. The reason the women were so important in this movie is because the main villain was out to have a perfect child instead of warboys and damaged men and women. He fought hard to achieve his goal. In this world where they have water and gas and food and bullets they focused on achieving new and healthy life.<br/><br/>Third point, Max was mad, just how he was supposed to be. For those saying there was no character development need to look at the eyes and pay attention. I for one am tired of movies constantly taking half of the movie explaining through long periods wtf is going on. It is annoying. This had many visual and vocal cues of character growth and development. You just needed to pay attention.<br/><br/>Fury Road had a very deep and engaging story for those with more than one brain cell who had the ability to put together a simple crossword puzzle. This movie doesn't have quips and jokes it was mayhem and darkness, which is what it is supposed to be. It is isn't feminist it revolved around the women because that was important at the that time in the universe. <br/><br/>Bottom line, grow up and pay attention the details of the movie. We are adults you should be able to pay attention to small cues and story development."
"Tyson14","10","3","17","30 May 2015"," A new classic that demands repeated viewings
","Flesh and metal collide in the part sequel, part reboot, post apocalyptic, no holds barred Mad Max: Fury Road. 70 year old director George Miller returns to the franchise he created, 30 years after the last outing. This time with Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanity.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple, Furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland, and take Immortal Joe's young brides with her. Joe of course sets out to stop her and Max is caught up in this battle. Charlize Theron is fantastic as Furiosa, with her artificial limb and war paint, determined to find her home and reunite with what's left of her family. Tom Hardy as Max is a man of few words, troubled by visions of past horrors. Both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of Joe to safety. The film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of Max, Immortal Joe and his War Boys. The performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue, exposition takes a back seat here.<br/><br/>Unlike previous films in the series, the budget this time around of $150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director. The sheer originality on display is impressive. Stunning photography, high contrast, warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland. The jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable, Fast & Furious is a walk in the park compared to this. You must see it to believe it, but even then you still ask yourself, ""Is this actually happening?"" It has the right mix of CGI and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like James Cameron's Terminator 2. And it all looks awesome in 3D IMAX. The score by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) is loud, heart pounding, epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if for some strange reason you've been sitting on the fence. It's feral, dark, gritty, anarchic, surreal, just pure mayhem. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just any action film, it's one that sits side by side with your favourite Hollywood blockbusters, a new classic that demands repeat viewings for it's visual triumphs and sonic assaults. Now if you excuse me, i'm off to watch it again!"
"finn-palm","10","3","17","30 May 2015"," Character driven, believable, pulse driving (spoiler free review)
","The characters: First of all you should know that this movie is character driven as opposed to story driven. The characters' individual journeys, how they are developed over the course of the story, are very thought through and, although some of them will seem flat at first, they soon start to grow and change into individual personalities.<br/><br/>The setting: It explores the base human instincts in an unforgiving world with little comfort, where survival is the everyday struggle. It brilliantly portrays, through acting and directing, the insanity that affects this worlds inhabitants, and how their desperation to survive drives them to believe in anything that they're told that gives them hope.<br/><br/>The art direction: The visuals are stunning. Miller allegedly wanted the movie to be colourful because he thought that, in a world such as this, humans will try to gather every scrap of beauty they can find to try and make their hard lives a little more bearable. This coupled with the amazing Namibian desert makes for an impactful picture.<br/><br/>The acting: The portrayal of the different characters in the movie is fantastic. Even the supporting cast has memorable personalities that are conveyed through a few simple actions - The adaptable survivor, the long term thinking life lover, the weak one searching for security, the brave protector. And these are just supporting characters. The main characters are equally brilliant, and thanks to actors with a proved track record these are brought to life in a great way that makes their emotions your own - hopelessness, desperation, anguish.<br/><br/>The action: Here's one important aspect. The action will drive your pulse through the roof. From almost the very start the high pace will have you gripping your seat. An acquaintance of mine measured their pulse while watching the movie and was apparently doing heavy cardio excercise while sitting down. If you watch this in a movie theater you'll hear the audience gasp for air between the action sequences. It's like a roller coaster ride, and I'm not exaggerating.<br/><br/>Lastly I want to explain how I rate movies. I give them a number from 1 to 10 based on my initial feeling and then I go over the movie and try to find things worth retracting points for. In this case the initial impression was so good, and after analysing it I decided that neither of the two things that made me go ""huh?"" while watching the movie was worth retracting points for.<br/><br/>I will definitely watch this movie again and this is one of those few instances where I'll be getting a copy to put on my shelf as well."

George Miller reinvigorates the series that he started back in 1979, if you've never seen the original Mad Max and The Road Warrior, or even Beyond Thunderdome which is probably the weakest entry in the series, but a favorite nonetheless. Stop what your doing, go watch these masterpieces staring the legendary actor Mel Gibson, It will tell you the complete backstory of who Max Rockatansky was, before he became the survivor warrior that he is. I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy's and was stoked, when he was cast in role of Max, he brings a new and fresh take on the character. I've really missed the character of Mad Max, weather it's Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy in the role, it's feels so good to see the character kick ass, in a world without rules or governments, where survival is king. This film truly lives up to those that came before, and what is yet to come. If your a huge fan of the franchise see it you won't be disappointed!!!!. 10/10."
"Jack-Flood","5","1","3","31 March 2020"," Poor Mad Max Film
","I don't know if I'm one to talk since my favorite mad max movie is thunderdome and that seems to be many people's least favorite. But I can't stand to see this movie with its completely undeserved 8.1 rating on imdb putting it in the top 250 movies of all time.
I was shocked to see that a mad max film could have so little to do with the main character Max, and it become obvious that George Miller wanted to create a film that could appeal to new and old fans. New fans with the total badass one note lead female role, and old fans with Tom Hardy as Max. But the puppet strings from the writers were so clearly shown throughout the movie I can't believe more people don't notice how they are being pandered to.
Very, very poor remake"

","Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller and is the forth and hopefully not last in the legendary Mad Max franchise. The action in this movie was ABSOLUTLEY INCREDIBLLLLLEEEEEEE! and everything I was so desperate to see again in the Action film genre. The movie is shot PERFECTLY. Seriously, every single shot of this film has it's own place and purpose of pushing the action forward and the cinematography blended with the stunts and practical effects, explosions and destruction is electrifying to watch and is pure cinematic magic to behold in all it's pure kinetic and masculine glory. The sandstorm sequence was so incredibly well crafted and shot my jaw dropped the first time I saw it in theatres. It's still one of the most awe inspiring action sequences ever shot on cameras and put together in the editing room.<br/><br/>The film reeks with Australian wit and attitude and bleeds with human emotion as we relate to the struggle of Furiosa and her ruthless drive to save her people from the evil Immortan Joe's control. Many crazy and memorable character follow like the over confident, fanatical but easily influenced Nux, The Five Wives, Rictus, The Organic Farmer and of course, Max. Who is so mad that he barley even speaks, but he gets better throughout the film as his ability becomes better and better. Tom Hardy has incredible prescence in the movie with the mouth brace now becoming an iconic image in cinema history.<br/><br/>Fury Road truly raises the bar in what it means to make your movie as awesome as humanly possible. The action sequences are large in scale with so many different types of post-apocalyptic vehicles to play with, the rythym of the action is also pitch perfect and operatic in it's excecution. The explosions in this movie are joyous to watch and bring out that childlike instinct in you who just loves the beauty of watching things blow up that made you a fan of action in the first place. The whole choreography of the destruction in the movie is all directed with such complicated precision and structure, like the structure of a song or a sequence in a fireworks show. It's all pre planned with such brilliant motion and timing, again your jaw drops with just the style of how it all unfolds before your eyes.<br/><br/>Fury Road is perfect in it's style and execution and gives the action fanatic exactly what the want to see. A non stop action thrill ride aswell as an emotional story to boot with a vivid and detailed world and backdrop. The music is great too and again adds so much adrenaline to the whole experience. A vivid and practical action masterpiece that will go down in film and pop-culture history as an Australian classic showing George Miller's practical handcrafted techniques over CGI and conventional modern Hollwood action filmmaking style that slowly become the norm. We honestly need more movies like this again and I hope future blockbuster hear Miller's plea to reinvent the trend<br/><br/>Overall, pure razor edged Action masterpiece with Australian magic sprinkled into it's DNA with a compelling post-apocalyptic story and action squences which are ruthless in their delivery and will captivate and electrify the audience in it's style and scale with an outstanding female co protagonist Charlize Theron makes the movie. She was a pure badass aswell as being very emotionally depthed. I hope there is a next installment in the works, It will probably be more story orientated over Max's character and his relationship with the Australian wasteland around him and the characters that live in it over the action sequences, because I have no idea how the action showcased in this movie could be topped"
"davidmvining","10","1","3","21 November 2019"," Grandpa makes a great action movie
","The success of an action movie really depends on the execution of the action itself. This is generally why it's a bad idea to make a no-budget action movie unless you know how to produce good action without any money. A lot of money makes a lot of moviemaking easier, but, in particular, it helps with action scenes.<br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road was an expensive movie, and it shows gloriously. The story is super simple, and reminds me of Dredd. There's no complex plot to tangle with, just the personalities and the journey, a there and back again structure that lends itself really well to the type of action on display. Women try to escape a prison, drive across the desert, find their destination, and then head back. There's plenty of room for absolutely bonkers action sequences and a surprising amount of character work.<br/><br/>Our central and titular character Max grunts his way through the movie. He's far less verbose than he had been in previous movies (lending some textual credence that he's actually the feral kid from The Road Warrior rather than Max himself), but even though he doesn't talk he still has a well-defined arc. It's pretty much the same arc he has in both The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome where he's just out to help himself but finds himself helping a group of the weaker against a strong enemy. In The Road Warrior, it was the people mining the oil pump. In Beyond Thunderdome, it was the kids. In Fury Road, it's the breeders and their leader Furiosa.<br/><br/>Furiosa is great. She's headstrong but more impulsive than she thinks she is. She's prepared her escape well, but she didn't realize the scope of the troubles that would fall on her for her action. Without the happy coincidence of Max, she'd have either lost everything on the way out, or reached her destination and just driven out into the desert with 160 days worth of gasoline, hoping to find something.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe, the antagonist of the film, is such a fantastic looking character. With shades of Darth Vader in his breathing apparatus, a massive frame, and a terrifying voice, Joe has an incredible presence. It's easy to see how he would incite both great fear in his enemies and awe in his supporters. How he could use both his presence and position over a necessary resource (water) to create a slave state.<br/><br/>On top of all of this is some of the most incredibly impressive action I've ever seen. The key to elongated action sequences is finding ways to change the action around while keeping the pace going. You'd think that with a car chase, there'd only be so many combinations one could come up with, but this is where the weirdness of the Max universe really turns into an asset. It's not two cars in pursuit. It's a war rig followed by a variety of different vehicles with different weapons, speeds, and abilities. My favorite of them all is the pole cats, which the movie saves for the ending and uses to great effect. Those metronomic motions create great opportunities for visuals, including what might be my favorite single shot from a modern action movie.<br/><br/>It's amazing how George Miller, the grandpa of a director, maintains the pace and energy through all two hours. It's a magnificent thrill ride."

","A high octane, pedal to the metal, adrenaline rush. Mad Max: Fury Road, is a nonstop demolition derby of an action movie. It is stunning to look at and has some of the best choreographed action sequences ever filmed. But Fury Road is not only a feast for your eyes and ears. It also has some narrative heft and two terrific performances, by Tom Hardy and especially Charlize Theron. Theron's Furiosa, joins Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor as one of the great female action heroines of all-time. If you are looking for a heart-pounding action extravaganza, that has more than a couple of brain cells and is not populated by stock characters, then look no further.

"ElMaruecan82","6","1","3","13 September 2019"," Who said women were bad drivers?
","This is not sexism but only a joke in response to the radical feminism that seemed to be fueling every major franchise reboot today... with the exception of ""Rocky"".<br/><br/>Let's start positively: ""Fury Road"" provides the most spectacular chases of all the tetralogy but the film is only ""The General"" with bigger stunts though what made Buster Keaton's film appreciable is that he risked his neck. And I still have a fondness for ""Road Warrior"" over-the-top climax and the ""Plane, Train and Automobiles"" sequence concluding ""Thunderdome""... speaking of which, we're talking of a 30-year time span between the last movies and that he could pull effect both practical and effective to an audience raised by the digital revolution is perhaps the best stunt of all. Now, forgive my sophism but it takes more than action to make action movies work and ""Fury Road"" was so stuck to the steering wheel it took its driver for granted.<br/><br/>The first might be the slowest or the least thrilling of the four but that's how we were introduced to Max Rockatansky, his skills, his humility, his tormenting hesitation between settling down and sticking with the family or hitting the road to fight the filth of the Earth. The whole exposition culminated with the tragic loss of his wife and baby child. In the next films, Max had won its status as a pop-culture hero, he resented that word but that was part of his persona. ""Fury Road"" doesn't embarrass itself with such technicalities, if makes Furiosa an immediate heroine, a Joan of Arc without any character's arc.<br/><br/>The character had potential but she was as semi-developed character as as if we had met Sarah Connor in ""Terminator 2"" or Ellen Ripley in ""Aliens"". These heroines were fascinating not only for their backstory as non-warrior characters but for the fact that they weren't handled like flashbacks but as true plot drivers. Furiosa is strong and bad-ass already and God forbids Mel Gibson would be an aging Mad Max playing her mentor (too controversial), or for her to show any semblance of vulnerability (too taboo).<br/><br/>And as the emotionless, shaved-headed heroine (à la Joan of Arc indeed) she displays traits that play like ersatz of masculinity, cliché even by guy-movies standard. Tough, hardly talking, always right, Furiosa doesn't even shed a tear when one of the ""breeders"" die or when she discovers the sad truth about the Green Place. I simply don't get what is so appealing in overly confident characters. Think of many icons, Michael Corleone didn't want to be a mobster, Travis Bickle started as Mr. Nice Guy, Rocky was a bum, characters who are perfect from the start might kick ass but they're ultimately boring, and a 120-format with 10% minutes for dialogues made of 90% of grunting doesn't help.<br/><br/>Still, one can appreciate the post-apocalyptic elements, violence, regression, the rarefaction of oil and water, but the first films covered all these speculative aspects. ""Fury Road"" just takes one step forward, after settlers vs. gangs, then marauders vs. migrants, then new glimpses of civilization, it's fair to imagine a neo-fascist world ruled by men and relegating women to their primitive functions: breeding and nurturing. There's something visionary in the way the film switches from the usual horizontal struggle (nomads vs. settlers) to vertical domination, but it also implies that in order to survive, women must display the same skills as men, elevating driving and fighting as Darwinian assets.<br/><br/>The film suggest matriarchy and self-determination as salutary options, after all the plot is about 'selected' women being freed by one of them. So basically, the alternative from being locked away by men is to be their own master. The problem is that unlike the previous films where children were present among settlers, ""Fury Road"" is rather pessimistic, implying that couples won't exist. And since the feminist take doesn't disregard the necessity to have children (for the survival of mankind), one must consider how they will have them if not by exploiting or using men as well. This feminism ironically depends on power perceptions inherited from men. Is it such a coincidence that all the fugitives are beautiful and the obese milk providers are left to their condition?<br/><br/>The film contains some epic-looking images and thrilling sequences but with a rather thin and manipulative plot served by very one-dimensional characters, and that goes for Furiosa too. She shares so many skills and personality traits with Max that I kept wondering what was Max' role exactly, except to be a foil for Furiosa, exactly what happened between Han Solo and Rey when she told him she could handle herself. And the film ends with the same acknowledgement from the original hero, foreshadowed by the name of Charlize Theron put above Tom Hardy in the opening shot.<br/><br/>This is not a hierarchy to trivialize, once again, we have a film where every man is flawed, weak and ironically, this is something I won't complain about because the War boys were touching in their twisted away and I liked Immortan Joe for even that scary dude had a weak spot. But ""Fury Road"" works exactly like ""The Force Awakens"", the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie, ""Toy Story 4"" or even ""Blade Runner 2049"", it recycles plots with that radical anti-male perspective, it's like the sole purpose of these reboots is to cure classics from misogyny they didn't have.<br/><br/>Because even the first ""Mad Max"" films had strong female characters, the old lady in the first, Max' wife that he failed to save, and Tina Turner who spares his life at the end of ""Thunderdome"", another thing they had in common: they were fun to watch, I wish one character could make us smile or chuckle at least once.<br/><br/>A product of its preachy and pedant era, the film takes itself too seriously and this is why it's my least favorite."

"Kelvimax","10","1","3","19 August 2019"," Best post-apocalyptic movie in ages.
","Amazing use of bright desert colors and not so blue night. Feels quite different than the usual dull theme for such movies. I love the use of live vehicles and scenes over excessive CGI. (Depends on movie type tho.) Building those vehicles, setting up real explosions, using real polecats and rock riders, all make the movie a better experience. 3-Act Structure plot well defined, as well as ""show, don't tell"" well executed. The tension escalated steadily, reaching the movie climax and giving a satisfying end. The return chase was action-packed.<br/><br/>Another kudo to Miller for cutting frames during any actions. Well thought of. Gives off interesting vibes. There's unfortunate logic in that humans would likely use other humans as meat and milk. Resources like food, water, and oil would be guarded and tyrants would rise.<br/><br/>You can see how poorly Joe views his people, war boys, produce, and breeders. Joe wasting so much fuel in his race is an amazing display of power. He's so ""rich"" he has enough to throw away. At least, that's the image he gives to his followers since he gets called out by the People Eater. Best line from Joe is the ""don't get addicted to water."" You'd expect someone to say the same, but for coffee. Also, the war boys, indoctrinated from childhood and proudly dying for a leader that doesn't care for them. Ouch.<br/><br/>Furiosa, badass strong female character represented in much more than just ""kick ass."" She earned her high rank position, although I'm sure it cost her arm. She wants redemption, surely for the horrible things she had to do. The war boys don't even question what she meant by detour. Taking Joe's 'wives' was such a bold move. Upon discovering the Green Place is gone, you can feel the pain with her.<br/><br/>Obvious that several women have been sexually abused, yet no need to show the actual act. Kudos for showing their trauma, feelings, and various reactions. The 5 'wives' were so diverse in personalities. Another plus for Joe treating 'his wives' well. They're healthy, educated, and have their own space, living the ""high life"" despite being rape victims. This way they will give birth to a healthy heir. It'd be no good if he treated them like trash and underfed them.<br/><br/>Max, literally haunted by his past, enough to hear voices and see things. Funny how Max is just there, along for the ride. Furiosa drives the plot and he follows. Thanks to Nux for bringing his 'blood bag' along. Plus, once Nux is separated from Joe long enough, he becomes saner. Even Max becomes more trusting. While Fury Road can stand on its own, it's useful to watch the previous three Mad Max movies to get a feel of who Max is and the world.<br/><br/>Use of the War Rig is top notch. That's one way to drive shiny and chrome. Best vehicle. It could even be its own character at this point. The storm was such a great render with an amazing quality and terror. Using lost knowledge and repurposing everyday objects are so realistic. Miller in his commentary is right that people would cherish the things they have left. Every scraps would be reused. The unforgiving hot desert wasteland, dunes, and dread are both astounding to look at and terrifying.<br/><br/>Another good note is the use of disabled people. Not just Furiosa's one arm or Max's insanity. The doof warrior is blind and I presume the drummers behind are too. Miller has done a great job in showing that physical and mental impairment don't prevent people from surviving the apocalypse. The use of medical conditions like fever, cancer, tumors, and stitched wounds make the environment feel harsh. Only a few, like the wives are in top shape because reasons cited earlier.<br/><br/>The acting. Entirely believable. The war boys are complete lunatics, suicide bombing, wanting a glorious death. Furiosa has one arm while the actress has both and despite this, you can believe an arm is missing in movement and use of the mechanical arm. As mentioned, the 5 eives with different personalities and Nux changing over the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, glad Joe is dead and Furiosa took his place, in a positive light."

Charlize Theron was pretty good as Furiosa. My only complaint (if you want to call it that) is that the film doesn't need to be rated R. It was a hard PG13, but no R.

"MihaiSorinToma","8","1","3","13 March 2019"," A good post-apocalyptic idea
","It's a post-apocalyptic movie which features an enormous wasteland where many fight for survival using highly modified, petrol-fueled war machines. The plot is pretty good, having an interesting premise and being non-linear an mostly unpredictable. It's filled with complex characters, each with its own problems and purpose who ultimately end up fighting for their lives. The scenes look great, the action is intense, generating plenty of drama and suspense, while bringing something new from time to time just to spice things up and keep the story interesting. The actors are great, doing a very good job in impersonating such unique characters, making them likeable but also credible.<br/><br/>In terms of downsides, I think that it could have had a bit more pace in some scenes as it tends to turn things to the boring side. It doesn't get there but a bit more pace could have done it much good. Also, the wasteland presented might be the perfect place for its vehicles to unleash their power but it seems a bit predictable, not leaving much room for something unexpected. Maybe a different choice of filming locations could have helped a bit in this department. But, by far what let me down the most was the wow-factor. It wasn't able to produce something that will blow your mind, something that will make you jump from your chair or chew your fingernails in tension. It's very good in all these aspects but not amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a movie which I enjoyed thanks to its plot, its characters but also thanks to its quality acting. The action plays an important role while some drama helps build up the great atmosphere. It could have done a bit more in terms of pace and predictability, limited of course to a couple of scenes which could have been improved, but overall it managed to be good and even very good in most aspects, providing a quality time watching it. Still, it's a bit far from impressive, fact which makes it a bit shy from the maximum rating."

It's true that Fury Road is a movie that can be enjoyed without thinking too much, its also true that's its a movie which has required an INSANE amount of work to produce.

Its a visual masterpiece and probably without exaggeration the best looking action movie ever made. 
to people claiming that its not well written, that is partially true. This movie wasn't written, it was story boarded - but writing good action sequences is one of the hardest thing to do as a screen writer and this movie has one amazing action sequence after the other.

","Where do I start ? I'm part of those very few who hadn't seen Fury Road to this day (we're in 2018), for whatever reasons. While I had some definite interest in it, I'm also part of those few who haven't seen the original Mad Max trilogy. 
Logically, when the fourth installment aired on French television, I was beyond excited. Well, Fury Road definitely lived up to my expectations.<br/><br/>(+)
<ul><li>Every character has a real purpose and follows through with it.</li><li>Junkie XL as the soundtrack. I swore all along this was him (Junkie XL is also responsible for soundtracks such as 300: Rise of an Empire - which was admittedly way better than the film itself).</li><li>The imagery. The artistry. It's a splendid film, which we don't see often in the action genre. The color palette is incredible, as well as the contrast. For most of the run, there's a lot happening on screen but the viewer is never lost in it.</li><li>The editing is just as superb.</li><li>Practical effects everywhere ! Another reason why it all looks so good (According to director George miller, 90% of the visual effects in Fury Road were practical), the stunts are impressive.</li></ul><br/><br/>(-)
<ul><li>I was left a bit perplexed as to why Norse mythology was mentioned/used by the War Boys. I might have missed something, but this felt a bit out of place to me, especially since one of their opponents was actually called ""The Valkyrie"".</li></ul><br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road was an exceedingly satisfying experience, I felt like all my senses were tingled and the first chasing scene with the War rig, the Buzzards and Immortan Joe's War Boys had me sitting on the edge of my seat - I was literally leaning forward, towards the screen, almost squinting by the end and letting out a little sigh when it did. The person I was watching it with had the exact same reaction and did exhale too, we were just that immersed.
The film manages to keep you interested despite a linear, simple story. It's all about survival, redemption, resurgence and hope; nothing original, nothing we haven't seen before, but George Miller succeeds on making it feel new, on creating empathy from us viewers for its (although numerous) mains. Also, and as the poster shows, the real main in this film is none other than Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a good (nearly silent) second lead.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Fury Road is proof you can make a beautiful movie with complex characters, female leads, a feminist subtext, violence, and a whole lot of action, all of that while appealing to a large audience. 10/10."
"callum-mccolgan","2","1","3","16 January 2018"," Stonk-boggeringly awful
","Mad Max Fury Road is loud, obnoxious, shallow and tedious. I honestly cannot think of the last action film I saw that I found to be so boring and painful to watch. Jettisoning such superfluous elements like plot, characterization, pacing, structure or purpose, Fury Road is left as little more than a non-stop 2-hour car chase.<br/><br/>There's beauty in simplicity to be sure (like Duel, or The Road Warrior for that matter), but the action in this film lacks any sense of progression or pacing. There's practically no meaningful transition between full-blown action and dreary overwrought dialogue - the film is either screeching up to 11, or not at all. And while the stunts themselves are indeed impressive for their practical feats, they soon get lost is the film's incessant white noise - at the end, I couldn't recall a single set-piece from Fury Road, just the sensation of a pounding headache.<br/><br/>Not that the 'story' parts are much better - despite having a strong pair of leads from Hardy and Theron, the supporting cast ranges from passable to positively awful. Even said leads aren't given much to work with aside from the occasional grunt or maybe even a strained attempt at actual drama. But these ring hollow and feel unearned in the film's mindless muddle. There can be great power in a simple story, but Fury Road feels less like a big-budget B-movie than it does a standard Hollywood story with all the non-explosive beats cut out of it (more so than usual I mean).<br/><br/>The scenery is spectacular to be sure, but it's also drowned in overly saturated shades of orange (during daytime) and blue (day for night) that make the whole setting look strangely fake despite the emphasis on practical effects. This isn't helped by the obnoxious editing, which makes heavy use of sped-up footage to pace the action scenes. This technique really does baffle me - yes, it was present in the originals, but does this really justify using a crappy technique that makes such scenes feel artificial and irritating to watch just for the sake of homage or nostalgia?<br/><br/>I don't usually like using the phrase ""I don't understand how people can like/dislike X"" since it just gives the impression that you've stopped trying to engage in any meaningful discourse or in trying to understand different perspectives. However, the acclaim behind Mad Max Fury Road really baffles me - this film seems to execute the worst habits of modern Hollywood blockbusters in the worst possible way, and yet has received universal praise from almost every quarter. I usually have a positive lean with movies, including those often disliked by others (such as Prometheus or Jurassic Park 3), but there's practically nothing in Fury Road that resonated with me on any level. Unless you count the migraine I received once this furious journey finally spluttered to a halt.<br/><br/>So that's one star for the spectacular Namibian scenery, when you can see it, and another for Theron, who really does deserve better material than this. Fury Road seemed to satisfy the vast majority of audiences; I just wish I could be among them."

","'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' is one of my favorite films of all time and I was really looking forward to seeing 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. When I heard there was going to be a new Mad Max film I was excited at the possibility of it being a great sequel, considering how disappointing 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome' was.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a sequel that would develop Max's character furthermore whilst building on the world the previous movies set up, considering the massive budget George Miller was given. I was hoping for an epic story with some depth, considering how the post-apocalyptic genre has evolved throughout the years through movies, books, video games, and television. <br/><br/>'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a horribly paced and horribly acted disappointment of a film. The action is extremely repetitive. The score is obnoxious. The editing is awful. The story is painfully basic. Character development is almost nonexistent. Character's make decisions without logic or reason. Max is pretty much a completely different character. In the original films Max was portrayed as a believable human being whereas in this film he is portrayed as a ""crazy"" cartoon character.<br/><br/>The only good things about this film are it's production design and use of practical effects.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a massive disappointment."

","This movie had everything. From war machines, to rugged vehicles, guns, action packed sequences. Everything but Max and his ""Madness"". This franchise were all about Max. His at times uncomfortable demeanor kept us excited every minute. Mel Gibson did a stellar job at this, at which Tom Hardy fails. He fails to deliver emotion or charisma of the character. He fails to capture the bitter experiences of Max. Well, flashes of some unrelated past events would not suffice! The character itself is frail in this installment. Max plays side-kick of Curiosa for the good portion of the run time.

The world of Mad Max is completely absurd and rich with details, it's visually stunning and the action is well choreographed and never fails to entertain. And characters seem like actual human beings instead of one-dimensional stereotypes. I've seen this movie 6 times already and will probably watch it another 5 times in the coming year.

","I wouldn't have thought that George Miller could overcome himself after the trilogy with Mel Gibson. But just look, this 4th movie is really super-rascal, I have no words to describe what pleasure I felt watching it for the first time. Great director, great story! I'll have to revisit it many times, and in much better conditions, on a larger screen (not on the laptop) and with the right bigger sound. Why? Because the movie is great, real show, it lets you breathless. Everything's super-cool. Starting with the setting of the Namibian desert and ending with Charlize Theron's amputated hand. This woman is beautiful even without a hand and with no hair on her head. Beautiful and gifted! I was just waiting to see an action movie and nothing more. But George Miller manages much much more, is far more profound than an exceptional action film, it's the highest quality adrenaline plus a simple touching humanist message. Once again, Charlize Theron, is a gorgeous, extraordinary actress. The scene when she realize that the green land where she was born doesn't exist anymore, is very strong. The whole movie is emotional, I was expecting to be more punk-rock, but it's a super-symphonic drama. Each frame is carefully filmed. The installation is staggering. Everything that moves on the screen is thought with great craftsmanship and attention. Every character, every actor, everyone is great. Unique show, super-show of great days. All is impressive, the bad guys, the young girls, the older warrior women, all the madmen, all the schizophrenics, are all out of an overwhelming world of the gloomy future of the planet Earth. And the cars, those metal monsters, the motorcycles, everything is super super. Great music and breathtaking shooting and editing. I would give it 11, but I can't."

"bowmanblue","7","1","3","5 July 2017"," Practical Magic
","""Mad Max?' who's he?"" cry the younger generation. Well, I guess he's Tom Hardy these days. However, to anyone born back in the seventies and eighties, he the titular character was synonymous with a different actor who has since majorly fallen from grace. So, in short – it's a remake. But, in that most rarest of remake traditions, it seems that the general consensus is that it's actually pretty good! Now, I was never that into the original films (I can't even remember whether there's two or three of them!) so perhaps I'm more forgiving and not exactly a 'Mad Max' purist, however, perhaps one of the reasons this new version is so well received is that it's written and directed by the original's director, George Miller.<br/><br/>It follows the same premise, i.e. in a post apocalyptic world (or 'Australia' as it's also known – boom boom!) gangs rule the deserts and fuel and water are the most rare – and therefore valuable – commodities that people will literally kill for. Enter one gruff loner (or 'Max' as we later find out) who's been surviving on the road all this time on his lonesome. However, his (sort of) carefree days of eating lizards and driving a cool car quickly come to an end when he's captured by a gang of those nasties who seem to come to be in every post apocalyptic world we've ever seen on screen. So he's tortured and killed and no one lives happily ever after. Just kidding. With the help of a load of other prisoners, he escapes and they all go on the run, hotly pursued by their psychotic former captors. However, just because you're on the run from people who want to strap you to the front of a high-powered vehicle and wear your skins for sun block, doesn't mean it's all bad. There are worse people to be on the lamb with than Charlize Theron (unless she's playing Aileen Phillips from 'Monster' I suppose!), so the pair of them do their best to fend off the constant attacks from the gangs, while protecting those who are escaping alongside them.<br/><br/>I guess if you were to sum up the film and try to pigeonhole it into a genre, you could say it's an 'action' movie, but I think the sub-genre of a 'chase' movie is more in order. It never really stands still for long and the film is ultimately one long chase across a desert, only stopping occasionally to gather a breath or two before everyone's off blowing moving vehicles up again. And, if that's your thing, then you're in for a real treat. Part of the enjoyment of this (very simple) film is that many of the special effects are real life stunts, as opposed to CGI or blue-screen work (yes, I think there may have been a little bit of the afore-mentioned effects, but it's pretty minimal) so you really get a feel of the danger the actors (or probably stunt people!) are going through.<br/><br/>Not only are the explosions all convincing, but the make-up is also really cool. And, by 'cool' I mean absolutely revolting! Although, it seems that in this dystopian future, only bad people are hideously mutated individuals and anyone who needs saving looks like a supermodel from a Victoria's Secret catalogue. Although, to be fair, it seems that once a woman stops looking like Cindy Crawford with slightly less make-up, if they still wish to stay on the good guys' side, they automatically become a hard-as-nails old crone who's got a heart of gold and a forehead that time forgot. Anyway, that's just me being picky, this film is fast-paced fun. If you like numerous explosions, car chases and general mayhem then go on a road trip with these people and you'll see how bad car travel can be – I promise you after seeing what these people have to endure you'll never moan again when all you have to do is drive a car with your kids in the back while they constantly ask, ""Are we there yet?"""

","Watching this film is like stepping into a lurid dime store novel. The setting is mostly desert and open road. The backdrop changes colors with the mood. The action feels spontaneous and inventive as vehicles explode and skinheads fly through the air like acrobats. The primary antagonist is a decrepit megalomaniac who monopolizes the water supply and literally milks and breeds women while driving his fanatical minions to self-destruct. To make this all less tawdry, his captive wives discover feminism and escape with a butch heroine, her posse of old biker chicks, and a romantic sap named Nux. Max helps guide the lost ladies to their true utopia. That, in a nutshell, is Mad Max: Fury Road. Sure, there's more--cretins with distracting deformities, a midget, a pregnant woman with an exposed belly, etc.--but none of it really matters. The world and its characters have a pulpy comic book shallowness. Either you like them or you don't.

Mad Max: Fury Road also includes Scandinavian Myhts. Problem lies in that. Myhtological sagas and dystopia anticipations should not necessarily be met.

","Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with ""Mad Max:Fury Road"". George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane ""chain to a speeding truck"" kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average"

It felt like the writer had a great idea, started writing, and just went with it wherever it took him. There was no real vision and because of that, the plot seemed lost.<br/><br/>Usually when a movie is as dark and revolting as Mad Max, the director tries to pull the viewers in by aestheticizing some part of it, be it a place or a character. Nothing about this movie drew me in, and i felt disgusted and uncomfortable throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The reason this movie gets a 7 from me is the decent acting and amazing stunts/filming.

","If you're going to make another Mad Max film, modeling it after Road Warrior (the best of the original three) is not a bad move.<br/><br/>This film hearkens back to Road Warrior, in that the whole movie is structured around the chase scenes, and if you aren't into chase scenes, you're watching the wrong movie. The souped-up vehicles are fabulous mechanisms, a hodgepodge of high-tech, hot rods and Neanderthalic sensitivity.<br/><br/>Even the movie's villain (Immortan Joe) is reminiscent of Road Warrior's Humungous.<br/><br/>The problem is: Tom Hardy is not Mad Max. Mel Gibson pretty much defined the character: self-centered; a survivor who approaches life as if he had nothing to lose; at the same time, a person who is willing to lay down his own life in the pursuit of someone's hope for a better life.<br/><br/>Hardy's character utters lines that convey similar meaning, but they don't seem to ring true. Gibson never had to say who he was - it was clear from the get-go. Hardy comes off as unmotivated, almost as if he's reading his lines. Even though he says his name several times, I never believed it (hey, if he has to tell you he's Max, it means he hasn't been able to convince you of that fact by his acting).<br/><br/>And where did the Bane voice go??? Gibson's Max was soft spoken, a deep, rough voice uttering as little as possible. Hardy's Max whispers, with a voice just an octave or two below falsetto.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I like Tom Hardy. He is certainly one of the up-and-coming actors of today. But if Hardy is in fact signed up for three more Mad Max films, those will likely be three Mad Max movies I won't be seeing."

","Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>In a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, female rebel Furiosa (Charlize Theron) goes against her tyrant leader by trying to get his female brides to a safe land far away. With the brides stolen the tyrant sends all of his force after them but with the help of the loner Max (Tom Hardy) they try to reach some place they can live with peace.<br/><br/>This is technically the fourth film in George Miller's franchise but I think it's safe to say that this here is the best of the bunch. Considering how good the original series was it's rather amazing to see how amazing this one here turned out. I usually don't try to speak too highly of a new movie because I think the true test for any great movie is time. I mean, how does a film work fifteen, twenty or thirty years after it was made? Does it stand the test of time? While watching MAD MAX: FURY ROAD I couldn't help but feel as if I was watching something that would easily stand the test of time.<br/><br/>Story-wise this is pretty much a simple story but it's Miller's wonderful eye that makes this truly one of the most remarkable action pictures in recent history. I really don't want to under-praise this movie because it is so wild, so crazy and so over-the-top and suspenseful that you really can't help but feel that you're watching something unlike anything before. The special effects here and stunt work are among some of the greatest that you're ever going to see. So many action films are overloaded with mediocre CGI that you can't help but feel as if you're watching an unrealistic world. That's not the case here because everything looks so real that you get caught up in what's going on because you feel as if it's a real world with a real battle going on.<br/><br/>There are some intense, heart-pounding battle sequences that really make your jaw hit the floor in regards to the action. The explosions are loud and violent and there are a number of bodies being thrown around in every way imagination. The built-up cars and monster rigs are something unlike you've ever seen before the the pure wild imagination in the action scenes is just rather remarkable. There's no doubt that what you're seeing here is among some of the greatest things ever captured on film. The masterful editing, sound effects and cinematography just pull everything together.<br/><br/>The performances are another major plus with Theron being perfectly believable as this tough warriors. Hardy is also extremely great as the loner who doesn't speak too many words. Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Zoe Kravitz and Hugh Keays-Byrne are all impressive too. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is pumped full of wonderful action and suspense and it's certainly one of the best of its type."

We hear that that Mel Gibson guy did pretty well for himself, and his first major film made quite a splash too. ""Mad Max"" held the record as the most profitable film in history (comparing budget to box office) for two decades, and spawned sequels in 1982 (""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"") and 1985 (""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome""), and 30 years later with ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (R, 2:00) – and more are planned. The ""Mad Max"" franchise has influenced countless dystopian films, inspired directors and musicians and become the basis for video games and entertainment properties as diverse as a WCW PPV event and an episode of ""Rugrats"".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the ""Mad Max"" films themselves have gotten bigger, bloodier and bleaker. The budget for the second film was ten times that of the first and the budget for the 2015 version was fifteen times that of the 1985 version. As the series has progressed, the bigger budgets have allowed for more spectacular visual effects, more elaborate props and more impressive set pieces, as well as more violence and the depiction of a steady decline of the human condition in the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max. But after all is said and done, the only question that matters is whether the time and money that has gone into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was well-spent – and whether we should be looking forward to the sequels.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the fourth entry into the franchise, Max (Tom Hardy) is still trying to survive alone in a world where civilized society has now completely disappeared. He's captured by the War Boys, an army of young men with painted white skin who believe that their power to fight is enhanced by the blood of other strong men. The War Boys fight for King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who rules his corner of the globe by rationing the only water in the region and he preserves his power through complete control of all available vehicles and the gas needed to run them. Immortan Joe keeps everyone in his realm dependent on him for their very survival and he treats the War Boys as his own private army whose loyalty he preserves by promising them an afterlife in Valhalla if they die fighting for him. Besides all that, selected men are used as blood banks for his warriors and women are used as breeders and sources of milk.<br/><br/>In a setting like this, it should come as no surprise that a very strong female character is as important to the plot as the title character. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has escaped the fate of every other female in Immortan Joe's realm by being a tough and smart servant of the king. She drives his heavily armored war wagon, a vehicle which is designed to carry and protect the gasoline that the War Boys help procure from nearby communities. Furiosa may be considered privileged, but she is not happy about her lot in life and she develops a plan to break free from the pack and do some good. She turns one of her gas runs into a run for the border, if you will. Furiosa drives her war wagon west toward the place where she was born and stolen away from many years before. She's heading to ""the Green Place"", as she calls it, but she's also smuggling some of Immortan Joe's most prized possessions in that war wagon. When he catches on, he pursues her, with the help of his regional allies and his own army of War Boys, one of which is the especially devoted Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who has Max chained to the front of his vehicle and connected to him by a rubber tube, making Max into a personal portable blood bank. Things don't go according to plan for anyone involved and there are multiple violent confrontations among the main characters as they crisscross this vast wasteland in a deadly game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" creates a world that can be as upsetting as it is fascinating. This film is something of an assault on the senses, but is a truly engaging experience. The action is virtually non-stop, while the various design elements and the cinematography are truly remarkable. Frenetic action and explosions of color are occasionally punctuated with an eerie quiet and practically monochromatic scenes, which are beautiful in their simplicity. The vehicles, weapons and clothing that these futuristic communities have cobbled together from the remains of civilized society's industrial production are both frightening and fascinating to behold. And the characters' personalities are just as colorful. It's very clear that Max has his issues, but almost everyone he encounters is madder than he is. At times, this film is almost too much to take in as it goes somewhat over the top with its action sequences and, for lack of a better word, with its freakiness. But there is no denying that director and co-writer George Miller, the man who co-wrote and directed (or co-directed) all three previous ""Mad Max"" films, has brought to the modern screen a unique, coherent and engaging post-apocalyptic vision which will remain in your head long after you leave the movie theater.

","Let's back off a little and look at who did this movie: The original Mad Max director! The guy who made all 3 previous movies then. He didn't really have much money when he made the first one (which is considered a classic and has some nice stunts, but has aged badly, feeling blown up at times, filling time to get to the 90 minutes mark), but it was successful enough to make more. The second movie was considered to be the best. Up to this point that is ... we have a new king (with a mad Queen by his side).<br/><br/>So a 70-year old man brings you this movie that could and should be played in film schools. But don't get it twisted, this is entertainment as it should be. Unless you have a case of ""macho gone wrong"", there is nothing you can fault in this. The beginning alone almost had me jump up and down with excitement. That's 5 minutes into the movie ... and more (insanity) was still to come.<br/><br/>If you can fault the movie for one thing, it's that you don't get as much Mad Max (the character) as you got before. But it actually makes Tom Hardys character even more mysterious. We don't really know what he's about (it does seem to lean a bit on the previous installments, character development-wise, if you want it to be - but that's up to the viewer to decide). You don't have to have seen the previous movies to get this. And even if some things seem inevitable (and some might say cliché), the movie itself is just superb and pure entertainment. Stunts, ideas, editing, score and more all blend into a very fine movie indeed"

","Fury Road, oh Fury Road. Eye-popping, adrenaline pumping, best action movie I've ever seen, I think.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much of it, as I'm not fond of remakes and really love the old trilogy (I wasn't aware it was the same director). I'm not fond of brainless blockbusters either, and already the trailer told this wasn't gonna be a brainy or profound story. I went to the cinema more out of curiosity, and boy that was one god decision. That is a movie that ONLY works on a giant screen with a blaster sound system. And the thing is - this movie doesn't need a scenario. It is BEYOND scenarios. And it's amazing how you stop looking for things to make sense after two minutes of movie.<br/><br/>The aesthetics are gorgeous, the characters have style, the music is beyond the mind. This movie starts extremely fast, and then it just goes faster and faster and faster, and if you let it reach you, you just tag along and it works and you just get dragged through the heated desert. The film is one huge action scene, everything goes in one fast-forwarding flow, probably thanks to Miller's wife, Margaret Sixel, doing an awesome job at editing it. I would just stare at the screen with wide opened eyes, gaping to not miss a thing, almost falling from my seat, mouth opened in a crooked smile that stammered "" ... -what?the?F***???"" <br/><br/>There are a lot of thing that are weird, feel weird, possibly ridiculous in this movie, that literally scream ""Let's do this, I want to, we'll just do this, because I can"". It's so over-the-top that I burst out in laughter a few times. But the rhythm is so intense, the car chase so fast and everything so bizarre and absurd that you just shake your head laughing incredulously in admiration at such spunk. It's bad ass, it's rock'n'roll, it's exhilarating and galvanizing, it's nonsensical and furious and extreme. This movie is like playing Need for Speed on ecstasy. It's like surfing on a raving wave of fire while blasting a fully loaded Kalaschnikov. It's awesome. I absolutely loved it."

","Occasionally, films will be criticized for having style over substance. With Mad Max: Fury Road, the style IS the substance. Every frame of George Miller's post-apocalyptic epic is rich with detail and a near obsessive level of perfection. At first glance, the story is minimal, although with repeated viewing, the many layers to the film become more obvious.<br/><br/>The amount of the story you recognize is irrelevant however, because this is a spectacle film in it's truest form. Dialogue is minimal, yet every action sequence is it's own coherent story playing into a larger whole. No punch, turn, or grunt is without consequence or meaning.

","(My original review for this was written May 31st 2015)<br/><br/>This Movie was incredible, and the best that i have seen in my life. The visuals were breathtaking, as the entire movie acts as a giant action sequence. The characters and story were very interesting, and I was greatly invested. The unique landscapes, vehicles, costumes and characters add to the sheer greatness that this film has achieved. With the lack of both dialogue and slow paced moments, this movie gives you little time to breathe as every scene is action packed and intense. The acting was tremendous as well, as Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron shine in their roles as Max and Furiosa. The practical effects were combined with digital effects to perfection, as Miller balances the two to a high degree of effectiveness. Many films today cannot compare to the critical masterpiece that is this movie, but can be inspired to make them surely better and improve. I can not praise this movie enough, but I will conclude by saying that George Miller has proved himself as a cinematic genius with Mad Max: Fury Road."

","While some movies tend to put the story over the film making itself, Mad Max graciously offers some of the best filming in the history of action cinema. Charlize Theron completely steals the show, becoming the real hero in a movie with a clear feminist message. However, Fury Road is, first and foremost, an action movie, that delivers insanely intricate sequences that will totally mesmerize the viewer. After so many years, it is really praiseworthy that director George Miller managed to pull off such a well-rounded sequel to the original trilogy, even more considering that Fury Road doesn't have anything in common with the original three movie, other than the theme, and even that can be discussed (Hardy's Max doesn't talk that much and the budget for Fury Road was way higher than that of any of it's prequels).

","Mad Max: Fury Road has reinvented the modern action genre in ways nobody truly saw coming; it's wonderful how refreshing the practical stunts, character development amidst the action sequences, and feminist overtones the film has to offer. It's what I've been waiting for from the action genre: an open minded film that pulls all the stops, isn't misogynistic, where the danger feels real, and an unsurpassed amount of visual kinetic energy on the screen.<br/><br/>George Miller has given us the finest blockbuster of 2015 thus far, fair and square. No superficial CGI robots, no CGI-ed explosions, no half-hearted performances: just fully realized, relentless excitement that has been long overdue this year. The cars are all really on screen, the motorcycles are properly on the screen, the stunts are actually happening, and the beautifully desolate landscape in the film is real. I can't think of a more honestly practical blockbuster than Fury Road from this year; it's just so well done and gorgeous.<br/><br/>A modern classic sure, to be remembered for many years to come."

","Mad Max: Fury Road 90<br/><br/>This film is totally epic, awesome, action-filled, spectacular fun-filled adventure ride of the summer. Right now this is the best film I've seen in 2015. Director George Miller just proved the practical effects can be very much better than CGI. You weren't distracted at all from explosions or vehicles that looked like they were pulled from a video game. CGI works in some cases and can be just as artful, but when stunts are done for real, it is a much better experience. (Except the few CGI things that stuck out terribly) Miller also kept all the movements and the actor's actions all very easy to follow so it wasn't such a mess. All the actors were great in this, like many have said before, Max, played by Tom Hardy, is barely the main character as his co-star Charlize Theron's Furiousa is the most bad-ass person in the film. Everything that was put into the action sequences: the stunts, the practical effects, the great editing, the director's direction, the actors, and sheer epicness make this such an intense film. This film had such an awesome, gorgeous look to it; like the scenery, color, and overall cinematography. Overall, great awesome film, intense, new, and not sloppy; Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action film of the year."

","I realize I'm writing this movie multiple months after its release, however for those still on the fence about purchasing this via DVD on the first of September, I'm here to help. This movie was one of the most incredible films I've seen this year. Aside from ""The Man From UNCLE"", this movie ranked highly on my personal favorites list. Tom Hardy is one of my personal favorite actors, and like the majority of his films, this one was extraordinary. The old Mad Max's lacked something this one put together. With multiple action scenes, a thoughtful plot, and a SUPERB cast, this film notched all the checks for me. To me, Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult played their roles to perfection. If you want to purchase a movie well worth your time, and the likely $20-$30 price range, this is it! I highly recommend this movie. RATING: I give this movie an 8.5.10, and I was constantly entertained when watching it. AGE: Even though this movie is rated R, I would say 15+ for this film, purely because of intense violent scenes. VERDICT: This movie was an adventure from start to finish, and I would definitely recommend this film."
"sharky_55","8","2","11","21 July 2015"," You will ride eternal, shiny and chrome
","""My name is Max,"" trembles the opening scene of Fury Road, and that is about as much exposition as you will get. A few sound bites hinting at a nuclear wasteland and a harsh voice-over establishing the persona of the title character tell us plenty. Yet the film could even do without those; the two headed lizard that Max chews hints at both these without being too overt and there is subtext without need for a immediate answer in the ghostly whispers of Max's deceased daughter and wife. George Miller's post apocalyptic world is immediately engaging with barely any expository dialogue or explanation. It's a film buzzing with strong imagery, mythology and mood that elevates it beyond pure action. <br/><br/>The production design is spectacular; in particular the art design of the various vehicles of the barren wasteland that run on the precious guzzoline. There's battered Falcon Coupes, a huge double reared Gigahorse, a Merlin V8 adorned with caterpillar tank tracks, Buzzards covered in spikes, a doofwagon entirely for serenading the warriors on the brink of eternity in Valhalla and the centre-piece, Furiosa's immense war rig, which hums with as much rhythm and intensity as the many action spectacles of the film. It's reminiscent of the equally menacing vehicles in 2008's Death Race, but whereas those racecars embellished with machine guns and missiles feel like a juvenile fantasy within a futuristic dystopia, Mad Max's feel more like an organic result of a desperate society and a crazed leader. Death Race, like most post apocalyptic films, is awash in muted and gritty grays and provides an excess of eye candy in female assistants for the racers. Mad Max is visually vibrant in a genre where this is out of place, as designated by Miller and cinematographer John Seale, overseeing a post production process to digitally ramp up the highly saturated landscape of reds, oranges and ochres. The night scenes were actually shot during the day, then washed in murky and atmospheric blues. There's no gender imbalance (even though a post apocalyptic setting might suggest one and even though 2 of the wives are portrayed by supermodels) - the wives and Furiosa are given as much weight and agency as any of the characters, as are the females of the Vuvalini clan (again, The Valkyrie portrayed by a supermodel, but the point is Mad Max never objectives them). <br/><br/>That's half of what draws you into the world of Mad Max - the other is the mixture of Norse and mechanically derived religion which brainwashes the horde of War Boys and Pups at Immortan Joe's command. Kamikaze-like attacks promise an eternity of feasting with heroes in Valhalla, referred to as a second life (I live, I die, I live again). Joe sprays a shiny mouthful of chrome paint and inexplicably, Nux rushes off with anticipation of the other life, imploring others to witness his sacrifice. It's all absolutely absurd, but it works because in addition to all the other fantastical elements of the aged future, Mad Max doesn't overreach in setting, premise or stakes. It's a tightly confined narrative which rides on its action sequences instead of trying to overpower them with tangents of emotional catharsis (one glaring exemption is the slightly ridiculous scene where Furiosa collapses silently on her knees when hearing of the greenland's demise). <br/><br/>Simply, Mad Max is one long car chase that reaches a wide expanse of salt flats (formerly the ocean) and turns around for the same thing. The sequences of car-combat and sabotage are tightly edited and shot; frenetic without allowing for excessive shaky-cam or jarring rapid cuts. Seale centres the action squarely within the middle of the frame, which makes the spectacular choreography all the more thrilling and easy to eye trace. They are brimming with rhythm and character interest, as the Vuvalini clan fit seamlessly into the scene with an air of competency yet desperation as the setting decides: one man, one bullet. They are accompanied by the doof warrior guitarist and several drummers which make up key areas of the soundtrack; the percussions builds in intensity with each beat with a gritty, distorted electronic twist.<br/><br/>Miller touches the grotesque and absurd without ever having to expand or explain. There's the complicated breathing apparatus and armour pieces Immortan Joe dons as he addresses the people of the citadel as their saviour. There's his stunted disabled son wheeled around in a chair and his equally imperfect brother Rictus, the paragon of imposing strength and brutality. There are curiously malformed creatures upon stilts in the wet marshland, formerly the green pastures of life and freedom for Furiosa. Mad Max doesn't just suspend your disbelief, it actively seizes your gaze."

"jonnyceriani","Null","2","11","24 June 2015"," One of the greatest action movies of all time.
","Many modern action films suffer from the same boring, dull, monotone action scenes that only succeed in cluttering the screen with obvious stunt doubles, blinding lens flare, and excessive explosions. Classic action films are often just that: classic. They may be fondly remembered for their originality, but they may be quite clichéd and fail to be as exciting as they intend. The Mad Max trilogy may fall into the latter with some debate. Mad Max: Fury Road, however, will always be remembered as one of the greatest action movies of all time.<br/><br/>I was relatively fond of ""Mad Max"" (1979), and greatly enjoyed ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981) due to its crude humor, dynamic characters, and action packed car chases. ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) was not great, but not terrible either. Now for the reboot. I am generally skeptical of rebooting a series, so I entered the cinema with caution. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015) presented a dedicated director, George Miller, who fronted all of the original films, two outstanding lead actors in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, and thirty years between its release and that of its predecessors, so this movie had everything going for it.<br/><br/>The beauty of the this film is all over. From the fantastic camera angles, the gorgeous landscapes that, while desolate, manage to create an incredible image throughout the film, the grade-A performances by the cast, specifically the two leads, and the non-stop action, perhaps the greatest part of this film is its simplicity. The entirety of the movie is a chase from point A to point B, then back to A again.<br/><br/>Perhaps the two aspects of the films that will deservingly receive the highest amounts of praise are the acting and the action. Tom Hardy performs perfectly as a mostly silent, somewhat anti-hero. Charlize Theron delivers one of the best performances of her fantastic career and steals the show from the main character. The entire films deals with jaw dropping car chases and action sequences which only pause for brief moments as the characters, and the audience, recover.<br/><br/>This film shows the public what action movies are supposed to be, and no one should deprive themselves of seeing this masterpiece. I cannot stress enough that if you have a chance to see this film, take it. In eighty-five years, when humanity looks back on the great films of the last century, and they stumble to action, a noble few will come from the first fifteen years. They will include ""Mad Max: Fury Road."""

","Original Review:<br/><br/>It's got the feel of the original series with a renewed energy. The world has changed, but the overriding theme remains: survive.<br/><br/>In this reboot, we follow the story of a drifter with nothing to lose and a woman looking for a way out. Both main characters are quite relatable and stand out in a fictional world much different and off-putting than any other. The disturbing imagery takes away your comfort and the action sequences drag on as the film wanes, but the beautiful desert landscapes and score by Junkie XL help glide the movie. The story was surprisingly heart-felt with a great performance from Nicholas Hoult and a surprising one from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.<br/><br/>As a newfound fan of The Road Warrior, this was disappointing. It is a decent road trip film, but I expect it to improve upon a mandatory rewatch.<br/><br/>Upon Rewatch:<br/><br/>Tom Hardy may have ruined the film. His occasional low growls and general lack of emotion certainly do not make him likable nor do they make him an interesting supporting character. The way Max was written for this movie makes me question whether this can even be considered a Mad Max film. That flashbacks that should add depth to his character do nothing but confuse."

","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is apocalypse wow! The fact that it's a fuel-injected adrenaline rush as well as a thoughtful, surprisingly moving film is a combination that makes this fiery blockbuster one of the very best of the genre.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a shot reminiscent of The Road Warrior, with our eponymous hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) looking away at the desolate wasteland of his shattered world and then it just goes berserk. Max gets himself captured by the underlings of the 'Citadel', a kingdom high inside a lone tower of rock. At the Citadel, chaos reigns among a starving citizenry at the mercy of a mutated leader known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a Halloween horror of a man outfitted with protective gear and a gruesome breathing apparatus. We meet his muscle-bound security team and his 'War Boys' – a group of tumor-laden, dying soldiers who fight for him in belief that after-life glories await from their sacrifices. Their present task is sending a big rig to a place called Gastown to fill up with 3,000 gallons of that most precious commodity outside of water. But when one of Joe's lieutenants Imperator Furiosa (a shaven-headed Charlize Theron) takes the truck on a detour with precious cargo - the leader's five wives, one of whom is pregnant, with a view to break them free of Joe's despotic shackles - the chase is on, with war-party vehicles in pursuit and our titular hero as a captive on one of these vehicles. Max bests his captors and reluctantly unites with Furiosa and her company of oppressed females. As far as plot goes, that's about it. <br/><br/>'Fury Road' moves at a frenetic pace from beginning to end, offering brief respites where the viewers can catch their breath to prepare for the next jaw-dropping sequence. Now visualize this image: A pair of 1959 Cadillacs welded together. Or a vintage Plymouth Valiant accessorized with tank treads. And all of them are militarized. Men and women vaulting from one vehicle to another, climbing giant, flexible poles planted in the rear in a frantic orgy of speed and skill.<br/><br/>The key to making this all work is in having original director George Miller back for another ride. He returns to the post-apocalyptic wasteland almost three decades later and it's like he's never been away, bringing a spry outlook to his burgeoning vision. On paper, the movie is one extended chase, a high-octane race through desolate desert and narrow canyons, raging to the tune of composer Junkie XL's pounding soundtrack, but Miller frames the trek with impeccable attention to detail. The editing is never hasty or disorienting; even at top speeds the movie brings riveting clarity to each ambush and narrow escape. Going against the grain of digitized sensation, much of what we view is actually happening, staged for the camera with incredible choreographic energy. And the cinematography does the unfathomable: it gives pulsating life to a barren desert, the most unattractive of movie settings. Of the cast, Tom Hardy's note perfect as Max, giving a no-nonsense performance eloquent in its silences. But the film's real emotional core is Charlize Theron's gimlet-eyed Furiosa, scarred by her warrior's life and bent on redemption. Sporting a CGI mechanical arm, face paint and a perma-stern expression, Theron makes for one bad-ass rebel!<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is an act of defiance - a rage against the mindless blockbuster made today. It is visceral, taut, insightful, engrossing, intricate, meticulous, and above all else driven by a creative spirit that sees the material from a space of undaunted enthusiasm."

The story isn't quite new, but well made and serves the events right. The issues presented at the movie are quite great and it made me ponder a lot into a lot of issues, deep and profound ones. The stunts and visual effects are great. It could have used some more mundane tasks drama (e.g. resource management,etc..) but that never seemed to be quite a hindering point to the movie."

","Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) is probably one of the best remakes that has come out in the last year. I've always been a fan of the original Mad Max movies and of course I was very skeptical of seeing this. The only thing that made me consider watching the movie and give it the chance was that Charlize Theron was in it; she is an excellent actress! From the minute this movie starts it is none stop action through more than half of the movie where it then begins to go over more of the story. After a few minutes of going over some more of the story it is balls to the wall action all the way to the end! Amazing remake!!<br/><br/>The graphics and acting were extremely well done."

The plot is great & I hope they continue this franchise. I don't know why people are complaining! Come on, what else do you expect? It's almost perfect movie. I just loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch.

"maurice_yacowar","8","2","12","14 June 2015"," Post-apocalypse man and woman overthrow water-hoarding tyrant
","George Miller's return to Mad Max is — who would have expected? — a great feminist film.<br/><br/>The landscape is unrelieved aridity and machinery, the dryness of the sterile male. The monster machines are technology without humanity, so they represent male power at its worst. The horde of pale bald humans connote another kind of sterility. The men's only skin growth are boils and tattoos. <br/><br/>Hence the evil kingpin's obsessive pride in having impregnated one of his ""breeders"" and his determination to recover the harem when they are swept off by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). The ruler is a pustular ruin who's encased in a shell of medals and plastic armour to conceal his venereal decay. He survives on a breathing machine. He monopolizes the water and doles out occasional spates to keep his subjects dry, enslaved and grateful, awed by his pretence to immortality. That Imperator will disprove.The tyrant's son Ritcus Erectus bears another name redolent of futile macho power, as he celebrates his stillborn baby brother ""perfect in every way"" — but dead. The society's emblem is a stark grinning skull.<br/><br/>Theron plays the heroine bald and flat-chested, eschewing the conventional heroine's beauties. The women she saves are young, insecure, their nipples outlined flat behind the white wisps they wear. In contrast, the tyrant's production line of milking mothers are swollen grotesques. In a world sans water the characters live on mother's milk, a reminder of the — but here abused — natural primacy of the feminine. <br/><br/>As the heroine's name suggests, she is both angry and driven — an imperative fury. Her character's name provides the film's subtitle. The narrative road is the woman's fury. She is enraged at the male power that reduces woman to milking machine and breeder. There is no indication of sexual pleasure, except for the one girl's loving caress of the reformed thug. Imperator resolves to save what girls she can from their strictly reproductive service.<br/><br/>Hero Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is maximum hardrock but he starts imprisoned, both caged by the villains and boxed in by the trauma of having failed to save his wife and child a few films ago. His fights with Imperator are even. As their relationship grows away from their initial distrust and violence there is not a single word of sentiment or romance. Necessity breeds a tentative trust, which eventually grows to include his initial enemy, Nux. The film ends with the hero and heroine exchanging a wordless nod across the distance between her settling in as new ruler of The Citadel (a reference to the brutish male military academy) and his disappearance in the crowd, off to seek his own solitary redemption. Miller eschews their romantic coupling because these women don't need to depend on men. Imperator's home community may have lost the green and richness she remembers from childhood but its women are tough, competent survivors. The oldest carries a satchel of seeds that will bring a new fertility to the blowing sands once Imperator frees the water the first ruler hoarded. <br/><br/>Of course this is a very violent, loud, sensational film. But at its heart is the reminder of the feminine upon which our species' survival is far more dependent than upon male power. That lesson justifies this sensational fable — and compels us to overlook its pervasive improbabilities: the characters' survival without food and water, the monster technology they have somehow managed to construct post-apocalypse, and the characters' rebounding from such violent assaults. It's a fable, a feminist fable, nestled within the strut of macho blockbuster. So Max washes a killed foe's blood off his face with mother's milk. Our feminine is the great cleanser."

","It's a pure cinema.Story and emotions are carried by pictures and sounds not just another chatter box movie! The other awesome aspect of movie is the very proper using of 3D.It really helped and improved the movie and the Director used it very smart to increase the tension of sequences by making it bold step by step. Characters were great, specially female characters. Not a beautiful sexy trophy for the Male hero, but an independent smart, focused and hardworking humans! very rare these days in movies!

"derelor","10","2","12","14 June 2015"," Masterpiece
","I had heard a lot of good things about Mad Max: Fury Road prior to going to the theater. Still, I only had rather modest expectations. After walking out of the theater, I could not immediately understand what kind of epic I had just watched. Fury Road was, simply put, a masterpiece on so many levels that it single-handedly reignited my hope in the movie-making skills of Hollywood directors.<br/><br/>Where do I even start? The first 30 minutes were perhaps a bit boring for me, but after that I was completely glued to the seat for the rest of the movie and ""WOW!"" was the most common thought in my head. Perhaps it would make sense to start with Charlize Theron's performance. She was simply FANTASTIC and captured the bad-ass attitude of the character as well as her deep pain and longing for freedom, perfectly. Even though it's in principle an action movie, she deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't really that relevant in this movie. I felt that George Miller finally had the tools to create the kind of post-apocalyptic Mad Max world he had always envisioned. And what a beautiful world it was! On top of that, the music score was awesome as well. When I got home, I immediately started listening to the Fury Road soundtrack. I could go on and on, but I'll just end this review by saying if you have not seen Mad Max: Fury Road, you absolutely must see it! I have watched a lot of movies from all genres, and on my list, Fury Road belongs to the the Top 10. It is such an exhilarating masterpiece that I might not bother to see any other movies this year - which movie could possibly surpass it?"
"andrewnestea","9","2","12","6 June 2015"," What a lovely day.
","I was having an absolutely horrible day when my friends asked me to go see this movie. I won't go into details, but it was bad.<br/><br/>The acting and explosions and everything else was so good that I almost forgot about my problems. This movie is the essence of what good movies should be; fun and unpredictable. Very loud, very exciting and very fresh. Right when you think you have it figured out, something unexpected happens and leaves you wanting more. I had never seen an Mad Max movie before this one, yet I enjoyed it completely, and was able to follow along.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this to anyone, and even more so if you like action, as this movie has non-stop action."
"sgholbrook","9","2","12","2 June 2015"," ""Explosions, Fire, Guns, Cars..... MADNESS""
","Truly Incredible ! That sums it up rather well. If you are looking for a film about 90% action and 10% other stuff ! This is the film for you. It was truly ""action packed"" ! From start to finish I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen and the story is SO simple, yet SO effective. Being, I imagine, one of the younger viewers, it didn't matter that I couldn't really remember seeing the first few films. This brought them to a whole new level anyway. I didn't view this film in 3D but am SO keen to go back and see it again and not make the mistake of 2D next time ! Don't get me wrong, the 2D was brilliant... But there was obvious moments MADE for the 3D and with all the explosions and madness in the film I think it would work extremely well..... Unless it motion blurs. Then you're screwed to see anything !"
"cognitron","9","2","12","1 June 2015"," What other action movies ought to be doing
","I watched Fury Road and Avengers 2 within a week of each other, and the difference was like night and day. Fury Road is an exemplar of what action movies ought to be like, and Avengers 2 is an exemplar of what they're like instead. I'd written off action movies completely because of the trend toward roller-coaster-ride visual spectacles with huge displays of senseless violence and asinine plots. I'm glad I took a chance on Fury Road, because I got the exact opposite.<br/><br/>The balance of show and tell in Fury Road is just about perfect. Miller does a fantastic job as always portraying a lived-in world where we don't need to have the intricacies explained to us in order to make sense of them. The plot is a bit thin, but it's also straightforward and makes sense. Max, the titular wanderer, blows into town just as he did in Mad Max 2 and 3, bringing just enough motivation to get him embroiled in the sympathetic-group-of-the-week's struggles with the villain-of-the-week. Anyone who thinks Max's role in this was too small ought to consider it in the context of the formula established by the earlier movies.<br/><br/>Where most contemporary action movies rest on spectacle, however, Fury Road takes its cue from the better action movies of the seventies and eighties. Spectacle is certainly an important element of the movie, but every blow matters; every fight carries a serious risk of wounding or killing a character or causing permanent damage to the escaping ""war rig"" the action centers on. The villain's forces are visibly depleted over the course of the movie, in stark contrast to the endless waves of throwaway henchmen in movies such as Avengers 2. Where we've been trained to accept thrown-together plots that simply give a context to action scenes, Fury Road gives us a plot completely interwoven with the action scenes that drive it.<br/><br/>The practical effects were a breath of fresh air from an industry infatuated with CGI, the visual design was imaginative and entertaining, and the actors fit their roles wonderfully, but all of those factors are simply bonuses. The real strength of Fury Road is that it shows that action movies do not have to be monotonous, you do not have to turn your brain off to enjoy a good action movie, and it is not nitpicking to criticize the plot of a summer blockbuster. Fury Road is what action movies ought to be like, and we do not have to accept what we've been shoveled instead for the past two decades.<br/><br/>(As an aside, apparently some people didn't like the movie because they perceived the message as feminist. Some other people say, ""you're wrong; it's not feminist at all, and therefore it's acceptable."" I'm not going to bother addressing that point, because if you avoid watching movies because they might promote equality between the sexes, then you and I have no common ground.)"
"AudioFileZ","8","2","12","1 June 2015"," Movie Making At It's Purest...Just Breakdown & Go See It!
","I guess you could say my interest in Mad Max movies is non-existent. At 55, I've never seen any of the previous ones even though I watched my share of movies during the VHS years of which the original was a breakout hit. So, why now am I not only watching a MadMax movie, but reviewing it? Simply because I'm guessing there are others not unlike me.<br/><br/>I like a good action movie or sci-fi flick and often watch ones I feel are over-ambitious ending up flat. Especially some that require total belief suspension which are, in my opinion, harder to pull off. With that in mind I wouldn't have desired to see the latest Mad Max movie as I had nothing invested in the franchise previously. What changed my mind is I kept hearing on multiple TV shows positive diatribes on the movie. After decades of being immune I broke. You know what? I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>This is pure movie making because the story isn't at all creative or, really, even compelling. The acting isn't anything special either though I realize some probably differ in my opinion. What is special is the sum of dramatic local vistas, unique characters brought to life, and a constant pummeling action that hardly lets up. This is what makes the movie so edgy and fun to watch. Here's some writers who found the right director and cinematographer to make a completely unbelievable storyline work due to ""hand-in- glove"" synergism. The props are ""off-the-hook"" as if someones drug-addled imagination came to life on the screen. I didn't feel I was ""dumbed-down"" either as I watched this. It's a kind of grand ""steam-punk"" industrial art movie discussed as a an action movie. <br/><br/>So, here I am telling you other resisters to break down and go see a movie I'd never thought I'd even want to see. That's excellent movie making!"

","10/10 Should speak for itself. Brilliant, raw, beautiful, brutal movie from beginning to end, and a breath of 'fresh' air from Marvel action. Fury Road is a testament to every Classic Max Mad film that came before. Making you want to watch them again & this gem even more. A Classic this Mad Max WILL become in itself. I look forward to more of our new Mad Max's journey, but will be happy having been able to experience at least this journey, if it is to be the last. Beyond Thunderdome left fans wanting more. I never felt like it had left as satisfying an ending as it could have had, such as our recent BatMan. Mad Max deserved this renewal or even this ending. Tom Hardy is Mad Max, just as Mel Gibson had been, and would have continued had so much time not passed. This feels like a continuation of excellence. Everyone else was perfectly placed, and George Miller did it again. Maybe even better. Thank you."
"bkrontz-85024","10","2","12","30 May 2015"," What did it for me...
","I love how Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has turned a crappy SKS into sniping rifle. The SKS doesn't have a method for attaching a scope naturally, so you'd need to find a mod that replaces some of the parts. All mods out there today are fairly unstable and typically garbage... In other words, I wouldn't recommend trying to scope an SKS. This simple touch gives the movie a more realistic feel in that they need to take whatever they can find and make it work. Bravo.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie is already a classic for me. It's right up there with Blade Runner. There's far too much depth, detail, and room to let your imagination fill in the blanks to think otherwise.<br/><br/>I hope they continue to film these in Africa. The environments seemed much more functional to the story."
"adri_mv1","9","2","12","30 May 2015"," Even with the lack of plot it is, indeed, a good movie
","As i have said in the summary it is a really good movie, specifically a really good action movie. Everybody enjoys an action movie every now and then, but you could watch Mad Max, with practically any humor. Even if the plot is almost non-existent, it has enough elements to make a consistent and amusing movie. The direction is magnificent and the camera games, perfect, despite being a very moving film, it never gets you dizzy and always maintains your attention. You could describe the film as a post-apocalyptic diesel-punk road (Duh!) movie, or just as an amazing and big persecution with an odd atmosphere, but the interesting thing is that with that kind of atmosphere, most of the movies would look ridiculous, but not this one! and that is thanks to George Miller's excellent labor and to an appropriate use of FX technologies. I'm really not a fan of the original Mad Max movies or remakes, but this film has showed me not to prejudge. Tom Hardy has been an excellent choice to the leading role and it has been a really nice touch to have Hugh Keays-Byrne again as the bad guy. I recommend to watch it in the biggest, loudest, greatest cinema you could afford."
"sanwit","8","2","12","30 May 2015"," Grim never looked so good
","Fury Road brings jaw-dropping dystopian landscapes, and you gotta hand it to the people who dreamed them up. The first storm sequence of the movie which Furiosa enters on the large gasoline truck is just WOW! This movie is about a very grim future, but boy does it look great! Hope hasn't looked so good, and despair so sickening. Theron's Furiosa is a driven individual with hope, hope for a home where she was born, the land of the Mothers. She is one of the prize breeders of Immortan Joe. In fact, all women have been reduced to just that in this world. Furiosa escapes with the rest of Joe's prize breeders, and we get this chase of a movie. I personally favor movies with CGI that blends with the environment so much so that it doesn't look like CGI anymore, and Mad Max Fury Road achieves that, and I love it. Good performances all around also help. Hugh Keays-Byrne's Immortan Joe is adequate and played with appropriate fury! Theron's Furiosa drives the movie, and the parts that she doesn't, Tom Hardy's Max and Nicholas Hoult's Nux take up the job. Overall, a great movie, definitely worth a watch."
"funkyfry","6","2","12","29 May 2015"," Somewhere between the Road and Thunderdome.....
","While not reaching the dizzy dystopian heights of ""The Road Warrior"", this film at least does not have the uneven quality or the naked sentiment of ""Beyond Thunderdome"", so in a sense this new film from George Miller has saved the series -- it wasn't right for ""Max"" to end on a bad note. <br/><br/>I've heard one person say, ""it's too bad Mel Gibson couldn't be in it."" But only one person. Most people I think recognize that his presence would only have complicated things; besides which, Tom Hardy is arguably better in the role than Gibson ever was. He's much more adept at disappearing into the role, and portraying Max as somebody who, rather than imposing his will on his environment, rolls with whatever is happening to him and tries to adapt and survive. I halfway think that the reason George Miller waited so long to make this film is that he wanted Gibson to be too old so that he wouldn't be criticized for replacing him. <br/><br/>I know that I wasn't supposed to take the film totally seriously, but the whole carnival/heavy metal aspect of the villains was just too much for me to take. Apparently, when the apocalypse happened a bunch of head bangers (as we used to call them) got together and decided to create a new society based on the lyrics to Slayer and Metallica songs. Everybody knows that it's absolutely essential in the post- apocalyptic environment to have your flaming guitar player with you when you set out on a desperate mission. Can't leave him at home. <br/><br/>To me, the presence of these silly elements does detract somewhat from the film's themes of survival and dignity in the midst of social disintegration. My other problem with the movie is the aggressive way that Miller used the flashbacks to the dead/endangered child. ""The Road Warrior"" stands alone, without much reference to his family or to anything that happened in the first film -- so why did Miller and/or his writers think it was so important for this film to constantly refer back to the dead family? The dialogue about redemption was heavy- handed and literal. <br/><br/>For every problem, there are a half dozen excellent and fun things about the movie, so I am recommending it to people, but I would say it's not as good as the first two films. I loved the earth mamas on their bikes (""One bullet, one man"") -- oddly enough they reminded me of Esme Cordelia Hoggett in ""Babe: Pig in the City"", kicking ass and rescuing the farm. A lot of people criticized Miller actually for leaving Father Hoggett on the farm to be rescued by his wife -- I think it showed the ""feminist"" streak that manifested in this movie and lead to even wider criticism of Miller. I'm pretty sure from where he's sitting, with this film raking in dough around the world, he's not too concerned with what a bunch of so-called ""men's rights activists"" think about the film. He's a subversive guy, and for the most part he knows how to challenge our preconceptions and our expectations just enough to leave everybody happy. The mixture of craziness, sentiment, and thematic force are just about right here."
"cronostitan","8","2","12","14 May 2015"," A very new draft of the cult movie of 1979...
","Only for the guilty pleasure to watch Charlize Theron in her own juices, this movie is worth its heavy amount of $. Of course the new Max is a little short of the real watermarked madness of his former actor (Mel Gibson for the total greenhorns) and the orange touch of a film undoubtedly touched again by the digital graphic pallet hurts sometimes its vision, and also, let us say the quite clear, for the continuity of a story somehow complex.<br/><br/>Devotee of the very first for a very long time, I have to admit all the same that I was amazed rather by a narrative which stand up straight most of the time, cart about somehow or other towards the number third of the franchise otherwise by being completely for its height, I named ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"". Obviously the end which is tinged with a mormon and puritanism spirit will not please to everybody, but this aftereffect fights well as a new one Ben Hur seen again and corrected, and his savages have at least the advantage to be truer than true.<br/><br/>Do not miss the bad appearance of the dictatorial head, Immortan Joe, a very successful miserable just like his harem, and also this decerebrate guitarist beating time measure during the gimmick of this nth epic of Max Rockatansky.<br/><br/>Thus let us wish that George Miller soon frees his hero - from a pure entertainment in the shape of blockbuster a little too much bounded to the commercial imperatives - towards a number 5 in which we shall find maybe inside the insane ultraviolence of a very inflexible censorship had condemned formerly for a long time..."

The excellent Charlize Theron is great here too but this is Hardy's Mad Max he's as good as Mel Gibson if not better in some ways!!!
The cinematography is gorgeous as expected & the scarily violent warrior & gang filled world of Mad Max is much more explored in this movie,
The music is banging Awesome throughout & the action is tough, brutal & Awesome!!! It's one hell of furious road trip accross dangerous territory & Mad finds some people to help & begins a violent quest of dazzling action set pieces.
There's too many crazy-funny & just plain Awesome bits in this instant CLASSIC.

If you want to see non-shaky camera showing wide shots of explosions and literally what you think of when someone says ""action,"" then this should please you thoroughly. The way the action has been created for this film is jaw-dropping, especially in the final act and most of this film uses practical effects and extremely minimal CGI, and it looks so much better than other action films or action within films that use CGI!<br/><br/>This film is also the perfect example of showing heroic/strong female characters really well. Imperator Furiosa is definitely my favourite female character from any action film and maybe my favourite female character from ANY film or very close to my favourite. There are other female characters that vary from a rather young age to a rather old age actually and they are all portrayed to be capable and awesome. Max himself obviously is a main character but to be honest, the title of this film doesn't really fit. Whilst Max is in it, it's really Furiosa's film and story but nevertheless, Max still does have a lot to do with the plot and is still a major character. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron nail their roles and put some really good performances to the screen. It is also worth mentioning that the score is absolutely fantastic and really fitting for the theme of this film.<br/><br/>To reference Chris Stuckmann in his review of this film: ""This is the best 80s action film that was not released in the 80s"" I highly recommend this film to not just action fans, but film fans in general. It is currently my favourite film of the decade and my favourite action film of all time.<br/><br/>My Ratings:
Characters/Cast - 10/10
Plot - 9/10
Dialogue - 9/10

Music - 10/10
Overall - 10/10"

","Fury Road is a movie that forces you to use your eyes and your head. Instead of force-feeding you exposition via pointless and unrealistic dialogue, this movie is the embodiment of ""show, don't tell.""<br/><br/>That is why some people hate this movie, and why I was somewhat confused as well at first; I was only doing what I'd got so used to doing in action films; listening for the story and looking for the eyecandy.<br/><br/>But this film puts everything from the small-but-saves-a-characters-life details to the overarching background story into the shots instead of the audio. The characters' clothing, equipment, vehicles, background and mannerisms tell as much as any dialogue could. Look for the story and you'll find this piece is an exercise in world-building like no other.<br/><br/>Combine that with incredibly creative and unendingly intense action and you have yourself one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>And to those saying Hardy's acting is poor: again, look at his face. Clue's in the name; Max is insane. His face does the telling, his words are but the pressured utterings of a man driven far beyond the edge."

","This is the best action film that I've ever seen. I love everything about it. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the special effects are up there with the best of the best. But, what really takes Mad Max to the next level is its subtlety. It uses subtlety in a way that not too many other films can, let alone action films. Sure, there is some dialogue that is too blatant in its goal to move the story forward but most of the world-building and plot movement comes not from dialogue but from everything else. The all-out action, the changes in scenery and the characters' general demeanor all help shape the world that the movie takes place in and tell the story. This is a credit to everyone involved in the film. Everything is done so well. The visuals, sound, acting, directing, everything.

","How many of these apocalyptic trash non-epics are we expected to watch? There's nothing new to this story. I had to pause it halfway through to watch something more interesting. Came back to it the next day and still was disappointed. Quasi-emotional scenes are dragged out too long with the over-the-top score reminiscent of a reality-TV drama-fest. Seriously, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, Zoe, Rosie, Riley et al are capable of so much more. Maybe they were bored or broke and had to take on this. Either way, their talents are wasted. Some of the characters and their on screen personas are downright silly. Like the guitar player standing up in front of some bombastic vehicle cranking out atmospheric riffs while the vehicle bobs, bounces and weaves across the desert landscape. And where are they getting the gunpowder and seemingly unending supply of gasoline in the middle of the desert? I understand the suspension of belief but come on! The line has to be drawn somewhere. If you want to see intensity and a story that makes sense, watch the original Mad Max and then The Road Warrior. At least those are believable and certainly more entertaining."

","When looking through the reviews by other users, I was surprised at how many negative reviews had been written for a movie with such high ratings. It seemed that there were two main issues that the negative reviewers had: 1) Max being a secondary character to Furiosa, 2) the motif of feminism being too prevalent. I agree that this really is not a movie about Max; it's more about the environment as a whole and how to live in it beyond just surviving. Perhaps people felt that this was not in keeping with the spirit of the original movies, but of course I haven't seen them. In regards to the feminism issue, I think it's great that George Miller decided to mold his world to make it socially pertinent. It's understandable that viewers feel offended and annoyed by Miller bringing his opinions into his movie, but the function of art is to impact the culture of its time. To disagree with what an artist or a director or a writer is saying in his or her work is one thing, but to say that they should refrain from saying something of importance is essentially censorship. Feminism and how women are treated is a pretty important issue, and it's great to see a big studio movie such as this comment on it in a meaningful way. People complain about how women are portrayed in movies, but Immortan Joe's concubines are shown as marginalized in a way that doesn't sexualize or objectify them on-screen.<br/><br/>In most cases, movies tell stories, but in this case the content was less about a sequence of connected events and more about the world that everything took place in. This is probably a big reason why it won so many Oscars for costumes and makeup and set design. It's not just that they were impressively crafted- they also contributed to the story and the world of the movie in an important way. The wasteland is basically a giant battleground of drug cartels. The people are actually competing for water and gasoline, but the resources seem to be treated more like drugs than essentials. One thing that was very thought provoking in regards to the unique world was how the older women talked about our present as if it were a golden age, because most people today even in well-off countries don't talk about our world like it's a time of prosperity.<br/><br/>Max's ability to live apart and not rely on any larger group for his survival is potentially interesting. More prominent, however, is how Nux and Furiosa live in relation to the world. Nux and the War Boys are servants of the system, worshiping Immortan Joe to the point that serving him is more important than their own lives. In some ways this is true since Immortan controls all of the water, but he takes it a step farther by creating a sort of heaven on earth. Furiosa is the opposite of Nux. She has had enough of the polarized class system and decides to use her standing as a member of the higher class to turn the tables.<br/><br/>In a craft sense, there is so much to be impressed with. The set design and makeup is top notch, of course. Acting was not as prominent, but all of the performances served the purpose. Even though there was not that much compelling dialogue or scene structure, I still consider this a well-crafted script for how proficiently it was able to pack character arcs and themes into a story that mostly consists of action set pieces. The combination of camera direction, score, cinematography, and action choreography resulted in some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. If you really watch what happens during the action scenes, the characters are really not that skilled combatively. They know how to handle themselves with weapons, but none of them have action hero-level skills like we are used to seeing. The fighting is very chaotic and explosive, but I never felt like the main characters should have died. They get banged up a bit and shot at a lot and the danger felt real, but it also felt like it was realistically evaded.<br/><br/>I would generally recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like action. It won't be as palatable if you don't care for action, but there are a lot of points within the story that make it worth watching. If you are an action person, this should be a treat for you. I can't say whether this is good for fans of the original Mel Gibson movies, but this is worth watching as it's own entity anyways. Overall Rating: 8.6/10."

","This will be rather brief. I wanted to contribute after seeing the zillions of 1-2 star ratings of frustrated and clearly very disappointed moviegoers. While ratings are subjective by definition, 1-2 star ratings are very, very unlikely to do this movie any justice, if a 1-10 rating system is designed to make films somewhat comparable.<br/><br/>If it were, then really low ratings are reserved for really bad movies, think Piranhaconda or The Room. This is not one of them, make no mistake.<br/><br/>Clearly, the strong points here are cinematography and pacing. They are fantastic. It is a thrill ride. Nothing more, nothing less. Insane art design, visual orchestration and stunt work drive home what the director intended: one long chase. This is what it is. If the trailers mislead a potential moviegoer, I would be surprised, they ooze the essence of mindless action. A thing that is often done horribly wrong, and done very right here.<br/><br/>People giving 1-2 stars have never seen a bad film before, in this authors humble opinion.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved it.

"Drakinius","7","1","4","6 March 2016"," A lovely day... but it could be better.
","This movie was and still is amazing to watch. Non-stop action that can only be described in one word; exhilarating and it's not hard for me to say that it's one of the best action films I have witnessed in a long, long time, if not THE best. But it just did not feel like Mad Max. It felt like an entirely different movie compared to the initial Mad Max titles. <br/><br/>For one, there was too little light shed on any of the characters and that includes Max (Tom Hardy). The only thing we learn about him, is that he used to be a cop (much alike the original) and that he couldn't save Glory (the young girl we see who comes to the conclusion that she wants Mad Max to instead be a horror movie, but does a pretty bad job at jump scares and being eerie) Furiosa (Charlize Theron), we know absolutely nothing about asides from the fact that she was taken at birth, bla bla bla another sob story. I, and probably many others found it hard to relate to any of these characters, because there was barely anything to know about them.<br/><br/>At some points the movie seems like it's about to develop a character, but then it just ceases to throw in another adrenaline-fuelling action sequence and it's back to square one; driving a truck in hopes to outrun a bunch of psychopaths. Wait. Oh no! Their vehicle broke down. Best repair it before they catch up!<br/><br/>In Mad Max 2, the characters seemed much more engaging. The supporting characters were just as interesting as Max was, and we could relate to some of them because they had just enough light shed on them so that we could do that. And on top of that, the movie was gritty, it was horrific. It felt like a true post-apocalypse movie, and it managed to tie in well with the action sequences, which mind you, were just as good and even better for their time.<br/><br/>But Fury Road just doesn't do that. It doesn't feel like Mad Max. It doesn't have that sense of gritty, post-apocalypse survival, despite the first few lines in the movie are of Max mentioning his only instinct was to survive. Nobody seems desperate in this movie, except for the citizens who live under the tyranny of Immortan Joe, and they were quickly forgotten about in order to be replaced by more action.<br/><br/>All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely worth a watch. The enthralling action sequences, soundtrack and most importantly the special effects are nothing short of amazing. But to those who have not yet seen it and are thinking you should, do not go in to it expecting a gritty, tense movie full of struggle and dirt. It's not."

","At first I was going to completely write this movie off, but since I had so many issues with it, I took a step back and asked myself, ""is it at least a good action movie"" and the answer is yes, which is also where most of the positive points of the film are.<br/><br/>Where the movie shines:<br/><br/>-Amazing visuals (this movie needs to be watched at least once on the big screen, or a really nice widescreen TV at home). <br/><br/>-George Miller lives for practical effects, and this movie didn't disappoint with great crashes/vehicles <br/><br/>-They used CGI only for certain weather scenes which turned out pretty cool (they didn't use CGI too much, and when they did it looked good) <br/><br/>-Charlize Theron does a great job in her role as Furiosa<br/><br/>Where the movie falters:<br/><br/>-Even though Charlize' character was great, she was essentially the main character in the movie which overshadowed Mad Max himself. If they both shared the lead it would have played out a little better <br/><br/>-Mad Max' character, the guy whose name is built right into the movie name plays second fiddle for the majority of the film (and is generally weak sauce for the majority of his screen time) <br/><br/>-Lack of story/plot as well as lack of interesting dialogue. Even Charlize mentioned in an interview there was no plot, just a whiteboard with scribbling details of how the movie should play out. This is why you can summarize the entire movie as the main group of good guys traveling from A > B > C > B > A with a car chases scene that lasts the length of the movie.<br/><br/>-Forgetting your roots. I'm all for reboots, as long as you retain what was good at the core of the originals. Why were they cult classics you need to ask yourself.<br/><br/>I ranked it 5/10 based mainly on visuals and Charlize' performance. If it had a solid story/dialogue and brought back some of the great qualities of the originals while at the same time rebooting the series it could have easily scored a 10/10. Still a great movie to watch once with this understanding of it."
"Tehmeh","9","1","4","15 November 2015"," If only we had Mel Gibson in this one!
","Seems like whenever we get a Mad Max movie with the word ""road"" in the title, it's going to be great and also full of impressive action. I just finished watching the blu-ray version, along with a couple cool special features.<br/><br/>There is a kind of purity to this film. While it is a big-budget movie for large audiences, it doesn't make any compromises. It is not your typical Hollywood action movie. George Miller, in a way, took all the advantages of mainstream production capabilities but unlike so many others, he didn't fall into that stream himself. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" knows exactly what kind of a movie it is, and doesn't apologize for it one bit.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" isn't deep. There is a simple story and a few somewhat emotional moments, but at its heart it's just pure chaos. Everything is crazy. Characters, vehicles, violence, stunts, camera drives, everything is absolutely crazy. It's not only chaos but controlled chaos, and it's magnificent. If this was an Indiana Jones movie, it would be a 2-hour version of the truck chase scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", pumped up with steroids and acid.<br/><br/>This movie looks beautiful. I'm not only talking about the wonderful design of all the crazy vehicles, weapons and clothes, but also the cinematography in general. Cameras are used exceptionally well, and the scenery is gorgeous. And just when you're getting tired of the orange color palette swallowing everything, you get half an hour of deep, calm blue. After seeing so many movies that try to attack my senses with excessive jump cuts, shaking cameras or horrifying color filters, all in the name of ""visual storytelling"", George Miller shows how it's really done. CGI is used just the way it should be - not to make the film, just complement it.<br/><br/>I have one gripe. Tom Hardy's Max. I usually like him, Tom Hardy is a very good actor, but I didn't buy him as Max at all. Either because it's hard for me to imagine anyone else playing him besides Mel Gibson, or because every time he spoke it sounded and felt weirdly fake. His facial expressions and mannerisms were alright at times, and I enjoyed him to some extent, but he took me out of the movie a couple times. I do realize that Max is always less of a character than the environment, crazy baddies and action itself, but I guess I was hoping for more.<br/><br/>While Max remains a little distant, Furiosa (Theron) and Nux (Hoult) are given more to work with. Charlize Theron is good, and she is the emotional heart of the film. She's not here to look pretty, but to play her part, and she nails it. Nicholas Hoult is clearly having a blast in his role, he is full of energy and adds that certain precious spark to the cast. I have always liked Hoult, now I like him even more.<br/><br/>What else could I say? Crazy characters in crazy vehicles chasing each other, someone playing electric guitar that spews fire and a few grannies with shotguns and rifles. If that didn't make you want to watch it, go see a doctor."

","Mad Max: Fury Road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than I anticipated. It was exciting, the acting was great, the story (yes, unlike what you've been told there's actually a story) was captivating and, while not really all that original, it felt fresh and unique in how it was told. Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip. Yeah, that happens."
"SythusHD","8","1","4","29 September 2015"," Great action visuals, with no understanding.
","Mad Max - Fury Road is a visually stunning movie, with great action scenes, which is most of the movie. But the lack of explaining to the audience who don't know the world of Mad Max is confusing and can take away from the emotional connection to the story. The performances are fine, but Max |Tom Hardy|, who's the title character seems like a secondary star to Furiosa |Charlize Theron|. Furiosa is a good lead, but she's not what the story should be based around. Max barely gets any lines in the movie, and seems to not be important to the plot of the movie. There is a lack of understanding of the story and the world of the movie, with very few scenes to explain the world and it's people. The positives are very good though, the action set pieces are visually stunning, with a lot of practical effects. The chase is very exciting, with a variety of spiked cars and trucks, even with someone playing a rock song on one of the trucks. The villain is really good, but again there is no depth in the characters and the world, to really get invested in the story and what happens to the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max - Fury Road is a fun film to watch, but doesn't live up to it's expectations, the story and characters aren't well developed enough for the audience to care. I'll give this film a Matinée."

The special FX were the star of this movie, not Mad Max, who had about 8 lines in the entire film. As much as I would LOVE to have given this movie a higher ranking, unfortunately I cannot. It just doesn't have any significant plot other than a big car chase for almost the entire movie. If you're going to make Mad Max, then it was a great opportunity to redo the original, but you didn't. You assume that everyone knows who Mad Max is. Unfortunately, half of today's audience haven't necessarily seen the original. You don't explain anything regarding Max, except showing his medical info by tattooing it on his back. No one would have any idea why he's really crazy and where it all started. Why would he be seeing flashes of some girl? Not many would empathize with Max because you haven't explained anything that happened to him. You assume too much and all of the great things that are in this movie fall flat because of it. Sorry, but I only give it 5 out of 10."
"SenorLengua","6","1","4","5 September 2015"," Justice to the original Road Warrior, in part
","The original Road Warrior, Mad Max Part 2, is well known in movie circles, but I am still amazed at how many people do not know of its existence let alone having seen it. The first movie of the series is even less well known, but it is also a better story. Beyond Thunderdome is an average conclusion to the Mel Gibson trilogy of Mad Max, and rightly ended as an attempt at making money. Yet, such is the cultishness of the trilogy, that this new version, Fury Road, was made both for those of us who know the original, and for those that have no experience.<br/><br/>The original Road Warrior was so good because it took all car chases, make them bigger, put a purpose to them, and centered the movie around them. There was real plot involved, too, though nothing like the movie Gibson later directed for his Oscar. The post-Apocalyptic setting of the Road Warrior was also unique, and it all combined to make a wonderful movie that probably is slightly above the level of cult classic. It was never even in any awards discussion, and Fury Road is also like that, but both are very entertaining (the two movies were meant for action, not drama), though Fury Road is more action driven and has a lesser plot when compared to Road Warrior.<br/><br/>Why Miller decided to remake the movie Is a mystery, though money is probably a motivator. That said, he had a lot to live up to. And he mostly succeeded. The major sticking point in this movie would be the ability to match the car chases which were both outlandish and interesting in the Road Warrior. As in the original, they were over the top, but not in a way that was cartoonish. And the uniqueness of the cars was quite good, too, with very little mimicry in the remake. (Though that giant, driving guitar speaker was stupid.) And along the way, there were quite a few small homages to the original series which were clearly meant for fans of the original. <br/><br/>Performance wise, it really amounted to Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and a group of models. My first introduction to Hardy was with Inception, and since then he has quite a few good roles (in another review, I espoused his performance in The Drop). Here, like Gibson in the Road Warrior, the script is not dynamic, but he takes what he was given and runs with it. Like Gibson in the Road Warrior, Hardy plays the role with the same persona and with the same presence. This time, though, Max has a co-star, this being the well-known Charlize Theron. It has been interesting to see her change from the pretty girl roles to ones with more grit. This certainly is that, and anybody who has really paid attention to her career would probably not be surprised to see her with a sheered head for this role. And just like Hardy's part, she needed to have a similar persona and presence, to which she does well. The two really do well playing off each other given the script's limitations.<br/><br/>Juxtaposed to that grit is the quintuplet of models that is supposed to make up this feminist version of the Road Warrior. While none of them are as dynamic in screen persona as Hardy or Theron, they each do well on their own, and as a group, and none of them are really out of place. They also each have a grittiness that grows as the movie progresses that is a nice counter to their typical model life. Credit to this last bit must go to Miller who was able to make these models both visually beautiful and dirty. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie, and exciting, though far from Oscar worthy. I do recommend watching the original trilogy first, but it is hardly necessary. Though the movie is R rated, none of the violence is graphic, there is only a single profane word, and no nudity just to have a naked body (there is some, but it is purposed and not graphic). I would even be comfortable considering this as a PG13 movie, though I understand why it was rated R. <br/><br/>Recommended, probably not late at night as the energy level is quite high.

And a lot of the other ideas of the movie are not new. <br/><br/>Like the army of fanatic neo-nazi boys who know how to fix a truck, made by 5 different cars, but get blood directly from veins of living people, tied to the same truck.<br/><br/>The only surprise is that the Mad Max is not really mad at all.

","I wanted to love this. I really wanted to love this. I came out exhausted, and while that can result from a catharsis, this film did not offer that for me. It was impressive on many levels, but ultimately, did not possess the soul the original has.<br/><br/>...and then there is the... er.... weighty issue. Miller utilizes the tired and insidious visual code: thin=good, fat=evil. If it were Miller alone doing this, I could ignore it, but it creeps in to far too many films without challenge. In addition to being visually clichéd and lazy: it's one of the last frontiers of discrimination, and still considered not only acceptable, but justifiable. For me; the film became less original for its adoption of this tired device. I want to see works that challenge me on all levels: the adoption of this predictable, pedestrian, device nearly ruined this one for me. <br/><br/>Other than that: it is one of the best choreographed films I've ever seen, and the make-up effects department are nothing short of heroic. <br/><br/>ps I want a vehicle with THAT kind of gas mileage!"

For me thats not a good movie, maybe for some teenager will be great , but this movie doesn't have a plot. Acting from Tom Hardy is somehow decent, Charlize could be better.

","In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is directed by George Miller, stars Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, Nicholas Hoult and is the continuation of the legendary Mad Max series - if you haven't heard of it, where have you been for the last 30 years? To be honest I haven't really enjoy any of the two and half Mad Max movies I've seen before, but it would be stupid to critic the heck out of this one just because I don't like the world created by George Miller in those movies. Fury Road is an action movie at its core, it's intense and rough. This film is insanely crazy. There's this guy that depicts perfectly the atmosphere of the movie: he's playing electric guitar on top of truck, shooting flames out of the neck of the guitar during the entire run time of the movie - until he eventually get killed of course. This film doesn't stop from the first shot to the last, hand to hand combat scenes and wide shots of chaos and destruction are very well handled. It involves emotion as well, brought mainly by Charlize Theron's character, due to her backstory. Plus I feel like she is actually the most badass of all. Her and Nicholas Hoult' characters are genuinely interesting and brings a ""little bit"" of humanity in this world; which is fine because we are use to root for Max who is the eternal good guy against all the crazies. Moreover, Tom Hardy as Max is pretty good, knowing that he had to fill Mel Gibson's shoes. Finally, you see some death, destruction, carnage, car explosions, more death, more destruction, more carnage and at last this craziness weirdly makes sense in this film as we are way past the precipice of madness. People clearly aren't sain anymore. <br/><br/>Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is CRAZY. This film does Miller's Mad Max things with a bigger budget i-e a post-apocalyptic movie with a two hours action sequence."
"Mars4532","8","1","4","15 May 2015"," Must see
","Must see for action fans only because the stunts are captured without cgi. The story plot and dialog are sparse like the landscape, but the action is kinetic. It's really a refreshing break from all of the new school action flicks fueled by cgi effects. A lot of reviews are kind of over hyping the movie though. But when a studio puts in $100 million for a movie like this I need to know what they paid for. If you want to see a real action movie - no cheesy stuff - this is it. Music score is pretty good as well as cinematography. The pacing is just edge of your seat pulsating for at least the first 40 minutes which is kind of crazy in this era of filmmaking. It kind of just shreds up the basic arc of storytelling, and says let's just jump right into to it."
"morefaster","5","3","23","16 May 2015"," Entertaining But Forgettable
","THE GOOD <br/><br/>Fury Road has some truly awesome high-speed stunts mixed with (real) practical effects. There are only a few scenes with obvious CGI elements. The action is intense, but there is a scope to it all, no Michael Bay style 360 degree slo-mo or bullet time. Most everything looks like it was achieved in camera using real fx and real stunt people. <br/><br/>THE BAD<br/><br/>There is too much action, too many characters, not enough plot, not enough twists, not enough setup. After about an hour the action becomes redundant and tiresome.<br/><br/>Weird feminist undertones. Not really a complaint, but I prefer the homo-erotic undertones of the Road Warrior to Fury Road's feminism.<br/><br/>Max is BARELY in the movie. He has maybe 4-5 lines. Very impersonal. The rest of the time he plays second fiddle to Charlize Theron. It would have been nice to see him do something besides grunt and point. This was a bizarre choice from Miller. <br/><br/>Worst of all, the V8 Interceptor is crashed within the first 5 minutes and aside from a short appearance later in the film, it is barely seen at all.<br/><br/>Entertaining but forgettable. <br/><br/>5/10"

","Yes it is very spectacular, yes it is very violent (although PG violent, I can't remember more than a few single drops of blood really.) It is very nicely directed and shot, and the few main actors are more than OK. Especially Charlize. It's just that there are so many explosions you get tired after a while, and very little story. It's not Michael Bay-crazy, but has some of his tendencies. It was enjoyable at least, and the 3D version is nice. It is a popcorn flick, so take it for what it is. Mad Max 2 it ain't though. I think I had too high expectations going in and maybe it will grow on me. I would be surprised if there won't be a sequel."

"pivic","9","2","13","23 August 2015"," Utterly thoughtful, action-crazy, brilliant feministic film
","Just as ""The Thin Red Line"" lured loads of boys into cinemas, thinking they'd see something resembling ""Platoon"" or a mindless Schwarzenegger flick, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" takes another route.<br/><br/>There's enough action here to shake a stick at, mainly where CGI doesn't really stand a chance to the real-live graphical action and the special effects are concerned, but the real difference is in the human, here. Both in the contrasts between good and bad, including all of the grey areas, of which there are, humanly speaking, many.<br/><br/>This film manages to inject feminism into your everyday man-packed genre, it's almost maddening to think that this film has come into existence. At the same time, even a broken clock strikes the right time twice a day.<br/><br/>Not that THIS is a broken clock. No, no. This is a world where civilisation is not as us rich westerners know it. It's a world where our poorest live, in cities of dust, with the richest at the top, degrading the ones down the hierarchical line, just along the lines of capitalism, making the ones at the bottom think that's where they belong, all cogs serving the greater good, which in the film is named ""Valhalla"", to where you gladly sacrifice your life to go, whenever your master feels like it, or you are programmed to.<br/><br/>There is no mercy here. No preconceptions like we are used to. People are people. The film starts off brutal, in the wolf's cave, as it where, before Theron's character decides to go off the decided path together with the tyrannical ruler's ""wives"" and gets hunted for it.<br/><br/>In an early scene, when the escaping party makes a run for it, one of the enslaved ""wives"" kicks the chastity belt she's been made to wear, and quickly jumps into a rig.<br/><br/>Theron's communication with Hardy is nearly breathtaking. I mean, enough said, right? I loved the nomenclature. The mixture of language. Words such as ""smeg"" (possibly culled from TV-series ""Red Dwarf""?), ""kamakrazee"" and ""guzzoline"" were well-used. Lines like ""Is that just the wind or a furious vexation?"" and ""We will McFeast in Valhalla"" actually made sense, rather than seeming like something extremely uncomfortable from, say, True Detective (season two).<br/><br/>""How long has it been?"" - ""Seven thousand days. And then the ones I can't remember."" The film's anti-xenophobic. Just see the interplay where War Boy and Hardy's character is. At first, the hatred is inherent, almost inherited; the more they get to know the situation, themselves and each other, respect and like is gained, as with Hardy's and Theron's characters. It's as though naivitÃ© and innocence are shown as-is: good things, really, in comparison with prejudice.<br/><br/>The fights, the action, is nearly without comparison. I was slightly reminded of the introductory scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" when seeing the first battle, but this is beyond that, with a magnificent display made throughout the film. It's really a feministic film, a world based on no bars hold, or rather, on men, women and beings trying to break out of their gender-based cage and away from bad preconceptions.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to say how much I loved the action scenes, the cinematography and the quick editing. The soundtrack is just manic, Wagneresque, and it actually works (where that method is usually, 99 times out of 100, trite beyond words), while you have attackers lurking, coming out of every crevice... It's almost like watching Gilliam's ""Brazil"", it's so far from this world, that it's almost like watching an action-film apotheosis happening before our eyes, in bright, sparkling colours. Killing never looked this good.<br/><br/>This film really stimulates growth in thinking areas, while being ham-fisted in a really good way. THIS is the way to go, for all action films.<br/><br/>Just a thing pulled from the IMDb trivia department that says a lot about this film: ""The film editor, Margaret Sixel, is director George Miller's wife. When she asked her husband why he thought she should do it as she had never edited an action film before, Miller replied, 'Because if a guy did it, it would look like every other action movie.'"" I love this film."

"Screen_Blitz","10","2","13","22 August 2015"," Exhilarating post-apocalyptic action thrill ride
","It has been over 30 years since we've last seen Mel Gibson as Mad Max taking on a gang of street thugs on a deserted road. This year, George Miller reboots his post-apocalyptic franchise with Tom Hardy in one of his most engrossing film roles yet. Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky, a drifter and former captive who forms an alliance with a warrior named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron), along with five women who were hostage by a cult leader (played by Hughs Keays- Byrne), in a vicious thousand-mile road battle against an army of bandits. Featuring an amazing cast including Nicholas Hoult, Rosie Huntington-Whitley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton, this sci-fi action thriller demonstrates astonishing special effects, a compelling storyline, and some of the most amazing cinematography presented this year so far.<br/><br/>I wasn't quite impressed with the original 1979 film with Mel Gibson. But upon seeing the trailer to this one, I had to give this one a chance, and when I watched this; I was absolutely blown away. The post-apocalyptic setting is so beautifully done, it gives the most authentic representation of a post-apocalyptic land I have seen in a long time. Even more amazing is the action sequences. As the film progresses, we are treated with prolonged car chases, complete eye-popping explosions, amazing stunts (similar to what you find the Fast and Furious movies), and outstanding cinematography that you will have your eyes glued to the screen. Tom Hardy does an amazing job as the lead character, and I was pretty shocked by Charlize Theron as the main female. They both work very well on screen together, and their performances shine bright.<br/><br/>If the characters, special effects, and camera-work isn't enough, the film also boasts a deeply engrossing story. In the midst of all the insane action, the story never stops developing. The story is near- perfectly paced and never drags for one moment. George Miller does an impressive job at mixing heavy action with superb storytelling, not a lot of action films do that nowadays. Miller does it just right in this film. He takes time develop the characters and the plot, while delivering these long stretched flashy action sequences.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action of this decade so far. I can easily see one going down as a classic. If you haven't seen the original two with Mel Gibson, no need to worry. This movie pushes the boundaries of what action flicks are capable of. It demonstrates everything that an action film should be."

"homulilly","10","2","13","9 July 2015"," Best action film of the decade
","This is one of the best action films I have ever seen, and this is coming from someone that abhors action films. The atmosphere, characters, and story combine perfectly to create a wonderful film with great cinematography and non-stop action. The simple plot in this film is such a relief coming from other recent action films containing plot twist among plot twist among subplots. It is just simple enough that it is understandable and allows room for action and character development. Major complaints people have with this film is the lack of character development and Max being a side character. The characters in this film change as normal human beings would: slowly. Furiosa being a major change from getting away to an oasis to going back to a horribly run society to create a new life for herself and others. Max has never been a major player in his own movies, rather a plot device to carry other characters along, and that is exactly what he does in this movie. The fact that the women in the film rise up and defend themselves in the best ways they can makes this movie so great for me. And the fact that pisses off MRAs also makes it super great. This film shows strong female characters that aren't just physically strong, aside from Furiosa. They have complex emotions and feelings like normal human beings and do not exist solely as sexual objects, which is an amazing feat in action films. I hope action films follow in Miller's footsteps to create a more realistic atmosphere with relatable characters as well as amazingly cool action. I absolutely recommend this film to everyone."

But they have done a brilliant Job without revising the past Movies. This Movies stands along side the classics just fine.<br/><br/>To be fair the Film was as much about the other characters in the new Movie as it was about Max. Max himself in this Movie is much more introspective and not full of bluster like Mel Gibson's ""Max"" who was talking all the time. (Part of his charm) But this did not detract from the Movie at all.

Each are brilliantly displayed emotionally and physically. Although my complaint here is the lack of more Max. Tom Hardy grips (once played by Mel Gibson) character and gives it a stone cold killer feel with gritty tactics and brute like strength. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) also carries this movie well with as of an intimidating character that has ever been with the way he is aesthetically portrayed. He claws at the role of dictator and is a true foe not to be messed with. <br/><br/>The gore and brutality of this movie is extreme but you are in for a spine crushing ride that never lets off the throttle. <br/><br/>8.5/10<br/><br/>MUST SEE"

"achsaphillippi8","10","2","13","6 June 2015"," What a Lovely Day to Write a Review
","There is hope for Hollywood yet. In an endless storm of sequels and reboots, finally a group of people came together and said, ""Hey, let's make the most amazing entertainment experience of the decade. Let's take Mad Max, and AMP IT UP."" And that's exactly what they did. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie for the ages. Yes, it is a reboot, but it's probably the best one in recent history. <br/><br/>Mad Max and The Road Warrior are enjoyable films. But I think this movie is way better. Mad Max: Fury Road wastes no time with explanations. It's all about the action, and the pure suspense. We understand the setting, the character motivations, and how much the world has changed for everyone without having to sit through a history lesson. It doesn't matter how the Apocalypse happened. It doesn't matter how the main villain Immortan Joe built his citadel. It doesn't matter what exactly happened to Max before the movie starts.<br/><br/>All the necessary information is there: The movie takes place is the post-Apocalypse where humanity had no choice but to go nuts. Max is haunted by the innocent lives he was unable to save. Furiosa's goal is to save the oppressed wives of Immortan Joe from a lifetime of being used as objects that give birth to future warlords. And let the madness begin!<br/><br/>The plot may be simple, and Max might not be the center of the story, but the movie works. We understand everything that we need to know, and we are able to care because the characters and the setting are so visually unique and interesting. I think the acting was superb, and the shining star was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, the one woman army who drives a truck called the War Rig, and can hold her own in a fight against even Max. She is a fearless badass, but also a compassionate and noble soul; she risks her life to betray Immortan Joe and steal away his prized wives so they can find a better life elsewhere.<br/><br/>Also in the mix is Tom Hardy as the titular Mad Max, who is a man of few words. He carves his own path, but will still stop along the way to help the innocent. Another notable performance was Nicholas Hoult, who plays a rabidly devoted follower of Immortan Joe, who insists on driving off to war even though he doesn't have long to live. The villainous Immortan Joe is also notable due to his incredible design and the mystery surrounding his strange cult of freaks, fighting in hopes of being reborn ""shiny and new.""<br/><br/>I would also like to note that this movie features REAL vehicles that the filmmakers built in REAL LIFE, along with REAL explosions and REAL fire.<br/><br/>If this explanation isn't enough to get you to see the film, then here's a list of other awesome things that are in it:<br/><br/>-A great, big, beautiful dust storm with lightning and tornadoes inside it<br/><br/>-A vehicle rigged with men playing the drums, large speakers, and one dude hanging on chords playing a custom electric guitar that shoots fire<br/><br/>-A man wearing a hat made out of bullets whose teeth are also bullets<br/><br/>-Spears that explode on impact<br/><br/>-Old warrior women on motorcycles<br/><br/>-One beautiful thirty-second shot of strange humanoids on stilts<br/><br/>-Lots of stabbing, punching, and exploding<br/><br/>-Did I mention AWESOME vehicles that were built FOR REAL?<br/><br/>I can't fully explain just how amazing this movie is. Everything about it is so enjoyable, not to mention METAL AS HELL. Go see this movie. Take your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, friends, your teenage kids! It doesn't matter that it's not exactly like the old Mad Max films. This blew the originals out of the water and into space!"

","Feels like hope. Recalling these words to sum up my feelings for the return of George Miller and the state of tentpole action films, after seeing the exhilarating, feminist, sense- shattering, visual orgasm that is MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.<br/><br/>Miller & co. has created one the best action films (PLUS chase film, post-apocalyptic film, and genre film) that I have ever seen. Being a film that has little-to-no exposition, it tells its very rich story through action and movement, and allows the audience to pick up details about the characters, their backstories, and motivations-- this is masterful work of visual storytelling and filmmaking which also becomes a universal language.<br/><br/>It has been reported that Miller and his story team (Brandon McCarthy, Peter Pound, and Mark Sexton) created 3,500 storyboards to plan out and basically ""write"" the film and it shows. Add the talents of cinematographer John Seale (pulled out of retirement for this film!) and the film creates a vibrant and emotional visual energy throughout. Most of the action is real, physical, immersive, and has a wonderful flow to it all. This is a film that can be watched over a dozen times, and you can still find something new and interesting within each detailed-pack scene. It's an amazing feat for any filmmaker.<br/><br/>George Miller is back in the wasteland and it has never looked so beautiful."

The characters and story were very interesting, and I was greatly invested. The unique landscapes, vehicles, costumes and characters add to the sheer greatness that this film has achieved. With the lack of both dialogue and slow paced moments, this movie gives you little time to breathe as every scene is action packed and intense. The acting was tremendous as well, as Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron shine in their roles as Max and Furiosa. I can not praise this movie enough, but I will conclude by saying that George Miller has proved himself as a cinematic genius with Mad Max: Fury Road."
"dastaten","10","2","13","30 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is the masterpiece I'd hoped it would be
","I just finished watching, and wow...<br/><br/>This ain't your mother's Mad Max. And anyone who says it's The Road Warrior 'rehashed' is a moron. At no point during the movie did I even feel like I was watching a Mad Max movie. This is a new beast that stands on its own. It's still a post-apocalyptic world, but with Hardy at the helm and with the new story, it feels like a brand new franchise. The action starts early, and it barely lets up for two freakin' hours. And what a lovely two hours it is.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is great, and really, she's the star. Hardy does a great job as Max, but he has like 20 lines in the whole movie (I might be exaggerating). But it doesn't matter - it feels right. Hardy is exactly what he's supposed to be, and he's awesome. And just because he doesn't have a ton of dialogue doesn't mean he isn't always present and kicking ass. He is.<br/><br/>The movie is more about empowering women than anything else. And that's a good thing. It's not about greedy marauders after fuel like the previous Mad Max films, it's a human story. And it sucks you in enough for you to care.<br/><br/>The comradery is awesome, there's a smidgen of a love story, and a bad guy switches sides and you'll love his character. The direction and cinematography are outstanding, and some scenes, including ones of destruction, are just plain gorgeous. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll get teary-eyed. It's f*cking epic.<br/><br/>Simply put, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is an action movie masterpiece, and George Miller is a genius. I don't see how anyone can be disappointed with this movie."

","A flawless masterpiece, Mad Max: Fury Road delivered a jaw dropping performance right in front of my eyes. Mad Max delivered ratings even larger and better than its originals and stands out as one of the best remakes of all time. Mad Max is the movie that ate away movies like Poltergeist, San Andreas, and Age of Ultron. While making muscle car movies like Fast 7 look like they were rated G.<br/><br/>The non-stop action in this movie is truly remarkable. Its nothing like a Michael Bay flick, its its own flick. The movie follows the story of Max, a man shrouded by mystery. His only goal? Survive. The beautiful desert scenery not only marks this title up for best picture, but also provides a great setting for an action movie. The special effects blew my mind away, while the make-up and costumes were absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>In total, this is the movie to watch. I firmly believe that this movie will win awards for best picture and best performance overall. The chase scenes might seem over the top, but you wouldn't care, with all the awesomeness exploding out of your skull as cars turn into scrap and guitars spit fire. Mad Max delivers the real scare and originality into a post apocalyptic setting, something many movies in the future can learn from. You will love this movie and you jaws will drop and shout 10 our of 10."

","Written and directed by George Miller, this is his fourth Mad Max film to date. His portfolio is notably diverse and also includes the horror/comedy The witches of Eastwick and the Oscar winning animation gem Happy Feet. To date, Mad Max is also Miller's most audacious and vivid attempt to truly impress and dazzle the audience, in a much less cuter way then Happy Feet. Unfortunately this is the one and only note that Miller succeeds in.<br/><br/>Mad Max is beautiful, stylish and vivid. The premise of the storyline of Mad Max movies in it's nature has always been fascinating, a dystopian future dominated by motorcycle gangs, violent heroes, villains and survival. As such this also might be the biggest thing that's wrong with Mad Max, it's too ambitious, there is too much happening and thus too much time is spent on showing and depicting the scenery, the characters, leaving little room for actual dialogues and an interesting storytelling. The movie is essentially one, big, 2-hour long, chaotic chase - no wonder Max is a man of few words.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the scenes are very fast paced and short, switching from one angle to another in split seconds, making it hard to concentrate or capture the full creativity of the scenery. There are however a few scenes with very unusual camera angles which greatly add to the dynamic of the movie. The premise of a huge long chase also makes it hard to focus on someone for a long time. The colors are amazing, vivid and contrasting, which is very enjoyable to the eye, the same way the works of Frank Miller are. The golden-yellow desert, matched with dark biker hybrid cars, motorcycles and insane gang-members is definitely pleasing and fun, but only for about thirty minutes. After the initial 'wow' moment passes and one adjusts to the scenery, Hardy's brutality and Theron's new hairstyle, one should quickly realize that Mad Max has nothing more to offer.<br/><br/>The storyline and the dialogues are too dull to compensate for the amazing special effects, background and characters. I was personally disappointed, expecting more of a 'Sin City' then a '300'."

","WOW!!! This movie is complete over the top, non-stop action for 2 hours. I would suggest this movie for anyone who loves action movies/games and want a complete overdose of it. After watching this movie, my need to see an action movie is over for at least a month.<br/><br/>For starters, this movie is all about action so if you are expecting a good story plot or great acting skills then you would the one falling in the category of disliking the movie and even while you are watching the movie you will soon realize that this movie is not for everyone. All those gaming fantasies of Twisted Metal/Rage are going to come true and the way the director has captured so much chaos at once is pure brilliance.<br/><br/>Action sequences are executed very well in a wasteland with the style of attack changing every 10-15 minutes which will keep you engaged and at the edge of your seat. It has so much of over the top, obnoxious yet enthralling action sequences that you will be laughing at some of the scenes.<br/><br/>If you are planning to watch this movie, just know what you're getting yourself into and the ride on the fury road would be far more fun and exciting. The movie starts with what it is and remains true to itself throughout, which could be considered a boon for some and burden for others as not everyone I was watching the movie enjoyed this but they were expecting an exciting plot which it never pretends to have.<br/><br/>So buckle up, get ready and prepare yourself for a ride on the fury road because those who didn't were leaving the cinema after the first hour."

","An action movie has never been more intense and delightful with its extraordinary sequences, stunts and visual non-computer effects (just few exceptions). Fury Road takes us in the middle of the one of the biggest havoc you have probably seen on the big screen. Yet it has everything the ordinary public could expect from the long waited brand new chapter of our beloved Mr Very Mad Max. To be straight and clear, lets cut off all of these mumbo-jumbo complaining reviews, lowering Mad Max's rate very (i mean VERY) inequitably. Its not the best option to see Mad Max if you are a very feminist, Stanley Kubrick's or Woody Allen's fan or some sort of self called critic with aspiration to find really deep envoy, showing us the right way to be. Coz Fury Road is beyond all of that. It was no intention of its director to face any existential problems so if you are looking for some solutions to deal with them-spare your time, your money and don't spit on the movie you probably didn't give a chance from the first minute. Its above your frustrations (just like Max's fans). <br/><br/>The real deal is: Fury Road provides the best sort of entertainment from the first to the last minute. The wastelands wont let you go till either Max allow you to do so or you sh*** your pants watching this true action-packed masterpiece. <br/><br/>""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on a fury road!""."

"DareDevilKid","10","2","14","5 July 2015"," Believe the Hype!
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5 stars<br/><br/>With exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" brings George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life. The film delivers and delivers big time. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Mad Max roars back with a vengeance.<br/><br/>Miller once again gears up for a post-apocalyptic action-thriller with ""Fury Road"", the fourth outing in the ""Mad Max"" film series. Set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life such as water and fuel. Within this world exists two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. We are reintroduced to Max, still a man of action and few words who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. The second insurgent is Furiosa, also a woman of action and one who believes her path to survival and possible salvation may be achieved if she can take a handful of oppressed, tormented, incarcerated beautiful young women across the desert back to her childhood homeland. Max and Furiosa team up in the most unlikely of alliances - and for polar opposite reasons - to stand up to ""the man"", get their hands dirty, and get the job done.<br/><br/>""Fury Road"" has visionary moments, speed, and a wild sense of daring. You stumble out of the theater giddy about what films (even action movies) can actually do when their set their mind to it, transported by the breathtaking velocity in this battering ram of a picture that just goes, goes, goes, and then keeps on going. Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". George Miller's bleak, badass actioner is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.<br/><br/>It also represents a certain kind of hope that's highly implausible to materialize - for as technology continues to improve and digital effects wizardry enhances exponentially, here's an old-school master that refreshingly gets to the basics and uses the powers at his disposal for good rather than to score an easy way out. The action is fast and furious and totally bonkers. And yet the style is totally in keeping with its predecessors while being innovative and boldly new: Old West showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama. Seriously! But the movie has so much more to do with the architecture of the frame and Miller's delight in throwing things right at the face of the audience than any sneaky feminism. There's a kind of kinetic genius to the movie, which is essentially one long chase, adrenaline-pumping chase sequence.<br/><br/>We have to admit that Hollywood's franchise hunger has reached the point where any level of cynicism regarding a sequel, reboot, or re-imagining is defensible, and given that it had been 30 years since the last ""Mad Max"" installment, one could be forgiven for approaching this Tom Hardy-led continuation of the saga with a somewhat jaundiced eye. But all that time away from the franchise clearly gave Director/co-writer George Miller plenty of ideas, because ""Fury Road"" is that rarest of blockbuster beasts: an action- thriller that isn't content to merely string together set pieces. In fact, it's a surprisingly thoughtful film, one whose message is afforded equal importance alongside epic action sequences arranged with balletic, eye-popping grace. Amidst all this, Hardy's Max Rockatansky remains a man of few words - in fact, he spends a good deal of the film with a mask covering his mouth - but alongside co- star Charlize Theron, he grounds the movie's gonzo outbursts with palpable human emotion. Believe all the hype, and then believe it some more. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" will melt your face off, and then slam it back on."
"aneeshsangma","8","2","14","5 July 2015"," Brilliant
","Mad Max Fury Road delivers. For an action genre , It seems it is hard to plot a strong thrilling story line as it is seen with many movies that belong to this genre. Most of them are just stupid and all about action. But Mad Max Fury Road is Wild , Insane, Action packed yet the Story line is interesting and gripping.It gives a much needed revival to the action genre which had been sidelined to only expensive budget special effect movies like Transformers ,Fast and Furious, well R.I.P. Paul Walker, but even though I like the F&F franchise, the story line is well, not strong. The action sequence of Fury Road resembles a lot like Death race, but well it suits better in a post apocalyptic struggle of War Lords rather than in a locked up prison race betting business. Tom Hardy seems to own every action sequence he does. The movie is epic, mind blowing and lastly very refreshing for the action genre."
"vinsim27","8","2","14","5 June 2015"," A great blend of pure insanity and good filmmaking.
","This film is can be considered a perfect summer film, which was exactly what I was expecting it to be. Max Rockatansky returns for his fourth film outing, this time portrayed by Tom Hardy. Imperiator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, steals the wives of the religious tyrant Immortan Joe, played by Hugh Keays-Byrne. Joe's war boys, Including Nux played by Nicholas Hoult attempt to get them back, and Max is caught in the crossroads.<br/><br/>The positives are incredibly numerous within this film. The cinematography in the film was beyond exceptional, cgi was used sparingly, and the soundtrack was surprisingly not bland like every other Hollywood blockbuster released during the summer. Surprisingly, the acting was also particularly well done. I could relate to the protagonists as if they were PEOPLE as opposed to them being cardboard cutouts that have less personality than a chair. The movie wasn't very dialogue driven, but the visual storytelling was very impressive. The story was simple, and the execution was masterful. Even when dialogue was used, the film was exceptionally written, even though it obviously wasn't the main focus of the film. I loved how over the top and awesome the action sequences were and I wouldn't want them any other way. <br/><br/>In the end, Mad Max: Fury Road is an incredible and delightfully fun time at the movies and I can't wait for the sequel to go even further with it's action. I urge you all: this is a must-see. Spend your money on this, and you will not be disappointed."
"fredstockdale-05007","8","2","14","5 June 2015"," Looking at the world of Mad Max
","After seeing for a second time, I have to say it is f***ing awesome. Like my first viewing it is still clear it has no story just a premise, but then on a second viewing I realized that is the whole point.<br/><br/>This is a film about the remnants of mankind surviving by any means possible in a corrupted and twisted apocalyptic future. Therefore there will not be any complex stories or intricacies, no-one is living a complex life anymore, life is now just basic savagery and brutality to survive, we are looking at a 'normal' day in this world.<br/><br/>For this reason I think Mad Max is a great film, a film where a normal day no longer has subtlety or subtext just Barbary and carnage. I see no story because this film takes place in a world where I don't belong, In my 21st century western life every day is filled with complex social and personal happenings so when I view a day in the life of Mad Max I am looking at a day in the life of a person and place where there are no such things.<br/><br/>Mad Max to me is a story our prehistoric ancestors would understand - for it is a story about a scary world where brutality is the dish of the day.<br/><br/>A rambling by me Immortan Fred"
"MUFCOK","9","2","15","8 June 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road is an adrenaline fuelled, nonstop action packed, visual masterpiece.
","This film should certainly be viewed on the big screen; this is where you will received the ultimate experience. I viewed it in 2D but it was very obvious that many scenes were made with 3D in mind and I feel alittle disappointed that I didn't get that experience.<br/><br/>The storyline is minimal and everything you need to know is explained briefly during the opening scenes. There are too many Hollywood films these days which try and cram back stories, subplots, character development and unnecessary dialogue into action movies, making them feel cramped and boring with three hour run times. Mad Max knows what it is, it's an Action Movie and it's as simple as that. It doesn't feel the need to complicate things and kept to a reasonable run time of under two hours, which is what I liked about it. The only thing worth talking about here is the action. It is so well done and so refreshing to see. You get to see full panoramic shots of the action and the use of 'shaky cam' is kept to a minimum. The camera work is breath-taking and it is used in such a way that you feel emerged in the action without having the 'headache/nausea feeling that so many action heavy films give you. I truly enjoyed the creativity of the entire movie, the costumes, vehicles and weapons were all very well done. The action was frantic and felt panicky at certain times, some scenes felt very anxious and the edgy feeling was quite alarming as I didn't expect it.<br/><br/>The movie is split into parts making it easily digestible and keeps it flowing smoothly. It will have 15-20 minutes of intense, breath-taking action then slow it down for 10 minutes with some dialogue. This suits the movie well, especially considering that the scenes breaking up the action are kept basic and do not delve into back stories etc.<br/><br/>I do have a few negatives but they are hard to comment on without giving anything away. All I will say is that some of the non-action scenes feel a little forced and clichÃ©d and what should have been one of the most important scenes in the movie was cut out and left to the imagination as to what happened!<br/><br/>Overall Mad Max is an adrenaline ride from start to finish and needs to be taken for what it is. It doesn't try to have depth and I respect that. Viewing it in the cinema will certainly enhance your experience more so that other films. Go and watch it!<br/><br/>8/10"

","Mad Max is a fresh take on action movies. 2015 was a year full of blockbusters and even so this one managed to stand out; it captures the essence of the previous movies while giving viewers a fresh take on Max and the newly introduced characters. The story, while not rich in dialogue or character introductions, provides all of their motivations by minimum dialogue and gives us a glimpse of backstories. The brides know nothing more of the life they've lived as prisoners or ""breeding stock"", and are chasing a better life although they have no idea what awaits out there. Furiosa, looking for redemption and an old home, hasn't lost hope and is looking out for the rest of the girls. Max, a hardened survivor, is looking only for that: to survive, not get involved in anything, and staying out of the way. Becoming unlikely allies for plot reasons doesn't feel forced but a necessity, as soon as the purpose is filled everyone takes their own way. As for who has the role of protagonist, there isn't really one and only. Both Max and Furiosa complement each other, and the plot drives them to stay together and have their own moments. It wouldn't be enough to have only one of them and the movie did an excellent job giving both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy enough development to make them have a good relationship while staying true to the Max character of being distant."

This is no masterpiece nor something I would recommend to everybody, but to those who love pure action? Go ahead!<br/><br/>Already in the first few minutes you gonna see everything this movie is about: survival, maniacs, fast cars and a hell lot of explosions. I think the title couldn't fit any better, since almost the whole movie is playing on a desert road with a furious Max trying to keep himself alive and a bunch of furious enemies on the hunt.<br/><br/>It was good to see Hugh Keays-Byrne as the antagonist, who already played in the first Mad Max movie, but also Tom Hardy in the leading role and a terrific Charlize Theron on his side. A small weak point in this cast might be the four escorts of Therons character such as Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough and Abbey Lee who have no clue about acting at all.<br/><br/>But I was rarely so full of adrenaline when watching a movie and that deserves my respect.

","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of those movies that shows that a movie can be good without character development, plot development... well, no development at all. It is just a thinly plotted car chase that runs for two hours in a breeze, and only at the end suffers a little bit of overstuffed, overacted, over-the-top. In one word: awesome.<br/><br/>The story doesn't matter. Charlize Theron's Furiosa runs away with the women of the bad guy. Tom Hardy's Max gets in an ""agreement"" with her, and both of them and the women decide to join forces in their escape.<br/><br/>Cue the most surrealistic and incredible car-chase movie ever. As said above, there's barely a plot: Furiosa, Max and the others running away in search of a ""paradise"" while lots of bad guys follow them trying to get the women back. But how it is done is what puts this movie in a high place: the visuals are amazing, the car chases are incredible, and the imagination in all the different moments of confrontation show a knack for the theatrical where George Miller's assured hand as a director shines. From people using poles to throw grenades, to a flame-throwing guitar, to all the explosions, cars flying around, storms, crow-people... It is crazy moment after crazy moment, with little breaks to let the viewer breath.<br/><br/>You probably won't like it if you expect more than crazy action and a car chase. And it runs a little bit too long. Otherwise, you are in for a treat. Nuts, absolutely nuts. In a good way."

","I saw this for the first time the other night, and whilst i have not seen the previous movies, which i probably should have done, i really did enjoy this and was able to understand the concept of Max losing his child and wife, and having that haunt him. I think the let down of this movie was a lack of character development...although i thought Nicholas Hoult was very well done. It seemed as though everyone in the movie was just doing what they had to do, to get to the end of the plot and finish the movie, without seeing any real change or big connection between them. the story was kinda simple but it was easy enough to follow and understand, and personally i feel that whilst the action, CGI, practical effects and soundtrack were great, if the story was deeper, the characters were more developed (apart from Max of course) and there was even more blood and grit to it like an R rated movie, than this would be perfect. all in all, i think the ratings for it are well over what they should be, but i believe that the reviews on IMDb are drastically low.

A man of few words, haunted by the past and cares little of the world he is living in.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is Imperator Furiosa who wreaks revenge on evil Immortan Joe by taking his young wives whose sole purpose is to make babies and be his chattel.<br/><br/>As the ladies escape they come across Max who is help captive by Joe's gang and he reluctantly helps them escape while being pursued by Joe, his sons and other members of his posse.<br/><br/>No doubt this reboot expands the premise of Mad Max 2 and is effectively a one long bonkers chase film with stunning stunts and visuals.<br/><br/>As a nod to the original Mad Max, Hugh Keays-Byrne returns as the villain but plays a different character, the sadistic Immortan Joe. The Mad Max films has form of having the same actors playing different characters.<br/><br/>The film adds a feminist twist with Theron joining Hardy as the lead character and Max being helped out by a group of women escaping from Joe's clutches.<br/><br/>As for Hardy, it is unfortunate that he had so few lines and I have to say that he has yet to wrest the role from Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>The film won six technical Oscars and was a contender for the best Picture and Director Oscars. I doubt this film could be regarded as Oscar bait, it is just an unpretentious action-adventure movie."
"OvidiuMUCA","10","1","5","20 January 2016"," What a lovely day!
","Like a visit to a World Heritage site. By far the best of the Mad Max series, and the best film I've seen so far this year. The movie was excellent, a true continuation of the Mad Max story. It was everything Thunderdome should have been and wasn't. This was the epic restart the Road Warrior deserves, and I hope that Tom Hardy and George Miller create more.﻿ The film is breathless and intense and it'll leave you feeling the same way. Sure, it doesn't waste much time on dialogue or a complex storyline, but who needs that when you've got a desert full of oily trucks and cars revving around and bumping into one another? This is one of the purest action movies I've ever seen – certainly not a disappointing continuation of the Mad Max franchise. What a lovely day!"
"SquigglyCrunch","8","1","5","25 December 2015"," A Truly Unique Kind of Action Movie, Something that We Don't See Often Enough
","I've seen this movie twice now. The first time wasn't nearly as good as the second. I think that it helps having a decent understanding of the plot before going into this movie, otherwise a lot of it ends up feeling pointless. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road follows Max as he travels with Imperator Furiosa and a group of breeders, or wives as they are often referred to as, in the hopes of finding a place where they can live in peace away from Immortan Joe, the breeders' 'lover' and leader. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road's plot is decent. My opinion on it hasn't really changed. I think that it's a good plot and it's executed relatively well. There isn't a whole lot of stuff to say about a plot as simple as this one, but it works for a movie like this, and it's enough to keep the movie exciting. The first time I watched it it all felt pointless due to my lack of knowledge about what it was about. Although it is mentioned a few times at the beginning of the movie, which I guess I just didn't pick up on the first time. <br/><br/>The characters aren't great. My opinion on them remains largely unchanged too. Furiosa's back story feels a bit less cliché this time around, but it still isn't great. All the other characters are just fine. You have a general idea of who they are by the end of the movie, but the development isn't anything special. <br/><br/>The action was way better this time. The car chase that lasts for the entirety of the movie is quite exciting, and while I was never actually tense or uncertain, it was just a whole lot of fun. The action sequences that take place outside of the vehicles are great. There are several shots that are sped up and actually almost add to the level of urgency within the movie. Not only that, but it just looks really cool. It's very stylish for lack of a better word. <br/><br/>The visuals are also great in this movie. From the backgrounds to the cars themselves, everything looks great. The fact that the cars are actually real as well really helps sell the movie as more realistic-looking, and makes it all the more impressive. <br/><br/>The movie is very unique. Something I wasn't prepared for originally is the fact that everyone is insane in some way. It was weird the first time, but the second time it just makes it way more unique. The movie has a very unique feel and look, and it pulls it off most of the time. The parts that weren't unique were often clichéd plot points. The clichés in the movie stand out a lot when the rest of the movie is so special, and that's really the only reason I haven't rated this movie higher. <br/><br/>Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is great. It's a special breed of action that I wish I could see more of. It's so much fun to watch, yet it goes so much deeper than fun with it's visuals and feel. This movie is so unique to the point that any cliché sticks out like a sore thumb, and those parts hurt the experience. This is easily one of the best movies of 2015, and one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a movie. In the end I would certainly recommend this movie, especially if your looking for a heck of a lot of fun."
"emilandreolsen","10","1","5","22 October 2015"," Not the revolution some are saying, still a great action movie
","I'm going to say it right now: this is one of the greatest ACTION movies I have ever seen. It had amazing car chases, exhilarating hand-to-hand fight sequences, with some of the most realistic choreography I've ever seen, and it even took time to tell a story. Though not in the typical way (tons of exposition in dialogue, painfully boring cliché romance etc.)<br/><br/>If you're going to review a movie, I don't think it's fair to start with comparing it to another. You have to look at what the movie sets out to do, and how well it pulls it off. Mad Max: Fury Road does nearly everything right. The action is exhilarating, the cinematography is beautiful (no shaky cam and stunning visuals) and even the characters are given proper depth through their actions. Some of it is, admittedly, easy to miss, like one of the girls carrying a music box, and some of the characters might feel bland as a result (at least if you haven't read the comics.) But if you re-watch the movie and pay attention to the things happening in the background, you will see that every single character is reacting to what is happening on the screen in their own way. This is what drives this movie. It's the interactions, expressions and the delivery of the lines that builds the characters individually, and I applaud the movie for not treating the audience like idiots. <br/><br/>Action is, as already stated, fantastic. The stunt-work is some of the best I've ever seen, and Tom Hardy is wonderful at fight choreography. It might not have shown in The Dark Knight Rises, but it definitely shines through here with how he throws himself around during the fight scenes. The costumes and make-up (all hand-crafted of course) makes it all feel real and authentic. And the vehicles. The vehicles... As a huge petrol-head, I was blown away by how much effort they put into building these machines. They help the movie build an impression, despite the fact that some of them are a bit too big and too excessive for the environment. However, the movie does try to explain the more insane ones, and does a reasonable job at it. <br/><br/>The plot is lackluster, but Mad Max never tried to tell a deep story. The story is just there so that our characters have something to do while the world is built around them. I must say though, that the movie does get themes right. There are themes like betrayal, loneliness, depression, fear, stress, anger and even desperation in this movie, all told through the visuals of course. There is one scene where one of our characters breaks down and lets loose a scream. This scene is very well filmed and is slightly heartbreaking, and is made even better by the acting. The themes I mentioned are pretty much all explored here in this half a minute long scene. <br/><br/>Overall, I don't see why nobody acknowledges why this movie is great. Sure, it's not the greatest movie ever, but it does do a lot of things right. It tells a story about good characters through amazing action and visuals.<br/><br/>It's not a 10, it's DEFINITELY not a 1-4, it rests in the 6-9 area. For me it's definitely an 8. Good job, team."
"driesenbrandon-81948","4","1","5","20 August 2015"," Over the top
","As far as story lines go this movie has little story for a 2 hour film. But as for the action it is greatly done. Although it does not excuse the painful first hour of the film. As the movie drops right in the action without ever explaining the story. <br/><br/>Although I must admit that even though there is no real story except the simple main one. The action is great and the acting is good as well. Although the action is way over the top but since it is executed this well it is still a movie you should watch if you love explosions without a real good story.<br/><br/>It's a movie only fit for an action oriented audience but not for those who seek a great (or even passable) story."
"shikhilnangia","6","1","5","15 August 2015"," Sci Fi Based Thriller that will keep you enthralled
","Mad Max Fury Rage has a probable weak story line and the only reason it is a hit is because of its out of the box location , characters , Action and Adventure .<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize have played their role well and some scenes in the movie have some vivid imagination of how War takes place at that time . The location of a deserted place lacking greenery and mankind is a sure put off for some of us . Likewise, there is essentially no dialogue, save a few grunts from Max and cringe-inducing awkward lines from the rest. <br/><br/>All in all this movie lacks the depth and it is a one time watch !"
"RileyOnFilm","7","1","5","19 July 2015"," Amazing Action, Not About Max
","It did well with critics but it's not without its detractors. I had read it was a class A action movie and on that basis alone I was excited to see it. I saw Mad Max in high school so I was aware of the character and the austere Australian cult vibe of the movie. This new version was only alike in costumes. The dialog was minimal but there were some heavy themes present. The evil leader gets his minions to blow themselves up by explaining some sort of after death paradise. Modern parallels anyone?<br/><br/>The movie is not from the perspective of Max this time. We see a lot from a group of women who get pregnant and supply their milk to the group for nourishment. I'm not entirely sure how helpful this was to the plot. It did, however, show by proxy that they had lost civilized conventions ... like cow's milk. The chases and shoot em up scenes are top notch. I wasn't bored once. The movie really is just one long car race and gang war. If you saw the trailer, you know about the flame thrower guitar. I wondered why that would be there but them recalled how in the revolutionary war the soldiers wee often led by flutes and drums. By the way, in addition to the wicked guitar flamethrower, there are some amazing drums on the cars. So often action movies get caught up in storytelling scenes. Max avoids that. It's just one long running action scene with pointless dialog from time to time and in between. Because it didn't focus on Max very much and because the story was a little weak it lost points. As an action movie, I think it will take its place in history as one of the best."
"Finfrosk86","7","1","5","2 July 2015"," Slightly overrated, but entertaining enough
","Wow, it's the same thing almost every time - when a movie receives extreme praise from both audiences and critics, it is wise to be a little skeptical, because it's probably not that good. And while this is a pretty entertaining movie, it's nothing too special.<br/><br/>I wanted to like it, I always want to like movies, but I'm giving my honest opinion here.<br/><br/>It does have some really cool elements though, and some nice cinematography, some awesome shots. But I found it to be rather uneven. We have long action sequences, that are not really that exciting, to be honest. It got a little dull. It's basically the same thing for 2 hours. But spread evenly around are small things, details, that bumps it into awesome-territory, then the action bumps it down again.<br/><br/>This was how my brain was thinking during the movie. <br/><br/>It went from: 'Is this all there is'? <br/><br/>To: 'wow, OK, yeah that's pretty cool'. <br/><br/>To: 'This is not that entertaining'. <br/><br/>To: 'Oh, that is awesome though'. <br/><br/>And so on. See? Uneven.<br/><br/>And where was all that gore and violence I was promised? We see a bunch of dudes getting run over, but there is so little gore that I felt like this was PG13 most of the time. I don't mind PG13, but when a movie is rated R, I expect more than what we got here. (could it be they were aiming for PG13, but got an R and didn't have time to edit?)<br/><br/>It probably doesn't help me much that I don't like this kind of dry, deserty post apocalyptic crap. But considering I don't like it, I did like the movie relatively well. Parts of the main plot I am totally sure I've seen before. I don't want to spoil anything, but right? Haven't we seen exactly this in some cartoon for children or something?<br/><br/>The acting was fine, I don't really have much to say. Immortan Joe was pretty cool, Max was a little weird. Charlize I have nothing to say about, but she did fine. Mel Gibson should absolutely have been in it though, he has some real charisma, which this movie is lacking. (I know he's an a- hole, but he's still a good actor)<br/><br/>The effects look pretty decent for the most part. I've read that there is a lot of practical effects used here, which people go on and on about, I don't care that much, I just want to see cool stuff. CG or not. There is definitely CG used in Fury Road, too btw. Not all of it is great either, actually.<br/><br/>So, all in all. Uneven movie. Some really good parts, other parts are not that good. Some ideas work very well, others no so much. I'm looking at you, air soul heart grab thing. Among other stuff.<br/><br/>I think you have to like cars/engines/driving, and SAND to really dig this movie. Plus it helps to be a huge fan of the old ones, I guess."
"khaktus","6","1","5","19 June 2015"," A satire that does not wink at the audience.
","This is one example of a bizarre vision - that presents itself in 1:1 scale.<br/><br/>Some portion of straight men (or gay clone-lovers perhaps) can take this seriously and just see a ""cool"" guy-kind-of-movie, that reeks of petrol, sweating muscles and glorified death ... with helpless supermodel girls endlessly soaking in water and playing with hose.<br/><br/>I'm wondering, how would it sell if it was happening in the Third Reich, since the content (life-style) of the movie is the same.<br/><br/>It seems this is a life-scale rendering of how the ideal man's world would look like: No whiners, no weaklings, man reduced to combating machine (muscles, shaved head, constant action, aesthetic/sensitive sides suppressed - just a pure functionality ... without a chance to reverse the old phrase ""women are pretty, men are strong""), life as a perpetual battle with lots of huuuge metal toys to play with, speed, fury, madness, strict hierarchy of ranks, fetishized death (what else could be a purpose of life of the non-feeling machine?). And then, the objectification - of the other men (use them as tools for ones own project) and women (living baby-ovens) - they are not treated as human beings or equal partners, they are used as things.<br/><br/>As such, it can be taken as an extreme kind of satire - to what's bubbling in male heads under the civilized camouflage of post-modern sensitivities. A satire that does not wink at the audience. You just have to have an intellect and will to grasp it as very bitter irony. As such, there hasn't been any more provocative and ""straight-in-your-face"" movie around recently."
"food-movies-sleep","7","1","5","19 May 2015"," Mad Max -- Not Max as half as Mad!
","I have not seen the Mel-Gibson Trilogy. So I went for a screening of this film for a dosage of action and also to check out what the chatter of this movie being feminist was all about.<br/><br/>I kind of like the fact that all the men in the movie are mostly relegated to driving like crazy, shooting, exploding, SHOUTING!STRINGS!OF!SINGLE!WORDS! and strumming a flame throwing guitar(one guy). Max looks sullen and handsome while kicking some(but not half as much as expected) @$$! Nick Hoult plays a version of a Crazy Zombie(as compared to the love lorn one he has portrayed before). The Villain was more funny than menacing.<br/><br/>So it is the women who are shown to have various emotions, decent dialogues and give the story some depth. Oh they also get the major share of the action! Charlize Theron brings out the Oscar winner in her even amidst all the noise and dust! The Ladies literally take the driver's seat in this movie. And the more interesting takeaway is that the director imagines an apocalyptic world where even though some women will be treated as just soft-skinned baby-carriers, there will arise a group of women(age no bar) who will stand up and fight and amidst the the survive-at-all-costs and hope-is-a-mirage imperatives, will still show tenderness towards all life forms. Boys, on the other hand, will remain boys. But have no doubts. This movie is an out and out action flick and literally hits the road running, well, just after Max chews the head out of a lizard :-) <br/><br/>I like the fact that there is no sex or mushy-mushy flashbacks and the whole movie is one long to and fro journey filled with fireworks(and the 3D ensures that some come right at your from the screen!). It is a simple film and I would recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to sit back, fasten the seat belts and enjoy the trip down the Fury Road."
"BigTenPower","Null","1","5","18 May 2015"," Great Action!
","I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road and that fact comes as a big surprise to me. I was expecting a brain damaged WWE version of this remake. Judging by the trailer, I wasn't expecting much. What we get instead is a super romp of an action film that goes out of its way to keep the pedal to the medal at all times from start to finish. I can't say I'd want every movie at the cinema to be all action orientated like this one but it's refreshing to see a few at times and to see one get action right. No CGI floating crap but solid real world stunts. The stunts are very believable and it a well executed film. The action is intense even if it is over the top and cartoonish. I've become so sick and tired of wire-work fight scenes that when a movie like this chooses to use raw, real action instead of wires, I applaud. My only real criticism of this one was the fact that is too long of a running time. All action wears thin after the hour and a half mark."
"MaximumMadness","10","2","16","11 July 2015"," One of the finest action-films in decades, ""Max Max: Fury Road"" is a welcome return for the iconic character! Shockingly entertaining! Perhaps the best in the series...
","The art of cinema is a splendid medium... capable of conveying many themes and ideas. From romantic revelations, to sinister horror, to wonderfully rich metaphors for the world at large. Cinema is by far the most fascinating and rich canvases for artists over the past 100 years. <br/><br/>And it is used here to great marvel and spectacle to convey an exquisite art... the art of carnage, destruction and action.<br/><br/>From master director George Miller comes the return of one of cinema's iconic action heroes... or rather anti-heroes. ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, first immortalized on-screen over 30 years ago by Mel Gibson. (Say what you want about Gibson- who has admittedly gone quite mad himself in recent years- but his three performances as Max are legendary.) Now, the mantle is passed to Tom Hardy, and the series has been given a fresh start in the form of this pseudo-reboot from the same creative mind as the original. (Although technically, this could also be considered a sequel, as outside of one detail, it frankly would fit in fine with the continuity of the original series)<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic future, former-lawman-turned-surviving- wanderer Max (Hardy) is captured by a tyrannical cult-leader called ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and made into a blood-donor to help give strength to his ailing forces- the ""War Boys"", who Joe has conditioned to worship him like a god. However, Max is able to escape and joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a former ally of Joe who has betrayed him and is attempting to escape with Joe's numerous brides/breeders, so they can start a new and peaceful life. What follows is in deranged, insane and highly entertaining adrenaline fueled ride as Max and Furiosa attempt to escape the every growing and ever pursuing forces of Joe and the War Boys- a chase that will rock the world with its fury and ferocity.<br/><br/>Something that I see as a recurring theme is the fact that many are bemoaning the fact that despite being the titular character, Hardy's Max is often overshadowed by other character's... particularly the excellent Theron as Furiosa. And while I will admit this is true, I don't understand why others see this as such a flaw. While the original film was indeed Max-centric, thus far, no other entries have really had Max as the main focus in terms of story. Max is honestly more of a conduit to drive the film forward and introduce the audience to the actual situation at hand- ""Road Warrior/Mad Max 2"" and ""Thunderdome"" both followed this model and are well-regarded. And ""Fury Road"" follows suit. <br/><br/>Sadly, this film is also being chastised by some of the more deplorable members of modern society as well- so-called ""Men's Right Activists"" (a P.R. friendly way to spin bitter and evil hatred of women into a more palatable-sounding term), who exhibit dreadful and disturbing misogyny to condemn the film for having strong female characters. But I guarantee to anyone open- minded who would like to see the film that their claims are far from the truth, and the film benefits from its strong female presence. Don't listen to their demented, prejudiced and hateful minority voice.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is it's wonderfully quirky atmosphere and the top-notch direction of Miller, who proves that even after 30 years, he still has the ability to spin wonderfully compelling sequences of mayhem while also being able to tell a simple, coherent, hard-hitting story. This is one of the best-directed action films I've ever seen, and Miller's insistence to film the many action sequences with as many practical effects as possible gives it an edge over many other movies being released today. You haven't seen action so quick, furious, ferocious and- most importantly- REAL as this is in a long time.<br/><br/>The cast is also fantastic. Although Hardy is indeed overshadowed, he gives a good performance as Max, and you get a real sense of someone whose life is hollow from personal loss and the constant need to survive. Keays-Byrne is a wonderfully wicked as ""Immortan Joe""- something that shouldn't be surprising, given the fact he also played the lead villain ""Toecutter"" more than 30 years ago in the original ""Mad Max."" But the real star is of course Theron's Furiosa, who is just a delight. Tough yet with an emotional core, Furiosa is absolutely outstanding, and I wouldn't mind seeing her return in future ""Max"" films or even in her own spin-off.<br/><br/>I really shudder to reveal too much more about this film as to not spoil anything, because the film moves so quickly and is so well- paced, it deserves to be seen without too much foreknowledge of spoilers or story-beats. Suffice to say, I'm in love with it. <br/><br/>Please see this remarkable film if you're a fan of action or suspense. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" easily earns it's perfect 10 out of 10 from me."

You could say that it is just their opinion that the movie is bad and that it is a love hate type of movie but it absolutely isn't.

Everything about this film is perfectly executed from its amazing visuals and cinematography to it's exhilarating score and if you say it bored you and is a bad movie it is probably because you just watch a movie expecting it all to be given to you and don't appreciate the endless time and effort put into creating something as incredibly cinematic as this. Don't get the wrong idea, i'm not saying you're not allowed to think this way about movies and i know the majority of audiences today look at films the same.

"griccardi-20184","8","2","16","9 June 2015"," Non-stop action with biblical undertones
","For the generation of moviegoers who are unfamiliar with George Miller's post-apocalyptic masterpiece, Mad Max: Fury Road is a rip roaring, stylistic treat on wheels that doesn't stop until the very last face-ripping explosion.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't retooling the franchise for the new generation and instead, added a new chapter to the ongoing saga. And who better to reintroduce Mad Max to the new generation than the old man, George Miller himself? Nobody, that's who.<br/><br/>Now, to be honest, I'm not much of an action-film guy myself. I've boycotted all of the Transformer movies and I won't be watching Furious 7 without somebody putting a gun to my head. But give me X-Men or Guardians of the Galaxy; give me anything where action meets plot and tie it all together with a unifying theme and I'll be all over it. Fury Road has all of those things!<br/><br/>For the action movie fanatic, it's two hours and change of virtually uninterrupted action sequence with visually stunning effects and some of the hottest girls on film. And for those of us who like to think during an action flick, it's got some serious underlying social criticism. <br/><br/>First, the most important things in the world are gas, water, and women. This should sound pretty familiar. If you're a Mad Max fan, the water and gas thing is a bit of a re-visitation albeit realistic in that commodified resources are pretty much the stuff that modern wars are made of. And if you don't think women are a commodity in this day and age, you need to take a look around. Really, people are a commodity and everyone is for sale if you really want to dissect it, and the movie touches on that aspect as well. <br/><br/>And how does is touch on that aspect, you ask? Well, there's something very biblical about what's going on in the movie. It's true the film's antagonist, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), chases after his wives through the whole movie, which has stirred up controversy among men's groups because of... honestly, who cares why? But the movie is clear in showing the importance of Joe's wives as baby-making machines, serving the utilitarian purpose of propagating new generations of loyal followers.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe (Byrne) is more than your run-of-the-mill psychotic super villain. He's a patriarch and spiritual leader who manages all the resources in an otherwise lifeless wasteland, who also purports himself to be some sort of connection to the great beyond. All of the sudden it makes sense that his followers would willingly blow themselves up to carry out his will, and why the only women who survive in the post-apocalyptic future are the ones you want to see naked. After all, if you were Immortan Joe, wouldn't you choose nothing but the best?<br/><br/>If there's one objection I have, it's that Tom Hardy might be a little too sexy to pass as a post-apocalyptic road warrior. Maybe they could've given chapped lips or just given the part to Joaquin Phoenix. But Hardy holds his own as an action hero, even if Max is more of a narrative character in this movie. Charlize Theron on the other hand, who has shown us these kinds of acting chops in Monster, gets her fair share of ass-kick as the heroine of the movie and held it down in what turned out to be the lead protagonist role. As hot as we all know she is in reality, they ugly her up just enough to make her a believable Furiosa, and her bionic hand gave her that extra Mad Max edge.<br/><br/>Try and guess who gets their face ripped off at the end. You might be surprised."

","The first half of this movie was almost entirely dominated by special effects which obscured the story. The second half was much more intense, as the relationship between Max and Furiosa developed. Charlize Theron was marvelous as Furiosa. Her character is the most developed and the one with whom the audience could empathize. The same could not be said for Max. He is a wanderer; we know little else about him. The world is harsh, and Max is a battered wreck who is barely surviving. Furiosa is also battered, but she is beautiful, as well as heroic and idealistic. She is willing to risk her life for others in a world where the value of human life is zero. Max also is heroic, but yet is still a wanderer. The post-apocalyptic world is presented starkly. It is a wasteland where resources are scare and whoever controls the resources has power. There is a dictator who reigns through terror and controls the resources. He is the bad guy. But is Max a good guy? The cast is excellent; their performances are powerful. Although this movie is science fiction, its premise, that civilization can collapse, is not without plausibility. Tom Hardy performs excellently as Max. Although brutalized, Max maintains his dignity. The question is whether he and Furiosa and trust each other. To find out what happens, watch the movie."

","I wanted to see this film for the longest time (I missed the theatrical run), and after buying the DVD at Walmart and watching it tonight, I have to admit, I was impressed with the engrossing action.<br/><br/>It's all one hasty road runner epic with barely time to breath. The pace is quick and you have to make sure you pay attention or you'll miss out on important key points to the plot. <br/><br/>The miserable, barbaric and totally cruel future is there which is the principle theme for these Mad Max films A world where nobody trusts each other and everything is all about guns, violence and saving the precious 'juice"" to make vehicles move.<br/><br/>This time around, there's beautiful and sacred pregnant women at stake and a hunt for the ""Green Place"" where everything is a Utopian grassland and an escape from the desert. An exciting goal for the story and even more exciting when there's a twist to the dream and the challenge to meet it.<br/><br/>The violence is non stop and the desperate killing to survive is plainly evident in this film. Max has flashbacks to the death of his wife and daughter and it's too bad the film didn't focus more on that, allowing the viewer to know the reason for Max's angry and hauntingly bitter mentality to the ""bad guys"".<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is perfect as the 'Rambo Female"", but there's no kissing or romantic moments here with Max. It was a brutal ""kill or be killed"" emotion between the two at the beginning, but after the chaotic clashes with the raging villains, they eventually learned to trust one another.<br/><br/>The barbaric, nuclear wasteland of a despairing future is an old cliché, but this movie brings a refreshing feel to that by making it into one wild and crazy race. In the ""Road Warrior"", the highway chase was saved towards the end along with the climactic finale, but here, the chase is through the whole movie. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is excellent as Max and Charlize is equally excellent as the ""SHE-RAMBO"", but the super quick movements of the characters makes it seem like the film was playing on high speed instead of running at a normal rate. Regardless of the flaws, this movie delivers on entertainment and continuous suspense. It's all on-the-edge-of-your- seat excitement. I highly recommend it."

"sbstevenson-02099","10","1","6","10 June 2016"," Brutal, high octane brilliance
","Firstly many people who've seen this title without watching the originals say that it's just one long car chase scene, well, welcome to the world of Mad Max. Since the beginning Mad Max has always been about 'a world gone mad' and a world where people only understand violence and cars. Not a bad world really, however Fury Road does give a good story behind the epic car chase. With a relatively sane, Furiosa, risking everything to help save a group of female sex slaves from an evil post-apocalyptic warlord, Immortan Joe, with unfortunate Max getting tied up in the middle, and kicking some serious ass in the process. As with the previous entry's in the series Fury Road doesn't massively focus on Max, he is a very important character, but he is greatly tied up in other peoples affairs. To summarize Fury Road is a fast paced action film with great acting and some very well scripted moments. With brilliant costume design, an epic original score and some amazing visuals, you can do a lot worse than Fury Road, and not much better."
"bix171","9","1","6","21 February 2016"," Full-Tilt
","George Miller's nightmare post-apocalypse vision is told primarily through kinetic visuals with dialogue provided only when needed. Yet it's so simple a story he's telling that the visuals are pretty much all that are needed; Miller relies on the visceral to move his story along. This all works because the dystopian world Miller and co-scenarists Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris creates is complete, with history, customs and rituals fully developed and identifiable; the viewer doesn't need a whole lot to buy in. This is also true in relation to the main characters, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Max (Tom Hardy): they don't have a lot to say but you get them immediately. Miller consistently comes up with imaginative set pieces (there's a knockout sandstorm and a nice monochromatic section is an interesting alternative to the mostly daylight action--the production design is by Colin Gibson) and displays as much Gothic grotesquery as he possibly can: there are alabaster bald children, weird midgets and startlingly obese men on wild display and that guitar player swinging from the front of the truck gave me the creeps; he gets tremendous make-up artistry from a team led by Lesley Vanderwalt, Elka Wardega and Damian Martin; every ugly image--and there are many--is beautifully rendered. Everything is full-tilt here but fortunately John Seale's cinematography and Margaret Sixel's editing are up to the task. Miller has thrown away the campy shtick that was ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" in order to revisit and fortify the series' original raison d'etre: a despairing view of a world gone insane due to a dependency on oil. Its relevance is just as timely as it was back in the days of ""The Road Warrior"" and even though it's a heady theme, this entry is just as entertaining as ""The Road Warrior"" was, only turned up to eleven. The soundtrack is by Junkie XL (he of the remix of Elvis' ""A Little Less Conversation"") and it's very good."
"TheBarleyGuy","10","1","6","12 February 2016"," An absolute masterpiece
","Mad Max: Fury Road is one of my favourite films of 2015, and without question one of the absolute best films gracing this years Best Picture category at the academy awards. It's absolutely one of the biggest surprises in the category, I had feared the film would be written off as an action movie, but was overjoyed to see it up for the big prize, as well as 9 other possible prizes.<br/><br/>There's something so special about a movie like this. Proof that strong and interesting female characters can lead one of the most balls-to-the-wall action movies that I have seen in my entire life. The titular Max is present, and Tom hardy does an excellent job, but he plays more of a secondary character in the movie. He doesn't say much, but manages to only keep the badassery up around 150%. Charleze Theron is a force of nature as Furiousa in this movie as well, and leads the movie in a way that women are almost never given the opportunity to do in action films.<br/><br/>Combining feminist overtones, criticisms of the patriarchy, and our reliance on fuel are things that many action films wouldn't touch with a 1000 foot pole, but Mad Max does that and still includes more impressive and amazing action than any other action movie has in years.<br/><br/>The cinematography and visual effects that this movie employs are some of the best I've ever seen, and there seems to be a seamless blending of real and computer generated effects from start to finish. This creates an epic and amazing feeling that so many action films try for, and fall short. If this doesn't win best picture, it would border on criminal to deny it the effects awards it's up for.<br/><br/>An absolutely stunning achievement that needs to be seen by everyone. If you haven't gotten up on this one yet, I can't imagine why for the life of me.<br/><br/>As I have with the previous films, I kept an eye on the number of those characters who were not white, cisgendered, heteronormative characters and even an eye on the Bechdel test. The movie passes the Bechdel test, but unfortunately doesn't have a hugely diverse cast. That said, the presence of immensely strong female characters is a refreshing change and is probably the most unique of the nominees so far."
"pete-murphy97","9","1","6","9 January 2016"," The film of 2015, and that's saying something.
","Mad Max: Fury Road as explosive and high-octane of a film that it is - and it really is, ceases to surpass this blood-pumping novelty that draws the masses each time a film drops, with the much-needed structural pretext and development a world as intriguing and terrifying as this inherently demands. It ought to just be called 'Fury Road', because I just cannot see any of Mad Max in this. <br/><br/>The normally hard-as-nails Max lacked the context, dialogue and gritty propensity that was manifested in the lead character in previous titles. He felt as empty, and overly solemn as the wasteland he traversed, and left a characteristic power-vacuum that was taken up only by the assertiveness of Furiosa, something that eviscerated the burning impetus that ultimately once defined this series; the brutal skin-of-the-teeth fight for survival - something this films' lethargic, near vegetative Max could never realistically confront. <br/><br/>The over-reliance on flame-throwing guitars; as cool as they are, feels like a comedic misplacement in a film that is allegedly post- apocalyptic. It seems too kid-friendly, with marketability that is appallingly and obviously aimed to accommodate the widest possible audience without completely eliminating the essence of the series; that unfortunately means a big cut-down on the lore and back story; components that are farcically underestimated in modern Hollywood film sequels and remakes, and dare I say even most new titles? The new mentality is that which will blow the box office to smithereens, forget originality. <br/><br/>Alas, the film does not suffer utter disintegration, I'll cede that the art style feels distinctively Mad Max, the cars, locations, sheep skulls, and so on, it is admittedly visually astounding. The chase scenes masterfully choreographed, the deaths gloriously vicious... the only pressing question left to be asked is; where is Mad Max himself? <br/><br/>One day he may return.<br/><br/>8.1/10"

","""Witness me Blood Bag!! Witness!!! I live, I die, I live again!!""<br/><br/>There's one word that comes to my mind after watching ""Mad Max Fury Road"", and that's the word ""madness"". This is a perfect visualization of what the term madness means. I truly believe that the creators and writers of this hallucinatory trip were fed with hallucinogens. A spacious cocktail of exotic mushrooms, barbiturates and other drug-related products. Otherwise I wouldn't know how they could think up this crazy, wacky post-apocalyptic film. A film that feels as if it consists of a single action scene. You're not given a moment to catch your breath. It's undeniable that this movie adopted the concept of ""Mad Max"" from 1979, a legendary cult film with young Mel Gibson in a leading role. The same desolate and parched Australian landscape with a shortage of water and petrol governed by fanatical gangs.<br/><br/>I must confess I've already watched this film a while ago and I never saw the need to publish my review. I thought that my opinion would contribute nothing to the general opinion that you could read here and there on the internet. Everyone uses the same superlatives and glorifying terms for this extravagant action movie. In general, everybody agrees this is an insanely great, explosive, ingenious and never tedious re-boot.""It's loud. It's unrelenting. It's crazily exciting, and, at times, it's just bloody weird"". ""Why repeat this again?"" I thought to myself over and over again. But recent events forced me to rewrite it a bit and highlight an additional aspect that's applicable to today's events.<br/><br/>We return to the scorching desert in a post-nuclear world where people struggle to survive and follow crazy figures that rule over vital resources such as oil and water. Someone like Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who thinks he's a kind of god and tyrannically keeps his followers in his grip. He rules the Citadel (an old water reservoir) and has his own private army of fanatical War Boys. This Mad Max episode shows how this lawless gang of lunatics start chasing Imperator Furiosa (Charlize ""The Italian Job"" Theron). She kidnapped Joe's harem (including Zoe Kravitz, daughter of). She's later assisted by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) who serves the first half hour as a living blood supply for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).<br/><br/>After the terrorist attacks in Europe and hearing a debate about the motives of a suicide bomber, I came to the conclusion that the creepy War Boys exhibit similar characteristics. They follow blindly a charismatic leader and sacrifice themselves for the greater goal. A hero status is awaiting them when killed in battle. They earn a one way ticket to a paradise they call Valhalla. By sacrificing themselves they become immortal in one fell swoop. Strange, but after the IS attacks, I immediately thought of this brainwashed gang. A similar motivation and the same destructive self-sacrifice.And then there's the guitarist firmly attached with elastics who's stirring up the troops into action, while he's playing his flame-throwing guitar. An absurd image amidst total chaos. Similar to the drummer at the forefront during the battles at Waterloo. Or ""Piper Bill"" who walked undisturbed on the beach with his bagpipes at Normandy landings in WWII.<br/><br/>It's evident that every fiction film contains comparables with reality sometimes. But beyond these serious digressions that overtook me, I can only recommend to watch and enjoy this macho blockbuster, filled with action-packed chase scenes with futuristic cars. A with diesel and gun smoke smelling stunner that deserves to be titled ""Furiosa: Fury Road"". Charlize Theron effortlessly outperforms Nicholas Hoult. It's not Mad Max who demands the lion's share of attention. You can call him Mad ""Drip feed"" instead.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","Mad Max: Fury Road was among the projects breaks jaws, those that everyone around the corner, we are afraid that Hollywood encroaches too much on the film and that offers us a real flavor without typical blockbuster and it's been almost fifteen years they are trying to make this film and finally gets a big slap in the mouth with this masterpiece!<br/><br/>This film is an action for two hours without a break, before we spring this fully filled movie with a peach of hell, it's all we could hope for but better!<br/><br/>George Miller finally returns to the front of the stage, 30 we lost Max, Miller is trying to more family films, Mad Max to pass Babe even when it makes a big difference and I do not see a drive Babe Ford Falcon. But back then, even if it is at the age of special effects green screen Miller back with a big smile by telling us that 80% of films are taken from real hell it is so class it! That's real crazy movie that we open our eyes to blow sumptuous post-apo universe with waterfalls outsized!<br/><br/>Of the first scene we find Max who turns his back on us and already a certain class you feel a kind of charisma through how to filmed and decor as well as posture and bang of the first seconds the film is already laid and Max who we swallowed a lizard with two heads that living dragged its feet. The strength of the characters is that there is no need to present them for an hour, for we see we can only appreciated, throughout the film we will ever feel alongside Max and Furiosa! So much so that at times we find in almost breathless. I like Tom Hardy but I was wondering what it was going to replace Mel Gibson is not easy thing and yet it beautifully in fate, he takes the character for him and imposes it touches there was a Max more tormented than ever plagued by visions that will disorient much as help. But ultimately the most captivating and almost the main character is not Max but Furiosa, wonderfully interpreted by Charlize Theron who offers us his best performance and especially the most badass who would shake the Machete or other Blackmamba. Then to Immortan Joe is the Evil with a capital M, a sort of guru who promises his kamikaze access to Valhalla that treats its women as cows or sexual slaves and who satisfies his people to blow drop water. The prototype of guy we want to burn bright, the quartering of the live skinning etc ...<br/><br/>Everything is like the road in the title: angry, the band sounds great electric guitar shot to overkill signed Junkie XL V8 engines! It smells like gasoline, violence, despair, brutality, everything we love what!<br/><br/>But let's talk about like Junkie XL that level sounds made us enjoy during the whole movie! A soundtrack overkill that had always just implanting the pace it takes up but what we take with it, in fact I am goes to listen to while writing this criticism, history of being in the right trip! This is not a first attempt, it has already made the soundtrack of several films including Divergent or 300: the birth of an empire and Man Of Steel, mostly with a very good side nag as I love. Here the music is almost essentially on wild percussion and heavy electric guitar riffs which we see throughout the film guitarist hung before his slaps in the middle of other jalopy with guitar spitting fire! With all that I become almost looking forward to see what we will do Junkie XL Batman Vs Superman on.<br/><br/>The only gripe we could do to the film is that it has a somewhat simplistic scenario, but by going to see Mad Max is not coming to see a psychological film, we come to see the action and at this level it is only filled! After we can still see in the film some subjects or legal but the film loses it in, we see feminism, human cruelty we see it (the fittest in particular), we see environmental problems , we see a critique of consumer society (Aqua-Cola, emissions, Festin Mc) ... if we want serious subjects are found but it is not the purpose of the film.<br/><br/>The goal is just to treat ourselves and this is exactly what the movie! That being so long since I had not put ten out of ten so clearly I strongly advice this film to everyone, the whole world must see this masterpiece !!!"

","If you haven't seen a Mad Max flick don't be bothered because it doesn't follow what happened before, well, some flashbacks may refer to it but still, it do stands alone this flick. On the other hand it is a typical Mad Max flick so for those who are into post-apocalyptic flicks this is a must see.<br/><br/>Never had any problems with those kind of flicks for me it clocked in over 2 hours and that was way too long. The first part (until they start driving) is okay and enjoyable but after a while the only thing we get to see is driving and driving and collisions and crashes and a predictable ending. I admit, that does make a Mad Max flick but it took to long.<br/><br/>On part of the effects it all worked well, some are done in-camera the others pure CGI because it couldn't be done for real. So if you aren't into post-apocalyptic flicks style Mad Max then don't watch it if you think you will see something new, but for the geeks of Max, watch it.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"

","I've really enjoyed this sequel, prequel, remake or whatever it is.<br/><br/>Set in the same apocalyptic world as the original Mad Max trilogy, this movie provides about two hours of continuously action.<br/><br/>It's also nice that the components of the story are not revealed (e.g. what's that milk used for). You have to figure this out by yourself.<br/><br/>The characters are also cool, the girls are beautiful and Mad Max is developed in just the way he is meant to be. Also, I've never seen Charlize Theron ugly in a movie before. Overall, it's a very good work for George Miller, but the movie needs something more to become a legend like the original movie.<br/><br/>This 8 ratting comes just because I'm expecting something more from this movie (or pack of future movies) than just action, naked girls, desert and so on. I'm hoping that Mad Max: Fury Road it is just the beginning for what will come, a trilogy that will definitely resurrect the original Mad Max, than just make money by reminding people about the series with the same name."
"YoungGunner101","8","1","6","20 May 2015"," What A Lovely Day Indeed
","I have to admit, I'm not a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy. I'm not necessarily saying that they are bad films, (well the third one is) they just never seemed to leave an impact on me. However, this film is so good I went to see it twice. <br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road isn't technically a sequel, nor is it a remake. It's a reboot of a beloved franchise. As you can imagine, although I'm not a fan of the series, my expectations were pretty low. Especially in this day and age where Hollywood keeps churning out more and more terrible PG-13 remakes of well-respected action films from the previous century. However, the reviews for the film were phenomenal so I offered for some of my friends to come see it with me. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised as it far surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>When I first heard that Tom Hardy was going to replace Mel Gibson as the titular hero I was actually quite excited. Tom Hardy is one of my favourite actors of our time and he has demonstrated on more that one occasion that he has a flare for accents. Although I thought someone like Hugh Jackman would be more suited for this role as he is able to perfectly blend humour with seriousness. Also, he's Australian so he wouldn't have to put on an accent like Tom Hardy does. However, after watching this twice, I think Tom Hardy did a good job. There were times where I could hear a hint of Bane and even Christian Bale's Batman in his voice but this film doesn't use much dialogue because George Miller wants to focus more on visual story-telling, which I'm all for. I love 2001: A Space Odyssey after all. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy isn't the only great actor in this film though. Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult both give excellent performances also. Nicholas is able to pull of the Australian accent well and Charlize Theron finally provides us with a female protagonist on par with Ripley and Sarah Connor. Even Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to franchise to play an even more intimidating villain. You could really identify with the heroes and you wanted things to go their way. As for the villains, you wanted them to fail so that hope could prevail. <br/><br/>The best part of the film of course is the action sequences, which there are many I might add. I love slow-paced thrillers but I'm still a guy, a guy who is a sucker for pretty explosions (just not when Michael Bay does it). Every sequence is well thought out and perfectly executed. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time as I was completely in awe of what I was witnessing on screen. It really was as Tom Hardy said, we were getting a glimpse into George Miller's mind. His direction was superb although things got crazy and a little silly at times. Despite this I felt worried for the characters on screen as well as the actors who played them. Most of the effects on the film were practical which I'm pleased to see. I despise how in action films today there is just CGI everywhere so it was refreshing to see an action film successfully utilise practical effects which look much better in my opinion. However, the CGI that was used looked spectacular and was always necessary. <br/><br/>Thankfully, this film has substance as well as style. Some people have said that they don't understand the story but I understand it perfectly. Honestly, it's not hard to decipher. I'm excited for the upcoming sequels where hopefully they will expand upon what was created with this film. I love the social commentary and the environmentalist message that this film had to offer and it really made me think about the corruption that power can bring and the horrible consequences that can come from wasting the earth's natural resources. As far as I'm concerned there was no Matrix level complexity to the plot.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is amazing and you should definitely go and see it. I will say that it is definitely a guy film though. However, if you love fast-paced action, explosions, awesome cars, an action film with a plot and Tom Hardy then this is the film for you. Seriously though, who doesn't like that stuff?"

","Wow! I just got back from the theatre and I have to say that Mad Max: Fury Road is one the most insane, blood gutting, intense, visual pieces of cinema work I've seen in years.<br/><br/>George Miller returns to the Mad Max universe after many decades, and presents us with a modern, fast-paced style of what is likely going to be a new series of Mad Max films. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce. When Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) lead a group of rebels on a daring escape through the Wasteland, she forges an alliance with Max (Tom Hardy)and from there it is a high speed car chase from there.<br/><br/>One of the things that I appreciate from this movie is how most of the stunts are all practical with a small usage of CGI. That paid off well as the action, and stunt work is eye popping, but it is all executed effectively without it making it look like a sloppy mess.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, there is not much of it. You might have trouble understanding on what the story is... and I had difficulty with it too. But this movie isn't designed for hard plot and if you are expecting that then be prepared to be let down.<br/><br/>The action and soundtrack were on point. In terms of acting, it was decent at best. Although the title of the film is ""Mad Max"" it felt like more of Charlize Theron film as Tom Hardy barely got enough screen time as Max. Moving on, Tom Hardy's performance was average but this can be due to a lack of proper screen time. As well, the constant flashbacks were distracting as it was never really explained why or what happened on that day.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film you don't want to miss. Don't let negative reviews on here prevent you from seeing it. At the end of the day, you are the judge of the film. After all, film is subjective in taste."

","""Mad Max: Fury Road"", is the 4th film in the Mad Max Series, from Director George Miller, and the first to be released in 30 years. It takes part in a post-apocalyptic future,, where humanity's survivors are battling for life-saving and potential life resources such as gasoline and water. The movie stars Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson in the title role in the previous movies as ""Mad Max"" and Charlize Theron as ""Imperator Furiosa"". I have heard that this film takes part in between the 2nd Film –""Mad Max: The Road Warrior"", and the 3rd Film – ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"". Prior to this, I had only seen the first film - ""Mad Max"", which I admit, I did not like, partially because there was practically no explanation that it was an post-apocalyptic setting, which I believe was explained in the next movie. Long story short, the action sequences – all in the form of action taking part in or around automobile chases, is indeed first rate. In terms of the story - I had heard you had not needed to see the others, but it would give you depth. My gut tells me that seeing the 2nd film, would have increased my enjoyment significantly, particularly as the film is not too Dialogue heavy in the about the first half of the film so. With that mind, the action sequences make it a fun thrill ride, and the actors do well with what is given. When I get a chance to see the other movies, I will certainly revisit this one, and it may improve. For now - 3 ¼ Stars out of 4 Stars – 8 ¼ out of 10 Stars."

So now that George Miller has a greater budget, he is able to do more with this film. First of all, there are great action scenes in this film. I've never seen greater action since Die Hard. The sets are good to. The whole set is just a desert, but that's what makes it good(after all the film is set in the apocalypse) The Villain is pretty cool to, he had a lot to do in this film. By the way i must warn you that this film is crazy. There are psychotic people everywhere in this film. For example, there's one part in the movie where the camera pans over a guy on a massive truck that is playing a guitar, and when he plays it fire shoots out of it.....enough said. The movie is sorta short on story, but when it is directed in a way that makes it fun and action packed then your going to have a great movie. So i really like Fury Road. It had great action, intense moments, and great direction. This is easily the best film of 2015."

","Not Just Cars and Flames: 'Mad Max Fury Road'<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is one of my favorite films of all time because it explores complex emotions in a simple setting. This film can be watched over and over again because it is so exciting, fast-paced, and emotional. I admit that the trailer seemed like a live-action Mario Kart, but when I first saw the film I was in shock and awe.<br/><br/>An action-filled wasteland that is constantly moving, the world of Max is chillingly similar to our own. Glory is given to machinery and power, and the flat desert acts as an expansive stage to display all the action. This film was a wild ride from start to finish, filled with exciting climaxes and poignant moments, as well as spectacular action sequences. It's advertised as a chaotic 2-hour car chase, and it is. But, the characters inside the vehicles have strong motivations and literally drive the film forward to an exciting conclusion. This is the main factor that separates the film from other action films. Both the female and male characters have believable strengths and weaknesses, and the female protagonists are given tangible drives that don't revolve around romance, which was refreshing and empowering.<br/><br/>The action sequences have their merit but would not have been successful without the depth of character. A devoted warrior battling over loyalty and glory, a shell of a man determined to find a purpose, and a high-ranking warrior searching for redemption give the story layers and meaning. Though the individual stories of the characters could have been explored more deeply, the nuances they were given allows the audience to invest in their journey.<br/><br/>The technical aspects, the cinematography and quality of the props, namely the entirely real cars and explosions, created a striking look of professionalism and spectacle to make the film even more exciting and raw. The rawness of this film in terms of the costumes, makeup, props, and stark desert landscape set it apart as a world of its own where the audience is transported. The score created the aura of this industrial world of metal and sand with pounding drums and screeching guitars adding to the chaos. Each car chase is fueled emotionally, and the quieter scenes of the film explain where that emotion is coming from. The score creates emotional peaks and valleys from the intense rock music to epic orchestral themes, carrying the audience on a wild ride through the film. The pacing of the film was a bit erratic but was all a part of the chaos of the warring clans of the wasteland. I was out of breath by the end, confused and slightly shocked, but also very satisfied."

","How they managed to make a 2 hour car chase increasingly exciting and entertaining is beyond me. I have never seen a film that balances non-stop action with story as well as this one. Secondly, the lack of CGI is incredible and only adds to the movie. It is a beautiful movie at that, some of the shots are breathtaking, in the middle of chaos. All the action is frenetic but easy to follow, a hard feat to accomplish. The characters are surprisingly endearing even with minimal development, another very hard feat. If you love action then watch this movie, if you're sick of CGI then watch this movie. We all have our own opinions but don't trust the packs of pessimistic trolls on this website, this is a good movie. Have a little fun, see what the hype is about, and form your own opinion"

","I didn't wanted to see this movie in the beginning, but when I saw so many good reviews to it, I decided to check it out. I was blown away by how well done and directed this movie was. Mad Max:FR had so many good visual effects, seeing so many cars exploding and people getting blown in the sky was mind blowing. And it was even more spetacular when I realized those stunts were real. The direction by George Miller was really good, all those sound effects were also great. But I do think this movie is a bit overrated, my reasons why? The villain was not that good, he was only there doing bad stuff. And the lead protagonist, Max, wasn't that interesting. He only said like 100 words and was just there kicking ass mos of the time. On the other Hand, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Nicholas Hoult's characters were really good and developed, specially Nicholas Hoult, I was gladly surprised by him. Overall, this movie has amazing action and direction Final Grade: 7/10"
"qeter","8","1","7","5 March 2016"," Something new in this movie
","Full time action over nearly 2 hours. Usually I get bored after five minutes of action. Because in most movies, action is only for the sake of itself. Maybe, this is the first time that character building has been done through speed action. At least it is that the first time that it worked out. So, what went wrong, not getting an Oscar for best screenplay, best directing or best picture? For what I can say: There is not much talk in that movie, but to me, still too much. Talking injects a kind of civilization, that did not match the behavior of the lunatic tribes. Another problem: The action scenes are so complex and one scene transforming into the next. It must be nearly impossible to manage the overview during directing and editing. And you can see it - sometimes the scenes don't fit correctly on one time arrow. This irritates. Another criticism (which is not fair, because the movie is so great anyway) is the overblown happy end. Way too much collective salvation at the end! All in all: huge effort by George Miller taking all the risks and trying to make an impossible movie. Ah yes, and Mad Max is incredible entertaining. The stakes are high for the next Mad Max. At least for Tom Hardy it should be possible to do better. He is a great actor and made 5! great movies 2015. It would be nice, if Hardy can manage to get more into the character of Max next time."

"utimategamer","10","1","7","28 February 2016"," Best Action Movie of the Decade
","Mad Max: Fury Road is the continuation of the Mad Max franchise that started in 1979. It is directed by George Miller (the director of the original Mad Max films) and stars Tom Hardy as Mad Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa. Now this movie is one of a kind. First off, this movie is ACTION-PACKED and it never lets up. The other Mad Max movies have been known for their action sequences and their craziness but never before has it been so fleshed out. Fury Road has the best action sequences ever put to film. The thing that makes this action so awesome is the fact that George Miller made sure that most of these sequences were practical effects. That means all the stunts and all the explosions that you see are real and that is just awesome. Another that I mentioned how crazy the Mad Max franchise is. All the Mad Max movies (except the first one) are taken place in the apocalypse, where oil and gasoline are precious resources. As you can imagine, people will start going crazy and in Fury Road, it gets really insane. You see some of the weirdest, most over-the-top characters that are just insane. Some people might find it too insane so when you see this movie, you need to know what you're getting into. I also have to give props to the direction of this movie. George Miller took his old franchise, reignited it, and introduced it to a new generation. The performances are also great. Charlize Theron as Furiosa is probably one of the greatest female heroines in film. She embodies her character and she is arguably the main character of this movie. Tom Hardy as Max is also really great in his role. Lastly, I think this movie will stand the test of time because of how re-watchable it is. I've watched 4 times not and it never gets old. If there's anything bad to say about this movie, it would be what other people have said. The movie doesn't have a lot of plot or character development and that has detracted from other people's feelings about this movie. Me personally, I don't think it needs it and that the movie is already Amazon without it. Overall, this is not only the best Mad Max film. Not only is this the best action movie of the decade. This is one of my favorite movies of all time."

","As a fan of the first Mad Max, at first I thought this was going to be too sterile, relying heavily on CGI. But the effects and editing are so good, you barely notice that they are created on a computer.<br/><br/>The action is relentless and the cinematography quite superb, set against some stunning scenery. It's not Shakespeare but it is a classy piece of film making.<br/><br/>It's hard to compare Tom Hardy with a 1980s Mel Gibson and if I have any complaint to make, it's that he tries a little too hard to be Max and ends up being more like Bronson. But Theron is excellent, in a Sigourney Weaver action figure sort of way.<br/><br/>This is true enough to the original to be enjoyable, and it's one of the fastest-paced action thriller rides you'll ever see. The action just keeps on coming, it's relentless and very exciting.<br/><br/>The original Mad Max was quirky and this continues in that trend. Take it for what it is and you just can't fault it."

","This remake of classic B-movie Mad Max (1979)-the movie that made Mel Gibson a star in one day, is George Miller's attempt to re-film the first (and best known) film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979.The result is visually impressive. Absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a post-apocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as post-modern and cyberpunk. The exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score (97%). Tom Hardy (known for Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) has become the next big thing in Hollywood due to this remake. Charlize Theron (an absolutely top actress overall) is simply great in the post-feminist role of Imperator Furlosa. Nevertheless, as one might expect, the fight for gas idea, which was original, innovative and to the point in 1979, has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today. Still, the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time, not for it's non-existent deeper meanings but for it's overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environment.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","If the world ran out of oil, gas, and water. If it transformed into a giant desert where humanity soon devolved into savage killers...who would truly care about furthering the human race? Who would try their best to find a place to live permanently...to rebuild society for the next generation? George Miller(director of the previous 3 Mad Max films) makes an argument that it's the women. It makes sense when you think about it, women get pregnant, men don't. They have a certain maternal instinct that could drive them to make the world better for their children, while the men go crazy(in the case of the film's villains) or drift aimlessly from place to place(Max himself.) This is why Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) feels like the main character. She drives the film forward(figuratively and literally) while Max(Tom Hardy) simply drifts along. The fact that Max is an extra in his own movie isn't bad, and it's not entirely new. As a character, he's not that interesting. He gets to engage in a couple cool moments, but mostly he's just a haunted shell of a man, his mind fixated on the past. In the film, he is captured by the pale, bald-headed forces of Immortan Joe, whose evil empire has found a way to control water supply, bringing thousands of people to his mercy. Max finds an opportunity to escape, when the aforementioned Furiosa, a soldier working for the bad guy, tries to smuggle Joe's concubines out of his captivity, and to a mysterious ""green place"" across the desert where they can be safe. Also along for the ride is Nux(Nicholas Hoult) who gets to have a couple sweet and funny moments along the way. What follows is not just a 2-hour long car chase, but an exercise in visual storytelling. The Mad Max films have always taken inspiration from Chaplin and Buster Keaton according to George Miller. At times, Fury Road feels like a silent movie. Even with the thumping soundtrack, there's almost no talking, and when there is dialogue...it actually isn't exposition. A miracle in itself. The film treats it's chases not as thrill rides, but as art. The thrill comes later. Each chase is like a line of dominoes, getting longer and more complex by the minute, and by the time they all collapse, you're left thinking ""how are they gonna top that?"" What's more remarkable, is that they keep doing so. I'm not going to list action scenes, because that's boring and pointless. See it for yourself. In a culture obsessed with continuity and ""expanded universes"" it's refreshing to see a movie where it just doesn't matter. Miller has said that Mad Max is an anthology, but it really doesn't matter. People arguing whether this is a reboot or a sequel...where in the time line it fits in are missing the point. It doesn't matter. Have I said that enough? Fury Road hearkens back to simpler time when people watched movies and enjoyed them for what they were. Much has been said of Theron's Furiosa. She's feminist propaganda...she's a strong female role model...she's a character made to pander to women. No no no. She's just a character. A strong character driven by maternal instincts and bravery. She's one of the best characters of the year. Not female characters. Not male characters. Just characters. Hardy doesn't really get to do more than grunt and whisper, but he does that pretty well, and his presence already adds enough gravity to the film. It's also visually stunning, with 90% practical effects. I'm going to say that again. 90% PRACTICAL EFFECTS. Overall, Mad Max is a film that demands to be seen. It yanks it's audience with it on a thrill ride that doesn't stop, and leaves your mouth open and your heart beating hours after you leave."

","I was told that this was a reboot of an old franchise, but as I hadn't seen the previous movies this was all new to me. To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be an intelligent piece of science-fiction. To my surprise, that's exactly what it turned out to be, as well as being noisy, violent, fast-paced, brilliantly edited, full of dark humour and, on the whole, well-acted. Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and a barely recognisable Nicholas Hoult are certainly excellent in the leading roles. The production design, costumes and make-up are all superbly realised. The two-hour running time flew by. The ending was perfect. All in all, I enjoyed it a lot."

","If you have a fetish for red dust, rust, heavy metal, V8 engines, monster trucks and motor-cross this is the perfect movie. To get to the point though, it is ALL about the cars. From the original movie Mad Max was one with the Interceptor. The development of the bizarre, Frankenstein vehicles since Mad Max 2 has built up huge audience expectation for what comes next. George Miller doesn't disappoint, and Fury Road shows every possible aspect of these breathtaking vehicles in all their glory.<br/><br/>Fury Road looks like a stunning live action graphic novel. The characters and story line are outrageous and larger than life, and the non-stop chase scenes takes the audience on one long wild ride.<br/><br/>Mad Max (""You know hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane"") continues his journey as the survivor every-man in a harsh, warring wasteland. I'm waiting for Max to gradually morph into Albert Tucker's Antipodean. This time he shares the screen with equal lead, Imperator Furiosa.<br/><br/>Furiousa gives Max the chance to redeem himself by accompanying her and warlord Immortan Joe's escaped wives to the Green Place.<br/><br/>The script is minimal like a graphic novel and entirely specific to this strange desolate world. The only language I didn't like was homophobic. I think in 2015 we are past using homosexuality as an insult. I liked the character development of the female characters and the empowerment of people with a disability or chronic illness.<br/><br/>The real beauty of Fury Road is in the look of it. It reminded me of the attention to detail in the original Star Wars movies with hand made costumes, accessories, cars and props. I hope we will be able to see them in real life in a travelling exhibition.<br/><br/>The music and sound works seamlessly with the story line and builds at the right moments. Like many other great movies, Fury Road uses minimal CGI and rests on great direction, scene set up, cinematography and editing.<br/><br/>I loved all the characters and there is lots to draw on for back stories. Bring on the next one and I can't wait to see where the cars go next!"

Or have a deep subtext without lots of boring exposition? This masterpiece pulls you in, and for two hours it never lets you go, save for a moment here and there that are perfectly timed to let you catch your breath.<br/><br/>As the movie went on, and to my delighted surprise, this turned out to not only be a story about Furiosa, Max, and Joe's wives, but this was also the story of Nux, of transformation. A crazed brainwashed thug who rediscovers his humanity through the kindness of Capable, one of the fugitives he was tasked with hunting down. He makes good, helping them, even being grudgingly befriended by Max, who obtains a boot for him in one of the battles, replacing the one Max 'borrowed' from him earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Nux tells Slit how he wants to die historic on the Fury Road, that he was destined for something great. Ironically he achieves his goal, not as a brainwashed suicide bomber as he originally envisioned, but as a true hero. In laying down his life, he saves his new friends. As a result he also brings freedom to the people of the Citadel.<br/><br/>I imagine that in the new Citadel, they will sing songs and tell tales of the Warboy who defied Immortan Joe...who died historic on the Fury Road...and gave Citadel the hope of a better future...the Warboy Nux, who rides forever in Valhalla, shiny and chrome."

In a post apocalyptic desert wasteland where gasoline & water are gold, the cruel despot & ruler of the unfortunate masses is ""Immortan Joe"". (Played by the same actor as the villain in the original '79 flick). He imprisons women for breeding but also another rare commodity - their breast milk. Enter our heroine Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is a rig driver sent by Joe to acquire a gasoline haul. However she has other intentions, that of finding ""sanctuary"" and with her sudden diversion a frenetic chase begins. And boy what a chase! Max at this stage is just a passenger. An ex cop, he is just used for his blood, transfusions to satisfy Joe's insane warriors. But Furiosa has a secret cargo; 5 of Joe's beautiful wives, all in it for freedom too. When Joe finds this out he is furious and with a huge convoy of monster cars, trucks, rigs & bikes the pursuit is on. Can Max be trusted to help Furiosa with her quest? Anyway, there is very little dialogue, but just enough to get the jist of the plot. The rest is amazing action, filmed on location in the Namibian desert & produced free of green screen technology. There are incredible stunts including a memorable sequence through a deadly sandstorm. It is LOUD: the vibrations & explosions rock the cinema along with an amazing soundtrack compliments of Junkie XL. As a movie fan JG thinks the unsung hero here is the cinematographer.

Tom Hardy is fine and Nicolas Hoult is just crazy (in a good way).

"pendenquejohn","7","1","7","15 September 2015"," Quite an impressive movie to say the least...
","I will start by saying that this was quite an impressive movie to say the least. The opening scene started like a first chord of a Beethoven music sheet – strong, cool and impressive. The spectator knew then somehow that he would be in for a strong ride.<br/><br/>There is no point denying that the scenery is just absolutely stunning -- magnificent -- exceptional. That point must certainly constitute the strongest part of the movie. It compliments extremely well the action scenes. A slick, neutral but also extremely dry and rough environment in which the characters can go about in their own groups or one against another flawlessly.<br/><br/>While it also true that I read that the movie did lack a clear story or that it wasn't strong enough, a fact which is somewhat true, I do think this was personal take of the writers to privilege action more than the intellectual part and I think it did work well. This would have been atrocious to combine such impressive actions scenes with boring dialogs.<br/><br/>The story in itself is doubtlessly quite basic and the whole of it turns somewhat around a pursuit. I did have a hard time picking up on the plot which was quite confusing until some point where you actually get the actual gist of the thing but I do feel however, and in comparison to other movies of the same genre, that it plays positively in the hands of the movie. One of the things that I particularly hate with action movies is the fact that you can read the story before it even starts. It did not feel that way with this proposition.<br/><br/>Focusing on some of the characters, even if some of the character's roles were quite limited in regards to the overall weight they played in the story, certain surprising actors such as Abbey Lee Kershaw delivered. One has to know that she does not initially come from acting but was an ex-model. And for one of her first blockbusters, have to admit that she lived up to the expectations. Her unusual distinctive beauty and cold naturally captivating distance that was her strength in top modeling served her quite well there. She was much more convincing that I thought she would because she was tailor made for this role.<br/><br/>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was not bad either though I thought she could have been a little bit better. It's actually a pity that her role did not last long enough to really have a serious idea about her in this particular movie. <br/><br/>To finish on this particular point, the depth of characters and persona throughout is really just superb. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a large palette of personalities of all kinds. It comes from bizarre repulsive looking people, to normal looking individuals, to beautiful ethereal nymphs all cohabiting in a very hostile environment.<br/><br/>The sustained action scenes raise two aspects. First a positive one. The movie is fast pace and there is no time for bore. The action scenes go from being extremely artistic at times, to jaw dropping [...] with the help of slick well shot scenery to complement them.<br/><br/>I'm not much into action movies to start with but this one I have enjoyed a lot to say the least."
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","7","10 September 2015"," A two-hour adrenaline rush
","Attempting to piece together the chronology of Max Rockatansky's four-movie journey between 1979 and 2015 would be to miss the point of the series altogether. Max Max (1979) was a raw slice of grindhouse that just happened to be financially successful and genuinely brilliant, and has since evolved into something so wildly imaginative and increasingly insane that to try and piece together how many years have elapsed since Mel Gibson's youthful Main Force Patrol officer watch his family murdered and how he has suddenly shrunk and become Tom Hardy would be as deranged as the franchise's latest instalment, Fury Road.<br/><br/>Whether it's a re-boot or a continuation of the story we haven't seen since 1985's Beyond Thunderdome, we are plunged back into the familiar, post-apocalyptic Australian plains (although it was shot in Namibia) inhabited by obscene punks, raging warlords and ragged rebels. Following a nuclear holocaust, fuel and water is scarce, and the residents of the Citadel are ruled over by the ageing Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a hulking monster of a man with a breathing apparatus strapped to his face. Max (Hardy) is captured and is used as a 'blood bag' for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), and when Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's lieutenants, goes AWOL with an armoured truck full of Joe's many wives, Nux and a small army pursue with Max strapped to the front of his vehicle.<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, Fury Road has little in way of a plot. Similar in many ways to Max Max 2, the film is little more than one huge chase with precious few quiet moments in between. Hardy is as reserved a Max as Gibson was, but strangely lacks the charisma that has propelled Hardy to recent superstardom. Yet Max is more in the background, playing second fiddle to the battering ram that is Furiosa. One- armed, shaven-headed and raccoon-eyed, Theron is in equal measures extremely sexy and utterly intimidating, offering glimpses of vulnerability as her trust in Max becomes more cemented. Furiosa's drive is that she wants to get back to her homeland, which is now little more than a distant memory from her childhood, and Max just happens to be along for the ride. But character development is left in the dust of what is ultimately one humongous chase set- piece.<br/><br/>Although he is now 70 and his recent work has consisted of Happy Feet (2006), Happy Feet 2 (2011) and Babe: Pig in the City (1998), director, writer and producer George Miler shows no signs of losing his touch. Fury Road is the most aggressive Max Max yet, complete with acrobats on huge wires who bend into other vehicle's to attack from above, War Boys getting themselves pumped for violence by spraying a powerful drug called Night Fume onto their lips, and an electric guitar player who sprays flame from his instrument and is backed by a hoard of drummers. Everyone involved in creating the stunts should be extremely proud, as what could have been repetitive turns into a two-hour adrenaline rush. It's not the masterpiece that it has been heralded by critics and audiences alike, but it has breathed life back into a genre stuffed with CGI and former wrestlers."
"merlin9877","9","1","7","10 September 2015"," More than an action film done right
","This movie ranks in my best action movies, and I haven't said that in a while... The thing that strikes me the most is the art direction. George Miller and his acolytes have created a very coherent universe that not just looks impressive, but is very believable (in the sense that it all fits together not that it could really happen). You feel the desperation of everyone, you taste the sand from the desert that gets everywhere and you understand the struggles such a dystopian society faces. Secondly, kudos for the fact that almost all the female roles in this action movie have clout! These gals can hold their own and then some. They give very good performances, even the secondary roles which I thought would be very weak. When I saw the ""breeders"", I thought they would be the cliché Barbie dolls of the movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see these girl models can rub elbows with the other stars of the movies and contribute to the creation of the substance of this film. And later, with Furiosa's tribe, these older women had real character! This probably fits all very well because of a great script. A script that could feel a bit clunky on paper but is masterfully brought to life by Miller. As for the two main actors, the restraint that Tom Hardy shows or the boiling temper we sense in Furiosa are outstanding. I guess that since Miller created this universe starting in the late 70's helps. And it shows that this director started out before the CGI era. The stunts are absolutely spectacular.

","An art house film disguised as a summer blockbuster, Mad Max: Fury Road is an action masterpiece and arguably the greatest action film of all time. A simple plot with characters who only speak when needed, Fury Road proves action films can be more than mindless fun.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy leads the film as Max, a lone Road Warrior in a post apocalyptic wasteland who reluctantly gets involved in a chase between a Warlord named Immortan Joe, and a female warrior named Furiosa, after she steals Joe's most prized possessions, his five wives. They are young, healthy women were taken from their homes when they were small and are locked away for the sole purpose of being breeders for Joe. He needs a young heir for when he passes, as his current sons are deformed or dying, themselves.<br/><br/>This film will go down as not only the best of 2015, but the best action film ever made. Thank you, George Miller."
"orionschwert","6","1","7","27 August 2015"," Understandable enthusiasm of action fans
","Yep, this is one action movie ! Somewhat from the 1st to the last minute it goes bang, bong and krapeng ! And it's well done action even if a little repetitive after a while. So, if 100% action and adrenalin, in a dark&dusty design is your kind of flick, then it is a 10 out of 10. Therefore it is understandable that it stays in the moment at 8,3 because many just seek for nothing else. If you expect a bit more, like deeper going characters, dialogs, acting, story etc, you will be disappointed because there is absolutely none of that. Sure, action movies are not made for that in the first line but I saw good stuff combining story and action. The ""non"" story here bases itself, as so often, on the fact that people need to go/drive from point A to point B and making here a lot of noisy and crazy stuff when doing it. But hey, this picture goes even a step further....they go as well the same way back !! Wow. That is genius. I did not expected any real relation to the 1st and one and only Mad Max (even if the unrecognisable Keays-Byrne was one) but I did hope to get more from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Damn, they can act, certainly Tom Hardy can..... But that's business and Tom Hardy knows it but I do hope for him that he is not ruining his career. Younger audience will be impressed by the action, score, design etc, but anybody who likes cinema for people acting around a story...they will go home empty in there heads. And one last thing before I close, you need to see this on very big screen or even the action fans will be bored."
"ahmadshah2370","7","1","7","17 August 2015"," Great action movie without any story
","If you love action movies, it will definitely be a great watch for you. Movie starts, and within few minutes, the movie gets too much tense. All those cars, oil-trucks, motorcycles create a great havoc. And it was enjoyable throughout. But, sometimes, mindless action sequences get tedious. After watching the movie, I felt that characters were not much developed. I wish I could know more about the protagonists and antagonists. And the fight was too much against the odd which I didn't like that much. In Batman Begins or X-men First Class, we can see initial development of the story, which seemed lacking in this movie. But anyway, action sequences were great to watch, and if you don't use your brain too much, you would enjoy without any problem. I wished a better story, few memorable dialogue, and some kind of believability in the script. Casting seemed good overall. Giving rating ""7"" for great action sequences."
"fionnanthomas","8","1","7","9 August 2015"," Good movie but needs to be longer
","I liked the idea of this movie. Tom Hardy is excellent as Max and I hope he is in the next Mad Max movie. But I feel the movie could and should of been longer. It was the same for every other mad max movie too. Your at the edge of your seat the whole way through and suddenly it is over. The action is brilliant especially for the last 20 minutes but the ending was not great. I did not quite understand the way they left that city and then came back at the end. I also feel it should not be R rated. There was only one brief bloody scene at the end. Having said that it is quite a violent scene but I think it deserved a pg-13 rating. I am looking forward to the next Mad Max movie and I hope Tom Hardy will star in it."
"markgorman","9","1","7","1 June 2015"," Probably the greatest movie ever to deal with the transport of breast milk to and fro across a desert.
","We'll put to one side the fact that half way through the screening I was at in Newcastle a girl collapsed in the stairway which meant that I spent ten minutes or so helping her out. (She was fine in the end). But it certainly added a degree of drama to a movie that is anything but short of that.<br/><br/>It's 30 years since George Miller last directed a Mad Max movie and in the interim he's treated us to rather more lightweight offerings such as Babe and Happy Feet.<br/><br/>But clearly it's Mad Max that has become his trade mark and this (the fourth instalment, with a fifth on the way) is the best of the bunch in every respect other than the fact that Mel Gibson makes a better Max than Tom Hardy although, truth be told, this is as much, if not more, Charlize Theron's movie as Tom Hardy's. (She manages to look spectacularly beautiful throughout despite having her face covered in axle grease.)<br/><br/>It's quite remarkable that a 70 year old man could imagine and then actually produce and direct a movie of this scale, scope and energy. In fact, it's mind boggling.<br/><br/>And mind boggling is a very good word to describe the experience that is Mad Max: Fury Road. (I saw it in 3D but I don't think that added a lot to be honest).<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing intellectual to discuss about a movie that transports a bevy of beautiful ""breeders"" across the desert and back again on board a tanker full of breast milk.<br/><br/>The dialogue, when you can hear it, is pretty vacuous. The bevy of beauties are pretty vacuous but who cares, because it's such a splendid romp and a visual treat from get go to end credits.<br/><br/>Time and again one's jaw drops as the sheer audaciousness of the endless vehicle chases as they unfold. Like most goody/baddie movies it is remarkable how inept the baddies are at killing the goodies who, by contrast, seem to kill with gay abandon, barely a shot or a strike not hitting its mark.<br/><br/>But if you can park your critical faculties at the door, sit back and just steep yourself in two hours of OTT nonsense then you will be treated to pure pleasure for almost every frame.<br/><br/>Cracking."
"c-kelsall","8","1","7","26 May 2015"," Demented and fabulous
","I like my action films, especially if they're done with style and originality. It might surprise you, therefore, to hear that I've never seen the original Mad Max films. Maybe it was Mel Gibson that put me off (I never thought he was a good actor, although I did really enjoy How I Spent My Summer Vacation). Anyway, I feel it gives me the objectivity to properly address the merits of Mad Max: Fury Road. It feels like so much more than the sum of it's parts - it's certainly not Tom Hardy's best work to date, although he makes a sufficiently game Max, so the way is open for Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult to steal the show. Early on I found myself distracted by questions of how most people survive in this dystopian future, but the whole thing steamrollers its way across the screen with such demented fun that I soon forgot all about that. If you don't like explosions and lots of shouting, this might not be the film for you. Having said that, the mayhem is punctuated by moments of calm to make sense of the narrative, and when all hell is breaking loose (which is most of the time), it puts Michael Bay to shame. Shame on you, Michael Bay, why can't you make films as good as this? The budgets are certainly big enough.... Where was I? Oh yes, sum of its parts. Plot. Really, what plot? If it's plot your after, don't come looking for it here. I haven't seen a film with such a paper-thin one since, well, er...John Wick? Okay, not that long ago. But my point is still valid. Which is that there isn't much of a plot. But who cares when it's so damn cool? Also, see it in 3D. No really! I usually hate 3D versions of films, but this is worth it just for one scene late on in the film (relax, no spoilers). I had a great time watching this at the cinema. What a day. WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!"

","I can't say this was an excellent movie, but it does make for a breath of fresh air in a world of technology filled thrillers and sci-fi rehashes. Going in to this, I expected very little and was very surprised when I walked out of the theater. The characters are all strong. I would have liked a little more 'Max' in the film, but it gave enough of an introduction and a back story that when Max became a part of the mainstream cast he was introduced well. Charlize Theron's character of Furiosa was strong, determined, but had just enough feminine qualities to play a good strong female lead without coming off as a damsel in distress. I like that in a movie anymore.<br/><br/>There will be a lack of heavy dialogue for those who look to have the movie explained for them. The low dialogue and heavy action and chase sequences let the viewer draw their own conclusions without overtly explaining everything. Overall, I enjoyed the ability to think my way through the film rather than have my hand held.<br/><br/>The old woman tribe I would have liked to have seen more of in terms of action, but they were presented well and had strong roles for their minimal screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a well directed film. The stunts are amazing. There were a few parts that were probably edited down for continuity, but the film kept a good pace with subtle lulls in the action to allow the audience to catch their breath. A solid 8/10. I can only hope the coming sequels are just as well paced."
"johnnymacbest","9","1","7","24 May 2015"," The best Mad Max film I've ever seen.
","I'll keep this straight and to the point. For YEARS I've waited for a film that lives up to the originals. Although Beyond Thunderdome was decent in it's own right, the film lost it's dark and gritty edge due to it's PG-13; a bane on dark, gritty post-apocalyptic films. Well, fear not for I am happy to report that Fury Road, is every bit as dark and gritty as it's predecessors. Tom Hardy does another incredible job as the world weary Max, a man with nothing to lose wandering the arid, desolate Australian wasteland, with little pockets of civilization here and there. Well, the term ""civilization"" is aptly used loosely here because most of them are anything but ""civilized"" as these roving band of savages try to eek out a bleak existence by any means necessary and this is the perfect backdrop for the story. With little twists and turns here and there, along with the impressive visuals and riveting action, Fury Road is a crystal clear reminder that CGI and MTV style action does not and should not take the place of a well-written story. Hopefully, a sequel is made. I'm that pumped for it. Best Mad Max film I've ever seen in years. Mad Max is back and he's better than ever."

","Mad Max Fury Road is like The Road Warrior on drugs. It simultaneously kept an older fan like myself and new fans very happy. It hasn't got a lot going for it in terms of plot, the whole movie is essentially one massive car chase, but I forgave that for what were some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron nailed the lead roles, and it was fun to see Hugh Keays-Byrne (ToeCutter, and now Immortan Joe) return to the series. After the disappointment of the second half of Beyond Thunderdome, I'm glad to see Max return to form, and I'm very excited to see the sequels.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it as a fan of the old Trilogy, but the friends I brought with me who hadn't heard of Mad Max before also loved it, and have watched the originals since. I must say, it's also refreshing to see a female lead who doesn't need to bone someone or get kidnapped<br/><br/>Basically, if you're a Mad Max fan go see it, and if you're not a Mad Max fan go see it"

","Movie is best viewed in a theater in 3D.. Stunts and vehicle design were spectacular. Main leads showed vagueness in their acting, maybe the concept did not go well understood by them. Mad Max was supposed to be a tough guy with no emotions and Terminator style attitude, but there was somewhat confusion in their roles. But of course, that was not what anyone went for.. It was for the Skull vehicles, Chase sequences and aerobic stunts. Never thought desert would prove to be an ideal action stunt scenario, but this movie showcases desert and desert is the topping for this movie.. because had it been anywhere else it would not have suited the movie. I think the Grandmas acted better than leads, and gave a better fight to the bad boys. Do not miss this movie, not for the vehicles, desert and stunts.."

","Nominated for 10 Oscars, George Miller's post-apocalyptic chase movie Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those rare summer blockbusters that lives up to the hype. That may be because the movie literally has its own hype man.<br/><br/>The main characters, Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), bolt across the wasteland of their dying world with the captured brides of ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe. Furiosa believes that returning to her homeland can provide salvation, and the drifter Max has been caught up in the ride. Immortan Joe, and his army of insane followers, will stop at nothing to retrieve his war brides.<br/><br/>Amid the literal beat of war drums secured to tricked out dune buggies, the action catapults forward at an unyielding pace. The preposterous villains chase Furiosa and her posse through the desert, atop motorcycles and monster trucks, shooting guns, spikes, fireballs and themselves at our protagonists in an effort to slow them down. These dim- witted steampunk zombies are on a kamikaze mission to Valhalla, and die they do, each one in a more hilarious manner than the last.<br/><br/>Are we surprised when the villains fail? I guess I forgot to care with all of the endorphins firing in my brain. This movie was designed solely to entertain you. It is an absurd production that is pure spectacle. So get some popcorn, sit back and WITNESS!"

The craziest, most engaging spectacle you're likely to lay see for quite some time. They are going to have hard time out doing this Mad Max! Acrobatic ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is thrilling and treats the viewer to the most astonishing action packed film yet.

"cherold","9","1","8","15 May 2016"," Best movie in the series
","Back in 1979, George Miller made his first feature film, a gritty little action picture, Mad Max, that was as mean-spirited as it was exciting. The movie was a hit, and was followed by an apocalyptic sequel called Road Warrior, which was also a hit but which underwhelmed me, and Beyond Thunderdome, which I didn't like any better. <br/><br/>And the game Mad Max: Fury Road, which beautifully combines the grit and excitement of the first movie with the big budget action that followed.<br/><br/>Max is broken down, haunted by the people he failed to save, concerned with nothing but survival. <br/><br/>But this isn't really his story. In a surprise move, Max become an unwilling part of another hero's story. Her name is Imperator Furiosa, and she is as tough and determined and heroic as Max ever was.<br/><br/>The movie's feminist vibe, with tough, gun-shooting chicks versus an army of bald, macho religious zealots consumed with war and honor, drove some ""men's rights"" people crazy, but it shouldn't. First off, Max is still a tough guy doing a lot of cool stuff, and second, the movie is about 5% feminism to 95% of the most intense, heart-thumping action full of explosions and destruction. <br/><br/>That 5% though, is what keeps the movie from being a hollow exercise in special effects like The Avengers. For all the action, this is a film with a vision, and a film about actions, consequences, bravery, redemption, hope, and all that good stuff.<br/><br/>I have a few issues with the plot. The final plan relies on one of many warring city states doing something basically suicidal, and the final moment is a standard hero cliché that feels false and unconvincing in the context of the movie. But overall, this is everything an action movie should be."
"HyBarry","7","1","8","10 May 2016"," Better than expected. Oscars are not all about art films and complex dramas
","Before talking about Fury Road, I must say a few words about its roots, the Mad Max franchise.<br/><br/>The original Mad Max was one of those movies from back in the days when B movies are like that - sometimes one design element or the poster created a lot of expectations. I personally think Mad Max is one of them. The world setting and the character design is so intriguing that it spawned many works inspired by Mad Max. This, in a way, creates Mad Max shadow larger than Mad Max itself. Perhaps people who are exposed to a long list of pop culture things that are influenced by Mad Max and don't even know it. (This list is readily available on Wikipedia and sites alike).<br/><br/>So the point is? Mad Max is significant as in pop culture, but judging the films based on its influence many be a bit too much. It was what it was - a B movie to begin with.<br/><br/>I didn't see Fury Road when it was released in the theaters. I blame that on the promos and the character designs. It felt like a cheesy reboot without Mel Gibson (although I am not a Gibson fan, not interested in him since Braveheart). Glanced at the poster and I didn't even noticed the female protagonist is Charlize. Had I known it was her, my interest level would be higher.<br/><br/>Then came the DVD release, and I watched it because of the Oscar buzz (as a surprise). This movie is absolutely stunning. Other than that one shot of a CG car flipped over, which looked fake, it's an amazing execution of cinematography. A Mad Max movie should deliver a out of the world experience and amazing car chases and fights. In that regard, the movie delivers just that. Would it be a better movie if there is tighter story, and twists and turns every 15 mins? Of course it would! However, I watched this movie very well knowing it is Mad Max.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 because it is an enjoyable watch. I love the car designs in this movie. There is not really parts of the movie that fells boring or too long. An enjoyable watch. The Oscar definitely helped this movie to get audiences. The movie is good ride and not winning the best picture is expected. At least it was never nominated for best screen writing. Otherwise I would really have a problem with the academy."

","Mad Max Fury Road? A captivating movie, set in post apocalyptic Australia, a world bathed in fire and blood, and if you are trying to disappear from a long and strenuous day at work, or just disappear, then surely you must see this: teeming with explosions, gorgeous Victoria's Secret models, stunning cinematic shots and metal music, it is a magnificent film that will definitely guarantee adrenaline coursing throughout your veins. There are tragic moments, ones where characters can't fix what is broken, and are nearly driven insane; and for the lovers of pyrotechnics, the special effects, though neither hyper realistic nor far from reality, which, when you consider a budgeted film, is quite fantastic. Nearly everything in Mad Max Fury Road is strange, however, and before watching it you must see three things: Mad Max, Mad Max 2, Beyond Thunderdome—you will be gripping your seat with anticipation. This advice is very reconcilable, for it is spectacular, the amount of converts to the series, after watching all four films. Because the film grips you, in an unequivocally transcending bond; the time passes by less noticeably than the froth of a cappuccino amidst one's lips; this I hope, is the way that time passes by in a Bahamian paradise, without any desire to return to reality; for that matter, these two escapes, sitting on a Bahamian beach and watching Mad Max, have another striking parallel: serendipity. The average viewer, for instance, watches a prolonged car chase, while being serenaded by brilliant and cunning dialogue—no matter what, they will become enthralled in George Miller's world; and viewers devoured by their own emotions, will love this film."
"lloydmorgan111222","8","1","8","28 February 2016"," A Visually Captivating Roller-coaster
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a very entertaining action movie that has a lot of style to make up for its lack of substance.<br/><br/>This is mainly due to its visuals and action. The film is one of the most visually captivating I have seen in a while. A combination of great cinematography, fast pace editing and creative uses of colour kept my eyes fixed to the screen. For example, I liked how George Miller tried to sneak monochrome into this action blockbuster with the black and white bursts during lightning strikes and the blue-tinted monochrome during the nighttime scenes.<br/><br/>The first car chase in particular was extremely engaging. It is edited at such a fast pace that it accentuates the calmness of the moment after it. The fast paced action is accompanied by Junkie XL's score, which sets the mood and makes the film feel ""epic.""<br/><br/>I also liked that, despite this being given $150 million, Miller was still able to create a unique film. On top of the costumes and vehicles, idiosyncratic details like the morbidly obese man with the weird foot, the blindfolded guitarist and a scene involving a doctor (saying anything more about it would reveal an important plot point) help make this film feel like a creation instead of a product.<br/><br/>Although I like this film a lot, what's stopping me from loving it are the characters. They aren't as much of a problem for me as they were in 'Carol' or 'The Revenant' since those films were more character-driven while this film is more focused on action. However, the action does need to stop for the story and the moments in which the film takes a break would be more enjoyable if the characters were more fleshed out. Plus, the chase scenes would have been emotional and intense instead of just visually captivating. <br/><br/>The only other problems I have are that the acting could have been better and some of the dialogue felt dubbed. These are quite small in comparison to how impressive the visuals are and how entertaining the film is as a whole. Even if you are not a big action fan, you should see this film."
"LukasII","8","1","8","1 October 2015"," Mad Max is pretty good!
","With Mad Max the movie was amazing and the characters were great and fleshed-out for not having a lot of time to create a big story arc as it is an action-based movie. There were no issues with any of the performances from what I saw and I was fully invested in the characters the whole way through because none of them seemed ""invincible"" which is an issue with lots of western-made action movies. There were lots of times where the combat footage was sped-up to give the illusion of fast fighting but I think it lends itself to the style and didn't take me out of it. The pacing was great and they were able to fit in subtle nuances as to why Max is a complete lunatic without making the flashbacks and backstory cheesy. Overall a really good movie for what it was aiming for and I give it a 8/10"
"Dennue","9","1","8","30 September 2015"," A Masterfully Executed Achievement
","I love Road Warrior and I would say it is still my favorite Mad Max movie, despite the climactic action sequence being a little boring to me, it has a wonderful tone to it.<br/><br/>So, I was incredibly excited to see George Miller returning for Fury Road. I showed the trailer to all of my friends, expecting a wild beast of a movie. When the reviews came out, I was cautiously optimistic, but didn't want to build it up too much in my head or else I'd be disappointed.<br/><br/>Then I saw it.<br/><br/>After the opening sequence that leads up to the title flashing on the screen, there was a massive release of tension from the theater's audience. I even heard someone say, ""jeez!"" Everyone was clearly sucked in, and this was only the beginning.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie I felt like I had seen something that I'd never seen before, and something that I don't expect to see again any time soon. George Miller took the ambitious idea of a 2 hour car chase and made it work. It was wonderful. A movie that is driven by action rather than dialogue. <br/><br/>So 5 more viewings later, I feel like I can say what makes this movie so great. Obviously, the art direction and cinematography are great, and the way the story makes you put the pieces together on your own makes the experience more rewarding and engaging, but what really makes it such a tight package is the fantastic editing. Watching this movie is like watching a Stan Brakhage movie, or a really great music video that you can put on over and over again. It's because it is such a joy to watch. The editing is so tight that it just FEELS good. And it was all edited by George Miller's wife Margaret Sixel, who had never edited an action movie before. I can't wait for the video essays breaking down and analyzing the construction and piecing together of shots.<br/><br/>The only complaints I have about this movie: We don't get a great understanding of Max's personality. Most of the time he seems like a wild dog but other times it feels like there is still wisdom rattling around in that head of his. Maybe that's the point though.<br/><br/>I'm not crazy about the score, and there are a couple moments where it actually feels a bit intrusive.<br/><br/>There are a few moments during loud action scenes where the dialogue doesn't properly sync with the mouths of the actors. ""First they take my blood, now it's my car!"" for example.<br/><br/>Even though there is such limited dialogue, some of it still feels unnecessary. The line, ""that's our fuel!"" delivered by a rock rider chasing the tanker almost feels like it was thrown in because a test audience was confused about why the riders were pursuing the vehicle.<br/><br/>The line, ""it's the bullet farmer! They're coming from the bullet farm!"" Yeah, no duh Furiosa.<br/><br/>These are minor nitpicks though, overall it's a great movie and I recommend it to anyone with an appreciation of action cinema, experimental cinema, silent films, or anyone with experience in film production. If you are someone who believes movies are only meant for telling stories, then you may need to expand your understanding of cinema before you'll really appreciate this."
"setolovesmoney321-513-878476","10","1","8","24 September 2015"," The People Who Are Complaing Have No Idea What They Are Talking About
","I can't believe the number of people who have the audacity to be so inattentive and ignorant when complaining about this movie. It's inexcusable, and it's turning a lot of people off from this masterpiece, so I'm going to deconstruct all of their incorrect arguments for those who haven't seen: ""There's no story and dialog/terrible story."" Sure, there's very little dialog and exposition, but that does not mean there is no story. Mad Max: Fury Road excels in visual storytelling, a unique and interesting form of storytelling which very few big budget Hollywood titles use. If you think there is no story, you simply aren't paying attention to the movie. While the overall story is fairly basic and predictable, the amount of depth put into the situations and the way they are woven together, as well as small details throughout the movie and references to Miller's other work, is so masterfully done that it overshadows all of this. Besides, a movie does not NEED to be complex to be good. I've seen the movie 3 times now and each time I notice a new detail I had never noticed before. ""It's all just one long action segment/car chase."" ... And? Isn't that what you pay for when you go to an action film? Isn't that why the name of the genre is ""ACTION""? Take a look at the latest Fantastic Four, it did the exact opposite of Mad Max in terms of plot, backstory, narrative and build-up vs. pure, raw, exciting, intense action, and look at the difference in response between them. It's also masterfully directed, using a tracking technique where the action is always being followed precisely between shots. This was covered in the Mad Max Film Theory Video if you're interested in this technique, as it really makes the film much better than all the shitty action segments Michael Bay puts out. ""It's feminist propaganda."" This is false. The want to be free from oppression and sexual slavery from a brutal, oppressive dictator, as well as the idea of women being diverse, in terms of beauty, skills and character, and capable of being on the same level as men, is not exclusive to feminism.

Alright, rant over. Seriously, this movie is one of the best action movies of all time. There's a reason it's being praised by everyone who has any sort of sense of what makes a movie good. it's incredibly entertaining and brilliant, unique yet familiar, and you need to watch it considering those points above."

","I was really really young when the first movie of Mad Max came out and it was kind of weird. I liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me, so it was a bittersweet feeling back then. <br/><br/>Watching this one, I kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it! It was both nostalgic but also intense for me, and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling I had imprinted in my mind! <br/><br/>The acting was OK, and I am not sure if it really matters. The movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off I think. I was amazed by the costumes, the make up, the vehicles, everything! The music of the movie was so good! <br/><br/>I liked the ""bad guys"" as they seemed and were really really bad and I enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie! The fiction part was there, but it's something you expect in such movies.<br/><br/>I was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10, but I decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre. If I could, I would give an 8.5 to it!"

","I'm not usually one who goes for action movies but this is truly amazing. It is essentially a 2 hour car (tractor trailer?) chase through a post apocalyptic wasteland but there is so much more to it than just that. I've watched it 3 times since last week and it just keeps getting better. The world is detailed and immersive. The characters are terse but complex. And the action is like nothing I've ever seen (with very little CGI).This one will set the bar for action movies to come. It will keep you entertained.... no enthralled all the way through and wanting more when it's over. Bravo George Miller, Mad Max is back with a vengeance!"
"Kenny-f-bieber","10","1","8","13 September 2015"," Beauty in the madness
","Reboots are everywhere you look these days in current cinema. More often than not they're cheap attempts at cashing in on something once great. However when one witnesses Fury Road one realizes how it can be used as a fuller realization of a true artistic vision. Taking place in- between the 1st two films of the franchise Fury Road's plot is fairly simplistic. Our main hero is captured , comes to the aid of a rag-tag band of female survivors and must out-run a crazed warlord and his disciples. The execution though is purely transcendent. <br/><br/>For starters every shot , frame and stunt is crafted with enormous imagination and inventiveness. This film easily contains some of the greatest stunt-work and set pieces ever committed to celluloid. The display of vision and sheer personality is overabundant and the pacing is heart-stopping with rests perfectly utilized. However between the spectacle and chaos Miller's film is richly emotional and dramatic. In our two leads Hardy and Theron create two broken individuals searching for salvation in a savage world. Theron in particular truly embodies Furiousa's strength , bravery and relentless drive perfectly. As Mad Max himself Hardy conveys a subtle yet effective mix of gravitas and palpable torment.<br/><br/>In terms of a cinematic experience Fury Road demonstrates the pinnacle of action film- making. It's grand , explosive , mind-blowing but in many ways deeply personal and truly awe- inspiring. Whether you're a fan of the franchise or of cinema in general this is one ride well worth taking."

","a great film, and a worth film in the franchise. in a summer that also brought us another terminator film, which effectively killed the franchise (or at least hope for a good film in the franchise) we have Mad Max which re-vitalizes the franchise with a GOOD film that stands on its own and not manipulates the audience with their nostalgia for the old films. I do miss Mel Gibson, and would rather have had him in the film to help with the continuity. I'm also playing the video game which is a excellent companion to the film. As you really feel like your part of the universe. The film deserves all the credit it's given, it's a instant classic and worthy of the hype. Here's to waiting a little less time for a proper sequel."
"nepeta","7","1","8","6 June 2015"," Finally a commercial film without lots of sexism
","I liked Mad Max, not because of all the adrenaline and special effects and the oversimplified plot typical of action movies, but it's one of the very few commercial films I saw lately that didn't spoil my enjoyment because of abuse of sexist traits. In this film a woman is an active and strong character and she doesn't wear high heels, make up and sexy clothes, she's even disabled and had her head almost shaved. The young women in the film that we can say that look more like what is considered pretty nowadays were also not full of make up and uncomfortable clothes, they were just young and fresh and they also helped a lot to solve problems in the film. And the hero of the film wasn't only one super strong man, it was the team work of different people with different genders and skills that could achieve a goal. There's no disgusting age gap between the characters that had a crush. Tom Hardy is even 2 years younger than Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron is turning 40, the age that many actresses are considered rubbish. And there was a group of older female bikes that were good warriors. And this film gave an important message that people should unite despite their differences and fight the real common oppressors."

","Mad Max Fury Road is the fourth of the Mad Max franchise and it had been 30 years after the last Mad Max movie and that was Beyond Thuderdome, which was not the greatest closing chapter for the original trilogy (although if you want to find a movie to become your guilty pleasure is a great choice). When I saw it ,it blew me away with its effects, which were for the 90% of the time real and not CGI, the combat on the cars : Gladiator meets Fast and the Furious ,only it is better than any Fast and the Furious. Also the characters are hardcore madmen or women, who fit perfectly in a environment like that. My favorite is Furiose ,which is a Amazon through and through, well done Charlize Theron, you are awesome. The story is ,to tell the truth, very simplistic though that to the flick advantage in order to give space for the action to be as epic as possible, and it paid of big time. In truth George Muller create the best action movie of the decade and we are only half way through! To add to that dispute its adrenaline and gasoline fueled madness, this movie ,which maybe be the most macho movie of the 2015 has an environmentalist and feminist message to give. George Muller how did you and your team did that?! In the end I had a blast seen it and I recommended to you with closed eyes."

","This new installment of Mad Max is filled with explosive action sequences. This is one of the better action movies there has been in recent years. There was very little down time where almost nothing was happening.<br/><br/>Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy, is just a certified lunatic who is off to seek redemption. His destructive behavior introduces him to captivity by the warlord Immortan Joe, played by Hugh Keays- Byme. Immortan Joe is depriving what is left of civilization from water and resources in order for him to maintain control and power. But a daring Imperator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, dares to defy Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Furiosa's betrayal to Immortan Joe leads to a deadly high speed chase in the depth of the desert. With the help of Max, they make their way through and engage in countless fights and warfare against the warlord's henchmen.<br/><br/>The vehicles used in this movie were absolutely ridiculously awesome. There were cars that were mounted onto tanks, cars structured like a porcupine, and cars that shoot bursts of fire. It just added to the already action packed sequences in the movie."
"amber-ryder","6","1","9","26 April 2016"," Strong female character
","Having a female lead character in Mad Max Fury Road was excellent in the step forward of the portrayal of strong female characters in modern day films. The other female characters in the film were stereotypically passive, to the extreme where they were seen as objects being stolen, this regrettably pulls the film away from positive feminist side. But on the other hand, Furiosa's strong personality balances this out and makes the film an empowerment to female representation in films. She is strong physically and mentally, being a brave powerful woman. A con of the film will be that the name of the film is 'Mad Max', named after the secondary male character, it seems odd that the film would not contain Furiosa's name being the lead character. But alas, having Furiosa as the lead character is a step forward for female representations."

Not too many words were spoken in the movie. I would have loved to see more conversations between take place the villains just for the sake of revealing the way they think and to give us more insights about them.

","So I saw this movie on a whim because it was playing at a small theater in a 1 screen moviehouse in a small town and boy was I glad I did. I went in not knowing what to expect or really anything about the Mad Max franchise or it's back story. Needless to say, but it didn't matter... The entire movie was a non-stop ride of adrenaline. I've seen plenty of movies in the genre that I liked, Doomsday, 28 Days Later, Children of Men, 12 Monkeys. This one tops them all with 12 Monkeys as a close second but is really in a different category since I group Post-Apocalyptic thrillers and action movies separately.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I started to try to find out if the others in the series would be worth catching up on, but I don't want to be let down at this point. The visual genius, gripping action, and intense audio would be hard to beat with movies released in the late 70's/early 80's. I may dive down further into the franchise, but at this point, I'm just anxiously waiting for the follow-up to Fury Road."

","This movie is one of the best action flicks of the summer, heck even the whole year. This movie is filled with interesting characters, and awesome set pieces. It is set in post apocalyptic Australia, and the atmosphere immerses you into the movie. The plot is pretty basic, but it's all about the action. Most of this movie is dedicated to awesome guitar solos, crazy driving, insane people, huge dust storms, and awesome explosions. The acting was great, and Tom Hardy reprises his role of Max very well, (even though he says very little), and Charlize Theron reprises her role as Furiosa excellently as well. This movie should be seen in IMAX, or in 3D, as the CGI is some of the best I've ever seen. I was pleasantly surprised by such a great movie, and can see how this series has influenced the post apocalyptic genre ever since its debut decades ago. Overall, this movie is amazing, and is definitely worth your money and time."
"sweeeetmikey","10","1","9","15 July 2015"," Mad Max Fury Road has raised the bar to a whole new level for action movies in my eyes
","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD review by Mike Smith <br/><br/>In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order.<br/><br/>25 years after the last Mad Max film ""Beyond Thunderdome"" we hit Fury Road. This film isn't really a remake, it feels like a continuation of the Mad Max mythology.<br/><br/>From start to finish this movie grabs you with non stop heart pounding action and madness. One thing that sets this film apart from most films this year is that over 80% of this film is practical effects. In the heavy C.G. movie industry that we live in, it's a breath of fresh air to see a big budget film with car crashes and flames.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing; Tom Hardy can do no wrong! He plays Max just like Mel Gibson did but better. He rarely talks but this facial expressions and intensity keeps you wanting more. Charlize Theron plays a strong character and she steals the show. Theron and Hardy work amazingly together. Nicholas Hoult is always a good choice; he does this gradual shift from psycho that you kind of want to see get killed off, to a sweet broken hearted man who is falling in love. Sure lots of people can pull it off but some actors can't. Nicholas Hoult pulled it off and was a great choice for the film. Now to the main villain, a spooky, creepy, evil, dictator overlord, what a hell of a blend. In a movie called Mad Max you would expect to see more of the hero but a character like Immortan Joe made me want to see more of the villain. This roll was made for Hugh Keays-Byrne and he ran with it. This whole cast worked amazingly together the chemistry was dead on.<br/><br/>The cinematography was spectacular; the car crashes, explosion and practical effects aside, the desert landscapes were awesome and the blue cold nights were stunning. The bit of C.G. we did see was really well done but the colours in the film were beautiful.<br/><br/>In the Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome there was a lot of crazy cars, characters, and sets. Well if that was crazy then this is straight up insane! everything is unique and beautiful in a post apocalyptic way. This was a treat for my eye.<br/><br/>There are some nods to the first three films (I'm not going to spoil anything). One thing that worried me going into this film was will I keep thinking of the other films, NOPE. I didn't miss Mel Gibson at all and let's be fair, if it works for 007 it can work for Mad Max. There are sequels planned but I hope they are released 2-3 years between each other.<br/><br/>I feel like Mad Max Fury Road has raised the bar to a whole new level for action movies in my eyes. I thought nothing (until Star Wars episode 7) would top The Avengers Age Of Ulton for my favorite movie this year.... Well I was dead wrong. After seeing this film I wanted to see it again right away.

","I watched the original Mad Max 2015 Movie a few days ago with my friends. After the 30 year later, we finally see the release of the fourth Movie of George Miller's Mad Max series. This movie MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the story of 'Mad' Max (Tom Hardy) and young women battle to survive in a desert wasteland after the collapse of civilization. Taking about series forward after MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDER DOME, the Movie features Hard taking the torch from Mel Gibson, with a promise of a journey filled with action in unending deserts.But does the movie live up to expectations managing to please the action hungry audience as well as the geeky fan boys who have waited for this movie.<br/><br/>if we going to discuss about performances, Tom Hardy play awesome performance of mentally troubled Max, who is constantly in battle with the demons inside him and is a definitive step up from the manic eyed performance of Mel Gibson in the previous movie. Tom Hardy dry sense of humour evident from his dialogue delivery, action, especially in the sequence of him talking about hope, adds to the overall experience of the movie."
"Tyferra","9","1","9","24 June 2015"," Strapped screaming to the side of a V8 death machine for 120 minutes
","I can't quite express how great I think it is that Mad Max: Fury Road almost completely abandons the action film formula that has been ruling the box office for about 15 years. <br/><br/>Fury Road is essentially a two hour chase sequence. There is perhaps two pages of dialogue in the entire thing. At times it seems like an elaborate stage show, a ballet, a piece of performance art, yet all in all it is exactly what it set out to be which is first and foremost an action film.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that the film works so well because George Miller didn't approach it as if he was making a movie. He seems to have approached it almost as some divine overseer creating and examining a world, putting the pieces in place and working out, given the circumstances and the nature of the characters, what anyone would reasonably expect to happen. In such an insane world there's no time for introductions or exposition, everything's at a furious pace. So Miller shows rather than tells and it's surprisingly easy to get your head into this world. So much so that you immediately accept a giant truck with a mutated blind guitar player in a red onesie perched at the front like a hood ornament, firing fire out of the neck of his twisted metal electric axe as he makes it roar and growl, thrashing and bouncing on bungee chords in front of a wall of speakers and loud-hailers as a tribe of furious drummers back him up.<br/><br/>As I understand the film was originally intended to be an animation hence it was storyboarded to death. This means every shot is absolutely beautiful. The special effects are almost entirely practical adding further depth to the fire and sand and twisted metal. 130 cars were built, I believe less than half survived filming.<br/><br/>The plot isn't Earth-shattering. It's not meant to be. Neither Max nor Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa are trying to save the world or even a small part of it. Furiosa initiates the plot by staging a rescue of warlord Immortan Joe's prized breeders which fires him up enough to pursue her with his entire fleet of glorious souped-up death machines crewed by an army of the insane and the damned. That's it. Max finds himself part of it through chance and the protagonists simply respond as best they can in order to survive. There's no grandstanding, no quiet points where characters talk about themselves in an attempt to forge audience engagement, not even so Furiosa could talk about her sweet robot arm or why she felt the need to revolt against Joe, (possibly with a reference to her sweet robot arm.) It doesn't need to have this either. Character motivations are plainly there for all to see due to Miller's approach. There's not even a set up for a final confrontation, no exchange of words between the antagonist and protagonist before they engage in fisticuffs as is usually the case. It happens as the rest of the film does; strapped screaming to the side of a V8 monster truck at 100 kilometres an hour as everyone just tries to stay alive. How are you going to have a conversation about motivations during that?<br/><br/>This would be a beautiful albeit forgettable film if it didn't completely rework or ignore how action films have been built over the last two decades or so, even despite the fantastic characters and acting from Theron in particular. George Miller deserves so much credit for having a vision and just pursuing it. How great it is that he was seemingly unimpeded by studio interests – mostly because I think it was seen as a schlock B-movie attempt to cash in on 70s and 80s nostalgia. How great is it that so many just went along with it. How great is it that audiences and critics are also going along with it, rewarding a brave and exceptional piece of cinematic art with the plaudits it deserves."
"ksorigin","8","1","9","19 June 2015"," A benchmark for all action movies to come...
","The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of the many positives to this movie is that there is no attempt to slowly introduce the characters and the setting. Straight away the film drops you into the action and it's just non-stop adrenaline from there. The movie is Raw, violent and gritty and that is exactly what i went into the cinema expecting, the tension is incredible throughout the entire film and the struggle for survival is evident through the acting of every cast member. <br/><br/>The post-apocalyptic setting is also fantastic and you can really see how the world has fallen to its knees. Civilisation is almost non-existent and any human principles are long gone which plays to the setting perfectly. The citadel plays a huge part in the plot of the movie and is also where we are introduced to the primary antagonist Immortan Joe. Both Immortan Joe and the war boys are intimidating, cold hearted and ruthless which shows how harsh the empire that Immortan Joe had created truly was. <br/><br/>However, after watching the film i was definitely able to find a few negatives. There isn't a lot of character development which made it quite difficult to care about the characters. For example, Tom Hardy was raw and emotionless which was part of his character and that was great but his performance was on the dull side and he definitely lacked the charisma that Mel Gibson had in the previous Mad Max movies. There was also minimal character development for supporting characters like the 5 wives or Rictus (the youngest son of Immortan Joe) who was supposedly the main supporting antagonist in the movie. Yet i do believe that Nux was the best supporting character in the movie and allowed the audience to see the transition from blood thirsty war boy to something more human. In my opinion Charlize Theron gave the best performance as Imperator Furiosa, you could see the pain she had experienced in the past through her acting which was excellent. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie, the action was intense from start to finish. Overall i believe it was a top quality action movie. - 8/10"
"Top_Cat84","8","1","9","12 June 2015"," Intense non-stop road rage
","If, like me, you've heard about the original Mad Max trilogy but never gotten around to watching any of them don't let that put you off from watching this movie. It's a stand alone film with imagery so intense it'll be haunting you for days. <br/><br/>The characters all have individual and quirky personalities and - despite the title - it's a film that's not solely about a man called Max. In fact, a group of strong women headed by Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa play a significant part in it. <br/><br/>This is not a dialogue-laden movie, with Tom Hardy's Max mainly grunting his way through each scene and any silence being taken up with the sound of large engines revving. This doesn't take away from the movie at all - rather it helps to emphasise the whole madness that has taken hold of humanity.<br/><br/>It's an adrenaline fueled film, with strong characters, a decent story line and intense imagery. Never has a film's imagery had such a strong effect on me - the craziness, the landscapes, the vehicles, the chases, the people are all just brilliant."
"gortx","Null","1","9","7 June 2015"," Road Warrior on Steroids
","MAD MAX FURY ROAD is good. The action is astonishing, and at one point, I just couldn't believe how INSANE what I was seeing was. And, you gotta love a gang that brings along it's own guitar and drums accompaniment! The use of real stunts over CGI was refreshing, but I wish Miller had resisted the temptation to monkey with the editing in post with all the digital ramp zooms and jagged editing, and color saturation.<br/><br/>The plot is so thin it could have been written on a napkin. And, some of the dialog is frankly embarrassing with Theron's ""redemption"" line being so drearily spot on, I was hoping it was supposed to be ""ironic"". Hardy is a fine actor, but, doesn't approach Mel Gibson's charisma in the role. And, Miller has sidelined Max to a virtual supporting role alongside Charlene Theron's ferocious Furiousa character.<br/><br/>With THE ROAD WARRIOR, Miller raised the stakes and brilliantly created a World Gone Wild with sublime action scenes - but, some of the central dramatic core was sacrificed. I like THUNDERDOME, but for it's slower, quieter second half with the lost children. It again restored the balance with drama over action. FURY ROAD is ROAD WARRIOR on steroids - bigger, faster, furiouser (ahem). This time, there is virtually NO drama - Essentially: Some beaten up dude meeting an Amazon who is leading her truckload of Playboy Bunnies away from an evil warlord. Repeat for 120 (admittedly thrilling) minutes.<br/><br/>I haven't seen THUNDERDOME since it's original release (30 years!), so I will have to re-visit it sometime. For now, FURY ROAD is a terrific action picture in a fine series - but, also, the least dramatically satisfying."
"Seraphion","7","1","9","2 June 2015"," Two hours of crazy cars, car-chases and pure action
","The story is just another one of those cliché action movie stories of the hero helping the party who is running from the evil ruler. It even completes with the common finale of the evil ruler dying at the end and the escaping party gets to become the new ruler. Nothing new from the story as there's no new ingredient added to the story as a whole, not even a good enough twist. Yet This movie grants a spectacular display of a very crazy action, from start to end. From the time as Furiosa starts to veer off her course the movie just doesn't give any room to stop to catch your breath. And the action is the kind of action which you rarely see in other action movies, with lots and lots of crazy stunts everywhere. I also like how the movie keeps and even develops the original Mad Max's style of vehicular mods and character designs. The acting overall is a great job for me. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max really equals, if not bested, Mel Gibson's performances from the original movies. The voice play is also nice. Charlize Theron can really make her character stand out. Nicholas Hoult did great to shed his previous characters and play this role of crazy eager War Boy."
"RaoulAcosta","Null","1","9","31 May 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road
","The 30 year gap from Beyond Thunderdome to Fury Road has resulted in one of the best action movies in recent memory.<br/><br/>Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a survivor in a post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by whoever has the guns, the ""guzzaline"" (gasoline) and - most importantly - the water. Due to bad luck, Max finds himself mixed up in a high speed conflict between Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Furiosa and Max will need to temper their distrust of others, if they are to escape Immortan Joe with their lives.<br/><br/>The film rounds its characters very subtly. Violent flashbacks provide a glimpse of Max' past. He is certainly not the main character, but don't be fooled. Hardy's road warrior is an excellent vehicle for bringing the audience into the story.<br/><br/>The ruthless Immortan Joe is characterized mostly by his costume, makeup and his actions. He covers his deformed body with a faux- muscle suit; he denies water to the needy so as to keep them wanting. Not a very deep character, but one who works as a very clear villain in a movie where the main characters are a bit more ambiguous.<br/><br/>Theron's character is the only one whose fleshing out eventually becomes a bit clunky and expository. Not to say that she is not a great character. The calm way she carries herself, her fighting prowess and her single minded dedication to the protection of others goes a long way to prove that she can be counted among the ranks of great female main characters like Black Mamba (Kill Bill), Sara Connor (The Terminator) and even Ellen Ripley (Alien).<br/><br/>Okay. Let us not forget that this is an action movie. The action is brilliant, and by brilliant I mean VULGAR. The audience is treated to stunts, explosions, occurrences and visuals that would fall flat i many other movies. They work in Fury Road, because they are so obviously and naturally a part of the world they inhabit. To me, a body being thrown under a big-rig makes sense in a world where human lives are not appreciated. This goes along very well with the fact, that the stunts, the makeup and the special effects are mostly practical (i.e. real).<br/><br/>I will give this film a 9/10 rating, not because I think it is among the greatest pieces of art ever committed to the big screen, but because it is so refreshing. It might be part of an established franchise, but thankfully it seems the creators were mostly concerned with achieving a clear-cut vision, rather than pandering to the widest possible audience.<br/><br/>Give this film a chance. You might not agree with the high ratings it has already received, you might wish it would share more secrets, you might think that it is too over the top, but I promise you: This is real high octane action."

","Clip your nails: because ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" will have you ruining chair arms if you don't.<br/><br/>George Miller has masterfully welded together a neat, gritty and chaotically choreographed dance of metal mayhem. This point is highlighted with scenes of apocalyptic war drums accompanied by a mad-red jumpsuit donned stringed ax thrasher who strums and picks notes during a-many doomed pursuits.<br/><br/>One of the most talented and varied cinematographers that exists in the industry, John Seale, punches bold and mesmerizing hues of rust, sweat, life and zeal through the audiences' optical pipes, seizing the imagination.<br/><br/>Madman of the hour Max (Tom Hardy) has few lines. Instead, he communicates more by what he doesn't say--which I found ideal for the character. His suspicion that all minds are tortured in one way or another, and how Miller illustrated those mental episodes, lets me feel connected to the character in that special way that elevates a movie from an experience to an interaction.<br/><br/>Rebellious, charming and astute Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) must have missed the memo about the title of the movie. Anyone would have trouble defending Max as being the lead in this movie. This is not a complaint.<br/><br/>Remaining cast were aces in my book.<br/><br/>Car chases were spectacular and certainly blurred the lines between special and visual effects. My only complaint is that despite the movie being titled ""Fury Road"" there could have been less vehicular venery.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT AHEAD.) Scale is scoped in epic proportions throughout much of this flick. Mile high dust storms, desert plains, hordes of monster truck luxury transports, motorcycles and rat-rod clod busters are barely contained on-screen. Encapsulating this fact is at the tail end of the climax as the mixed group of protagonists contemplate their futures into an apparent dried up ocean bed--gazing to the haze of the foreboding horizon. To cross it on motorcycle would take over one hundred and sixty days.<br/><br/>While not my preferred octane of choice, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an addition to the franchise that many will aspire to replicate, some will use to motivate, but all respectable fans of cinema will appreciate."
"seansnyder-60410","10","1","10","25 June 2016"," One of the best action films EVER!
","This film is a down right action masterpiece on all levels. The action, the setting, the characters are all well realized to bring us one the greatest films we have had in a long time. I don't to sound like I'm ""fanboying"" over this film but I have no problem in saying that this is probably the best shot action I have ever seen in a movie. Beautiful wide takes of incredible action are given to the audience and we are not cheated with all the shaky cam crap that's floating around in Hollywood today that passes for an action movie. But what struck me the most about this whole film was the vulnerability of our hero's as they progress through the movie. Constantly someone is beating on Max played by Tom Hardy who does a great job taking over Gibson's role and Furiosa played by Charlize Theron. Both of these characters are so well realized for who they are, there human beings. They aren't some super powered being who can defeat bad guys left and right. Charlize Theron easily puts herself up there with one of my favorite female characters of all time right behind Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise. She isn't some damsel in distress that needs someone to come save her every 20 minutes. She kicks major ass and brings and leaves a great impression for movie makers of the future on how to properly make a strong female character in film. If you are an action movie lover, this is the movie you have been waiting for. Finally we have that definitive action movie for this decade to say action movies can be great again, you will not forget this one guys I guarantee it."

I'm very happy to say that and Mad Max: Fury Road wasn't just a good film, it was the best film of the year by a country mile.<br/><br/>It contains one of the most impressive and most dramatic scenes in modern cinema.

George Miller has always been very good but this film deserved far more recognition than it got for him personally and that's in spite of the fact that it has won more awards and has been nominated for more than any other film of 2015, including Spotlight (Best Oscar Film winner) and The Revenant (Best BAFTA Film winner). <br/><br/>It is a cinematic masterpiece; I can give it no higher praise and it deserved more."

"brchthethird","9","1","10","6 September 2015"," George Miller's triumphant return puts other ""Mediocre!"" action films to shame
","At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed ""pure cinema"" (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have)."

","First things first, I'll confess that i didn't see the trailer. So i had no idea, no expectations from this movie whatsoever. A spontaneous plan resulting into watching this flick was nothing more i could ask for. If you're watching it for the first time, be ready to get blown away.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Max(and his ""that was deep"" dialogue) eating a two-headed lizard. WOW. That was something. You might think that. Then from the next minute the action begins and results into a cat and mouse chase. <br/><br/>Max, played by Tom Hardy, is a road warrior who is haunted by his past. Imperator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, does a fantastic job. Her role is flawless and so is her performance. The big chase comes due to Furiosa and an astonishing chase results from it. Casting both Tom and Charlize are excellent decisions as they do it well.<br/><br/>Speaking about the chase, Immortan Joe, the warlord, takes his warrior boys and also takes help from neighboring farms. Played by Hugh Keayes-Bryne, he adds a touch of an eerie-dominating warlord who wants to rule the world. <br/><br/>Nux, played by Nicolas Hoult, also does a good job of supporting Max and Furiosa. His maniacal excitement of going to Valhalla makes you feel he's gone nuts as he keeps on talking about it. For you, the chase in the first half will not be over as there is a chase in the second half. Add to the chase lots of guns, fire, modded vehicles, flying warrior boys, old ladies with shooting and fighting skills(you'll be surprised), Max with a plan and the booty(the reason for all this chase). <br/><br/>The story isn't much, but the action scenes and sequences make up more than for it. At the end you would be impressed by the action, but not by the storyline. <br/><br/>My word: Watch it once for the action, stories aren't original these days so we wouldn't miss them much."

","There is non stop action, a great and interesting world (like the fallout series) and many great ideas. The problem is to see 50 kg women fighting 80-100 kg men and having a chance (= another fairy tale). Thats of course ridiculous. In addition I had always the feeling men are bad in this movie and women are innocent, like it is showed in most of our mass media. There was one great dialog, that I appreciate and contradict to this feeling: young pregnant woman saying despicably to an old woman, it will be an Warlod Junior, gonna be so ugly. Old woman says, it could be a girl. Interestingly she responds, you kill people with that thing, do you? The old woman tells proudly how well she can kill and the young one responds: ""Thought somehow you girls were above that."" Nice one. Anyway, the importance of women in such a world is unrealistic."

They didn't bother forcing any needless plot or dialogue on us, just enough to give context to the chase. If you're looking for plot/character development, you will not find it here. This movie was all business. Pure, raw, hardcore action. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that went this balls deep with action. Absolutely phenomenal. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron gave believable performances. Charlize especially shines as a strong female protagonist.<br/><br/>I would rank this title as one of my favorite movies of all time.

"superceded_vampire_pants","9","1","10","1 August 2015"," This is NOT an American Film.
","In Australia the original Mad Max was a cultural phenomenon. The 70s birthed some of the most high-octane albeit ridiculous films in the cinematic history of this country and everybody loved it. George Miller returned to Mad Max after 30 years to pick up where he left off and it is nothing short of incredible. In a world where computer animated special effects are applauded as revolutionary, it was wonderful to see PRACTICAL special effects. you see a guy swinging from a pole on the top of a car? That's a stuntman swinging from a pole on the top of a car. Miller had every reason to succumb to the popular idea that CGI is the only way to create spectacular sequences, but he didn't. Miller's direction was as important here as it was when he initially released Mad Max 30 years ago. This is by no means an American film and i am sick to death of seeing people suggesting that it is. Miller is a prize to Australia and we are very lucky that he used all Australian actors for supporting roles in this film, as well as casting the wonderful Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe so long after he played Toecutter in the original. The story is, yes, quite simple; but so is the original. The high emotion in this film was unsurpassed by any action film that has been released this year, and i wish that people would approach it for what it is; an Australian director re-imagining something he put so much effort into so long ago. The acting is strong from all sides and the soundtrack is incredible. You can complain all you want about Max's lack of presence in the overall film but George Miller willed it to be that way. This is an action film that transcends the action genre. This is Ozploitation for the 21st century. This is what action films should be."

","My quick rating - 8,3/10. There really is no reason for a long winded review. Too many great things about this movie to point out. The way that ""Max"" is used was done so well to make the main character seem as though he isn't the focus. Furiousa (Charlize Theron) was astounding in her role as the heavy (strange, huh?). The movie itself starts off in high gear and rarely lets up to allow us lucky viewers a moment to catch our breath. Visually stunning in a very dark way such as the others were : A world were gas=gold and water is a commodity. Violence is non-important, only survival is. So well doe throughout with every bit of attention paid to detail to make you feel the desperation. I could go on and on as many reviews I am sure have, but it is tough to keep up, I may just have to watch it again. Go in knowing you will like this movie for many reasons.

"luke5119","10","1","10","29 June 2015"," George Miller's Intended Vision Finally Realized
","Some 36 years ago completely unknown director George Miller released what went on to be one the biggest cult action films in history, Mad Max. Starring the also unknown at the time, Mel Gibson. Who much like Harrison Ford in Star Wars released only 2 years earlier, was the lone star of the film to make it big in Hollywood. Mel would go onto become on the biggest names in Hollywood throughout the 80's and 90's while director George Miller fell into obscurity, maintaining a presence as a working Director, but releasing radically different films like the animated hit children's film Happy Feet. I didn't have the highest hopes for Mad Max: Fury Road when I first got wind of it some 4+ years ago. I grew up as big fan of the original Mad Max trilogy as my dad is a huge fan of Mel Gibson. I knew that Fury Road was going through production hell and always was scrapped entirely with how long the process was taking, some 10+ years with changing stories, actors, etc. <br/><br/>When I finally heard that they were in pre-production and had a set cast in Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, I anxiously waited word on who the new Mad Max was going to be. My original bet and hope was for Terminator Salvation / Avatar actor Sam Worthington, when they announced Tom Hardy, I thought to myself...okay, okay. After seeing the first full length trailer, I was jaw dropped. I knew that George finally achieved in making the film he envisioned making some 36 years ago. Mad Max, the way he saw it in his head. Everyone delivers an amazing performance. Including the unknown Hugh Keays-Byrne, who is only well known for his role as Toecutter in the original Mad Max film.<br/><br/>I think what baffles me the most is how in the world this movie gets made. Honestly? How does a director at the age of 70! Who is only known primarily for a film series with a mere cult following at best, get granted a $150 million dollar budget!? Unlike Star Wars which established a massive following in it's time before releasing it's newest trilogy. George Lucas also maintained a heavy industry presence in writing films (Indiana Jones) before the new Star Wars trilogy was announced. That was also a mere 16 year difference between the release of Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace. <br/><br/>I think what helped this film was the nature of the story, it's even more relative today than 30+ years ago, it follows a central ""post apocalyptic"" theme that is also very popular now. It appeals to adults young and old, admirers of the original ""Mad Max"" story, and those looking for a good action film. I'm so excited that this movie was able to get made. I'm still mind boggled by it, but still very happy that this movie got made. I saw it a month ago and I'm still geeking out about it. <br/><br/>To put it simply, this is to the original Mad Max Trilogy, to that of what George Lucas hoped for with the Star Wars prequels."

","""Oh what a day.....what a lovely day!"". <br/><br/>Definitely was a lovely day, and how can it not be when you watch something like this. <br/><br/>Prior to watching this, I did a marathon of the original trilogy and didn't liked them very much. They may have been great in their own time but not anymore. No idea why people loved them. And I was of the opinion that this movie won't be that different from them. Luckily, I was wrong, so very wrong. <br/><br/>The movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where nuclear war destroyed everything. Chaos and pure madness is what remains. Now, in the previous movies, this whole post apocalyptic world didn't really interest me all that much. But in Fury Road, I got just the type of execution that clicked with me and the world hooked me in. Story was never the selling point of these movies anyway. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy filled in the shoes of Mel Gibson as Mad Max. He played his one of the more typical roles, with less talk and tough guy voice and such, and he was great. Max needed no big introduction or anything and we didn't get one either. However, The character who stole the show was Furiosa, played perfectly by Charlize Theron. She was amazing. Being both tough/badass and emotional/caring. Her character was the center point of the movie and it felt like she is the lead, not Max. The movie could have easily been called ""Mad Furiosa: Fury Road"". The character development of some characters was pretty good, and all of it was done on the run. <br/><br/>The whole movie is like this one big chase of epic proportions. The action sequences were so satisfying and thrilling. The cinematography was so perfect. The editing and pacing was spot on. Many heart racing and adrenaline injecting sequences. I was in awe multiple times throughout the movie due to the sheer beauty of carnage and destruction at display. What made it even more awesome was that 80% of the action was all practical effects. I mean, WOW, just WOW. Kudos to George Miller and the team.<br/><br/>The movie utilized very vibrant and popping color filters, making every frame, all the destruction and madness more beautiful. The explosions never looked more awesome. And it was a very fresh sight to see too because almost all post apocalyptic movies have bleak degraded colors for dark tone and atmosphere. <br/><br/>The one thing I was most glad about was the Soundtrack. I hated the original trilogy soundtrack. IT was miscued a lot, and was just bad. I'm glad George Miller went with a more modern approach and the resulting soundtrack was great. And Epic. Really made all the action more thrilling. <br/><br/>As for the negatives, one thing that really popped out was that while CGI was sparingly used, and most of it was great, there were some moments where green screen usage was apparent and it REALLY felt out of place because everything else was so top notch. Another thing that somewhat bothered me was the motion direction style that George Miller sometimes adds into his sequences, which makes them feel sped up and jittery. <br/><br/>All in all, this was one HELL of an action movie. It has been a long time since I got this much entertainment from a purely action movie. Don't go into it thinking it has a deep plot and story and whatnot. It is not that type of movie. But it is still a must watch because honestly speaking, it is a work of art for what it was going for. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

"burlesonjesse5","7","1","10","18 May 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Mad Max: Fury Road
","In the mid-1980's, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior represented the first time I ever saw a movie on VHS. No joke. There I was, taking in the existential, catastrophic splendor and thrusted into a funky, eclectic world that only director George Miller could deposit me in. I was also taken aback by the aura of star Mel Gibson. He didn't say much. He just drove the big rig and gave any punk rocker delinquent the business (via a veritable, sawed-off shotgun). When the announcement that a new installment was on the horizon (some thirty years later), it was also predicated on the fact that Australia's favorite son be omitted from the lead role. Brit Tom Hardy who seems to be everywhere these days, got to inhabit the driver's seat (ha-ha). The question on every moviegoer's mind is can he fill the shoes of ""mad"" Mel? The answer is, it doesn't matter. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't entirely about the character of Max Rockatansky. And Hardy for what it's worth, only possesses about a smidgen of Melle Mel's ear to the grindstone screen presence. For practical purposes though, he'll do and so will the movie. Its plot is slight yet there are action sequences providing enough scorched antics and kinetic motion to make your eyes shoot through the back of your head. We're talking apocalypse now more than ever.<br/><br/>Historically, George Miller has been in charge of every Mad Max movie since their franchised inception back in 1979. He takes everything that made those films work and ratchets it up a few more notches here. His world in ""Fury Road"", is made up of caricatures that for the most part, are funkier, nastier, and much more repugnant. This is imagination outside five boxes. The look is more modern too. Cinematographer John Seale (he shot The Tourist) harbors a canvas that is ablaze, drenched, and vehemently dusty. It's like a sunburn that eventually turns golden brown. As for storytelling sensibilities, well they are fashioned less than in all three of the previous outings combined. The script is the product of more than one writer and you think to yourself, ""did it need that many?"" In truth, there's not a whole lot of dialogue anyway and I suppose whatever amount is messaged to the audience, well it probably comes off as concealed. No matter. I honestly don't go to Mad Max movies for the account. I want to view what Roger Daltrey sang about (that would be the tune by The Who called ""Let's See Action""). Granted, this 2015 release has enough pyrotechnics, villainy, and aerodynamic exertion for ten movies (with what seems like almost no CGI). I hope the stuntmen got paid handsomely because they work some serious overtime.<br/><br/>Now the last thirty minutes of Mad Max: Fury Road are a masterpiece all in itself. They make the flick better than it really is or even has a right to be. You gotta use your utmost imagination or just think Raiders of the Lost Ark on anabolic steroids. What precludes is an extended chase sequence with enough semi trucks and other motorized vehicles to overrun the city of Detroit. There is violence in nature here and acrobatic candour that simply wears you out.<br/><br/>So who is this all attributed to? Well director George Miller of course and at age 70, he is one feisty fellow. This dude is like the Martin Scorsese of action directors because of his starry-eyed energy that's blatantly possessed. He hadn't made a Mad Max film since 1985 so you know that he had a lot of time to subjugate his newest vision. My thinking is that he might have checked out 1995's Waterworld to mirror the costume design, or to polish things up a bit, or even to add some new angles (there are shots in ""Fury Road"" where the villainous malefactors are off in the distance and you know that danger is coming. It reminded me of said film so sue me). His premise is in short doses and it intervenes between periods of metal-geared rubble and heavy metal stage prog.<br/><br/>You have of course, Max (Tom Hardy). He's an Australian prisoner and a man who's held captive while being used for upside down blood donation. Then there's Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron in the token, female badass role). She's a War Rig driver who is helping five wives escape from breeding slavery. Finally, we have Nux (played by Nicolas Hoult who reminded me of the Gyro Captain from The Road Warrior). He's a sick War Boy and needs a large amount of ichor to go on surviving. That's all I'm gonna reveal. Just know that all of these souped-up characters are in some way, connected. Now your job is to buy a ticket, get strapped in, and let the chaos and upheaval simply spill onto the screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film has garnered four stars from many of the nation's critics. I myself enjoyed it but I'm scratching my head to figure where all the enormous praise came from. Here's how I chalked up my rating. I gave Mad Max: Fury Road three and a half stars for the audacious, relentless suspense and two and a half stars for the razor thin narrative. That results in a solid dose of action-adventure fare but not something that's catered to magnum opus territory. Regardless, this is still a ""road"" worth taking. There are no exits, no stop lights, and the aspect of no passing lanes is irrelevant. To quote Nicolas Hoult's albino, cracked-lipped Nux, ""what a day, what a lovely day!"" Natch."
"jmdietz-74267","10","1","11","21 September 2015"," A visual Masterpiece
","Having anticipated this movie ever since the first trailer, having seen this movie as soon as it came out in theaters and having bought it on bluray as soon as it was possible, I can say without a doubt that this movie is great. True, I am not a connoisseur of the original Mad Max movies, but that doesn't mean I don't know a good movie when I see one. Fury Road is definitely not all action and explosions! (Though they are present from start to finish) the movie also has it's serene and meaningful moments. These are always accompanied by stunning visuals and amazing cinematography. What's almost more impressive than the film itself (almost) is the making of it, with all cars and explosions being practical and the concept art reaching back 10 years. Truly a masterpiece, infused with metaphors, representations of industry, war cult and economy, all set in front of a beautifully designed backdrop."
"bourassaanna","9","1","11","27 August 2015"," So much more than ""just explosions""
","Disregard all the reviews you've seen saying that this movie has ""no substance,"" or ""lacks a storyline"". The movie is supposed to be action packed, and that can be distracting for certain viewers, but when you look beneath the explosions and remember the whole point of the movie, it's quite a beautiful story about fellowship between those who rebel against an oppressive dictator for different reasons: survival, freedom, peace, and the most common theme of redemption.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>The scene where Furiosa removes her prosthetic arm and drops to her knees after hearing that her home place has been destroyed gets a lot of criticism, where its described as over dramatic, but if anything, is less dramatic than it should have been. The main characters find out that their entire journey has been in vain and everything they hoped for has been destroyed. Of course, this is hardest on Furiosa, because not only has she condemned herself to this horrible fate with false hope, but also the entirety of her company, also realizing that she'll be killed, even if the breeders survive, and I'll leave that up to you to decide which is a worse fate. If that were my position, I'd probably be upset at the moment too. <br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max: Fury Road is a highly underrated movie with a great storyline, great character development, and insanely great special effects. I highly recommend re watching it if you haven't yet, keeping in mind the plot line."
"Lule22","8","1","11","26 August 2015"," Mad Max gets thrown in the middle of a wild chase after Imperator Furiosa who is in search for the green place.
","Well... this movie is just a blast to watch. George Miller proves that a great movie can actually be made without a complex plot or tons and tons of dialogue. With Furiosa, we finally get a truly strong female character. Mad Max turns into a side character by the and of the movie and it can be argued that she is actually the lead of this film. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron did a wonderful job, as they always do. Other actors also did a good job playing their parts. Cinematoraphy is great, CGI is unnoticeable and blended seamlessly with practical effects. Action is directed perfectly and all the hard work that was put into making this movie can be seen on the screen. This movie is actually the best movie in the whole franchise. Overall, this is not a perfect movie, but it surely is the best action movie we've had in years."
"Ramification85","10","1","11","30 July 2015"," A Milestone for Action Movies
","I watched this movie with little expectations, as was the case with most action movies in the last ten years. I was blown away with the intensity of the high speed action sequences, the continuous stunts and explosions mixed with the emotions that were delivered perfectly with minimal dialogue.<br/><br/>The whole movie was a great journey to find Furiosa's homeland ""Heaven on Earth"" the plot gives you hope in a place where water is a luxury ""Hell on Earth"", almost everything around you drives your instinct of survival.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and the rest of the cast were excellent, but Charlize Theron had the best performance in this movie. <br/><br/>Fury Road gave me hope that action movies can and will be great again."

","Continuing from the original Mad Max film series (although I'm not sure where this fits in continuity-wise), this movie finds Max (Tom Hardy) taken prisoner by the War Boys, a cult-like army for warlord Immortan Joe. When one of Joe's rig drivers, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), tries to help Joe's young ""wives"" escape, the warlord gathers all his forces to pursue her. Max, being used as a walking blood bag for one of the War Boys, finds himself along for the ride.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the original Mad Max movies, I was more than a little hesitant about a new one with a new actor in the role. I was also hesitant with regards to George Miller's capabilities nowadays. He has done mostly family fare since the '80s and, let's be honest, most of the great directors from the '70s and '80s have since lost whatever magic they once possessed. To add to this the critics were all praising this movie and the hype was through the roof and I'm always skeptical of movies heavily pushed by The Machine. Despite my reservations, I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie a lot. Its action scenes are exciting and refreshing. I do wish that Miller could've pulled it off without so much CGI. There are many moments where the action scenes are diluted by the poor blending of CGI cartoonery in with the real. But I'm sure I sound like an old fuddy duddy, as I often do when it comes to CGI in action movies these days.<br/><br/>I liked this but didn't enjoy it as much as the original series, all of which I've rewatched within the past year. My primary reason for this is that this doesn't feel especially unique in any way. It feels like the previous movies visually and even homages certain things directly from those movies, but it never feels like it adds anything of its own that's particularly creative. Each one of the previous movies built on the other and added new characters, lines, and moments that were distinct and memorable. I also don't feel like Tom Hardy brings anything impressive to the table. Part of that is the script's fault as Max is almost a supporting character instead of the star in the first half. Charlize Theron gets the best role in the movie and easily outshines Hardy, who mostly just grunts his lines and tries to give his best Blue Steel for close-ups. So I do have some problems with this. But, at the end of the day, it entertained the hell out of me and that's what matters most. Kudos to George Miller for proving he's still got it. Now if only John Carpenter could figure out where he left his mojo and give us one more great movie, I would be ecstatic."

","To just say this movies one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's great for the action, blood, gore, insanity, and mindlessness. It's also good for the special effects, plot line, unique weapons and characters of insanity. If you like gory mindless action with good graphics you must watch this movie in the theaters. This was a good birthday gift. <br/><br/>So this takes place in the middle of nowhere, where a tyrannical scumbag is taking the lands resources and turning everybody into slaves. His greatest assistant goes on a mission to bring several girls back to their home land from slavery. AS in the middle of this the well known ""Mad Max,"" is taken prisoner and collides with the assistant of the tyrant. Then they have to work together to fight against the continuous waves of this tyrant.<br/><br/>MUST WATCH!!!!"
"static-25910","8","1","11","7 July 2015"," Fury Under The Hood!
","If someone asked me to describe Mad Max: Fury Road in one word it would most definitely be ""metal"" There really is no better suited term to this movie it's just so freaking metal! Fans of the Mad Max series know how hardcore the past films have been but this is by far the biggest thing to ever come out of not just a Mad Max movie but any action movie ever!<br/><br/>The plot of the film is pretty simple so I won't go into too much detail. It starts of with Mad Max himself being taken prisoner by a group of death crazed cultists, lead by a large, disease ridden warlord called Immortan Joe. In his attempt to escape, Max meets up with Furiosa, a woman attempting to free Immortan Joe's several wives. The movie follows Max and Furiosa as they travel across the barren post-apocalyptic landscape trying to get to Furiosa's homeland all while being chased by Immortan Joe and his group of psychopaths called the War Boy's.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are many, particularly on the villains side but all of them stand out as an individual. Tom Hardy as Max is the strong and silent, battle hardened warrior. Charilze Theron's Furiosa is one bad-ass female character with a mysterious past and in truth the coolest character in the movie, the returning Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe is intimidating as all hell as well as his rag tag group of nutters. However, for me the stand out character was Nicholas Hoult as the newly reformed War Boy Nux. He starts off as a fanatic of Immortan Joe but ultimately realises how his idol was just a dictator once he falls in love with one of the rescued wives. His character arc is the most interesting to watch and he provides some much needed comedy in otherwise serious situations as well as having a few touching scenes with his love interest as well.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this is not why you should see this movie. You should see this movie because of the perfect, incredible, breathtaking action scenes. Everything that happens happens on the biggest scale possible in a way that similar to Murphy's Law: If it can blow up, it will blow up. The battles that take place on the road are exhilarating and in every one something incredibly entertaining happens without fail. Even the cars themselves are amazingly detailed and cool, ranging from your basic spiky death machines to pimped out classics to a gosh darn giant war rig with a dude playing electric guitar on it! The film is worth going to see just for this alone and the cool characters and insane adventure only add to the sheer insane enjoyment.<br/><br/>True the film is not without it's flaws, despite it being incredibly over the top there are a few things that feel a little bit silly and some moments between certain characters can feel forced at times but ultimately it doesn't take away from your enjoyment of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>In the end, Mad Max: Fury Road is a high octane thrill ride that is well worth the watch, whether you're a fan of the series, a fan of action flicks, or just a fan of awesome visuals Mad Max is the movie for you. It's absolutely mental but that's what makes it so great! So get all of your friends together and just marvel at the sheer awesomeness of it. Get pumped when Max blows something up! Get anxious when a villain has the upper hand! And most importantly..GET FURIOUS!!! Road rage has never looked this good."

","""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on a Fury Road"" - Nux Mad Max: Fury Road drove into theaters with furious anticipation due to excellent reviews that we have not seen from a Blockbuster movie in a long while. A mixture of sadly hearing (I like going into movies with no knowledge of critically feedback) about those stellar reviews before my viewing of this film and my favorite actor Tom Hardy playing Max, my excitement for this film was a bit overwhelming. Could it live up to the hype? ""My name is Max. My world is reduced to a single instinct: Survive. As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me... Or everyone else."" This is the spine tingling start to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD narrated by Max (Tom Hardy). In a world ran mad, by the mad, due to a reduction in the worlds oil the thought on the minds of everyone is simple...survive! In a beautifully shot opening, which is consistent throughout the movie, Max is chased down by cult leader King Immortan Joe's (Hugh Keays-Byrne) men and imprisoned in there citadel. He is used as a blood donor for half-life war crazed Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who wants to die historic on a Fury Road. While Max is locked up Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is sanctioned to lead a gas run with a convoy towards Gas Town. On the road to Gas Town Furiosa takes a detour and Immortan Joe discovers that his five wives are out of there chambers and Furiosa sets the road she is traveling on a furious course. The King in a desperate anger leads a historically wild and large war party to retrieve his ""property"". Nux, wanting to make a name for himself and to impress the immortal, sets out to lead the ""rescue"" with Max chained to himself so he can continue to receive his blood which gives him strength. The first of many absolutely breathtaking action scenes ensues between Furiosa's rig and Joe's army in a sand storm with tornado's and all sorts of ""lovely"" natural elements. Nux drags Max into this mad sandstorm in pursuit of Furiosa's rig and declares it all as ""a lovely day"". Lovely...this is maybe not the best word to describe the surrounding events for Max, but for the viewer...one of the straight up coolest and jaw-dropping scenes ever filmed. The intensity captured and maintained throughout the movie is sheer brilliance displayed by director George Miller. The whole film in its most simplistic form is just one big chase scene, but the execution and characters make this film so much more. The movie throws you right into the story like so few successful movies have, but the acting gives these characters such depth. Hardy, Hoult and most of all Theron are so effective in a movie that is more about the ground breaking stunts and beautifully sadistic film making. Hardy, like in many films doesn't talk very much for a main character but gives a fully expected performance marked by controlled brilliance. Hoult, as Nux gives energy and surprising heart to Mad Max: Fury Road in his quest for hope. The theme of hope is rooted in this film, Nux's hope began in an attempt to please cult leader Joe in battle and ended in a quest to help those he was originally out to kill. Theron as Furiosa was a gem and gave a strong women character that at times stole the show from the titled character. Passionately ran by redemption, Furiosa fights for those oppressed by this cruel apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road ""feels like hope"" in an action genre fueled by CGI and depthless characters. It is unlike anything seen before and the intensity is jarring and never lets up. George Miller creates action scenes that are truly unique and will leave no one yawning. Hope has arrived not only for the characters in the movie but also for viewers and fans of action films. What a refreshing cinematic experience, not only because of the visceral action scenes but also the depth of the characters and themes. While due to the hype the fourth installment of Mad Max may not of left me fully satisfied, it was pretty dang close even though my expectations were through the roof. If you choose to see Mad Max:Fury Road it will truly be a lovely day for you and hopefully regain your hope in summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews: http://www.reviewsbycaleb.com/"

","Okay, don't listen to the party poopers who say this movie sucks. ""Blah blah blah, you get get up and leave... Still the same action when you get back-"" NO. No, no, no, no, no. This is modern action at its finest! There are parts in this movie of 10-25 minutes of straight action but that's probably what you're coming to see Mad Max for, right? Miller throws in just enough character development to keep you interested - so don't listen to Mr Lame and Uninterested, because if you leave you probably will miss some of the movie's soul; what makes it a great movie instead of a good one, the messages and all that tasty deep stuff. So what's left is the action: They completely exhaust action in the best way possible. You won't be seeing the same mechanisms of combat again and again as the movie progresses, it's always changing. Cars are always blowing up, but they won't blow up the same way they did ten minutes ago! And by the end of the film you'll wonder how the hell they're going to make the sequel without showing you the same thing over again. My one gripe: I felt that toward the end of this film slowed down a little in terms of pace, but just like a warming car engine the movie found its footing and picked up again."
"devileye-07504","10","1","11","19 June 2015"," Must watch movie
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.<br/><br/>Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.<br/><br/>I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.<br/><br/>People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.<br/><br/>The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.<br/><br/>What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.<br/><br/>Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it."

","This post apocalyptic adventure film is full of action from the word go. Tom Hardy gives a fantastic performance as the lead (mad Max)showing just the right amount of craziness and is brilliantly moving in the more emotional scenes. The lead actress , Charlize Theron, plays an equally emotionally stirring roll as she fights for the freedom of four young wives and the remainder of the population. Immortan Joe (the evil ruler) played by Hugh Keays-Byrne is insane and terrifying. I couldn't see the role being played by anyone else. Nicholas Hoult plays the second male lead and like all the other roles in this film has been hand-picked perfectly! Not many films can pull of 100% action all the way through and normally leave you bored of the plot line HOWEVER, this keeps you on the edge of your seat and begging for more!If you like fast cars, action scenes, crazy futuristic inventions and insane amounts of special effects and media make-up, THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU!"

","I haven't seen the previous Mad Max films, but I do love the Borderlands franchise which is heavily influenced by the Mad Max universe. So when I saw the trailer for Fury Road, the trailer screamed ""BORDERLANDS!"" to me. I was totally on board for Borderlands: The Movie and went in very excited.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciated right off the bat was that we were thrown right into the story and action with little explanation. Tom Hardy as Mad Max is being chased and almost immediately captured while separately Furiosa is smuggling the Wives away. The warlord, Immortan Joe, chases after Furiosa with his War Boys, who drag along Mad Max. And that's the setup for the whole movie: one big chase scene for survival. The lack of exposition is very welcoming and the pacing is handled very well. Breaks in the action were perfectly timed so as to not leave one exhausted or bored. <br/><br/>Mad Max is a great character, a man of few words, who grunts often, as if it's a struggle to for him to form words. And when he does speak, it is very simply. Charlize Theron as Furiosa is definitely the character who gets to shine in her quest for redemption. She was a tough badass who could and did go toe to toe in a fight. It was SO refreshing that she and the Wives weren't helpless eye candy for Mad Max to save. The War Boys reminded me fondly of the Bandits from Borderlands and I enjoyed their craziness and fanaticism. What a lovely day indeed!<br/><br/>The action was very realistic, believable, and intense. Minimal use of CGI definitely helped this movie maintain tension; it was used sparingly and it never distracted me. I loved the intense orchestral music and the use of the guitar-playing character and drummers was excellent. George Miller, his crew, and the actors did an amazing job. If you are looking for the action movie of the year, Mad Max: Fury Road is it. This is a definite must-see in theaters and I am already pre-ordering the Blu-ray."

","At last, I get the chance to watch this much-hyped action-er in the local theatre, squeezed in a third-rate screen-room with a pretty small screen, this is what I can find for a current movie enters its third week run in Cairo, the hardware facilities are inferior, but we should all make the best of what we can acquire.<br/><br/>This reboot of the cult brand of MAD MAX from the mastermind behind its original trilogy is a felicitous remedy to the generational fatigue of CGI-rampaged action tent-poles the world is overloaded with presently. After decades of immersion into animation filmmaking (paid off with an Oscar trophy for HAPPY FEET 2006 with his co-directors), George Miller's grandiose return to live-action feature, the first one after LORENZO'S OIL in 1992, detonates the genre film enthusiasts with its cutting-edge visual spectacles which counter- act the current trend with the majority of its staggering set pieces accomplished with blood- and-flesh stunt-men and authentic objects other than virtual fictionalisation aided by computers, more pleasingly, the film has already conducts a profitable box-office trajectory worldwide, albeit it bears a hefty budget of $150 millions. <br/><br/>Strictly speaking, the entire picture is a long-drawn-out wheels-chaser, it starts with Furiosa (Theron), an imperator who betrays Immortan Joe (Byrne), the tyrant of a post- apocalyptic world in the vast desert, driving an oil-tank truck back to her homeland (e.g. the Green Place) with Joe's five young wives on board, and Max (Hardy) joins the chase passively as a captive from Joe's war boys. After a string of white-knuckle experiences en route, from foes to friends, Max, Furiosa and one of the war boy Nux (Hoult) successfully outrun Joe's relentless pursuit and reach the land of hope, but hope is a luxury in this world as humans are on the brink of extinction, it only weakens one's most primal instinct, to survive, under any circumstances, which Max abides by firmly. Together, they embark on a more perilous journey to fight back, to topple Joe's reign and take over the source of water, and officially initiates a new chapter for the remaining humanity. <br/><br/>At long last, we have a female heroine can face-off with the main villain without sidelining to combat sidekicks, or being cast as a convenient love interest for our hero during the break, in this case, the film is exceedingly refreshing, Theron's Furiosa, is a brave warrior, not once her female identity is used as a defamation or tease for cheap laughters, in the battle, sex is purely irrelevant, we have a posse composed exclusively of women, mostly grannies, but they are no less combatant than the war boys here. Feminism is a word now has been unfortunately garbled by some very vicious intent, but come what may, I am absolutely in agreement with that this is a revelation and a tremendous progress of our society when we can treat woman as a veritable equal as man, more essentially in the mainstream media, for that reason only, George Miller and his team is worth a big ovation. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy's Max, although upstaged by Furiosa most of the time, is the definitive example of masculinity we should rightfully extol, a man of action instead of vain words, doesn't go all flirty with women (especially, the hot super model kind) whenever he has the chance, it is also a homage to Hardy's other well-known character Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) when he is curbed with a metal mask. Nicholas Hoult, on the other hand, represents another virtues reside in a man, the good-natured innocence veiled with blind idolatry, and finds redemption in the audacious sacrifice. <br/><br/>Apart from its gallant stunt team, the originality of its eye-opening visual parade is also superbly boosted by the unique dystopia aesthetics from the art production and Junkie XL's adrenalin-driven score, only if I could re-watch it on an IMAX screen, it would be a paramount experience to drench one's frustration of our stereotyped blockbusters with stocky character settings and mind-numbing earth demolitions, so, it means a resolved ""No"" to SAN ANDREAS (2015), and this is a film truly earns its entitlement for a sequel, or a prequel, since we haven't know much about Max's background yet. Hardy has already signed on for the next chapters, now let us hope Theron can return too, and more blissfully, with an equal pay-check to prove that we are not living in a retrogressive civilisation."
"evanobrien100","8","1","11","6 June 2015"," A well orchestrated orgy of chaos
","George Miller returns to the big stage proving that he's got a few tricks up his sleeve yet with ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". A monstrously bold 120-minute extravaganza with a road chase to end all road chases culminating in an explosive and thrilling final stretch. Miller clearly has a deep and comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the kinetics of cinema.<br/><br/>What he has displayed through this and previous Mad Max films are applications of the foundations of what is needed to sustain momentum, motion and fluidity of events within scenes. What is displayed in Fury Road is as basic as what was seen in a vast array of silent films.<br/><br/>Fury Road is no holds barred through and through. If you can submit to the unrelenting mayhem then I don't think you'll have a better time. I found myself at one stage thinking ""There is a gigantic truck and on the back of it is a mountain of speakers with weird looking dude playing a flame throwing electric guitar. This is so awesomely weird that any argument I could make against it would be completely invalid""<br/><br/>That's not to say that I don't have criticisms the transitions between certain acts come off as cheap at times. Why don't you just cut instead of fading to black and then re-joining the action? The unstoppable insane action can come off as exhausting at times though there are plenty of respites to help mitigate this effect. The action moves forward so fast that some narrative elements and characters get lost in the mix. Some parts come off a bit trashier than others which leaned heavier into the realm of exploitation than I would have liked. These are only minor issues though.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, in particular, own their roles with well-choreographed and unique physicality. The stunt work is flawless, the action has precise clarity, the music from Junkie XL is heart pounding and fits well with the action, the anamorphic digital aesthetics are flawless with rich well-conceived desert night blues and scorching daylight oranges. Environmental factors and production issues meant that it took many years to bring this film to the big screen with Mel Gibson original set to reprise the titular role. You could tell that Miller has used every single one of those hiccups as an opportunity to retool and improve pre- production aspects of the film and gladly this has made for a much better viewing experience. This film does what its predecessors accomplished on the world building front while creating some brisk forward momentum simultaneously. It takes a lot of talent, effort, and imagination for a movie that is for the most part wall to wall action to get me to still reflect on it once it finishes."
"Vinegaroon3","9","1","11","3 June 2015"," Absolutely Incredible Spectacle.....
","I have seen this film twice, and remain completely blown away by the entire spectacle.<br/><br/>Normally I am not at all a fan of movies with little story that try to engage the viewer with awesome visuals and action. Clearly Mad Max: Fury Road is precisely in that category.<br/><br/>However, I have to give credit where credit is due...they made it work.<br/><br/>I almost wish this was a completely standalone film that did not attempt to tie into the ""Mad Max"" franchise, because it has little in common with the releases from years past, and for me Mel Gibson will always be the only ""Mad Max"". All this latest film shares with the Gibson releases is the name and a few of the general visuals.<br/><br/>So on to the action....since that is all this movie really is.<br/><br/>I am certain at least some of the scenes in this film had to be CGI, simply because there would be no other way to do them. Despite this, it is seamless. I can normally spot CGI a mile away, and in Fury Road I honestly could not tell which effects were done with actual ""hardware"" and which were computer generated. This is important because it is key to the amazing visual experience of watching this.<br/><br/>The action scenes were breathtaking...I'm not sure how else to describe them. They were accompanied by audio that on occasion gave me goose bumps, particularly the air horns on the main ""war rig"" and the surrealistic ""music"" from the mutant rock and roller on the pursuing rig.<br/><br/>I realize this movie will not be for everyone, but nonetheless I have to say it raises the bar for what can be put on the screen in the action film genre. I am already trying to come up with an excuse to see it a third time.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Importantly, it's not just a matter of having a lot of action. Contrary to what we see in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the action here is very realistic. Miller avoided maximum use of special effects, which resulted in a great and brutal sequences. It does not give the impression that we are facing a game. Entitled only to a short presentation at the beginning, the film has almost two hours of nonstop action. It's basically a large and insane car chase, with little room for rest and no room for children (who are the worst things of Mad Max 2 and Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome). Without fear of sounding repetitive, it's insane. By the way, it is also insane how much action fits like a glove in the script. The viewer does not have much time to breathe. But he did not ask for it. He wants more and more, as the inhabitants of the universe on the scene ask for water. Excellent."
"moneysorigin","9","1","11","30 May 2015"," great action from begging to end
","George Miller really hit out of the park with an unnecessary follow up of the old Mad Max trilogy. The first two, are some fan favorites that still hold their effects and storytelling styles to today's movies. The third was considered a let down, but not a disappointment either. As some young people would say, like myself, this movie is possibly the best of them and even could go down with some of the best action movies of all time. The style that Miller directs in is what I would say as a great mix of old, gritty, long-shots, action with modern effects and choreography of all the action sequences. I don't want to focus about the praise worthy action and beauty of it, what I like and respect most about the movie is its emotional aspect and character development. The heroine, Feriosa, is first shown as a highly respected and great leader in Immortan Joe's empire. The action starts from the get-go as the audience is not sure if Feriosa is actually the hero, but because of the great story telling, we find that she is taking Joe's enslaved mistresses to a far away green piece of land. Max, becomes part of the conflict when he is captured and is used as a trophy on the front of a car of one of the Warriors of Joe's army. Nux, who drives the car with Max, wants to recognized by Joe and wants to be a great help to him and become a hero. In his determination, he catches Feriosa first, who everyone is after, and that is where everyone meets each other. As the plot moves on, the audience sees Nux loose confidence and become depressed that he may not redeem himself. Frriosa finds that she has not redeemed herself in that the green land she was to take them, is now a wasteland. As hope fades, Max pulls some kindhearted Ness out of himself, comes up with the plan that will save everyone else for Joe. With no other choice, this diverse group of people come as one and sacrifice for the greater good. Of course they succeed, but not without loss, and as the final is about to happen we see Feriosa being praised as the hero and Max walk against the crowd being humble and a lone wolf. The effort he shows, even though he knows he won't benefit from it, is the type of character that should be seen as a hero. This movie has A quality action, but the character development that Miller shows, takes this movie to the next level. Mad Max Furry Road is a must see."

","Dr. George Miller's Mad Max franchise has been pretty corny since the start. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is about what you would expect. Most of the movie is an excuse for muscular people in weird outfits to go medieval on each other. But I liked Charlize Theron's performance as the renegade soldier freeing the sex slaves. As for the main character, it makes sense that they recast Max; knowing what we now know about Mel Gibson, would anyone want to cast him? <br/><br/>Basically, Max Rockatansky is his usual tough self, and Immortan Joe is the average villain. But this movie belongs to Charlize Theron. If you ask me, they should have made Imperator Furiosa the star. Like Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley in the Alien movies, or any character played by Pam Grier, Furiosa is one s**t-kickin' babe! <br/><br/>Watch the movie for her. Pretty ridiculous otherwise."

","I was blown away by the action scenes when I saw it first time and it grew it up even more in my estimation due its visual poetry on repeat viewings. Director George Miller not only perfected the genre that he created in the late 70s but adds surprising narrative heft dealing with serious themes such as sex slavery in a nuance way besides survival and redemption. I found this movie so well made ( (direction, cinematography, production design, costumes, practical /VFX effects, score,even the acting is extraordinary with not over-the top comic book characters) that I think that it could be one of those rare blockbuster which could get an Oscar nomination as best picture at the end of the year :)<br/><br/>My No 1 film in 2015 so far !"

So you should not be terribly confused if you haven't seen the older ones.<br/><br/>The storyline, while it's the fourth installment in a series, is quite unique and creative. It is also very well thought out and compelling. I like the characters. Just like in the older films, Max is likable and a really cool protagonist. Joe is an awesome villain. I like Nux. He is quite an entertaining antihero. Furiosa is also likable and I actually had feelings for her as well as those other women that Ally Max. I like the chemistry between Max and Furiosa.<br/><br/>I think all the actors and actresses played their roles very respectively. Tom Hardy is surprisingly great as Max. He's not Mel Gibson but he's about as close to another ""Mad Max"" as you're going to get. I liked Nicholas Hoult as Nux as well as Charlize Theron as Furiosa. I also think that Hugh Keays-Byrne did an awesome job as Joe.<br/><br/>***MINOR SPOILER*** I LOVED that guitar guy.<br/><br/>There is not a single thing about this film that I did not like.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought Fury Road was an awesome film and it just might be the best film in the ""Mad Max"" series (besides ""The Road Warrior"").

"vailsy","9","1","12","5 July 2015"," gutsy move with a constantly varying visual frame rate
","I watched Fury Road in 2d, and when I first started watching it I thought something was wrong with the picture, but after five minutes or so it became evident that the selective, perhaps sometimes random, variance in the frame rate from shot to shot was a stylistic choice probably made by George Miller <br/><br/>It was brave because the effect is extremely unsettling (epileptics should probably avoid this), and probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, so the choice could've easily backfired. The viewer is never able to settle into a scene and it keeps the intensity high, the only respite being when they reach the Green Place and the frame rate is normal for a few minutes <br/><br/>Charlize Theron is extremely strong and in my opinion steals the show or at least shares it equally with Hardy who is like a crazed animal through most of the movie.. and as usual Hardy does a fine job doing it. Easily one of the best actors around right now, his vocal delivery is a little bit Bane-like, and his Max is like a Bronson/Bane fusion <br/><br/>My only slight complaint was the soundtrack.. the music is 'diegetic' (Zzzz) and coming from drummers and a guitarist who are part of the War Boys pursuing convoy. It could've been handled better but it does add to the mayhem. Otherwise the sound design is a standard summer blockbuster mass of whooshes and rumbles, and badly needs something like Max's signature V8 Interceptor which would've cut through the noise like a knife<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the original two movies, especially the second one and I still found Fury Road to be an amazing experience. This is 100% an action movie though so do not expect to see a standard story, it's basically one long road chase, even more extreme than Road Warrior<br/><br/>Overall destined to become a cult classic and crying out to be watched a second time at least. Just wish Max's trademark car had been in the movie more, hopefully next time.."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","12","19 June 2015"," 'Mad Max' finds new life in modern blockbuster era
","As hard as I tried, I could not get into George Miller's ""Mad Max"" or ""The Road Warrior."" Although the latter at least proved to be a more developed post-apocalyptic Australia concept with progressive action, it felt like a violent costume party for people who like things with engines. Now, 30 years after ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" Miller takes his franchise out of the shed for a new ride, and my oh my has it aged well.<br/><br/>The cornerstones of the franchise are most certainly there: excessive violence, over-the-top characters and a story more invested in aesthetics than narrative, but the chassis beneath it all this time is rock-solid and effectively compelling.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy takes over the franchise in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" as Max Rockatansky, a lone ranger of sorts haunted by wife and child he failed to protect, and countless others. After being captured by the powder-white War Boys, Max becomes a human blood bag for several War Boys soldiers, who worship Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villain Toecutter in ""Mad Max"" back in 1979), an overlord running his own colony who promises those who serve him to the death a place in Valhalla, the afterlife. <br/><br/>In what is supposed to be a routine gas-run, Immortan Joe's right hand, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) betrays him and veers off the road, making off with Joe's precious wives as her cargo. He authorizes an all-out chase to run her down and retrieve the wives, a journey Max unwillingly becomes part of.<br/><br/>The plot is a straight shot out of a gun, with just enough of a human element and a couple of complicated heroes to root for, something the previous ""Mad Max"" films were sorely lacking. The context and character development is still minimal, but Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris use some creative substitutes, such as Max's hallucinations of his past, that provide just enough depth to garner the audience's investment.<br/><br/>Yet the calling card of ""Mad Max"" and ""Fury Road"" is the action and the post-apocalyptic trappings. In an era overripe with computer-generated effects, the stunt-driven visuals of ""Fury Road"" offer something original, in a sense. Miller has always been one of the greats at practical effects and with a little bit of help from modern CGI, he blends the two in a way the feels more real and more explosive.<br/><br/>The imaginative nature of the series also appears to have taken leaps forward. Even in the more ridiculously campy creative choices, such as a the faceless electric guitar player strapped to one of the trucks who gets an unusual amount of screen time, there's a certain ""cool"" factor that before just seemed grotesque and frilly. This could simply be that the ""Mad Max"" look stands the test of time well, that nothing has compared to it in the last 30 years, or it could be that we just don't get ballsy creativity like this in the blockbuster landscape these days.<br/><br/>The ""Mad Max"" films have never necessitated great talent, but Hardy, Theron and Nicholas Hoult as a fanatical War Boy named Knux definitely add something to the film. They aren't asked to do much in the script, but strong choices in facial expressions can tell a story just as well and it's enough to make ""Fury Road"" more of a high-stakes grind than a frivolous chain of vehicular stunts.<br/><br/>And for this movie fan, who for years never understood why this franchise held any degree of acclaim, ""Fury Road"" shows Miller for a true auteur whose twisted little apocalyptic lovechild will likely have a life on screen that surpasses his own.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

If you're in the mood for Mad Max, you sit up straight to better get your face rocked. <br/><br/>The actors all hold their weight but the true scene-stealers are the costume and set designers.

This movie will give similar thrill.... but difference is, it's on wheels!!! :) . 5) The Rockband on a war bus is awesome!! Because, it also depicts the character of the villain.

"bryank-04844","10","1","13","27 July 2015"," 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the ultimate summer movie, and I don't see that changing any time soon.
","It's a damn shame that every action movie can't be as good as 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. So many action films will try, but will ultimately fail for a variety of reasons. Pure action filmmaking and movies just don't get better than this movie. 'Fury Road' is a troubled story to say the least. Original creator George Miller who made the original three 'Mad Max' films had the idea for this fourth installment back in 1998. That's 17-years ago. This project wasn't necessarily put on a hold shelf, but a few things had happened to delay the film from being made. From 9-11 to foreign policy, to Mel Gibson's infamous arrest, there were a variety of things that prevented this movie from seeing the light of day.<br/><br/>Years went by and George Miller went on to make 'Happy Feet', which is a far world away from the likes of these 'Mad Max' films. However, the script showed up again and some rewrites happened, and Miller got all excited again, hence this new film. At first, Miller wanted Gibson back in the iconic role, but both he and Miller decided to revamp the series and go with a different cast and angle. That pretty much brings us to 'Fury Road', starring Tom Hardy as Mad Max. Make no mistake about it, this film is epic in every way and I don't say that lightly.<br/><br/>It's a rare occasion where I get overly excited for a movie and have the highest form of expectations, when after viewing said film, it meets and exceeds all these expectations. That's the case with 'Fury Road'. Not only did George Miller build on this post-apocalyptic universe, he also made one of the best action films I've literally ever seen, with mostly using practical effects and not CG. There is really zero down time in this film. From start to finish, something big is happening on screen, which doesn't allow you necessarily to get one breath in, let alone blink your eyes.<br/><br/>What I like about this film, is while it's a remake, it doesn't need to spend any time with a backstory for Mad Max. Miller knew that almost all of us would know the general gist of the story going into it, hence we are thrown in straight to the action from scene one. Max (Tom Hardy) escapes the grasp of an evil monster of a leader named King Immortan Joe, who enslaves the poor people below him and keeps all the precious and rare water for himself. Max crosses paths with Furiosa (a badass Charlize Theron), who is taking five women who were impregnated by King Joe to a better place to live.<br/><br/>King Joe doesn't like this one bit, so he takes his insane minions, and all of their weaponized vehicles, along with a few other war lord gangs, and chases after Max and these women. These car chase sequences and fight scenes are legendary. Each and every one of the 150 stunt men and women earn their pay check the more with the chaotic stunts that are shown here. Plus, Max more or less takes a back seat here, where Furiosa and the other women show that they can handle themselves in any situation, however, Mad Max for sure earns that name here.<br/><br/>This is the purest form of action, which each character and story told through very little dialogue, but somehow through the intense battle sequences and their facial expressions, you bond with them. Nicholas Hoult plays one of the minions named Nux, and he's unreal in this role. I can't believe the little kid from 'About a Boy' turned into this amazing character. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' really has it all in the form of action, explosions, gun battles, chainsaws, and vehicle chases.<br/><br/>There is so much happening on screen, that you'll have to go back for a second time to catch it all. I just wish that other filmmakers who were making an action movie would take notes here and follow suit, because this is exactly how to make a movie. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the ultimate summer movie, and I don't see that changing any time soon."

","Having read so many high praise reviews, I was naturally hyped going in to Mad Max: Fury Road. After all, its predecessors are great- genre-defining films. And after all the rave this film was getting, I set my hopes ridiculously high. <br/><br/>Now, normally, in doing so, I'd walk out of the theater with my hopes tamed and lowered. Not so with this film.<br/><br/>This film not only met my high expectations, it blew them out of the water. Every detail of this film is diamond-cut to absolute perfection. <br/><br/>Probably what stunned me the most about this film is how real it all seemed. Not a bit of it felt unrealistic - the usual, ""oh, that could never happen"". This movie has an exceedingly refreshing ""real"" feel to it. So often, in big-budget action blockbusters, you see CGI-mania, effects so obviously animated that they ruin the effect of the film. This movie remains real - real stuntmen, real explosions, real people doing real action.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are top-notch - Oscar-caliber, I'd say. Tom Hardy serves his purpose wonderfully as Max, although at times he becomes a costar in his own movie (but it's all for the good of the movie). Nicholas Hoult also delivers a uniquely memorable performance as Nux, a crazy follower of the villain, Immortan Joe, who ends up fighting alongside Max. The real star here is Charlize Theron, who outshines everyone and everything as Imperator Furiosa, a freedom fighter in Immortan Joe's own ranks. Theron absolutely lights up the screen with permeable emotion, stunning subtextual depth, and real action. She has become one of the all-time female action heroes, alongside the likes of Sarah Connor. Every moment of her performance is, once again, visceral and real.<br/><br/>This film makes an interesting feminist story. The story revolves around the liberation of Immortan Joe's ""breeders"", or basically baby-making sex slaves. With the aid of Furiosa, they make a daring escape alongside Max, and together, they make their way across the barren wastelands in search of the Green Place - a land where it's green and there is hope and redemption. Rare is it in Hollywood to see so much of an agenda shoved down an audience's throat and yet it remains completely acceptable and not preachy. Feminism has never shone brighter on film than this film. Men and women, fighting together on equal footing for women's rights - it was a joy to see.<br/><br/>There are only a few other things to be said. The cinematography is beautiful - the action sequences are beautifully filmed, not only showing everything in beautifully choreographed detail, but the camera knows when to look on and when to tastefully look away.<br/><br/>The music is very apropos to the frenetic situations, crazy and upbeat during the action and heart-wrenching and moving during the times of sadness, tenderness, beauty. <br/><br/>Absolutely fantastic reboot of a classic franchise. 10/10 - would recommend."
"tone_lord","10","1","15","19 June 2015"," A Masterpiece
","Possibly the best action movie I've ever seen, it will also likely be the best movie I see all year. Why is this film so good: 1. Nonstop action with an off-the-charts WOW factor, mostly based on real world practical effects, which are always more convincing than CGI. 2. Characters who are genuinely sympathetic no matter how strange they seem at first. 3. A well-thought out, intricately detailed and consistent world which is certainly no real world that could exist, but is a perfect embodiment of the mythic Mad Max universe. 4. Technical perfection. This is one of the most beautifully and expertly made films I have seen in a long time. Brilliant photography, design, editing, costumes, makeup, pacing, acting, etc., etc. A final word: if you haven't seen it yet, do so. You will not be disappointed (in spite of any expectations created by my gushing review)."
"michma321","9","1","15","17 June 2015"," Brutal, barbaric, beautiful
","Not just the best Mad Max movie. The best action film. Ever.<br/><br/>The two main characters are played extremely well for how little dialog is in the movie. Charlize Therone had the acting chops worthy of the franchise. I was a little concerned about a Max not played by Mel Gibson, being a huge fan of Road Warrior, but by the 2nd watch I was used to it. Tom Hardy is a different, less human Max, but still both a sympathetic and bad ass character.<br/><br/>The villains were the best, most complex characters in the franchise yet, with a sufficiently deep and broad back story as well as even some tangible humanity in them. Sure they were still villains and ultimately bad dudes, but in several scenes their mostly hidden redeeming qualities are revealed. They weren't all scumbags like most of the villains in the previous movies.<br/><br/>The photography is crisp and vibrant for a film that moves so fast. But the action isn't the jerky, hard-to-take-in, hand-held camera junk. You can satisfactorily absorb the entire movie blow by blow.<br/><br/>The costumes are right on. Outrageous without being over the top. Lots of possibilities for Halloween.<br/><br/>The best part... The score and soundtrack of this movie really bring out the beauty in the fury, and the chaos in the carnage. Between that and the emotion in the characters, especially the villains, this movie stands above the other 3, even Road Warrior, which was one of my favorites for decades.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because there are still some things I would tweak."
"moggzmail","10","1","15","5 June 2015"," Surpassed expectations
","As a huge fan of the original Mad Max films (1 & 2), I'd always wanted another Mad Max that was like The Road Warrior on steroids.<br/><br/>Miller has returned to make a chase movie that's like The Road Warrior on steroids, and it's actually so much better than what I'd imagined it could be, I even think it may have replaced The Road Warrior as my favourite MM movie.<br/><br/>It doesn't really feel possible that a Hollywood movie of this kind could ever really exist. It defies the very conventions of the studios that churn out the same old stories. Because Miller. And because Mad Max is a style of story that is not often re-told (Although Django touches on similar themes).<br/><br/>This is a brilliant re-invention of the road warrior chase turned into a whole film and with a load more warring factions involved. This far surpassed what I ever expected from a new MM sequel. Intensely grueling action and live stunts from start to finish and just enough dialogue and enough depth to the few words, combined with clever storytelling, to create meaningful and believable characters.<br/><br/>Even the cars (which are the most OTT and gritty of any MM film), despite being real trucks and not having smiley faces on the grills, have a huge amount of character and development in this film.<br/><br/>While it's primary visual focus is on destructive car fetishism, it's underlying themes are liberation, emancipation, redemption, anarchism and empowerment. It's a brilliant film with a brutal retro style that I never thought I would see in modern big-budget cinema."

","I think this film is really overrated. Firstly, the plot is very simple, it doesn't have any specific moments or something like that. Secondly, the cast is great, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are the brilliants of film. But! The film is called ""Mad Max"", but Max in this film is supporting character, the main one is Furiosa. Thirdly, the action is wonderful, it was very difficult to make it because they almost used only real action (without computer technology).
So, it's good road-movie without good plot."

","The title Mad Max is a bit of a misnomer really. It should be called Completely Demented Max, because it really really is, and it's fantastic! A blind mutant guitarist with a flame throwing electric guitar. Hundreds of white-painted berserkers cruising down the road like mime artists on acid. Grandmas with shotguns. All this and more completely ludicrous delights can be found in this crazy slaughterhouse of a movie (NOT a film!). Anyway, the basic plot revolves around Imperator Furiosa, played so damn well by Charlize Theron it should be called Furiosa:Fury Road, stealing some of a warlord's wives (this being the apocalypse, there aren't many fertile women left in society), picking up one of the warlord's deserters, Nux (Nicholas Hoult) and the titular drifter Max (Tom Hardy) along the way. The warlord, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keats-Byrne, eating the scenery) isn't too happy about this and sends a massive fleet of customised vehicles (Monster trucks, quad bikes and War rigs, oh my!) to kill them to death. I love lots of other factors than the Carmaggedon, such as the fact that Furiosa has a disability (she has a prosthetic arm) and no one talks about it,Tom Hardy's gloriously growly performance as Max and the music and sound design, but the huge car chases are the cherry on the top of the spiky, flaming cake. Just don't watch it on a car journey; you might get an urge to crucify one of your family on the front of the car and drive it into a sandstorm."

"Dello_","8","0","3","21 January 2020"," Fantastic action, but maybe a little too much
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a great action movie with a spectacular technical department. Indeed George Miller was fantastic because all the scenes are clear and thrilling, and some of them are very memorable. The score is also inspired: frenetic and tense and it surely enriches all the action. But the most impressive thing is that almost every choreography is realised through practical stunts and this is particularly important because the movie has a a grounded and ""realistic"" taste because of this practical stunts and in doing so it raises the level of the tension the viewer can feel. And finally I liked all the performances and the characterisation of the main characters. I found pretty solid the idea to give Max a little backstory so he can be perceived as mysterious and intriguing and I found him very cool.
The only problem for me is that there is toooo much action. Clearly I want to see action if I watch ""Mad Max"" but I would have preferred a little more time spent on characters's interactions instead of almost 110 minutes straight of car chasing. And this was a problem for me because I found myself bored when these scenes were longer than 25-30 minutes. And probably it is only a problem of mine because maybe I can take only a few action at a time but sometimes I was bored and I can't hide this aspect.
In general ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a more than suggested movie, very frenetic and with a fast pacing, great visuals and music, that can be boring in some parts but it's not a very big deal: if you are searching for adrenaline in a movie this is a great choice!"

","Mad Max: Fury Road is an overload of an overload of extravagant action set pieces, metal soundtrack, and post-apocalyptic setting. It relishes in all its glorious action, but isn't enough to carry the film on an emotional level.<br/><br/>Driven by characters who battles for survival in a barren and water-less world, Fury Road touches upon themes of loss, higher purpose, tyranny and, surprisingly, feminist message. Tom Hardy, playing the titular character, is haunted by the loss of someone who constantly appears in his imagination. Driven by guilt and or sadness, he seeks survival as the tyrannical, cult regime of Immortan Joe forces the people around him to beg for water. Charlize Theron stars as Furiosa, the leader of an escaped group of females who seek the Green Place. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux, a fanatic member of Immortan Joe who would die willingly for his cause. The characters are driven by their respective motives, each being revealed as the film progresses. However, there is too much action for the drama and character interactions to settle and majority of the best emotional moments are placed near the end leaving the rest of the film lacking much in substance.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

"Cinemagoer77","10","0","4","27 July 2019"," Miller's Magnum Opus
","My world is fire and blood. George Miller went full maestro mode. This is one of of those films that Miller was probably dreaming about for 40 years. This is a film in which his visionary concept is fully realized. He interweaves high octane action scenes throughout an unforgiving aussie post-apocalyptic world and it never comes off as unneeded or over done which is something the fast and furious franchise suffers from.
Some of the vehicles are battle armored v-8's that resemble metal beasts of hell. Some of the older films I am sure suffered from budget constraints and you won't see many vehicles lacking here.
Even though the movie is a big chase scene filled with Miller's stylized action the movie never loses it's humanity or soul. ""Out here, everything hurts."" These aren't shallow protagonists. Max suffers from ptsd. Furiosa isn't just an escapee. Everyone has suffered except the psychopaths. The reasons and motives make sense in that mad world.
I still respect Mel as Mad Max and I also see Hardy as Mad Max. Can you imagine someone else playing Rocky or Conan the barbarian maybe? Rocky no, Conan yes for me. Replacing actors is not an easy feat to pull off and coming from a super mad max fan, they pull it off right away.
The dialogue is minimal but catchy and appropriate to the scene. ""Say bye bye to the neck!"" Instead of ""you're dead meat"", is fun and memorable. You will never hear the word mediocre the same again. The manner in which the main villain labeling something mediocre to boys is hilarious. What a bully.
There is directorial genius to George Miller's mad world that can't be seen in any other action films and it isn't for everyone. It is an action masterpiece."

","It's very hard to review a picture that has already been regarded as a classic (and ""Best action movie of all time!"") but here goes. 'Mad Max 2' was a damn hard film to recreate and the look and feel of 'Fury Road' comes very close; with jaw-dropping stunt work and some stunning battle sequences. Just like 'The Road Warrior' (the perfect movie), it's mad folk being run-over at 120 mph, which is a standard, brilliant feature of any George Miller movie. Where it fails is that the whole film is one long chase sequence and you wonder why they are bothering to risk life and limb in doing so. For halfway through the movie the character Max has little involvement and even spends most of the second half strapped to the front of a car. The narration is told throughout the endless chase but it's unsatisfactory. As the time expects, the main character is a female, so it's more of a case of 'Mad Maxine'. You think it would have been simple to have just cut half the chasing away, developed the new Tom Hardy version of Max, to a younger audience, so they know what he's about (his history) and just crank up the violence! You really miss the colourful characters developed in 'Mad Max 2', and most of all the hilarious helicopter pilot. You had such empathy for their fate and rooted for Mel Gibson all the way. 'Fury Road', just might be the most spectacular of them all but it's perfectly flawed."

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) is a glorious film that puts you in a world that is far out of society and gives us the most insane effects and moments that shock you and make you pumped at the same time. However, it is still a flawed film, here's why. There were unexplained aspects like the people in the swamp area or the flashbacks Max had. It's more or less open to interpretation for the viewer. I at least see the flashbacks as the people Max let down and the swamp people are...just weird. I honestly never figured out what they were. The story was also simple. Thanks to Nostalgia Critic on Channel Awesome, I figured out that the story was only a chase. If you look at the film the theme is there, and it can be either seen as genius or potentially lazy. I find it to be something with good intentions but kinda of a weird outcome. However, a lot of the aspects and characters in these story make this movie worth it to watch. 9/10."

The casting and acting are incredible especially by Charlize Theron as the first truly human female superhero and Tom Hardy as Max but a much more real human max in a sense but a war torn survivor who is not the hero of the story but still an important piece to the story.

It's good in any way that I can think of. The only thing that doesn't quite keep the good job is that the plot is more around Furiosa than it is on Max, but hey I can't lower my rating because of that.

","It may sound strange, but that's probably why this movie stands out as watchable compared to every other hollywood product in recent years. you see, americans have these rules how you're supposed to write stories, what they have to include, and how characters need to be built. I'm seeing it all the time on pinterest, ""steps to include in your story"". what? no! you can't write like that. well, obviously you can, but if you think that there are mandatory steps for a story, you can then also write a bot to spew up stories for you.. and it feels like hollywood is doing just that. they press a button ""sci-fi"" and machine prints out a sci fi script. 
it is well established fact that hollywood never wanted to be paying it's writers, and now they have replaced them with robots. they don't have to pay at all.
since this movie didn't have a script, it's actually good, compared to everything else. it works, it's raw, you believe the characters, they feel more natural than almost all other recent characters.
I guess my point is, if you can't produce a script that makes you stunned or if you can't produce a movie with no script at all, probably don't make a movie..."

Halfway through I just accepted the film for what it was and let it continue to take me on a nail biting crazy ride.<br/><br/>This film takes the previous Mad Max films and cranks it up to 11. Importantly though I feel that Miller didn't just do this to get bums on seats, he did it because this is the natural progression for the series. This is what happens when people have lived without civilization for so long.<br/><br/>I'd love to see where the franchise takes us next.

On the 13th time watching it ,this film is truly a huge masterpiece. Everyone call other movies such as Aliens or Terminator 2 as the greatest action movies including Die Hard from 1988. I defiently agree with them but Mad Max Fury Road is the greatest action movie ever made.
From the first shot until the end ,this movie is just an incredibly powerful chase which never stops for a moment but it really has deep story and thought-provoking themes.

","While I wasn't overwhelmed with this movie as a whole, there is no denying that the action sequences were over-the-top in the best way possible. Costuming and design was brilliant along with some outstanding stunts and effects. I enjoyed the action and thought that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron contributed all they could. It's an action movie and that's about it.<br/><br/>I guess I expected a little more substance being a fanboy of the prior films. In fact, I think Thunderdome is still my favorite for the amount of humanism in it. Maybe that's the point I missed, that people are pretty much gone. Humanity is a relic of the old world. But it's more than that. It seems like this script is more what you'd expect from Hollywood - the villains don't get to be human anymore, they're too busy being archetypal bad guys, only the heroes get the opportunity for redemption. I don't like black and white characters and everyone felt pretty flat.<br/><br/>The visions that Max had were just odd to me too. They seemed way out of character for him. I know he's a tortured soul, but I felt like we were missing something. He's always been the reluctant hero that ends up saving everyone but himself. I've always hoped Max would maybe stumble across Never Never Land one day and find a new way, but this is just a reboot, not a continuation. Too bad."

","Shell-shocked former cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy in peak rugged form) and tough warrior Imperator Furiosa (a fabulously fierce portrayal by Charlize Theron) join forces to protect a group of fertile women from the vile clutches of evil warlord Immortan Joe (robustly played to the monstrous hilt by Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his vicious minions.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer George Miller keeps the lively and wildly entertaining story hurtling along at a relentless slam-bang pace, stages the thrilling action set pieces with rip-roaring brio, and brings a staggering sense of epic scope and crazy go-for-broke creativity to the infectiously over-the-top proceedings. Better still, Miller's tightly streamlined narrative pares everything down to the exciting bare essentials which in turn ensures that there isn't a single wasted frame or dull moment throughout. This movie earns extra points for its strong feminist stance in which a bunch of women who have been relegated to the status of property whose sole useful functions are either for reproduction or providing milk take a defiant stance against an oppressive patriarchy.<br/><br/>Moreover, Max's struggle to regain his humanity and the redemptive character arc of the misguided Nux (a sturdy performance by Nicholas Hoult) give this picture extra depth and poignancy. This movie further benefits from a colorful array of outrageously nasty villains: Nathan Jones as dim-witted brute Rictus Erectus, Josh Helman as deranged War Boy follower Slit, John Howard as the grotesquely obese the People Eater, and Richard Carter as unhinged religious fanatic the Bullet Farmer. Kudos are also in order for John Seale's breathtaking widescreen cinematography and Junkie XL's dynamic pulsating score. An incredibly ferocious explosion of a film."

","Now, I can't really claim to be much fan of the original ""Mad Max"" movies with Mel Gibson, so I didn't really have much of any expectations to this 2015 movie, and I actually waited all the way until towards the end of 2016 before sitting down to watch it.<br/><br/>And now that I have seen it, I must say that I am impressed. This certainly was a visually impressive movie, and there were a lot of really nice details to the costumes, vehicles, characters and settings. And that really worked out well in favor of the movie.<br/><br/>However, the storyline in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was flaccid and so simplistic that it was almost insulting. The storyline here was almost non-existing, and it contributed nothing to the movie in any sense. And it was in fact the more than impressive visual effects that salvaged the movie and made it enjoyable.<br/><br/>I am not much of a fan of Tom Hardy, but this movie was actually was one of his better. Personally, it was because he had very little dialogue in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", and that worked very well with me.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, then there were a lot of details every where, and even on the characters. And here I must say that they created a lot of memorable and outstanding characters here; characters which stand out and carry the movie quite a long way.<br/><br/>""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is the type of movie that you just simply disengage your brain, then lean back way into the seat and just enjoy the thrill ride. The movie challenges the audience in no way or manner, as there are no surprises, no plot twists, no nothing. It is essentially just one long extended car chase scene. But hey, it was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. And I will actually say that the effects and visuals were so amazing that they more than make the movie watchable more than just a single time.<br/><br/>I am rating this movie seven out of ten stars, solely because of the visual effects. I was more than blown away by what I witnessed on the screen, and as such, then the lack of a proper storyline faded to the background as you were carried away on a continuous assault of special effects."

"manuelwinchester","8","0","6","7 November 2016"," The greatness of an action monologue
","The sequel to George Miller's trilogy is finally done. The new Mad Max film is here to prove that Miller is still one of the best directors worldwide. The plot is not something innovative or pioneering, but the scenery is enough to impress even the most skeptical. In a vast desert full of sand, George Miller sets his post-apocalyptic scenery which is about a rebellion against a tyrant, Immortan Joe. Actually, Miller set a motor orchestra, a war of vehicles on the humongous desert. Each action scene is a work of masterpiece. The details of direction are flawless, giving the impression that we've never seen something similar. Maybe we are accustomed to special effects and blockbusters, but here the level is definitely up. The action is exponential, in a point that Miller should have given some action-breaks to relieve the audience. But this is the main characteristic of Mad Max: it doesn't let us take our eyes away, not because we'll lose plot's continuity because the action scenes are delightful. I think George Miller had conceived his film as an action monologue. Well, in order to do this, Miller has sacrificed all his characters. It's a fact that he doesn't give a complete portrait of his characters, only some specific elements. For example, we never learn who is Max (Tom Hardy), the complete story of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and many other clues, such as how the world ended. I think that's the one and only film's drawback. It would be much better if we knew more things about the characters' s background. There are also many other elements to bear that Mad Max is magnificent, as the six Oscars winning. The sound, the makeup, the costumes and generally the way the film is produced, indicate the overall great work. As for the interpretations, we didn't expect less from Tom Hardy, who is possibly the hottest name in Hollywood at the moment and Charlize Theron proves one more time that she can play in such movies any given day. Mad Max: Fury Road is extraordinary. A few words need to describe this film. If someone is looking for something deep and profound, then this is not what he/she should see. Mad Max: Fury Road is full of action from first to last and due to this is considered a great film."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is the sort of fascinatingly original movie-going experience that one almost never sees from an existing franchise. And when it comes to ""part 4s"" in the history of all of cinema, I can't think of one I've ever liked more. George Miller, who directed the series' other three entries, is back to do the job again here almost 30 years after the last one, and he proves to be cinematically as sharp as ever. The fine accomplishments of actors and all the technical people notwithstanding, this is a director's film more than anything, with a sweeping vision of a post-apocalyptic world that, however crazy it gets, sells itself all the way through. You don't question what you see—you feel you are there.<br/><br/>It stars Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, and Tom Hardy as Mad Max—that's in order of importance. Max is a good character, the continued tortured soul trying survive, and yet finding the humanity in himself; but with all respect Furiosa is the real soul of this movie, the best performance (I'd put it Theron's best character since her Oscar winning turn in ""Monster"") a woman strong, cunning and skilled, yet also at points vulnerable, as she leads a troop of wives away from their powerful, malicious husband who chases them basically from one end of the movie to the other. Max gets caught up with them along the way, in an interesting evolving relation towards Furiosa and the wives. These wives, five of them, don't get a lot of lines, but the qualities they bring in something different from both Max and Furiosa is important to the film's success. Vital too are the host of villains, who come in such variety of interesting dark flavors, from the head evil master, down the hierarchy of his lower-ranked cohorts, to the followers convinced of the glory of self-sacrifice for their leader.<br/><br/>This movie is marvelously thick with post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It is also thrilling, and so varied with every action or chase sequence that rolls brilliantly off of the previous one. There are moments of slowdown, so to speak, where there is verbal interaction more than a couple words at a time, but as far as character building there's as much during the action as in the less hectic times. This is a constantly surprising, original film, frequently exciting, sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and absolutely never for any minute stretch uninteresting. The technical expertise to create such wild, high-flying (figuratively and literally) things as are shown here is just mind-boggling, but creativity is where it really excels. It's one captivating experience, not quite like anything else that's been made before. It must be seen."

","A Review for ""MAD MAX: FURY ROAD ""<br/><br/>Post-apocalyptic wastelands entice the general population of human for the simple reason that those worlds are being more and more imaginable by the day.<br/><br/>Capitalizing on this macabre tendency of mankind, Australian film maker George Miller in his movie Mad Max: Fury Road, has shown a skeleton of a ruined civilization that is subsisting on scarce resources and brutal dictatorships. Under a flashy veneer of action-packed scenes and special effects, Miller has touched upon environmental and social issues that plague our society at the present moment. While the general premise of the movie is consistent with the previous movies in the franchisee, the very fact that Miller introduces strong female characters and fosters feminism is a welcome change.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Max, wandering around in a desert, and who is finally captured to become a blood bad for a warrior called Nux. The villain has a stock of 'breeders' who are supposed to be his wives and bear his children. Most of his children turn out deformed and thus he is always trying for more. We awaits us is an show of patriarchal society suffering from a huge water crises.Some pieces were missing in the jig saw of story line. Movie was mainly bases on action which is delivered at par with the expectations<br/><br/>In this bleak landscape, comes Inperator Furiosa, who helps the wives to escape and goes with them in search of 'The Green Place of Many Mothers'. Max gets caught up in the whirlwind and what ensues will make you think deeply about issues such as environmental crisis and feminism. At one point in the movie we see one wife ensuring another by saying ""We are people, not things!"". We see Nux, the war-boy, crack under the expectations placed on him. We see an entire population of human beings suffer because of the greed of a few people. We also see a flaming guitar in an army.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant movie in its layering and one can take a lot out of it if one thinks about it. Movie is a must watch for action lovers however expecting a lot sense out of the story would be an injustice. Don't let the flaming guitar distract you from the real issues of the film."

","Few rare films are simply not interested in impressing everyone unanimously since they neither have any interesting storyline nor any intense show of loving relationship between its key characters. These are the films specifically targeting the viewers who love watching high paced actions sequences coming one after another in an unstoppable mode making you feel the adrenaline rush providing many electrifying entertaining moments in those two hours. And further can also be compared to an unbelievable roller coaster ride that refuses to stop once it starts pressing the accelerator with a promise to make you scream and yell like hell.<br/><br/>So if you are one amongst those who are eager enough to witness this astonishing show of exceptional (or rather impossible) kind of stunts, extremely difficult yet superlative cinematography and breath-taking execution on screen by hundreds of performers together in the location of a hot desert, then just buy a ticket and fasten your seatbelts to have one of the best action-oriented, cinematic rides you might have enjoyed so far.<br/><br/>Coming after a few decades of its original Mad Max trilogy, this latest venture surpasses them all with many unreal firsts showcasing an incredible quality-chaos featuring brilliant performances (superbly led by Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron), long car chases, amazing bikers, giant trucks, big explosions and jaw-dropping mad action that forcibly gives you the thought that ""How the hell they could do all this and then capture it on camera too so brilliantly?"" Made on an admittedly weak plot of a group of girls being rescued, the film also focuses on the strong women power displayed by its female protagonist. But what actually lifts the movie beautifully along with its action are its meaningful, life teaching one liners included in its short but powerful dialogues. <br/><br/>For instance, ""What are you doing?"" ""Praying!"" ""To who?"" ""Anyone who's listening!!!!"" OR ""You know......HOPE is a ...... Mistake."" ""If you cannot fix what's broken, you will go insane""<br/><br/>Moreover the skillfully composed background score successfully brings you on to the edge of your seats, especially with the 'already famous' rock-star on the truck playing his explosive guitar along with the people hitting the huge drums at the back. Plus this is one of those few movies that remain bright throughout (due to the chosen locations) and never becomes a pain watching in 3D due to its fascinating sequences both shot & performed extremely well.<br/><br/>Having said that MAD MAX: Fury Road also might not be the film for the ones not much interested in such pulsating action or a loud, brutal fight for survival shot unbelievably with its own limitations of concept and storyline. But if you really wish to experience many highly charged, thrilling moments in the theatre like never before then do opt for the film, especially on the bigger screen to respect & honour the amazingly mind-boggling achievement made by its entire team.<br/><br/>In short, it can also be referred as one of those remarkably conceived, eye-opener films that actually make you realize the huge amount of backstage preparations, hard-work, time, energy and resources required to shoot such a challenging film on location. So do watch it at a must to take your own lessons of film-making from the masters on work both on and off the screen so majestically."

Not many movies can do this nowadays and still keep you entertained. There was so much going on that it felt like a thrill ride. The scenes were put together so well that I felt like I was there. There were also so many epic scenes that brought this together and the characters within the movie were astonishing.

","It was with some trepidation that I watched this film. Too many times I have watched films that claim to be reboots but are poorly conceived, imagined or simply bear more than a striking resemblance to the original(s).<br/><br/>In my opinion this isn't one of them. The most notable cast are Theron and Hardy and they are both excellent. There are nods to Max's past, but the film is also well filmed and finished product could easily have been the third part of the trilogy I wished we'd had instead of Thunderdome.<br/><br/>The film is bleak as you'd expect, but some of the slightly sped up scenes such as Max trying to remove his mask all took me back to the earlier two films. There is humour here as well and that is always welcome in a film with a lot of violence. That they have chosen to use sparse special effects and rely and real-life action is a credit to the production. The FX here are used to enhance small aspects of the film but in no way dominate it.<br/><br/>I liked the first two films a lot, almost because it didn't look slick and filmed to death.

","Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 action movie directed by George Miller, the mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise. In short, Mad Max: FR is a high octane, no holds barred action flick with epic set pieces and fast cars. In long, Mad Max: FR is another look into the now legendary Max Rockantansky's insane world and his struggle to live, fight and survive in it. The originals were often considered some of the greatest action movies ever made and Mad Max: FR shines and blows our mind once again. From the devastated nuclear landscape to the high speed, high adrenaline fuelled road war and to the surprisingly vast amount of both character development and emotion, ranks this once again as one of the all time greats. The movie never lets up right from the get go, huge Michael Bay style explosions, brutal, gritty fight scenes and giant chases. Tom Hardy fills the shoes of the legendary Max, a role he portrays with great depth, his quiet, stern and seemingly mysterious portrayal certainly make him one to rival Gibson as well as a fantastic supporting cast with equally insanely 'mad' characters played by Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays- Byrne as the terrifying and power hungry villain, Immortan Joe. My only flaws with the film is a slight feeling of repetitiveness and slightly unsatisfactory villain confrontation in the third act of the film, also a very unmemorable soundtrack with no real scores featured to accompany the mayhem. Overall however, Mad Max is a fast, furious, adrenaline fuelled thrill ride filled with beautifully shot action sequences, accompanied with intriguing and exciting characters in a phenomenal action adventure. 9/10"

The historically violent series, which includes Mad Max, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, picks up Max's legacy with faster cars, crazier villains and a bigger budget.<br/><br/>This time around, Max finds himself taken prisoner by a band of engine worshiping raiders known as the War Boys. They are led by the sadistic Immortal Joe, who hoards water and imprisons young women in order bare his twisted children. When one of his top in command Furiosa (Theron) breaks the women out of captivity, Joe sends all of his forces in pursuit to get them back by any means necessary.<br/><br/>The War Boys are incredibly fun to watch. They cover themselves in a white powder and inhale chrome as they throw their sickly bodies at any obstacle in their way. Immortal Joe is their god and the V8 engine is his roar. Nicholas Holt's Hux shows the War Boys' determination to please Joe as he tries and fails time and time again to recapture Furiosa.<br/><br/>The action is out of this world entertaining. Every single character is beyond belief crazy, the explosions are eye-popping and the chase sequences are incredibly well choreographed.

","Australian writer/director George Miller, who gave us a trilogy of Mad Max dystopian thrillers from 1979 through 1985, is back with his new incarnation: ""Fury Road."" For those who love sci-fi and action blended together, ""Max"" should be your thing. Miller's post-apocalyptic world takes place out in the desert where a group of mutants are lorded over by one Immortan Joe, a king worshiped as a god by his subjects, who sports a mask that resembles a human skull. His warriors look like modern-day skinheads and there's also a grand coterie of Joe's subjects, akin to medieval peasants, Joe controls the water supply at his fortress called ""The Citadel"" and also owns a small harem of sex-slaves he maintains for breeding purposes (these women appear to be the only healthy ones in the realm).<br/><br/>The protagonist is Max Rockatansky, now played by Tom Hardy of Inception fame. Rocktansky is captured by the skinheads and makes a futile attempt to escape from the Citadel early on. The character with the bigger part for a while is Imperator Furiosa played by an enervated Charlize Theron. Furiosa moves things into Act 2 when she kidnaps Joe's concubines and drives in a souped up tanker truck headed for the mythic ""Green Place,"" which supposedly is some kind of aqua-infused paradise. Joe's minions give chase in a crazy assortment of different vehicles, all patched up from parts remaining after the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>We don't hear much from Max since his face is hidden by a steel mask and he's strapped to one of those weird vehicles which is chasing Furiosa. After a series of spectacular chases and crashes, Max finally gets free of his captors (but still must have Furiosa assist him in cutting a chain that binds him to one of the skinheads (Nux) who ironically joins Furiosa and her group after deciding there's great glory working for the rebels than bad guy Joe. <br/><br/>The long continuous chase to capture Furiosa temporarily slows down when the good guys must navigate their way through a canyon controlled by hostile forces. After successfully breaking through the canyon blockade, Furiosa finds an old woman who belongs to the Vuvalini, the clan which Furiosa was kidnapped from as a child. Wouldn't you know it but the old woman makes it clear that the ""Green Place"" is indeed a myth so what are the good guys to do?<br/><br/>The plan is to finish off Joe's forces on the way back to the Citadel (which they successfully accomplish) and then kill the king and gain control of the water supply, much to the peasantry's delight. This of course allows Mr. Miller to stage another big chase scene, just as spectacular as the one in the first half.<br/><br/>That's basically it. ""Fury Road"" is nothing more than one big chase scene after another. After a while, the whole thing just gets a little tiresome. One can admire the production design and how the chase scenes are choreographed—but the script is so paper thin, that the best rating I can muster here is 5 out of 10. Sorry!"
"seancram","8","0","4","7 January 2016"," One of the best action movies in recent memory
","Every day is a fight to survive in a harsh and unforgiving post-apocalyptic landscape. In Citadel, one of the few cities still standing, a ruthless overlord maintains an iron grip over every resource and human being. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of his top soldiers, steals his ""wives"" and flees, all hell breaks loose. She crosses paths with Max (Tom Hardy), a man haunted by past failures who's reduced to a single instinct: survival. Together, they just might be able to restore order to the world. Mad Max: Fury Road is a reboot of the franchise from the late 70s/early 80s, but knowledge of the original films isn't necessary. The best way to describe the world of Mad Max to the uninitiated is as follows: engines roaring, guns blazing, people jumping from vehicle-to-vehicle, sandstorms; in short, complete insanity.<br/><br/>From Citadel, to the desert, to the action sequences, everything about Fury Road is massive and well-crafted. Most modern directors choose to make huge action films like this with copious amounts of CGI for the sake of ease. George Miller (director of the original Mad Max trilogy) went to painstaking lengths to ensure the film's authenticity, and it makes a world of difference. The stunts were real, there's very little CGI, and the props were fully functional, even a flame throwing guitar hooked up to a truck full of amps (a type of post-apocalyptic war trumpet, if you will). The high-octane action sequences, which take up a large portion of the film, are awe-inspiring, gritty, and imaginative. However, they are precise enough where they never feel like they are too over-the-top or overstay their welcome.<br/><br/>Because the focus of the film is on the action, there isn't as much room for story or character development. Max and Furiosa's pasts and motivations are compelling, but most of their time is spent kicking ass (not necessarily a bad thing). The world that Fury Road is set in is full of fascinating details concerning how humanity continues to survive in such a harsh and unforgiving world, which makes up for the fact that the plot isn't as unique as it could be.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action movies in recent memory. 8/10"

","Saw Mad Max: Fury Road as soon as it hit theaters in my country. Being quite honest, I had not seen ANY of the previous movies so I was totally out of context. That being said, I entered the theater with very specific expectations, or, should I say, with a ""standard"" movie in mind -- dialogue, characters to root for, back story... Instead, I witnessed a bunch of explosions and, pretty much, what seemed to be a video game mission; go to to point A to point B, then head back to the starting point. As a matter of fact, even some of my friends left the movie when it was approaching its middle -- I suppose they also had something way different in mind. The lack of straight exposition and fluid dialogue might have discouraged them. Can't really blame them, most likely they were truly expecting your typical action movie with one liners, clichés and predictable plot points. Not even the stunts kept them interested. Now... That was the first time. <br/><br/>I did notice that the movie kept getting quite positive reviews so I took my time to watch it alone, in BluRay, in my living room... and boy did I have a blast! As I watched the scenes, each line of dialogue seems right, short but effective. The images were eloquent, the events taking place were always building up to the plot that, however simple, offers an original story. Even the very start of the movie tells you a little bit of Max's background: he used to be a cop, and the subtle but constant flashbacks (they hit you and him in the right moment as part of his motivation), help the viewer fill the blanks and construct the world this adventure takes place in. Furiosa's another remarkable addition. She's so determined. We can understand the motivation through her actions, and that is amazing storytelling, in my opinion. I did find a lot of feminist messages and concepts disguised or intentionally delivered in several scenes, through different objects, lines of dialogue and actions. It blew my mind ...Not to mention the jaw-dropping, REAL stunts and the fact that little CGI was used in this movie. It heavily relies on Miller's fantastic ability to show explosions and cool cars and vehicles (that, yeah... as many other have pointed out, remind me of Twisted Metal -- in fact, this'll probably be the closest thing I'll ever see in a movie that truly resembles such bad ass game)rolling around. And the more you look at them, the more you realize just how much effort was put into bringing them to life. The guy with the flame-throwing guitar, the ""war boys"", the post- apocalyptic hints of what might've happened (again, I did not see the previous movies but this one clearly gives information if one's to pay attention to details). I'd only say that, just because I happen to be a huge fan of character-driven stories, I would've loved just a bit more of fleshing out scenes. However, I do love those scenes at night and the dialogue between Furiosa and Max. Once again we see how effective and carefully chosen each word is. Totally recommend this movie and can't wait for what's to come!"

","Mad Max is really a mad movie. From start things happen that you don't really understand, but fortunately, as the movie proceeds, things get clearer and clearer. I wish I have watched it in 3D rather than the DVD version, as the best part of the movie was the action scenes and the huge cars racing the desert. But the story is good too. Noted, I haven't seen the original movie, so I'm not sure if the story is the same, and thus I can't make comparisons. But, for what I have seen, the movie is rich with action and it will keep you interested throughout it's length. Sure, the performances aren't award winning, and the emotion never reaches a high point, and so, if you don't like action movies and prefer dramas, my suggestion is not to watch Mad Max. But if you want to have fun watching an adventure\battling\high speed movie, this film won't disappoint you."

","To let you know I had not watched the original Mad Max movies when I had watched this film, so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis, and using that fact I must saw that George Miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it. John Seale, the cinematographer, does a exceptional job here. There are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here. John Seale also did some of the Harry Potter movies were he also did a great job in. The action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down. <br/><br/>As for characters Tom Hardy is good as Max. He hardly says a word and I really love that when watching the film. I loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking, because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene, and Tom Hardy was no exception. The fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly Max. <br/><br/>Now Charlize Theron I adored as Furiosa. She was what won the movie for me and made it awesome. I still remember after seeing this film the first thing I thought was ""Dam she could be a great Wonder Woman."" I mean seriously forget Gal Godat and get Charlize to play Diana, and bet I would love it along with everyone else. I mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband. <br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne sadly were not as good or interesting. I mean they were just raging fits of anger. They didn't think and they had no brain. I mean really they were not compelling villains at all. In fact I found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didn't make any sense. <br/><br/>Now with that being said I am going into all the problems with this film. <br/><br/>The lack of story- While there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause I do like a good story. That being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to it<br/><br/>The entire first 20 mins were boring- I mean at first I was into it, but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasn't for my desire to finish my food I probably would have gone to sleep. Not good movie. Not good at all. <br/><br/>The villains suck!!!- No really they do. There bad and awful villains to the point were I wanted them all dead. __ OK now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough. I won't be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho. Still tho there is a lot that we can still love with Mad Max: Fury Road which is why I am still giving it a 7/10."
"Apologi","7","0","4","26 December 2015"," On the surface somewhat dull action flick, which however has a deeper existential level
","I have somewhat mixed feelings about this one. On the surface level this film is quite dull. One car chase to a promised haven which has ceased to exist, second chase back, and that's it. The promise of the Green Place stimulates imagination, so it is a big disappointment as actually no mythical green land is found. The terrain is also very monotonic. The battles are too long, dull and repetitive. Very much attention is paid to detail of the objects, though. Technically the film is splendid. Rated on this level I would give it a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>However, the film also spoke to me on a deeper level. The post-apocalyptic scenario is used to create a world in which people are exploited like livestock, and the whole culture has has decayed to accommodate this abuse. In the beginning of the film Nux is just one warboy. He follows blindly the dictates of his leader, sugarcoated by promises of glory for those who die valiantly in battle, that have allusions to the Pagan Norse religion. In the course of the film Nux is forced to make personal choices, to choose who he is and wishes to be, so that his life gains independent value.<br/><br/>The same topic is also explored through the five wives of the gang leader Immortan Joe, who in the course of their escape are trans-morphed from objects to subjects. Their original childish/girlish, irresponsible and spoiled behavior contains in my opinion heavy critique towards modern women's culture. One does not need to be a feminist to see this side of the story - rather, the film shows that the golden cage is not built just by men of power, but requires from women a decision to pursue the path of a trophy object. The wives are granted a personal liberty, but use it to make different decisions, some wishing to flee the rough real world back to their captors. Also for Imperator Furiosa the Fury road is a road to personal liberty, though she takes more an active role.<br/><br/>On this level, therefore, the film can be considered an existential movie, which explores the relationship between personal choices and cultural pressure: a story of the birth of an individual personality, when one is liberated from the pressure created by oppressive cultural forces. The journey of the film can therefore be seen as a kind of allegory, in which fleeing to the emptiness of the desert represents the flight from those cultural forces. It even carries a hint of a religious journey towards a Promised Land, though in the bleak atheist(?) existential view of the film the Promised Land no longer exits, so that each person is given the task to forge his or her own destiny. On this existential and allegorical level I am willing to give the film an 8 out of 10. When I consider the both scales together, emphasizing the existential merits the film does in my opinion deserve a total 7 out of 10."
"Icedooitle","8","0","4","4 November 2015"," The Beautiful Hideous
","The Mad Max saga began in the late seventies with polarizing reception. The desolate wasteland of Beyond Thunderdome was criticized for its clash with the overly stylized life of its ruthless inhabitants. The latest chapter Fury Road marries these two elements with a skill that is rarely successful. Director George Miller takes the blinding colors and overt violence that has become a cheap thrill in many films, and put them to use to their greatest potential. What separates this film from say, a Transformers extravaganza? We care. If there is nothing else beautiful in a wasteland, the violence can be gorgeous. It could be argued that the characters in this film are in a desperate search for their own respective glimpse of beauty.<br/><br/>The story picks up, roughly, where the series ended in Thunderdome. Tom Hardy's Max is still a survivor of the impossible elements and is taken by the War Boys who sell him to the half dead blood breeders. From its first frame, this film is a desperate fight. Max struggles through the bowels of a labyrinthine Citadel, ruled by the imposing Immortan Joe, Hugh Keays-Byrne. Every villainous character in the film is eye-catchingly attractive, yet hideous. Regardless of the importance of these characters, they are fabulously memorable. It is a great feat indeed that the character of Immortan Joe still maintains his position as immortally memorable. With a monstrous voice and boned steam-punk breathing apparatus, he resembles a mix between Tom Hardy's Bane and a Gollum created by The Misfits. Joe controls the most important currency in the world, water. He doles it out in controlled doses like a methadone clinic to the desperate populous. Joe's second in command is the beautifully rugged Furiosa, Charlize Theron. We meet her in the middle of defying Joe in a rescue operation, attempting to smuggle his gorgeous breeding woman to a safe haven. <br/><br/>Max, meanwhile, has become the property of a War Boy ""Nux,"" Nicholas Hoult, who uses Max's blood intravenously to support his own half- life while taking to the Fury Road to intercept Joe's beauties with the whole of Joe's army. The entirety of the film takes place in the white-knuckle chases on Fury Road. The situations and characters are so well established that the non-stop action functions as it should, monumentally engaging. Max, of course, finds himself with Furiosa, aiding in her scheme to steal Joe's angelic women to her former home and last known land of sanctuary. Hardy plays Max in such a low key that he sticks out in contrast to the vibrant and restless surroundings. Due to Max's almost non-existent dialogue, the character of Furiosa does occasionally upstage the dynamic, but it does nothing to hurt the story. <br/><br/>I will not spoil the visual crescendos that make this film unstoppably watchable. I will simply say that refraining from using the restroom mid-film is possibly worth the UTI. There is nothing profound about the plot, standard and linear. The profundity can be seen in the characters' adaptation to their hostile environment. Some find their personal beauty in the mania of battle. Others, like Joe, prefer the more traditional form that he finds in his slave women. As for Max, this world holds nothing for him. He exists because his greatest talent is his curse, survival. In any other environment his past would be an unbearably tragic tale that would isolate him. His isolation here has nothing to do with his past, it's doubtful his is better or worse than anyone else. That he is so damn good at living makes him tragic."

It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.<br/><br/>It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.<br/><br/>As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of ""what the f"" feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.<br/><br/>What I think was my latest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules! Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well."

","Max is not so much a character as a figure, a myth. Kinda like James Bond, only with more in-universe justification. If Batman was a moviegoer, he would likely sing this movie's praises as if it were an angel that brought his parents back. It is thus not an issue that Mel Gibson is replaced by Tom Hardy. They are simply two faces to the myth of the desert known as Mad Max. Hardy delivers an admirable performance. Though he is not the main character, his starting monologue sets the tone for the film and his grunts and groans and occasional line propel it onwards through the adrenaline-soaked landscape.<br/><br/>And what a stunning landscape it is. Miller's filters make the desert a bright orange and the sky a deep, sapphire blue. At night, everything is covered by a thick deep-sea-blue fog that perfectly fits with the barrenness of the desert. Oh what a film. What a lovely film it is indeed. It is a piece of poetry in fire and blood and dirt and cars and dystopian and hope and redemption. There is a scene in the first third of the movie in which they go into a dust storm. As Imperator Furiosa, the true main character and the showstealer from all accounts that seek to be considered reasonable, drives towards it, you are awestruck. Not as an exaggeration or a figure of speech; you are literally struck with awe. It ripples through your veins and sends your heart beating out of your chest and into the air of the theatre or living room in which you watch it. You are certain that this can't be topped, that they can't show you anything better than this.<br/><br/>You are wrong. As they enter the dustcloud, you can see that this is not any kind of normal storm. There is lightning and tornadoes. You look into the pure heart of chaos and see that it is one of the most beautiful, most deadly, most arcane, most fantastic things you have ever seen, in film or otherwise. And that is only the setting. The action here, in no terms the ultimate highlight of all the action that takes place throughout the movie, involves cars burning up and getting thrown into the winds. It involves chases that would make even a typically-accomplished action filmmaker hold their breath. And then the dust blows over and the main characters emerge, alive but covered in sand. Perhaps for the first time, they know what they're in for. And so do you.<br/><br/>This is one of the most beloved movies in the country as I write this. As well it should be. Everyone has that one moment when they knew that this wasn't just going to be another action movie, that it wasn't even just going to be another Mad Max movie. This was going to be something grand, something monumental, something that would be studied and respected and learned from for decades.<br/><br/>Miller himself has been at it for decades. I have been born and raised in the lull between the last Mad Max movie and this one. But if this is what twenty-five years of waiting and learning and making Happy Feet Two gets you, then I would recommend it to anyone. This isn't just a mind-blowing film if you come into it not knowing what to expect. It is inherently a mind-blowing film. It carries such through its very essence. But it is even more than that, perhaps far more.<br/><br/>This is the movie that Miller always wanted to make. When he made those other Mad Max movies, as fantastic and thrilling and immersive as they were, he was always thinking of this. This is the magnum opus of one of the greatest action filmmakers in history. If I went to an alien civilization and was asked to show them a Mad Max movie, this is the one I would show. If they asked for an action movie, this is the one I would show.<br/><br/>The cinematography stuns. You feel as spent as the characters when the film finishes. The soundtrack fits so well that I can hardly dare to call it a soundtrack. Soundtracks play repeatedly on video game levels when you are taking a break to drink a soda. This music is the natural essence of the film played out to a sonar format. As a whole, the film is what I'd call a symphony if it was more perfect and restrained and classical. As it is, it's more like one glorious rock opera played out to the arms of the masses.<br/><br/>That is not even to mention the angles and shots they conjure up. There are many thoughts that lay dormant in my mind of what a movie could do but hasn't yet. This two-hour chasefest filled perhaps more of them than any other film. It accomplishes what could only be before thought of in the realm of imagination, from subtle touches to entire action sequences. Miller is a virtuoso.<br/><br/>I have compared these films to Miyazaki's works. If so, then this film is Mononoke or Spirited Away. A defining work that leaves all others in the sand. It races ahead day and night through the desert, sometimes looking for a purpose, sometimes looking for redemption, sometimes just looking.<br/><br/>Is it the best film ever? Maybe not. But it is the most adrenaline-fueled, a unique decision that is handled well and makes the pauses mean only the more. It is one of the greatest films of the decade and its characters and ideas (thunderpoon, anyone) will live for eternity. Action can be understood by all. Great action speaks to all. Superb action puts all on a high from which you will not permanently egress.<br/><br/>See you in Valhalla."

The story is (extremely) simple, to the point where I knew who would live or die by the half way point. Some characters were undeveloped. Other than that, there are next to no flaws to this almighty film. Hypnotic action sequences, heart pumping soundtrack and top notch performances from the entire cast make Fury Road one of the best films in years. The car chases are some of the best action sequences film has ever seen, with great cinematography and soundtrack. And of course, explosions.

","I haven't been this in love with a movie in a very long time. From the very beginning Mad Max: Fury Road has you hooked with an extremely interesting environment, characters and culture of the war boys and their illustrious leader, Immortan Joe. As well as a fascinating, dark world we are treated to many explosions and a lot of action, and sympathetic, bad ass women tie the plot together. Our movie starts off with the famous Mad Max over looking the desert wasteland and shortly thereafter being ambushed and kidnapped by war boys, and being held captive as a ""blood-bag"", because his blood type is O-Positive. While he attempts his daring escape Imperator Furiosa, the other protagonist of the film attempts to free Immortan Joe's 5 wives, who he treats as breeding stock, a way to create more of his war-boys, mindless warriors fanatical in their service to him, who die for him with pleasure. The two meet in less than friendly circumstances, but end up fighting together, to help free the wives, and eventually, all of Immortan Joe's people."

"mohammed-alkawsi","9","0","4","9 October 2015"," It somehow shows the human nature.
","========================= Spoilers ======================== The movie Mad Max has proved again that it is not only for entertainment; but also shows how a human is capable of without resources. The movie talks about the world after it collapses and the madness that goes in it. It also talks about how dictators who are supposed to be leaders can be abusers. The movie takes a place in a desert where water is almost nonexistent to the people. In addition, the colonel Joe Moore, the Lord of Citadel, controls the distribution of the water to the people. In the movie, water is more needed than oil and no one is able to get enough of it or get it at all. Also, in a later storyline, the movie talks about a lady warrior, Imperator Furiosa, who was supposed to transport the 5 wives of Immortal Joe. Those wives are called the perfect humans due to their lack of any radiation, the ""non-defect"" humans. Imperator Furiosa then decides to escape the wives to a safer place. Then she gets help from a loner and former captive, Max Rockatansky. The ending was assumed because of the nature of the movie. The movie finished of course with a happy satisfying ending. <br/><br/>George Miller has done a great job in directing this magnificent movie. I believe this movie has a hidden message on how human beings can behave based on the environment they are surrounded by. In my opinion, the hidden message in the Mad Max movie is about the evil that can be found within us, humans. The movie describes humans, who were effected with radiations, as savages and monsters. In reality, and as proved, a human has the capability to be a monster and aggressive if needed. We all see it on the news, everyday. <br/><br/>The movie had some minor glitches and errors such as using the same vehicles that were used in the previous Mad Max movie. In addition, there were some actors who did not fit the characters, or couldn't do well acting. The violence was beyond thoughts and too graphic, but we were warned before watching it. Some of the scenes were not even close to reality, but it is a movie; imagination had to be used. Other than that, the movie was enjoyable to watch and to learn from. The affects and graphics were reasonably good. Most of the actors performed very well and in an engaging way. The plot was well written and interesting. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie was very excellent and engaging. One thing I would rather change in the plot is the reason why humans are savages is because of radiations; and there are perfect or imperfect humans. I would suggest that the reason for humans being monsters is war, hunger, and chaos. Moreover, instead of the idea is being perfect or imperfect human, it would be more reasonable and easier to adopt if it was healthy or ill human. In my opinion, the change would make that particular point more interesting and logical. <br/><br/>Overall, Mad Max was ""mad"" good. If the viewers were into those kinds of movies, it would be a great choice to watch it. The plot was very interesting and the acting was too. The directing and camera shooting were marvelous. If you find yourself tolerable to too much blood, then it would be a good choice to watch. <br/><br/>Mad Max Fury Road"

","I never watched any of the other Mad Max films so I wasn't too sure what this movie would entail and this movie left me in awestruck. In this thrilling ride through the fury road, Max Rockatansky played by Tom Hardy takes us on a journey of survival through a post-apocalyptic world. This movie franchise created and directed by George Miller, is based on a time in the world has ended several years ago ruled by corrupt warlords. Only a few sanctuaries still exist in this desert of a wasteland. Citadel being one of them, is a desert fortress populated by apocalyptic survivors. These survivors rely on a limited water supply controlled by their warlord leader, Immortan Joe. Max is a character of few words but his actions are unrelentless. At the beginning of the movie, Max is running from a group of warlords and eventually is captured. We don't know much of this character at first but Max experiences concurrent glimpses of a little girl shouting out for help. This gives us a little bit of background of Max's past. Although it has not been confirmed in the movie, we believe that he had a daughter whom he failed to save and is now being haunted by his guilty conscience. The stolen warrior Imperator Furiosa played by Charlize Theron, along with the warlord leader's five wives, attempt to escape the shackles of Immortan Joe. Max and Furiosa join alliances during this high speed chase as they run through the desert wasteland in a war rig away from Immortan Joe and his army of half-life warlords. In this high speed, adrenaline rushing and action packed film, we get to see the dynamics of each character as they embark in their own journey filled with sacrifice, romance, resentment, betrayal, and the last hope of humanity. George Miller, takes us on a science fiction fantasy that will have you at the edge of your seat from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end credits. If you are not familiar with the movie's franchise you will be left puzzled with the first few scenes, but fear not you will get the gist of it all. A phenomenal job well done to the cinematography of Mad Max: Fury Road, that captures the massive destructions and explosions that will leave you wanting more. If you weren't an adrenaline junky already, this movie will have you convinced otherwise. I only wish that the movie explained more about the wives stories and how they became Immortan Joe's property. The movie ends with Immortan Joe dead and Furiosa taking back Citadel. Max humbly disappears in the crowd and sense of a new beginning and new kind of hope is left to interpretation. I highly recommend this movie to those who are looking for a rock n' road thrill ride. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron's dynamic is unquestionably profound. They embody two leading characters, Max and Furiosa, as troubled souls on a quest to search for the diminutive hope at world's end. What a Phenomenal movie!"

","Spoiler Contained The movie Mad Max Furry Road is set in a post-apocalyptic world. In this wasteland violence rushes throughout all cities and resources are diminishing. There are two main characters in the movie that attempt to restore order. Max's history includes losing his wife and his son during the war and violence that came about. Furosia is a strong leader who wants to work towards progress in the world. She initially is under orders from Immortal Joe, but she has her own plans and escapes with 5 women who were going to be bred by him. Max is held hostage by Immortal Joe who uses his blood to supply a wounded solider named Nux. Furiosa and Max find themselves working together after escaping from Immortal Joe, who is the main enemy of the film. He possesses a lot of power and has a lot of soldiers on his side. One of them includes a character by the name of the Farmer. Immortal Joe's army name is War Boys tribe. Furiosa and Max have an intense standoff against Immortal Joe and have a lot of struggles throughout the movie. Upon their escape in a dessert, Furosia and Max flee towards a city called Citadel. In the journey Nux ends up dying as he was found to be in the truck with Max and Furosia on the way. Furiosa is also heavily injured during the battle that occurs nearby the city. Max saves her life by supplying his blood to her in order to sustain her life. Joe ends up dying during the battle. At Citadel Max and Furiosa are greeted with respect and full of joy at the site of Joe's death. I have been a fan of these action and related genres for over 10 years. <br/><br/>Although there were some sections of the movie that could be improved, the story didn't matter as much as it was full of action and battles. The plot line could have been more refined to include more character development and twists. The overall film production was adequate and the characters roles were fairly good. The characters roles did seem to twist a bit but they stayed true to their roles for the most part. The main conflict which involved Immortal Joe and Max and Furosia ended with Joe's death. The movie was different from anything I have seen in a while which is why it was enjoying to watch. <br/><br/>The main setting includes wastelands and worn down structures. The wardrobes were a also very different as they attempted to match the state of the world. They were very minimal clothing on some characters but they wore mostly open costumes. . The background was a backed by very good production that helped to increase the quality of the film. The director could have had more variations in setting for a bit of change. <br/><br/>The angles during the movie did seem a bit all over the place. There is a lot of battle scenes which do require angles switches, but it seems to be overused throughout the entire movie. Another factor that was a bit lacking was the sound. From the vehicles to weapons the audio seemed a bit harsh. It wasn't that large of an issue and didn't interfere with the story plot of the film. The music was prominent in the action and suspense scenes and was a bit over powering."

","Wow 1,274 Reviews for this film and counting and an average rating of 8.3!!! that should tell you a great deal about this MAD MAX revamp.<br/><br/>I saw the amazing trailer but somehow sadly missed it at the cinema (damn) especially as I had read nothing but positive reviews about it.<br/><br/>So, caught up with it on Blu-Ray but it couldn't be THAT good could it?<br/><br/>There's not much in way of storyline but you've probably figured that out already by the subtitle 'FURY ROAD' yup it's a chase movie and quiet possibly the GREATEST chase movie EVER!!!<br/><br/>George Miller (the director) returns to film the 4th Mad Max movie, a series of movies I've enjoyed since why back when I was but a teen back in the 1980's. Mr Miller takes what clearly was the best of those (Mad Max: Road Warrior) and pumps it up to the Max (sorry) with steroids...<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully directed and simply gorgeous looking film which I knew I'd like within the first few minutes.<br/><br/>ACTION...ACTION...and more ACTION.<br/><br/>I simply don't know how they managed it all, the choreography and planning involved in filming most of these sequences in the film are just breathtaking, all involved with this film should be very proud of themselves in what they've accomplished.<br/><br/>Now a few (and I do think only a few) might be a little disappointed in that it's not simply all about Max (Tom Hardy makes a good job of taking over from the iconic Mel Gibson) who was always a normal, average type of guy trying to survive what had become a mad post apocalyptic type world. At first he just wants to be left alone but the caring Max we know (and love) is still in there somewhere and it eventually finds it's way to the surface in order to help out the quiet incredible Furiosa (the MAGNIFICENT Charlize Theron)<br/><br/>I'd be disappointed if there were not 2 sequels to this film... One for Hardy's Max and another possibly for Furiosa but how do they top this?<br/><br/>I'm currently rating it a high (for me) 8.5 / 10...I will need to see it again possibly to re-adjust this score.<br/><br/>A TERRIFIC ALL-ACTION Film that will be loved by most."

","Boy what a ride! Crazy action and visuals. But the movie is far from perfect.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie was simply amazing. The movie dives straight into the world of Mad Max. I didn't question anything I just enjoyed the view. And for the first hour of it's runtime the movie more than delivered.<br/><br/>It was in the second half, where I encountered some problems. The movie is essentially a 2 hour long car chase. The action doesn't revolve around the plot, the little plot this movie has revolves around the action. This was fine and I didn't even care about the lack of story, until the action stopped. Due to the lack of the story I was incredibly bored when there was no action. And I'm not even an action junkie. There simply were no substance apart from the action.<br/><br/>It would seem that Charlize Theron's character Furiosa would be the most interesting character since she is the one who had perhaps the biggest story arc out of all the characters. But having the biggest story arc in this movie is not a whole lot. I actually found the title character Max by Tom Hardy the most interesting. His actions and his rough exterior fits him right into the movie's brutal world.<br/><br/>Max was a lot better character than Furiosa. Her character was trying to have some emotional depth, but ultimately it fell short in my eyes. Probably due to the lack of story in the movie. Max was just a real fighter and a survivor and the filmmakers didn't even try to make the character anything more. I really liked that! Despite what their characters were in the movie, both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy gave good performances. Tom Hardy sure knows how to grunt.<br/><br/>Even though the action was amazing, I became a bit numb to it towards the end of the movie. The climax didn't have the same paralyzing effect to me anymore, like the first half of the movie did.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an enjoyable movie. But I can't even think how awful it would have been if the action wasn't as good as it was."

","It's nearly impossible for me to take seriously any of the 1-star reviews that I see below. Either these people profoundly missed the point, or they have an agenda. Mad Max: Fury Road will stand the test of time as one of the greatest action movies ever made. Maybe THE greatest. But that isn't to say it's a piece of mindless entertainment. Far from it. Sure, the dialogue is sparse, but there is quite a lot of story to be gleaned from contextual visual clues. If you're the type to reflexively cringe at Miller's punkish post-apocalyptic stylizing, you'll miss out on the careful and plentiful world-building that went into this movie. And while the slam-bang action rarely relents over the playing time, there is nevertheless rewarding character development and rich thematic content, despite claims to the contrary. This is one of a handful of movies that I know I will watch many more times before I die."

","They are on their way to Valhalla. Witness! <br/><br/>This is a re-imagining of the original Mad Max movies with Mel Gibson. There is no direct link other than Max. On these boards I asked ""What is the basic story?"" A couple of interesting replies are: <br/><br/>"" In the new world order there is a family (faction?) in monopoly of (each of) the resources, one has the water, another the oil production, and another the gun production. Furiosa escapes the clutches of the water baron taking his captive breeding women. He pursues her with the help of the other monopoly members. She realizes her dream homeland is gone so she returns to the water baron's place, killing him en route and taking over his fiefdom. Along the way Furiosa encounters Max, who decides to help her. ""<br/><br/>"" Leader of bad guys has 5 models who are his brides who have his children for breeding the pale white guys. girls run away, bad guy chases them across the dessert, max helps the girls and battles the bad guy. max wins by ripping off the bad guys face. end of story. boooooring as hell but pretty to look at scenery and oh so cool chase scenes. ""<br/><br/>So whether one considers this boring or exciting depends on one's frame of mind. In the chases across the Namibian desert it is almost nonstop action. Chases, shooting, flame-throwing guitar playing, cars and motorcycles crashing, explosions. I have to give credit to the filmmakers, and the sound track has much deep bass to emphasize all the action, you need a home theater with a good subwoofer to really appreciate all of it. I watched it at home on DVD.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all the main actors, Tom Hardy is Max and Charlize Theron is the crazy lady, Furiosa, who takes the truck and the women to set out to find the Green Place of her childhood memories."

There isn't really much in terms of writing / dialogue. It lacks substance and is quite far removed from reality in every aspect. It's best to not try and make sense / use logic while watching this. ;-)<br/><br/>If anybody is concerned about the ""feminism"" hype this production garnered, don't be.

There's utter chaos in the attack scenes, which defy both logic and gravity and yet seem to make perfect sense in the world Miller has set up. It's truly a roller coaster ride of a film, and I'm happy to report that the 3D never feels intrusive. Shot against mostly bright, saturated landscapes, the film has a very different visual palette from the first Mad Max movie. Sure it's a slim plot, and there's very little dialogue, but the writers do a good job constructing a surprisingly feminist tale."

","Years after the end of civilization, the authoritarian Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) enslaves survivors inside a dessert stronghold known as the Citadel. Once a fierce warrior called Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) makes an escape, taking Joe's five wives, she aligns herself with a wanderer and a former captive named Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy). Protected by their massive, armored truck, they must try to outrun Immortan Joe and his henchman as well as other foes in a dangerous high-speed chase through the Wasteland.<br/><br/>I've read everywhere that this is the greatest film ever or just the best film of the year. I personally wouldn't go that far with my praise. It's a good film but not a great one. Maybe because when I saw it the first time I saw the film Ex Machina afterwards and I couldn't help but to compare them to each other. It probably isn't fair but that's just human nature. I also never saw it in 3D either time and I have never seen any other Mad Max film before. I have been saying this a lot in all of my reviews but this has to be the best looking film I've seen this year from the cinematography, to the color palettes (yes I know most of the film takes place in the desert), and the contrast between each really makes things pop on screen so those kept my attention throughout. I will admit to being a little confused about the story as I wasn't sure what was going on until around halfway through the film. Despite not having ever seen a Mad Max film, I should be able to figure out what is going on pretty quickly. I also found the story a little repetitive since most of it takes place in a truck running through the desert with a few occasional car battles to liven things up. I got bored when there was no action taking place. If the film spent a little more time in the Citadel at the beginning, it may have helped as it wouldn't have made the middle as long. I didn't care as much for the wife characters either but luckily they did not get too much focus. Nicholas Hoult plays a War Boy named Nux who I found quite annoying but did not get in the way of the stars of the film who were Theron and Hardy. The films is called Mad Max but Imperiosa is really the main character of the film as she gets most of the screen time and the emotional moments but I didn't mind because of Charlize Theron's performance where she was able to make her go through a range of emotions and made the character very likable. Hardy was okay as well with hardly any dialogue. Overall, this is a decent action movie that is beautiful to look at but I wish the story had a little more depth.<br/><br/>Score: 7.5/10"

We pick up with Tom Hardy on his acting career roller-coaster playing Max, a drifter who comes across Furiosa, a woman who rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic Australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners. Pretty crazy huh? Charlize does spectacularly awesome work as Furiosa, kicking ass throughout the film next to the muscular and quiet Tom Hardy. Their performance aren't the key to this roller-coaster film. The endless car chases, massive explosions, and dazzling editing and cinematography blend this crazy ride of a film into one spectacular work of art that belongs in the lists of the top ten greatest movies of all time. And yes, this action-packed thriller makes other legendary action films of modern time look like dust. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a visionary experience from George Miller, placing itself as an instant classic for film geeks everywhere."

","Where to begin, everything about this action film was stunning. Simply stunning.<br/><br/>What I really love most about this movie and the original Mad Max movies is that all the cars are actually REAL. Yes they literally do build these machines and sets, so it gives the movie a realism(Hollywood please take note, real life beats CGI every time).<br/><br/>While this movie does use some CGI and to excellent effect, it's the real life actual explosions and car action that really makes the Mad Max movies. From the very first movie through to this movie.<br/><br/>I'm also blown away by Mr Edward Thomas Hardy who does a superb job with Max. We all love Mel Gibson as Mad Max, but sadly his time has passed(unless he makes an appearance as an aged Max looking back and telling a story from his past perhaps, that might work). Mel certainly still has it, 'The Expendables' movie roles were great, but the age is showing. That said I noticed some original actors from the original series making appearances in this recent film and they were brilliant.<br/><br/>I'm kind of puzzled as to the whole story issue's people are having and I think it's a movie that you'll either love or hate with no in between. The story is very Mad Max and I felt it really did fit in well with 'The Road Warrior'. Anyone who is winging about this new film, really needs to go back and watch the original movies. This movie actually had more in it than what people are giving credit for it. Unlike the other movies however, this one requires that you fill in the blanks yourself. It's a story told on the run. It's a mad post apocalyptic world that doesn't give you the luxury of reflection and that's the way George has put this installment together.<br/><br/>It's big bold, constant full throttle nail biting action and that's what Mad Max at it's core is about. People trying to live in a world gone mad.<br/><br/>The effects, the acting and yes the story were great. It was the Mad Max we all know and love, given an upgrade it rightfully deserves.<br/><br/>My only gripe for all 4 Mad Max films is that the continuity with the original 3 films was a touch off base, but overall this movie really did deliver, in fact far more than I was expecting and it's great to see George is back with his signature film creation.<br/><br/>Highly recommended and anyone knocking this movie mustn't have liked 'The Road Warrior'.<br/><br/>My only wish is that Bruce Spence get's to make a guest appearance in one of the sequels to this film. The gyrocopter flying loony was a great addition to the original films and would really thrill fans of the series(who knows, maybe even get Angry Anderson to make an appearance or possibly Tina Turner....)"
"DarthVoorhees","8","0","4","19 September 2015"," Excellent in many ways but ultimately wanting...
","I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed by 'Mad Max: Fury Road' if only because the super hype led my expectations to be way too high. There's a lot to love in this film and it is obviously a very meticulously planned and executed picture. If we are judging it on it's technical merits and the imagination behind it's world than 'Mad Max' could be considered masterful. I want to stress how gorgeously shot and imagined the movie is. The action sequences are painstakingly choreographed and have thematic weight to them. <br/><br/>The problem as stated earlier is that when it comes to dissecting the script it is so flat on emotions and characters. I'd be surprised if there was even a good ten pages worth of dialogue in the film. There just isn't any real sense of conviction other than the story dictates that there must be to move the pieces from A to B. The characters are all competently brought to life by very talented actors but I think there is just the surfaces of characters. When Furiousa has her moment explaining a vague back story it actually seems sort of goofy as if Miller and his screenwriter collaborators were just making up big Science-Fictiony words. Frankly Max in particular feels entirely superficial as a character. I think it's a movie where the aesthetics are so impressive that you just have to look past a very weak story with very weak characters.<br/><br/>I think if 'Fury Road' were released in the eighties it wouldn't be considered the masterpiece many consider it to be now. That 'Fury Road' is raised to such a level is a testament to how bad action films have become and not how excellent this particular film is. . You must know 'Mad Max Fury Road' has a lot of excellent things about it if this seems to be a review that tanks the film. I think people going in for just the experience of wall to wall action will be immensely satisfied. Those who want an elaborate action film with characters in the vein of the better action pictures 'Fury Road' is said to be a successor to will be disappointed. I hate to be the contrarian but there you go"

"tariq-hossenbux","8","0","5","18 September 2015"," Blood, Sand, and Car Chases All The Way To The End
","There have been many who wrote negative reviews for this film, but I think if you start watching Mad Max with the right frame of mind, you will find it worth watching. Set in post apocalyptic Australia, it features stark but stunning landscapes of sand and craggy rock. Tom Hardy as Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa are excellent and very believable as people traversing this gritty and violent world in search of something better. Hope and redemption as the film puts it. Through blood, gunfights, and car chases they try to stay true to their hopes for a happier future. Best seen on a larger screen to take in the scale of the vistas and the numbers of vehicles involved in the battles, but still very impressive on the smaller screens. The gigantic but empty landscapes highlight just how small they are as they continue on their quest, and also how small their chances of success are. The film at times has a theatrical quality almost like a Shakespearean play as the individual characters reflect on their situation. The battle scenes are elaborate, and almost circus like sometimes. You will get your fill of car chases, guns, and blood in this one. But besides the action Mad Max makes an effort to fill out the backgrounds and hopes of the main characters. These days you don't find that attention from every Hollywood film. Mad Max powers through with the steady pace of an 18 wheeler and you will get a steady supply of action to keep you interested till the end."

","I watched the original Mad Max Movie back in the day where the plot went about Max trashing a gang of motorcycle riders after they had destroyed his family. Very satisfying! <br/><br/>It ended with him riding off into the sunset and they followed it up with one called 'Under the Dome' if I am correct. <br/><br/>This new Mad Max movie in my opinion lost the plot....<br/><br/>Mad max Fury is a great movie but little over the top compared to the first two. <br/><br/>The vehicle scenes were great in Mad Max Fury, but it was a bit of a thin round about story with no real meat showing any of the REAL world, possibilities of other colonies?<br/><br/>What about Mad Max in the city?"
"gungfuknight","7","0","2","17 September 2015"," Fantasy cartoon brought to life, with too many crappy 3d zooms and effects.
","First of all I do want to say I enjoyed this film and I think it is worth seeing again. It was exactly what it was supposed to be: Entertaining.<br/><br/>Bad news first, then the good news. Bad news is, there is way too zooming in and quick cuts, obviously it was made for 3d. I'll probably never watch a film in 3d again, so this is just irritating, because there is not really a purpose for 3d. Also there was no story. Yep, No story at all. Nothing and no one to care about. Also, why was the film called MAD MAX? He didn't talk at all, he had zero story, the whole thing could continue if his character died. Tom Hardy is pretty good as an actor and his talents were absolutely wasted in this. It should've been called Imperator Furiosa: Crank The Gauntlet Wasteland. I do have to say though my least favorite thing about the film is that they didn't get a single Judas Priest song in there. I mean c'mon! <br/><br/>Other than that, there may have been some dialogue that was really stupid, but it wasn't supposed to be an intelligent film at all. It was supposed to be fun. <br/><br/>Now for the good news, If you wanted to see an amazing car chase film than pretty much any car chase film in at least 15 years this is your film. The vehicles were all modded and retro, it was awesome and very creative.<br/><br/>My personal favorite thing about this film was the costumes and the voice overs. The art direction was spot on. It really felt like a retro fantasy cartoon film brought to life. With clear as day inspirations from Light Years: Gandahar, Super Shredder in TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze and Quan Chi of Mortal Kombat."
"kgprophet","7","0","2","15 September 2015"," Locke 2: Fury Road
","This film took director George Miller 12 years to make, and it shows. There is a great deal of depth to this fictional post-apocalypse world. Here the same back story is depicted, with a larger and more ferocious telling. I expect this film will greatly influence future action movies, primarily because the elements of this action film are so fresh and unique. Director George Miller should especially be recognised for getting performances that get the character's emotions without much dialogue. Much needs to be said about the action cutting of this film. First, there is little or no ""shaky cam"". For me, the ferocity of the pacing for an extended action sequence seemed almost impossible, yet it kept my adrenaline going. I'm not sure how many edits are in this film, but it feels about twice as many as a normal action film, yet it doesn't suffer from Michael Bay syndrome (addicted to quick cuts).<br/><br/>George Miller has created a 'look' to his Mad Max films by undercranking the camera. This means instead of playing back at 24 frames per second, the motion is sped up so there is perhaps 26 fps passing by within a second. Next, is starting the story as the chase begins, giving the character momentum. How to make an original action film? Spend months designing and building wild vehicles previously only seen as bubble gum stickers I used to collect as a kid. The personality designed into the cars and trucks rivals some of the actors. There was an interesting shifting of the weight of the story to the supporting characters, allowing the main characters to go through most of the movie without any dialogue. It is a bit of irony for Tom Hardy to have so little dialogue while spending the entire movie in a traveling vehicle. Around the time of the release of Mad Max was ""Locke"", in which he spends the entire movie talking while in a moving vehicle. Charlize Theron needs no backstory to understand she is tough. <br/><br/>A lot of good adrenaline inducing tribal drums punctuate the soundtrack. One of the chase vehicles has six drummers bashing away while a fire wielding heavy metal guitar player assaults the sonic landscape. No other film this summer has this kind of well paced action with original visuals."
"billylarrick","10","0","7","15 September 2015"," A revolutionary new take on action films
","The film may be called Mad Max and it may start and end with him, but anyone watching soon realizes that Mad Max is actually about her with Max providing the vehicle (no pun intended) for her story. It is she who is trying to free the birth mothers and take them to ""the green place,"" her story of redemption for past sins as much as Max's redemption, and she who the film's villain, Imortan Joe, is trying to kill (in fact Joe never so much as acknowledges Max's existence at any point during the film.) Charlize Theron's performance is a refreshing defiance of the typical female role of helpless love interest and shows that a strong female lead playing an emotionally scarred, physically tough character can be just as believable as male actors. This film, and Charlize Theron in particular, left me wondering why more films don't have stories written for strong, independent women if characters like Furiosa are the result we can expect. <br/><br/>Max (Tom Hardy): Where the character of Furiosa wore her emotions on her sleeve, the audience had a much more difficult time discerning what Max was feeling or thinking due to his extremely limited dialogue and his largely quite demeanor. Hardy's performance was subtlety at its finest. Since his dialogue was so limited he could not act through his words, as most roles do, so instead he used his eyes and his body language to convey his character's inner turmoil. The jittery manner in which Hardy moves throughout the film is one example of how he effectively demonstrates Max's borderline insanity without speaking, another being the way his eyes are constantly shifting back and forth in his head. <br/><br/>The director George Miller should be applauded for his decision to use as little CGI as possible (only about 10% of the film is CGI) in order to make the film appear and feel as realistic as possible (the flames shooting out of the guitar are in fact real). Using the Australian landscape combined with enhanced color filters to make the film as vibrant as possible, Miller was able to achieve his goal of creating a uniquely colorful post-apocalyptic world; this was a conscious effort by Miller to prevent the audience from feelings of bleakness and destitution. This method was simple yet also highly effective.<br/><br/>Another area where Miller imprints his directional style is his transitions throughout the film. There are several moments in the story where there is a shift in the story's pacing, usually from a high action sequence to a much slower one, and a lesser director might have struggled with these transitions appearing choppy. Instead, Miller uses scenes like these to further enhance the audience's feeling that they are not only watching a car chase, but they are experiencing it. One example is the scene where we see the flare in the desert after storm slowly dim and fade to darkness as the music builds and then suddenly the scene switches to bright morning sunlight with bright sand and a very slowly rising Max. This quick shift from high speed to an abrupt halt is not unlike suddenly braking in a car and gives the film greater depth in a very subtle way. Another example of this technique is that right after Max is caught while trying to escape being branded and has been shown at a higher film rate, he is thrust back inside the cave and we are immediately shown the brand on Furiosa's neck. In addition to creating a car-like transition, this also serves as a way of introducing Furiosa and immediately creates a connection in the audience's mind between her and Max.<br/><br/>George Miller and his co-writers also strengthened this film's story by avoiding the temptation to fall into overdone and tiresome clichÃ©s. Having the intestinal fortitude as a storyteller to kill off Nux, a young boy who the audience grows to like and sympathize with, rather than sparing him to preserve a happy ending, was a bold and commendable decision. The greatest trap, however, that Miller avoided, was the temptation to have Max and Furiosa form a romantic relationship by having Max kiss her when she was on the verge of death. Not only would this have weakened her character significantly and turned her into yet another damsel, it would have shattered the bond they had formed over their shared desire to achieve redemption. Sometimes it is not what directors and screenwriters do that makes their stories successful, it is what they choose not to do.<br/><br/>Another significant part of what made this movie interesting and unique was the many creative concepts that Miller brought to this post- apocalyptic world. The types of War Boy warriors: pole cats, flamers, war rigs, etc. as well as the many different car designs, especially the rocker vehicle, gave the audience something to look at as well as making the film less like a typical car chase. The concept of Mad Max being a universal donor and used as a blood bag, which ends up saving Furiosa, was also very clever. At the heart of the story is the concept of the War Boys being half-lives who are trying to reach Valhalla while also worshiping V-8 engines; this along with the idea of ""witnessing"" with chrome and being reincarnated shiny and chrome like cars is a very creative concept of a fictional religious cult.<br/><br/>Mad Max: Fury Road is a revolutionary new action film which incorporates strong female characters and a unique story in addition to breathtaking visuals. These visuals are not overdone and neither is the story. This film is fast paced and action packed, yet somehow also makes great use of subtlety through Miller's directing and Hardy's acting. Charlize Theron's performance is incredible, particularly in the still limited genre of an action film, but even more impressive than her acting is the creativity and skill that director/writer/producer George Miller brought to this film."

I cannot recall the last time I have enjoyed watching a film so much- maybe the first time I saw Aliens.<br/><br/>Every detail was epic- the cars, the War Boys, the sandstorm, the wild cars- and that was all in the first act. I was especially pleased that they had Max's original V8 Interceptor, and Tom Hardy is the best man for the role- he has the grit needed for a post-apocalyptic Max but with a hint of sane incredulity in his eyes.<br/><br/>I watched Road Warrior first, then the original Mad Max, and loved them. I was rather disappointed with the Thunderdome, but it was the 80s. This entry into the franchise redeems it wholly. Please don't talk about character development, because that was done in the original- this is just big, loud , and crazy.<br/><br/>The scene where the whole War Boy army takes off is an amazing spectacle- the modded cars were something I had never seen before, with Max strapped up front, and the rolling guitarist to spur this crazy horde onward.<br/><br/>This is not Terms of Endearment; if you like this kind of movie, then you will love this one."

","""Mad Max Fury Road"" was a movie I decided to see with great trepidation. I thought it was a remake of ""The Road Warrior."" A friend of mine pointed out to me that this was a reboot of the franchise. I'm glad I listened.<br/><br/>All I ask for in an action movie is, well, action. However, some have failed to live up to a very simple premise. Such was not the case here. The action began at the start of the movie, and it did not end until the movie was over. The cinematography and art direction were absolutely superb. Colors were used to the greatest effort to depict various moods. <br/><br/>The story is simple: a crazed ruler lords over a vast area of wasteland. He is in charge of the water and the vegetation. He also pedals flesh in the form of his breeders--women who are sent to various places to repopulate this barren nothingness. Max and his band of merry widows (so to speak) are trying to find the ""green patch"" in all this desolation. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy (as Max) and Charlese Theron (as the female lead) were terrific. The supporting cast was very good, and the stunts and visual effects were out of this world. This movie is rated ""R"" for violence and adult situations. I highly recommend this one."

","With a bare bones script and set in a bare bones landscape the movie wacks the audience with visuals and helter skelter chaos in what boils down to one long pursuit through a rocky desert that recalls Mad Max 2: the road warrior. <br/><br/>Is this the road warrior redux? <br/><br/>Perhaps it is in a way, but then it's infused with a touch of borderlands(the game) for it's over the top weird characters, with names like: The People Eater, The Doof Warrior and The Bullet Farmer. There is no way describing them, they have to be seen. The movie keeps a stringent pace once it get's going, which is almost right from the bat, after we are (re)introduced to Max and the setting. Tom Hardy is a worthy successor to Mel Gibson, perhaps even better for he has a rather more edgy attitude, which is why Max is called Mad after all. In the first scenes he gets captured and while he tries to make his escape, he finds himself dragged along as war trophy perched in front of a car that is part of the pursuit of the War Rig, a massive truck-trailer combination commanded by Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) who is trying to escape the War Boys of the Tyran Immortan Joe with his most adored treasure: his five nubile wives. <br/><br/>The chaos increases when the first of the pursuit catches up with Theron and Max tries to escape them, while the War Boys try to kill him, Furiosa and get the War Rig to stop at the same time without killing the wives. Once the first of the War Boys have been dealt with by Max and Furiosa, the fight is between them at first, but eventually necessity turns them into allies. Later on they are joined by Nux, a Warboy who is forced to switch sides. <br/><br/>A lot is smartly interwoven with the pursuit. There is the awkward love relation that develops between Nux and one of the girls. There is a kind of respect developing between Max and Furiosa. There is even some pondering that gives the movie a deeper feel. And there is even a very Boschlike scene when the War Rig travels to a swap-land where the Crows live. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are a marvel to behold, almost everything fanciful is flung at the War Rig: pole riders, trucks, bikes, monster trucks, armored cars, flamethrowers, hooks, chains and a high speed saw among them. <br/><br/>All in all this is a well made movie in which the star is Theron who overshadows even Hardy due to her personality. It's not because she pretty in this one, -for she is not- she is gritty, dirty and bald, but it is because she brings Imperator Furiosa to life. It makes me wonder whether the next installment in the series will be called Mad Max."

","What a thrill-ride this film is. What an elderly lady said behind me - as I was leaving the cinema - perfectly summed up the intensity and raw power of this accomplished blockbuster; ""I felt like I was shaken around for two hours straight!"". That is the broadest way to put Mad Max: Fury Road. I was extremely excited for Fury Road considering I am a massive fan of the Mel Gibson Trilogy, yet, even going into the cinema with the highest of expectations, this movie did not disappoint. What I loved about it most was not the action and gore and explosions, but the underpinning themes that tie this masterpiece together in such a way, that the action and exquisite acting by Tom Hardy and most definitely Charlize Theron told most of the story. Themes of hope, home, glory, ecological breakdown and redemption shaped the action blockbuster into a more subtle post-apocalyptic action/drama - which is uncommon. I thought George Miller did a wonderful job with the cinematography - the stunning visuals and lighting. As a devoted musician as well as film-goer/critic, I became totally glued to the screen when we first witness the crescendo, loud, raw, amazing and unusual characteristics of Coma the Doof Warrior! (spoiler) If there ever is a Mad Max-like apocalypse, I want to be Coma! Overall Mad Max: Fury Road is a joy-ride of constant action, expositions, extraordinary stunt-work, amazing direction and Oscar-worthy acting (Theron deserves an Oscar nod)."

","I think you will either love or hate this movie. It is excessive. Let's get that out of the way, and incredibly silly, but no one surely went into a film called Mad Max Fury Road expecting anything else did they? Yes the plot is pretty weak, we could pull apart some of the gender issues for hours but for what it is I found it massively entertaining and visually stunning. The main cons are; relatively weak plot (it is just a car chase for the entire movie), lack of realism (if this is always a con), poor acting from some (Huntington Whitely, Kravitz...) which may be down to the writing, and Tom Hardy is unable to shine. The pros are, it looks excellent, its incredibly fun if you can take it for what it is, and Charlize Theron is excellent. It is not a film for everyone or for all occasions but if you are going to pick an action blockbuster this is as good as any. On occasion I felt like it was trying to make some sort of political point but then more explosions happened and I forgot about it again.

","Having worked with George Miller on all three previous Mad Max movies over 30 years ago I was really keen to see what he would come up with number four. Well, the lack of story was a little disappointing, but as a comic strip action movie it scores well. However, a two hour chase from point A to point B then back to point A was a bit pointless, and without some decent dialogue one just didn't care about the characters... Top marks to John Searle for his fantastic camera-work which provides a visual feast to compliment the spectacular stunt work....The hard task was to replace Mel but Tom Hardy does a decent job. Nicholas Hoult was great as Nux, and it was good to see Hugh Keays-Byrne playing the bad guy once again. (He played Toecutter in the original Mad Max film).

","I will keep this simple.<br/><br/>there's two kinds of cinematic approaches tagged along with many genres those we call art-house and those we call blockbusters. the most important thing with films is to enjoy yourself and/or have something to think about. some are direct with it's message, others are indirect using little language in dialogue and the rest goes through symbolism and analysis. the direct (in some occasions) are just to milk money- i call that shallow cinema. <br/><br/>it's not just based on nostalgia or just to milk money. the perfect excuse for this film is the growth of technology. filming in digital makes it easier and the quality is greater both in sound and image.<br/><br/>this one is something else and to be honest, I haven't enjoyed a blockbuster in years.<br/><br/>George Millers career has been there- but throughout the years his work is a small catalog. but this one feels right in this time of age. being a fan of the previous classics well- they are classics but they've aged and not too well. this is a fresh start and feels like a dream come true with a vision that is meant to be. the quality will age well through the years. with all in mind this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>a previous reviewer complained that is it too much action - but that's what mad max is about. that's part of the experience. it's not the type of film to milk a franchise. it really is a dream come true. it's visual presentation even customization. this movie had to be made. and perhaps this is what George Miller always wanted.<br/><br/>this movie is a long ride and I mean it. to me this is the best action film of the year and i haven't enjoyed one in years.<br/><br/>the main protagonist isn't really max but furiosa (charlize theron) and she steals the show with a great cast, score and set. those who appreciate a good film and are fans of the concept and the series will love this. if you haven't seen it-treat yourself with this film.<br/><br/>this is a new beginning and I can't wait for a second film.<br/><br/>this is a movie that needed to be made now."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is 100% THE best action movie this year. Every aspect about it is perfection from the magnificent cinematography which captures gorgeous wide shots of car mayhem, to the snappy editing that doesn't have 7 billion quick cuts in a fight scene to hide the fact that there are stunt doubles. Another thing that stands out is the unbelievable effects, there is little CGI in this film and mostly what you see is what you get. You see that car crash in to that car and do a barrel roll and explode? Yeah well that bloody happened. George Miller who is a 70 year old man who has somehow managed to create a fantastic action film coming off of Babe and Happy Feet 2 and gifted us movie goers with a film that should be rewatched for yearz. Not to mention the amazing but subtle performances from Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. However Nicholas Hoult steals the show with his amazingly crazy and also human character. I can't wait to get my hands on the blu-ray and witness (ME) the bright vibrant colours and dolby surround sound. This is an absolute must see for anyone."

","The film marking the fourth installment of in George Miller's ""Mad Max"" series, follows Max, a prisoner and blood bag for a war boy Nux, a soldier for the cult that has taken reign since society's post- apocalyptic collapse. As it's core this part is a one long action sequence on fury road. This is a thunderous achievement of pure film-making technique, and a film that makes most other blockbusters of the 21st century look amateurish. It could be argue that the film's real star impostor Furiosa, who betrays immortal Joe by freeing the five wives. The movie set's into the action when Furiosa takes a detour to green place consequently Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is one of those movies that are fun to describe, but hard to write about. Mad Max: Fury Road is essential in-the-moment entertainment. Nothing sticks after leaving the theater, but the George Miller's direction makes the every single moment of action exhilarating. There are so many moments in this movie where I found myself saying, ""Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing this"" — either because the visuals were so insane or so extreme, or just because there was intense beauty filling the frame.<br/><br/>The main theme of movie was survival, the film completely justifies the opening lines ""I am the one who runs dead as well as alive"". Their isn't much of story in the movie but cinematography and direction was so fabulous that it can compensate anything. Miller exaggerated every single aspect of movie thereby making it a thrilling experience for viewers. Detailing of mechanical rigs, elevator and vehicles was overwhelming which can easily allure anyone's eye. ""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the fury road!""<br/><br/>As you can clearly see i' m in complete awe of what George Miller has accomplished here. Mad Max: Fury Road is everything an action movie should be. It's a masterpiece in terms of cinematography, direction, screenplay and editing."

","""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the fury road."" Max (Hardy) is a loner and a drifter who has been captured and is being used as a ""blood bag"".

Max and Furiosa form an unlikely alliance in order to save a group of prisoners from the tyrannical leader. I wasn't really looking all that forward to this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Mel Gibson series and wasn't expecting anything great from this movie. It may have been my low expectations but this movie wasn't that bad and it was pretty entertaining throughout. The best part of this movie is that it didn't try and do too much. It knew what the audience wanted and it is basically a 2 hour car chase movie. There is nothing amazing or horrible in this movie. On one hand it was better than I expected, but on the other hand it really didn't do anything to wow me or add anything extra special to set it apart from the originals, or Death Race for that matter. Nothing else really to say other than this is pretty much what you are expecting it to be. A very safe feeling middle of the road action movie. Overall, entertaining but didn't really take any chances and didn't set itself apart from other movies like this. It is very watchable though. I give it a B."

","I can absolutely say without a doubt I am blown away! Mad Max Fury Road is a two hour action masterpiece with thrilling stunts, incredible vehicles, and disturbing costumes. The action sequences are wonderfully executed. 95% of the special effects are practical giving the film authenticity. The film is edited with fluid feel while simultaneously keeps you anxious and uneasy. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron play the leading roles. Their unique on screen chemistry magnifies the tense action. Nicholas Hoult is a sleeper in this one! George Miller held nothing back and provides a new take on an over saturated genre.

"halodude-91048","Null","0","10","29 August 2015"," Mad Max: Fury Road Is Great
","*SPOILERS* Before I get bombarded with hate comments from the 1-4 star Mad Max community, let me make my point clear. Mad Max: Fury Road is not completely lacking a plot. Yes, this movie was not plot intensive, and yes it was mostly a massive scale car chase. However, that is fundamentally what Mad Max is. <br/><br/>Here is the plot of Mad Max: Fury Road. Imperator Furiosa is tired of being under the tyrannical of Immortan Joe. So, one day on a supply run, Furiosa decides to drive into the desert to get away from him. She also has the opportunity to use the war rig to find her home. When she finds out that her home is now part of the landscape of the desert, she decides to take the Citadel because Joe's army kidnapped her as a child.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we have Max Rockatansky. He was kidnapped by Joe's warboys, which naturally pisses him off, so he joins the fight against Joe's army. Also, he is looking for redemption so he decides to help Furiosa and her friends take the Citadel.<br/><br/>And, because it seems like nobody realizes this, here's Nux's story. A warboy since birth, he and everyone around him are insane. Once he finds a group of survivors with sanity, he helps them against Joe's forces so that he himself can find a sense of sanity. (This is just the way I looked at it).<br/><br/>Accompanied by gripping action and outstanding CGI, Mad Max: Fury Road is worthy of a 10/10."

It might be too explosive, too noisy sometimes, but this is what makes this movie wild and furious.

","I said overrated because this is not a movie above 8 / 10. This is a good action movie, not necessarily an expected sequel. Doesn't have that mystic sensation given by the older versions with Mel Gibson. But, Tom Hardy is a very good selection considering the way this movie was constructed, also Theron teams up with this guy pretty good against the maniacs from the Wasteland. I saw a lot of people say full action movie from start till the end. For me, there were moments when you could get bored, precisely because too much action without a fully logical correlation, so, some moments of thought and discussions would've been approved by many i think. Our road warrior is now an agent of wasteland, that went through this episode like another day in paradise. Maybe, the next one will settle things better."
"rduffy-94597","10","0","10","2 August 2015"," Over the Top Action with Surprising Depth
","Mad Max: Fury Road has some of, if not the most, intense action sequences of any movie. It spends much of its run time giving the viewer a heart attack by throwing Max and company into seemingly inescapable danger. The thing that makes the near non-stop action work is the feeling that our heroes are actually in real danger, keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout. Once one gets beyond the shell shock of the action sequences you will notice an incredibly well directed movie with some surprising heart to it.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is nearly unmatched, so I will not waste time retelling the ways this movie puts to shame all the superhero movies that have been pretending to be great action movies (looking at you Dark Knight). What really makes this movie stand out is it's fantastic pacing and show, don't tell, approach to story telling. The movie does not slow down to have someone hit you across the face with the theming, instead it uses the character's actions and visual symbolism to accomplish its goals. The movie posits that compassion is what makes us human, and it shows us what a world without it looks like. A place where we are all just things to be used and disposed of and wanting to know the name of a person seems frivolous. It does this with what some may argue are strong feminist undertones, pitting a society where masculinity has been taken to the extreme (and thus a lack of compassion) against Max and a mostly female ensemble. The theme is brought home in Max's character arc, in which he starts in ""a world of fire and blood, reduced to one instinct.. survive"" and ends with him regaining some of his humanity. Mad Max Fury Road is sure to excite with its action, but still has depth not seen in an action movie in some time. In the end this movie places its self squarely in the running for greatest action movie ever."

","This film in simple terms was amazing. It was a non stop action thrill ride. The fight scenes were so fluid and easy to follow and the imagery was fantastic.l I also loved the range of characters George Miller has created. Furiosa was by far my favourite she was just a pure bad ass. But I loved how everyone in this movies got an awesome moment, even the bad guys got an awesome moment. The plot follows on from a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for the sick War Boy Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants, is sent in her armored truck to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives are missing. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. The action is mad, beautiful and actually tiring to watch. This better get the all important Best Picture nomination and maybe a few acting nods for Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron."

","I am shocked when I think that the Director George Miller's last film was Happy Feet Two and his last live action picture was Babe 2 Pig in the City, that said, I was a huge fan of the original Mad Max films, so given the relaunch I went in to the theatre with a mixed feelings but open mind.<br/><br/>I have to say when I left I was just blown away. Absolutely amazing. I think I was actually out of breath, the speed at which the film flows, so many fast flow sequences each one flowing into the next it was fantastic just no time to breath. Edge of your seat action.<br/><br/>Worth every cent!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","14","27 July 2015"," Adrenaline injected straight into your veins, and also your heart
","After three decades we finally get another Mad Max film, and from the original director to boot. And if we learned anything from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it is that these kind of movies are to be feared. Which is why it's my great surprise and pleasure to announce that Mad Max: Fury Road is not only amazing, it comes very close to being the best Mad Max we've ever had.<br/><br/>Couple of reasons for this. First of all, it is an unbelievable action film. Eighty percent of the whole running time is spent in one kind of action sequence or another, but the directing and the pacing are both so iron tight that you'll never feel overwhelmed. I was at the edge of my seat the whole film, biting my nails, trying to rein in the urge to leap to my feet and yell ""Oh yeah!"" It also helps that this movie is one of those rare movies nowadays that are confident enough to utilize practical effects where they can and only rely to CGI when the effect is impossible to replicate in real life. And that shows. You really believe that all the cars are there and that the explosions really happen. It's a nuanced difference, but we see so much CGI these days that we've become able to spot the difference.<br/><br/>The actors are also phenomenal. Tom Hardy is perfect as the new Max. Sure, he doesn't have the underlying suave charisma Mel Gibson had, but this is a more jaded Max we're seeing in this film, and Hardy is perfect for that. But the real breakthrough performance here has to be Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. I demand more action roles for this woman! She's everything someone portrayed as Max's equal has to be, and then some. Undeniably badass, utterly skilled and frightening in her fury, she's one of the best action heroines we've ever seen, if not the best. More, please.<br/><br/>And thirdly, the surprising depth and emotions shown in this film. And yes, the themes are largely feminine. It deals with subjects like forced pregnancy, slavery, treating women as objects to be owned, fear, suffering and loss. All this in the middle of the most straightforward action gorefest you've ever seen. Yet the thing is, the themes never take away from the action. It wouldn't be a better action movie if you dropped the themes away or replaced them with something more ""masculine"". It works precisely because it can be a movie for both the adrenaline junkie muscleheads and for those looking hope and redemption in cinema.<br/><br/>And that is why Mad Max: Fury Road is so great. Because it pulls of the miracle of not only being a fourth part in a franchise thought having died a long time ago, but also being a movie about humanity, redemption and equality, while also being the movie most likely to cause per-pubescent boys to drop their voices by two octaves."
"Andrew_Ormsby","9","0","10","25 July 2015"," What a lovely movie!
","I have a feeling the script for this movie was three pages long. The first page said, ""The most epic explosions & car stunts ever!"" The second page was dialogue. The third page said, ""Remember page one? Let's put it in fourth gear!"" The reason this movie gets a 9 / 10 is because it delivers perfectly on what it wants to be. This is exactly what George Miller wanted to do back in the old Mad Max films with Mel Gibson. There are parts of the movie (flashbacks) which if you haven't seen the older films will not really make sense to you, but they are not so confusing that you wont enjoy the movie. Like I said, if you are wanting a film to blow your mind with over the top action & pure insanity like you've never seen before, this IS that film."
"tyingling7766","8","0","10","25 July 2015"," Another Mad Masterpiece
","All right folks, today I am going to review the movie Mad Max: Fury Road. Now I know the movie has been out for over two months, but I finally got around to watching it just last night. And I kicked myself in the butt for waiting so long. As the movie is not a ten out of ten for me, it is still really good. Not as good as the masterful original, but equally as good as the second one. Yes I said it, the original Mad Max is better than The Road Warrior. I still say Alien is better than Aliens. Accept it because it's true. Now on to my review.<br/><br/>Synopsis: An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland. Stars: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult Director: George Miller<br/><br/>Like I said in my build up, this movie is a Masterpiece just as much as the first and second movies were. Let's forget about the third forwell, ever. George Miller returned to the series reportedly fifteen years ago trying to get this one made. Now, little is known (but if I had to guess I would say it was) if the script was the same back then as it was in the film. Truth be told, I'm glad that he had to wait this long to make it. The effects were that much better. There is a story out that Tom Hardy admitted was true where he got into Miller's face about the dust storm scene. Just imagine for a second if Miller tried to make that scene fifteen, ten, even five years ago. It would not have looked the same.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, it was very simple. Max is trying to find peace but gets caught up in the problems of others. With exception to the first movie, it is the same storyline as the others. And there is nothing wrong with that. You can't come up with something for a loner who never talks besides doing either one of two things. This storyline is one of them. The other is that he just stumbles among the bad guys such as in the first movie. So, really nothing wrong there. Max doesn't even really say anything until about twenty to twenty-five minutes into the movie. That's something that everyone should expect from him. No way around it.<br/><br/>The acting was right on the mark. Granted, the wives were mostly the worst part of the acting aspect, and the real reason the movie isn't higher up on my ten scale, but that's okay because of everyone else. In truth, the one that really stole the show was Nicholas Hoult as Nux. Nobody had any idea what he was going to do in the movie and he surprised even me. Charlize, nothing can really be said about her because she is awesome in almost everything she does. Tom was just Tom. A lot of people will say, and some that I have heard before, that he was trying too hard to be Mel in the movie, but he made Max his own character. Something that Mel has admitted he wanted Tom to do. Which is also one of the reasons that Mel kept his name out of this one. Sure, he could come back for one of the two other sequels, but we'll see.<br/><br/>The music was the same as it always was. Just right for the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>I really don't know what else to say about this movie. If you haven't watched it, then you need to get out and see it. You will not be disappointed, I can promise you that.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (I really wish IMDb would allow a half a point)<br/><br/>That's it for me folks.

","Mad Max is a colossal achievement in the movie-making world with its tremendously persistent pace and constant reverence unseen in our millennium. It has the emotions to back up the bombastic action (a balance not usually witnessed in your ordinary summer popcorn flick).<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are impeccably cast and do an admirable job as the lead characters of this post-apocalyptic remake. Tom Hardy's rendition of Mad, albeit more crazy and unpredictable, was still marvelous in its own right. Charlize Theron's never- before-seen character, Imperator Furiosa, helped enforce much of the emotion that's deliberately felt while still maintaining an aggressively courageous mindset.<br/><br/>All in all, Mad Max satisfies in pretty much every department. Masterclass in its execution, Mad Max will be stored in my personal list of favorite films of all time."

","The story (to a certain extent) is secondary to the action in this film, due to it essentially being one long action sequence (must of cost a fortune). Nevertheless, they pulled (tugged) it off. It's a visual spectacle that keeps you hooked in. It's a cracking watch.<br/><br/>The actors play their respective parts & there's not much more to say because it isn't about in-depth storytelling, it's about the shiny-shiny things. So because nobody actually reads these reviews & only looks at the scores, here's a story about a bunny rabbit:<br/><br/>Floppity, The Rotten Rabbit.<br/><br/>Floppity & Flappity were rabbit twins. They would play all day & sleep all night. They liked to play in Mr Cheek's garden because the large rhubarb & cabbage patch made for excellent hiding. They would take turns to hide & have such fun trying to outwit one-another.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, hide & seek wasn't the only reason they liked to play in Mr Cheek's garden, as the fruit & vegetables Mr Cheek grew were exceedingly yummy. However, Mr Cheek wasn't best pleased to discover Floppity & Flappity had been gnawing on his fruit & veg. In fact he got very angry and laid snares around the garden to entrap Floppity & Flappity.<br/><br/>Now children, snares are string and stake devices designed to capture a bunny rabbit by it's neck or foot. The more the bunny-rabbit struggles, the tighter the snare grips. This results in a lack of blood to the appendage caught in said device. For example: If the snare is around the bunny-rabbit's neck the bunny rabbit will suffocate or on occasion break its neck in the panic which ensues entrapment.<br/><br/>One day Floppity & Flappity got into an argument whilst playing in Mr Cheek's garden. Flappity was unhappy that Floppity was mocking his name, for Flappity wasn't actually Flappity's real name, it was Brian. Brian had gained the name Flappity from Floppity for displaying a nervous disposition:<br/><br/>""You're always flapping, Flappity."" Floppity said sneeringly.<br/><br/>""No I'm not, er, I just like to think things through, which is hard to do when you keep pressurising me."" Replied Brian.<br/><br/>""Flappity (Floppity sneered once more) just pick a bloody cabbage leaf & eat it! Old man Cheek will be along in a second with his shotgun, remember what happened to mother"".<br/><br/>At this Flappity snapped.<br/><br/>""Don't you! Don't you ever talk about mother again! It was you who made her go back into the garden to retrieve the cabbage leaf that you dropped! <br/><br/>Floppity looked at his irate twin & with the demeanor of a clergyman giving Sunday prayers, he methodically replied, ""Calm-down Flappity old chum, stop flapping."" <br/><br/>""Cock!"" Flappity cracked-back.<br/><br/>""Qué pasa"" Floppity replied.<br/><br/>BANG! As buck-shot flew through the emerald-lit undergrowth of cabbage utopia, so did Floppity & Flappity. Like two grey wigs shot from a cannon they sped to the outskirts of the garden in an instinctive lust for life. Flappity got to the hole in Mr Cheek's garden fence first, but instead of darting through to safety, he stopped & slid a loose fence-post across the exit, into which Floppity charged.<br/><br/>Dazed, Floppity got to his feet, ""let me through brother, quick!""<br/><br/>""What's my name?"" Greeted Floppity's call for help.<br/><br/>Floppity looked around in a panic, then screamed, ""There's no time for this, let me through now Flappity.""<br/><br/>""What's my name?"" Came once more from behind the fence.<br/><br/>""Bri...."". Floppity's response was cut short.<br/><br/>Before Floppity could finish the name that Flappity so longed to hear, another shot pumped from Mr Cheek's gun, not only peppering Floppity with holes, but Flappity too through the fence. As the buck-shot ridden rabbits lay grasping at the final cabbage-leaves of life, Floppity could hear Flappity faintly murmur through the fence, ""dick...head""."

Well, that's what they do and we are all born within their system.<br/><br/>Fact.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe is a representation of a posh fella who's realised, with his access to resources, he could create a new society. And so he did. But, he didn't consider the feelings (and therefore actions) of willful people like Furiosa. The flaming guitar man is a social motivation thing. He egged the warriors, under Immortan Joe's control, on. It makes sense to me.<br/><br/>Immortan Joe also created a religion that would motivate his warriors to sacrifice themselves to his cause. Hence the chrome mouth, Val Halla thing. He's a bright bloke. Look, how many people have died for ""King and country"" or ""americuh and freedum"" or ""the emperor (Japan, China, England)""? The chrome mouth nonsense makes sense to me as does the guitar dude. If I created a society, I would use sonic, visual and religious motivators too. Blatantly.<br/><br/>The film is a bit deeper than people realise at first glance. However, that said, Miller is fantanstic at visualisation - just look at Mad Max 1!! It is a shame that ""Hollywood"" denied the essence of Miller's deep point - But IT IS STILL THERE.<br/><br/>Yeah alright, the deaths aren't as personal as they are in the original films. But of course not. This isn't an indie project like Mad Max was (you should watch Mad Max IN THE Australian VERSION!!!!!!) to see what I mean. Nevertheless, Tom Hardy does express Max well.<br/><br/>In this film however, Max is not a central role. There is very little ""character development"" or ""story arc"". But this is a film that shows our beloved Max dealing with the ""here and now"" of a future predicament he finds himself in, much to his chagrin.<br/><br/>Psychologically, this movie doesn't explore deep Human developmental characteristics in a ""thespian"" Al Pacino way, but it does strike a chord, especially with those poor girl's plight.<br/><br/>I found this film to be curious and fun. OK, it's not as good as Mad Max or The Road Warrior. In fact, I feel that this film would have been brilliant if Miller had secured Aussie entrepeneur and Aussie corporate investment, but such a film would have taken a long while to establish itself as a crazy, violent classic. What would you (really) do if you had to persuade people to cough up their wealth or if wealthy people said, ""do this, do this, we'll throw our money at you"" ?<br/><br/>Obviously, the second case happened - after some persuasion. This does make the movie appear a lot like an American mass consumption movie -but it still exists, and so many people spent some of their working lives to make the movie happen. I'm glad and grateful they did.<br/><br/>Mad Max, Fury Road is alright. It isn't great, though. Well, I like it, but the old movies are way cooler."

","Mad Max: Fury Road is jam packed with non-stop action and chase sequences, but the seriously lacking story line resulted in a movie with no depth or real character investment. This is a shame because the little bit of back story teased was engaging and could have been developed into something that would have left an impression beyond explosions and crashes. The imagery, set, costumes, stunts and visual effects are impressive and if you're looking to be entertained for two hours with high energy trucks, suped-up cars, motorcycles and creepy humanesque things going boom, then this is the movie for you.

","i came into theaters to see this movie hoping that it would be absolutely amazing, as thats what all of the critics and the freaking 8.7 rating on IMDb said. but honestly, i don't see what all of the hype is about. sure, all of the effects were pretty cool and the action scenes were entertaining, but at the end of the day, what is it? its a movie about a post apocalyptic car chase that has a couple battles while they are driving. the characters weren't that in- depth, and they had little development. and i have not enough knowledge about the little civilization that immortan joe has that they overthrow at the end to actually be rooting for them. the acting was relatively good, and the three main characters, portrayed by charlize theron, tom hardy, and nicholas hoult were well played, but i wasn't that enthralled in the movie. and i was expecting more action that i got. and it wasn't as gruesome as i expected. probably shouldn't have been rated r. it really wasn't that gory or sexual, and i don't remember any swears. some scenes were very well done, though. but if all the scenes were done as well as those, i'd definitely like this movie a lot more. maybe its because i didn't watch it in 3D?"

","Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that portrays a future dystopia where chaos lingers amongst every part of the world.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a character known as Max (Hardy), who is captured by a race of people, obsessed with plunging resources. The race is run by a dictator called Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne), that promises a Valhalla-style heaven to his fallen warriors.<br/><br/>Eventually, Max escapes his imprisonment but winds up with Furiosa (Theron) & Immortan Joe's wives; the group have to collaborate to escape Immortan Joe, whilst also finding a way to return to Furiosa's homeland, where it may still be possible for people to live in a sustainable manor.<br/><br/>Now, the film does have great CGI, whilst the music included is very apt, specifically tailored to each scene. The best thing about this movie was definitely the action, with the final action scene being one of the best & longest action sequences I have watched throughout!<br/><br/>The film, however, I just feels lacks something. The character himself, Max, whilst I understand he is the kind of superhero that is a man of few words, did not come across to me effectively & because of that, I did not feel his pain, anguish and actually did not care about him that much. I can't help but liken Max to Riddick from 'The Chronicles of Riddick' but I have to say that I felt Riddick himself was not only cooler, but the way he was presented I cared a lot more about him. Also, the whole concept that they left the Citadel to just then go back just does not seem right to me. Finally, I understand this is just a movie, but the amount of times Max survives impending doom, well, it is slightly unbelievable, even for a superhero!"

","It took me nearly a month and a half to finally see this movie, and that's mainly because I am not into post-apocalyptic movies. They literally depress me as there's very little to look forward to in any of their finales. But, I gave this a shot, and every single thing my friends had posted about this, couldn't have been any truer. This movie was unyielding, merciless and, yeah, furious with its action and almost exclusively non-CGI visuals and stunts. While I mentioned I'm not a post-apocalyptic movie guy, I'm less a CGI guy. So, this was refreshing. <br/><br/>The story was void and what was on screen wouldn't confuse a 3-year- old, but the whole point of this movie is to see strong leads and an absolute roller coaster of a car chase downyou guessed it, a Road of Fury. <br/><br/>Theron was excellent, as always, and Hardy, though good, was mostly just present. The real star of the movie was the superb and extremely long, albeit welcomed, detailed action scenes. So many for so long, that you probably have 10-15 minutes in the two hours to catch your breath.<br/><br/>Wasn't a fan of the connection to part three. The never-ending battle in Max's head to give him some depth. I give them kudos for attempting to add development and understanding, but it came off like a deep background story for a Friday the 13th teen that's just gonna distract what we bought our ticket for.<br/><br/>Strictly for action and I mean REAL ACTION – phooey on CGI, and nothing else, totally recommended.

","Mad Max Fury Road takes elements you might expect to find in any rock concert that utilities lots of heavy metal props and tricks and marries it up to a hard core, petrol head driven world of ordered, mechanized, post apocalyptic chaos.<br/><br/>This is a highly visual film. There is an economy of dialogue. Instead, the actions of the key protagonists tell the story that needs to be told. As such, its hard to offer up much insight into the quality of acting, as there is not really a lot of acting, as such, on offer. <br/><br/>That said, this films works well because it adheres to its action formula.

","Through sand, metal and blood, I bore witness to the intensity and chaotic world that is Mad Max: Fury Road. With a run time of 120 mins, I found myself immersed in a world based on instinct, survival and carnage, it was evident, the world was broken, charred and without remorse and The Mastermind George Miller's vision of a post- apocalyptic world engrosses us and allows us in an experience like none felt since the release of one of his earlier films, Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior. Though being released 30 years after the last movie Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, this fourth installment in the franchise has cemented itself as a cinematic masterpiece, both visually and as a story. After leaving the theater I felt myself wanting more, believe it or not, I walked out having,""A lovely Day."" In the introduction of the film we hear after a short we hear static accompanied with a narrative echoing the events that have that have transpired decades precluding the events of this film, we meet Max Rockatansky(Tom Hardy) a lost remnant of an already perished civilization, he is quickly dashed in a chase for survival. At that point we are shown glimpses of that grim that has over-run the planet, minutes later we see Max tagged and locked away in a cage; being used as nothing more than a blood bag for our next and if not one of our most memorable characters Nux who is played by the talented Nicholas Hoult, a war boy who's sole purpose in life like his many brothers is to gain the approval of their surrogate father and idol Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) the villain and main antagonist. This fuels him and many other war boys like him to gather their war vehicles and witness their way into Valhalla. ( Nux: I live, I die. I LIVE AGAIN!) Before going any further, I also have to make mention to the key protagonist in this film and Fury Roads proposed heroine and gladiator the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). She in my opinion would be the very result if Wonderwoman and the Terminator decided to have a baby, pure aggression driven with un-wavered purpose to rescue the five wives (breeders) held captive by Immortan Joe and transport them to the ""Green Place"". The film brings all these characters together and molds them into an artwork unrivaled by any other post-apocalyptic action film in the last decade. You may ask yourself, why so much hype?<br/><br/>I pose this question to you, have you seen Mad Max: Fury Road? If you haven't stop what ever it is that you are doing now and do your adult life some justice and go to your nearest movie theater and watch this film and after you have done that; and witnessed the masterpiece and epic gospel that this film is; go tell your friends, your co- workers, f**k it get some boxes cut it up and walk around with a sign around your neck and a megaphone in hand preaching to all who have either eyes or ears to go watch this movie. Now that my rant is out of the way, Mad Max Fury Road is a rare film, the whole idea or premise has been tried time and again, but never in this scale or magnitude. I myself was brought back to the feeling of emotion with each death, however minor the characters were, you could feel everyone's struggle for survival or their cry to be immortalized as their deaths bore witness to fruitful carnage. Tossing feministic or misogynistic views aside we as an audience are able to experience strong leads from both genders and trust me in this review I try hard not to spoil the movie for you as I truly wish for you to experience the beauty that this film is. It's a film that has layers, yet doesn't condo lude or go off point, it steers you in a no holds bard adrenaline rush of visual spectacle and story commingled into one, as the characters not only fight for their lives and freedom, but also to maintain their grip on humanity, we are not things, this film is littered with memorable quotes, an awe- inspiring score and the camera work is spectacular. I didn't go to film school, but this is how I wish to one day make movies. With all said and done and all bias tossed aside I give Mad Max: Fury road 5 out of 5 stars."

This movie is a must for all action loving audience and this movie experience is worthy every penny. So why only 7 stars?<br/><br/>I would love to give 10 of them, but there are some WEAK SIDES of the movie: 1. TOM HARDY AS MAD MAX - I was disappointed by Tom Hardy in Child 44 and the performance in Mad Max just confirmed that. Mel Gibson as Mad Max was kind of crazy guy. Tom Hardy is somehow teleported Bane from Batman. 2. THE BAD GUYS - it is visually very attractive to watch the road battles, however, you are missing any scary or nasty part watching the bad guys (e.g compared to Bane & Joker in Batman. The different tribes could be described more precisely, perhaps even showing their home bases. 3. HAPPY ENDING - I know there is always happy end. However, finding a new place for a quiet living somewhere at a seaside would be fine, as well. No need for Greenpeace Happy Ending.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, go to a cinema and enjoy this action masterpiece."

","Mad Max Fury Road comes racing at you like a steam train with nitro boosters. From the get go you have action that thunders at you and there are few stops to take a deep breath.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is our mostly reticent hero who seems to play second fiddle to the real heroine Charlize Theron, as the pair get entangled to help a set of 'wives' to escape to some hoped for land. Chasing them across the barren desert is the warlord 'husband' with his masses of punk underlings ready to die for him.<br/><br/>You get explosions, smashes, blood and bullets. Yet underneath is a story that is enjoyable, the action and few moments of respite paint an interesting picture that makes for a story. It's very much a live graphic novel, and it is actually a complete break from the norm of late (thankfully).<br/><br/>Probably the stand out is the settings. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful scenery and well used lighting. That makes is all a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The only issue is that it can get heavy going, and the action scenes so long it can get exhausting.

"ericrnolan","7","0","7","17 June 2015"," This is like a modern ""Ben Hur"" (1959) on acid.
","Dear Lord, Charlize Theron is a fantastic actress. It's amazing what she can communicate with just her facial expressions and line delivery, even when her dialogue is sparing and simplistic. She's also a superb physical actress, has great scene presence and is stunningly beautiful. Why not simply call this movie ""Furiosa?"" It's really that character's story; the titular ""Mad Max"" says and does little that is plot-relevant. He is a superfluous character who is here only to attract the fanbase for the original ""Mad Max"" movies.<br/><br/>Theron is one of two things that ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has going for it. The other is pure spectacle. I don't love this movie the way that everyone else seems to (I'd give it a 7 out of 10), but I really did enjoy the action, special effects, costume, prop and set design. This is like a modern ""Ben Hur"" (1959) on acid — the characters, weapons, sets and vehicles look great. This movie is like a really good heavy metal album cover made into a feature- length film.<br/><br/>My attention wandered, though. The action is often difficult to follow, thanks to too much Michael Bay-type directing. Tom Hardy is really just a one-note character as Max, despite efforts to render him in depth with cliché flashbacks of a lost family. And I liked this guy a hell of a lot in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012); I thought he made the masked Bane a great villain with physical acting that compensated well for an obscured face.<br/><br/>I submit that this is a somewhat brainless movie that barely qualifies as science fiction. We have a sparse opening montage that tells us about world-ending wars for resources, and then the rest of the movie is really just an extended gladiator battle in the desert with baroquely costumed bad guys. It's like a monster truck rally.<br/><br/>It's sometimes fun, but it doesn't make a great film. The good guys are too thinly drawn to engender viewer sympathy; the bad guys are too cartoonish to be scary. You also need to turn your brain off, lest certain questions occur to you:<br/><br/>1) Doesn't gasoline degrade over time? I don't think it would be worth warring or bartering for after a year or so, unless there are oil rigs and complex refineries to seek and develop it. We see evidence of neither.<br/><br/>2) What do people eat, out here in the never-ending desert? The disappearance of ""green places"" is a plot point; there is no arable land.<br/><br/>3) How often does this dictator (""Big Joe"" or something?) give his subjects water? Once per day? I thought dehydration killed or immobilized people fairly quickly.<br/><br/>4) Where the heck are we? I hear a lot of United Kingdom accents.<br/><br/>5) I'm pretty sure that blood transfusions don't work like that. And even if they did, you'd see a hell of a lot of opportunistic infections in such unsterile conditions.<br/><br/>6) Why does one young woman immediately fall in love with a sleeping barbarian whose teeth are spray-painted silver?<br/><br/>Whatever. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie; I'm just suggesting that it's a little overrated given its current accolades by fans. It's fun enough, if you're in the mood for a ""Mad Max"" movie."
"pyrocitor","9","0","9","15 June 2015"," A boomerang powered by nitroglycerin (or: ""It's FuriOsa, not FurioSA"")
","Early on in Mad Max: Fury Road, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the film's gas-mask- huffing overlord (don't call him 'Bane 2.0' or you will have Tom Hardy's permission to die) jeers at his pitiful subjects not to ""become addicted to water, as it will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence"". The warning may as well have extended to the film's audience to not get addicted to breathing. George Miller's retread of his apocalyptic '80s asphalt nightmare is arguably even more bonkers than its predecessors, bludgeoning viewers at such a gleefully manic pace that holding one's breath becomes as much the norm as the pounding sands of the film's eternal desert. The film, undeniably, is 'capital-M movie-making' at its most batsh*t, as Miller, finally gifted with a $150 million budget, orchestrates his apocalyptic fever-dream with frantic energy and furious passion. <br/><br/>The film undeniably takes some acclimatizing to. No time is wasted on extraneous exposition; after a brief, grim Tom Hardy voice-over, the viewer is immediately thrust into a world of bone-crunching fight scenes, demented –and often deformed, or otherwise grotesque - characters hooting and bellowing while attempting to kill one another, constantly covered in sand, accompanied by the 'Inception-on-twelve-cups-of-coffee' soundtrack by Tom Holkenborg, constantly blaring like a car horn from Hell (so absurdly fun that hearing it on cinema speakers is worth the admission price alone). The prospect of spending nearly two hours in this world initially seems intolerable. And this is all before anyone even starts a car. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Miller's wild ride is one absolutely worth taking. Amidst the constant cacophony of overstimulation framing an almost cunningly simplistic plot (""drive that way, then drive back""), Miller has crafted a fascinatingly thought out society, and allows discrete scraps of bloodbaths over water and oil, feudal politics, and ramshackle, cultish spirituality to hit the viewer like bugs on a windshield. And, lest it seem the film had begun on too calm a note, the insane momentum steadily picks up – chase upon chase upon explosive spears and flamethrower-guitars and concussive sandstorms and blood and screaming and swallowing silver spray-paint and drums drums DRUMS. <br/><br/>until it finally quiets down, perfectly timed to just avoid audience heart attacks. All of a sudden, we're watching a different film. Quiet, reflective, poignant, and gently desolate – a softly heartfelt interlude of a skeletal matriarchal society (credited as consultant is Eve Ensler of Vagina Monologues fame, of all people). All of a sudden, the contrast to the blaring first half of the film is striking: this is what's at stake, and worth the spectacularly named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron)'s mad dash to flee the dystopic wasteland with Immortan Joe's imprisoned sex slaves in tow. There is so little beauty left, the film suggests, that the few dregs of it are worth fighting for, worth giving anything for. It's an inspiring message, which, curiously enough, even extends to its antagonists: sadistic rapist overlord Joe is genuinely devastated and grieves when one of his harem, bearing his unborn child, is killed in the chase, giving his muscle-bound behemoth of a son (Nathan Jones) the chance to issue the most oddly sympathetic line in the film: ""I had a baby brother, and he was perfect in every way."" By the time the film ricochets to its even more haywire climax (almost exclusively filmed with practical car chases and stunts, and all the more aggressively thrilling for it), it has earned its insanity on an almost primal level, with the fate of the world feeling like it actually rests on one of the most insane car chases ever filmed. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy has always been at his best when punching things ferociously, muttering like an unhinged maniac, so it's impossible to imagine a more perfect piece of casting as a post-Mel Max. Theron's Furiosa easily grabs the show by the horns, not only perfectly essaying the quintessential badass, but imbuing her with more aching emotion and raw talent than anyone would ever have expected out of a Mad Max sequel(?). The film's most joyful scenes involve the two of them forming their uneasy alliance, taking turns passing guns and the steering wheel back and forth as they clamber over one another in impeccably choreographed symmetry, forced to collaborate not out of trust, but more out of 'who's more likely to kill me first'. Each of the quintet of 'wives' – particularly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zoë Kravitz – impress, providing crucial doses of indignant humour, courage and pathos alike. Even the normally grating Nicholas Hoult coughs up a compelling character; his Nux, a teenage Gollum desperate for validation like a kicked puppy, becomes steadily more sympathetic and likable as he evidences the film's most evident emotional arc. <br/><br/>In an age where too many audiences sneer at the CGI-bloated contemporary blockbuster, Fury Road provides enough of a tangible, cathartic glut of chaos and melodrama for even the most jaded to feel like they've finally watched a MOVIE again. By the time the viewer is finally left with a moment to catch their breath, they are caught between wanting to pass out as if they've just spent hours at the gym, or prepared to burst into a round of manic applause. Mad Max: Fury Road is a gloriously committed budget-bloated B-movie that is more engrossing and infectiously fun that it has any right to be. To paraphrase one of the film's most bombastically emotional moments: ""WITNESS IT.""<br/><br/>-8.5/10"

"niallwade","7","0","5","30 May 2015"," A great film overall, however, a few minor flaws that may be easily overlooked
","Unfortunately at this current time I have not been able to indulge at pleasure of viewing the original work of George Miller (Original Mad Max trilogy), though with the modern Twist of Mad Max Fury Road I can comment on my opinions are of this film, not of the franchise.<br/><br/>Firstly I would like to bring to light the out-shadowing of Max. As we all know the character of Max is of course borderline insane. I love the way Miller has presented the audience with this information with hallucinations of what seems a family member, and a Quote he says something along the lines as hope leads people into insanity. Now we know a little snippet of Max, I think we all expected him to be a silent bad ass like he was back in the original films (As I have been told). Though it seems that Imperator Furiosa (portrayed by Charlize Theron) in a sense takes Max's bad ass attribute. Though Max is still a hardened warrior and at best a veteran surviver, its as though Max is playing a supporting character to Furiosa, however, that is my opinion of the subject.<br/><br/>One other aspect of the film that I would like to bring to light is that for the whole duration of analysing the film, I felt that it was wholly just a massive chaotic car chase. It is more than bearable, however. With dynamic shots and the sense of visual story telling there is much more at large than just distraction. There is a real element of narrative told by action and emotion, even if the dialogue is vague. <br/><br/>As a film student focusing on becoming a film editor, I really devote most of my notes to the post production of the film and I must say that I am indeed impressed. All of the transitions to different scenes are staggering. Especially the the sand storm scene. Not only is the colour correction utterly stunning with flashes of a deep blue, but it is the end that captivates me the most. As we reach the climatic end of the very action orientated scene, the transition to the next scene is a slow burning flair reaching the end of its brightness and I love that to slow down the pace of the film a really good job there guys. <br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers of any sort this concludes my review of the fantastic Mad Max Fury Road film. I would highly recommend people of the action genre to see the film at an cinematic experience. I know that I haven't really focused upon acting skills and other aspects of the film. I wanted to give a little taste of what the film has to offer. So as a film maker myself I say to you fantastic people. View this fantastic film. I will leave the rest to you."
