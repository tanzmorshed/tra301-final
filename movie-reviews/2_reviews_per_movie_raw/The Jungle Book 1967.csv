"gogoschka-1","10","65","75","20 December 2013"," Best animated feature of Disney's golden era - and what a killer soundtrack!
","There aren't many animated Disney films I don't like, basically every single one of them until the end of the seventies was amazing. But for me, this is the one which stands out. <br/><br/>Sadly, Disney himself never got to see the finished film (he died during the production), but this is one he would have been proud of. Crafted beautifully and with attention to every little detail, from the way the different animal species move to the colorful jungle backgrounds. <br/><br/>Wolfgang Reitherman has directed some of the studio's best - but here he has created his masterpiece. Outstanding animation, fantastic characters - and what a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>A joy for every generation to discover anew (my 9-year old nephew currently has a bit of a Shere Khan fixation), I guess I will never outgrow this timeless classic. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","In case you're wondering, I'm 25 and my favourite films of all time include Heat, Once Upon a Time in the West and Apocalypse Now. This is just a pointer to how, considering the film I'm writing about, eclectic a true film fan's taste has to be. I'll start with one statement: this film should be compulsory viewing for every child. If, at the end of this film, you're face is not permanently disfigured from smiling, there's something wrong with you. Everything about this film is enjoyable. The characters so loving, the songs so memorable; everything is so uplifting. I first saw this as a child and right then I loved it, but not until you reach a certain age do you realise how much a film can affect you. Every character has something about them that you cannot fail to love. Baloo and King Louie are obvious - they are there for light relief, but even the sinister Kaa the snake and Sheer Khan the tiger are lovable in their own ways. Mainly I put this down to the voice cast and the way they portray their characters. Everybody with a good knowledge of film knows that Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in Toy Story and that Mike Myers was Shrek, but who knows who provided the voice of Baloo? It shouldn't matter and, as is the case with The Jungle Book, it doesn't. The characters are what is important. Character and plot are the only things that matter in great films and this film has that theory at its bedrock. If you have a child, sit them down to watch this and I guarantee they will be transfixed. I'm 25 and I make sure I watch this every 12 months. Age wise I'm an adult, but I'm still a child when I see this on screen, and that's the way it should be."

","The Jungle Book, one of Disney's ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. I'll admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my fav's though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.<br/><br/>Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the fun-loving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and won't rest 'till he kills him. <br/><br/>Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the ""bear"" necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that we've all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disney's most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldn't be surprised if he was Scar's inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you haven't seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, it's worth the money. It's a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, it's a good time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"White Dolphin","Null","52","84","11 November 2000"," One of Disney's Most Memorable Movies
","The Jungle Book is one of Disney's most memorable animated movies. It's based on the ""Mowgli"" stories by Rudyard Kipling (who also wrote the famous Just So Stories). Like in most Disney films, Mowgli is an orphan. Bagheera the panther find him and he is raised by a family of wolves. That is until Shere Khan the tiger comes back to the jungle...<br/><br/>One thing I love about The Jungle Book is the villains. In most Disney movies you have one villain, sometimes with stupid and funny sidekicks who get bossed around all the time. But The Jungle Book offers three villains all who want Mowgli all for themselves. There is King Louie the king of the monkeys. He kidnaps Mowgli but doesn't really want to harm him, which perhaps makes him the least cruelest of the three. All he wants is to be like man as he puts it in the wonderful song that will want to make you get up and dance: ""I Wanna Be Like You"". More specifically he wants to know the secret on how to make fire. Then there's Shere Khan, the tiger who comes back to the jungle and is the reason that Bagheera and the wolves (and eventually Baloo) want to take him back to the ""man village"". Shere Khan is very swift and cruel but also very calm about his cruelty and not the least bit temperamental. However his characteristics do change at his last screen appearance, and frankly I'd be freaking out to if I had a burning branch stuck to my tail (heck I'd freak out if I just had a tail). Shere Khan hates mankind and of course Mowgli is man. Last but definitely not least (my favorite of the three)- Kaa, the snake, and a very big one I might add. See- King Louie wants to be like Mowgli, Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli and Kaa wants to... eat Mowgli. He has a very big mouth which would enable him to eat Mowgli but it does him bad too- he talks to much and then never gets the chance to eat Mowgli. <br/><br/>Other than these three memorable villains there's Mowgli himself, the man-cub (who by the way was voiced by Bruce Reitherman, son of the director of this film- and many other Disney greats: Wolfgang Reitherman). There's the elephants, the vultures (who are actually nice and quite humorous too), Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther. Songs include King Louie's (who was voiced by Louie Parma) ""I Wanna Be Like You"". Kaa's ""Trust in Me"" (which no one should... trust in Kaa that is). And of course Baloo's ""The Bare Necessities"".<br/><br/>As for the racist overtone- that's one of the silliest things I've heard. The Jungle Book can be enjoyed by anyone of any age (...and any race)."
"iftekhar25","10","61","100","9 May 2002"," All-time classic
","I grew up on this animation, and all I can say is that no classical animation-style Disney movie till date, not Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame or any other that you can think of comes THIS close as to compare itself with this all-time classic.<br/><br/>A brilliant combination of wonderful voices, magnificent characters, songs that will keep you humming for weeks this is certainly the peek of animation storytelling. It doesn't get any better than this.<br/><br/>I give this one 10/10 without a second thought."
"chrisbishop5000","8","9","12","29 November 2007"," BAGHEERA: ""It's Not funny!"" I agree (to an extent) but that is Not all I think of this film trusst me!
","From the very first minute that Walt Disney conceived of ""The Jungle Book"" he promised for the sakes of general audiences that he'd absolutely Pile Rudyard Kipling's classic book with energetic, toe-tapping, show-stopping music and unforgettable crazy songs though many people around him had doubts for the original novel was apparently quite serious. Throughout his entire career he had proved so many critics and members of his crew wrong, that he Could enhance the familiar yet ageing qualities of the original tellings of many of the world's most beloved classic books by putting his own magical, musical, charming, ambitious nature into them and would then transfer his versions onto film. Not once had he failed to prove the world and the world's opinions wrong in all his life and ""The Jungle Book"" was no exception. It's got to be his own happiest, most carefree, most musical adventure movie to date! I haven't read the book yet because I don't even have it though I do have a shortened Ladybird book of it but I haven't read that so I can't judge any inaccuracies or changes to the story but I'm positive there are some alterations - all for the best, of course. I must say that Mowgli is quite rebellious here and impudent. He's always running away when things don't go his way, I've noticed he hits and threatens a lot of his friends and yet they still like him! Baloo is - as everyone sees him - so lovable and kind. For the first time in a Disney film, Sterling Holloway provides the voice for a villain - the murderous Kaa the python snake. For a happy-go-lucky cartoon, I think it's unpleasant how a bonkers snake could randomly get a little boy into his deadly coyles (at night at one point), hypnotize him and prepare to eat him! But at least Mowgli gets the last laugh by causing the python to have a knotted tail and shifting him off his tree. My favourite dance number has got to be with King Louis of the Apes in the ancient ruins (""I Wanna Be Like You"") and how all the crazy dancing sends the ruins tumbling. My second favourite is ""Bare Necessities"". In my opinion, the part where the mildly poor comedy comes in most of all is with Colonol Haithi and his elephants and his whiny wife; poor Verna Felton had Winifred the elephant as her final role on film. Colonol Haithi is supposed to be a no-nonsense, snooty leader but my eyes (and ears come to think of it) tell me that he is just a totally absurd loud-mouth. If there is any character in this film who won't stand for any nonsense it's Bagheera! I know that all he really wants is for Mowgli to be safe and therefore return to the man-village but he was certainly a miserable old busybody after the King Louis scene. He had the cheek to break up that special bond between Mowgli and Baloo that so many people have grown to love! Charming! Recently, I bought the twin DVD release of the Platinum Edition of ""The Jungle Book"" from Woolworths and it was just amazing! Better than most Disney DVDs today (even though they're not bad themselves)"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","21","33","13 February 2009"," this movie's a legend
","It isn't completely faithful to the book, but for a good reason. The book has bits that you can't have in an animation. The animation is beautiful, the backgrounds rich in colour, and the characters beautifully drawn. The story is a very simple one, yet effective, and allows the songs and characters to take force. The songs and music by the Sherman Brothers perfectly match the breeziness of the film, with classics such as "" Bare Neccessities"" and ""Wanna Be like you"". Unlike some people, I liked the vulture barbershop, excellent harmonies. And what a talented voice-cast. Phil Harris was hilarious as Baloo, and Sebastian Cabot was brooding as Bagheera. Reitherman's son was good as Mowgli, and Louis Prima(who's not black so the racist overtones idea is ridiculous) was a riot as Louis. The real star was the perfectly cast George Sanders as the frightening and calculating Shere Khan. This is fantastic, if a little short, and avoid the sequel! 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","The Jungle Book is a great classic animation movie. It is famously known for being the last film that Walt Disney himself ever got to work on. He died while the film was in production, and sadly never got to see the outcome of the movie. The animation in this film is excellent, and the songs and performances are even better! Each character has something about him or her that makes you like them. The movie seems to be very cheery and happy. I remember watching this movie as a little kid, and I absolutely loved it! I give The Jungle Book a 10/10."
"SupahDuck","Null","28","49","5 October 2002"," What racist overtones? Don't jump to conclusions....
","It may interest readers of these reviews that the voice actor who played King Louie is not in fact black.<br/><br/>If you follow this helpful link right here at imdb ( http://us.imdb.com/Name?Prima,%20Louis ), you'd find that Louis Prima is in fact white, and was quite well known at the time for his musical repertoire, of which the song ""I Wanna Be Like You"" is a prime example. I don't think he was chosen for that role because of how 'black' he sounded, but rather for his musical abilities, and how that fit into the character of King Louie.<br/><br/>As with all the other voice actors chosen for this film, Walt Disney made perfect choices.... so much so that the film works perfectly: animation, voices and story all mesh together perfectly to make one of his best films, precisely because it *is* so simple, yet effective.<br/><br/>No need for fancy computer graphics here."
"tiyusufaly","10","41","79","21 September 2002"," The Best Disney Film Ever!
","When I was a little boy growing up in St. Louis, I loved the Jungle Book. I used to watch it every day. You hear that? EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! I have seen nearly every Disney film, and not one of them has beaten out Uncle Walt's last supervised animated motion picture. The only one that I believe comes close is Aladdin (And no, I haven't forgotten about The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King). The musical score is probably the best ever. The Bare Necessities, I Wanna Be Like You, Trust In Me, I could go on and on. I wish Disney would make films like they did in 1967 rather than today (I mean Atlantis: The Lost Empire? Please!!!). In conclusion, this is by far the best Disney film ever made, period! 1000000000000000000/10"
"michael_the_nermal","7","6","8","13 July 2006"," Well Done Disney Animation
","This was the last cartoon feature Disney was directly involved with before his death, and it is one of his better films. The animation appears a bit dated, in large part because it appears to use the Xeroxing method, but that doesn't detract from the great story Disney had created, or the voice actors who add life to this movie. The film's standout is obviously Phil Harris as Baloo the Bear. A veteran of old time radio, such as ""The Jack Benny Show,"" Harris brought his comic talents to the fore and provided a very lively portrayal of happy-go-lucky, free-spirited lovable oaf, which is a welcome contrast to the cute anthropomorphic animals Disney had a penchant for in ""Bambi,"" ""Cinderlla,"" and ""Dumbo."" The guy who does the voice of King Louie is also great, as is Sterling Holloway as the goofy villain Kaa; you might remember Holloway better as the original Winnie the Pooh. The Sherman Brothers did very well with lots of good songs, such as ""I Want to be Like You"" and ""Bare Necessities"" This is a great animated film for the whole family to enjoy."

","What can I say about The Jungle Book? It probably has the best songs of any Disney movie, it's full of wonderful animals such as Baloo the Bear and King Louie the ape and it has a great little character in Mowgli who was raised in the jungle (so I guess he's related to Tarzan).<br/><br/>This is a great story throughout and the songs were just wonderful. When I first watched this film I couldn't get the songs out of my head and just kept humming them to myself time after time.<br/><br/>There's plenty of creatures for fans of animals from snakes to elephants to a big bad tiger called Shere Khan (one of the best Disney villains ever).<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen The Jungle Book, may I suggest viewing it as soon as possible?"

","This is one of the best Disney cartoon films ever made, based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. A baby, or ""man cub"" is found by Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot). He decides to take it to a wolf family to look after him. As time goes by this man cub called Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman, son of the director) has grown with the wolves. Until the wolves discover that Sheer Khan the Tiger (George Sanders) had returned to the jungle. Now Bagheera is insistent on Mowgli returning to the Man Village where he will be safe from the Tiger. Mowgli is too happy in the jungle and wants to stay with his new found friend, the film's highlight, Baloo the Bear, voiced by singer Phil Harris. Unfortunately many parts of the jungle take Mowgli away, e.g. the monkeys. Another highlight of the film is King Louie, voiced by singer Louis Prima. Phil Harris has the good Oscar nominated song ""The Bare Necessities"" and Louis Prima has the song ""I Want To Be Like You"". It was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, it was number 7 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Films.

I recommend it for all ages, kids will find it funny, and will fall in love with characters like the friendly Balloo, the worriesome panther Ballugha's parental instincts, and the hopelessly incompetent Kaa.

The animation is pretty good, although Disney wasn't at its best design-wise in the 60s (or 70s).

","'The Jungle Book' is another colourful Disney classic. What really makes this one so lovable is its charismatic and funny characters. The story is straightforward and could have used some more development and depth. The animation is good but very two dimensional (the characters do not have shadows). Yet, the vibrant exotic colours of the animals and background stand out. The background sound could have used fascinating sounds of the jungle but instead what we get here is silence. Yet, in spite of all the flaws, I loved it. Balu and Bageera are awesome. They're like Mowgli's parents, Baloo being the fun parent and Bageera being the rather disciplined one. Of course there are the hilarious orangutans, the manipulative snake, the singing vultures, the military and the evil Shere Khan. I'm slightly disappointed that the adorable rhinoceros character was not included (check the deleted scenes). The songs are fun too. My favourite one is the Orangutan number.

","This adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's popular jungle-themed tome keeps it all light and ditches anything deeper than superficial. One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.<br/><br/>Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.<br/><br/>Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).<br/><br/>It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant. Baloo and Co. came back in TaleSpin 23 years later and secured their status among the most popular Disney characters."

","The Jungle Book is based off a book. Like HOND, I refuse to read it. The movie is awesome and I would like to keep it that way.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is the music. It's light-hearted and very upbeat compared to most Disney classics. The Bare Necessities is great, one of my favorite Disney songs. I wanna be like you is NOT RACIST! It's just a fun, upbeat song about an orange monkey wanting to be someone else who he is not. Kind of like middle school when most girls think they look terrible and they want to change for the better or worse. It can't be considered racist. Trust in Me is the worst villain song ever. Kaa just sounds so weird (I think Winnie the Pooh sounds awesome, but they have the same voice actor). The score is very good especially at the climax!<br/><br/>Here's the million dollar question: did The Jungle Book deserve a possible nomination of The Acadamy's Best Picture award? Some will say no because it's an animated film (umm... take a look at Beauty and the Beast (first animated film nominated) and The Lion King (won Best Picture at the Golden Globes), but they are from the 90's). I would say yes! Some of those films that were nominated sucked! The Jungle Book would get that award if the Acadamy didn't turn it down. So this is my POV about 1968's (maybe 1967) Best Picture Award.<br/><br/>What an awesome movie! My parents used to show me this movie all the time and we danced to the music and booed at Kaa!

","""The Jungle Book"" encompasses everything that I always wanted to see in an old hand-drawn animated film by Walt Disney. I saw many of Disney's masterpieces in my childhood, and now recently, I have begun to start watching them again several years since I last saw them. Take ""The Jungle Book"" for instance. It was one of my favorite Disney movies in my childhood, and yet I hadn't seen it in years until just a few moments ago. And now that I'm older and know more about the movie, I appreciate it and enjoy it even more than I believe I ever did as a kid.<br/><br/>First off, there is the absolute amazing animation done by Disney's studio. If I'm not mistaken, they were still using hand-drawn animation when they made ""The Jungle Book"" and if my guess is correct, it was masterful. It's amazing that artists could be so talented, so precise, and yet so creative at the same time to make things look so vivid and realistic. And they also bring depth and characterization to their 2-Dimensional characters with only a script to base their work off. All of the characters in ""The Jungle Book"" are amazingly created and fitted into the story, adapted with talented actors to perform the voices. And Disney used authenticity with several voices. The voice of Mowgli was performed by an actor of about the same age as the character. The other voices of the heedful Bagheera, the take-it-easy Baloo, sinister and even more so comical Kaa, and then Shere Khan, one of the most memorable Disney villains of all. George Sanders provided a perfect, purring and cold-hearted voice for the character, ultimately increasing the effect of the tiger to make up for his lack of screen time. Lines such as ""you're trying my patience"" and ""You should know that everyone runs from Shere Khan"" always make me think in my mind: this was perfect! After Shere Khan, my favorite character is Kaa the python with the hypnotic gaze. And he's not a frightening villain, but a funny one and therefore, a lovable villain.<br/><br/>There is one minor flaw in ""The Jungle Book"" which I find in a lot other Disney movies. Everything it this film is perfect, except for the fact that its running length is just not equal to its entertainment. In other words, it's about ten or twenty minutes too short. But I suppose this is justifiable for its age. Movies at its time weren't all that long and hand-drawn movies take a long time to put together because of the hand-drawn animation. Yet, this did not impact my enjoyment on the film as I watched it. The bottom line for this review is that ""The Jungle Book"" is one of the finest, if not the finest, of all of Walt Disney's films. It's too bad he didn't live long enough to see this one go to theaters and see the audiences cherish and love it."
"Jim Griffin","Null","3","5","28 December 2001"," Ignore the cynics - this is classic Disney
","The last time I watched The Jungle Book, I thought for about half a second that King Louie was a rather uncomfortable stereotype.  Given that white racists love the phrase `Get back to the jungle' and make comparisons to monkeys, a scatting orang-utan who desperately wants to be like a man seemed like either a dated character who'd never heard of political correctness, or a deliberately racist one who sat rather awkwardly among the otherwise saccharine sentiments.  But after reversing my lobotomy, I realised just how much I was talking out of my a**e, because Mowgli, who this awful, shameful black stereotype sings to, isn't white.  There's that theory shot to pieces. Add to that the fact that Baloo the bear scats alongside Louie, and that bears haven't been given the racist association that monkeys have been saddled with, and it becomes pretty obvious that people are reading into Louie a perversion that simply isn't there.  After all, if Louie is a racist character, then every British viewer should be disgusted to find that the villainous, murderous, savage Sher Khan is given an English accent despite living in a jungle in the middle of India.  My point being: shut up.<br/><br/>The same point goes for people who've complained that the female character who attracts Mowgli is desperately sexist because her song shows that her only ambitions are to be a wife to a handsome man and a cook to her children.  That argument ignores not only that this was a movie made in the 1960s, where a career girl was still far from the norm, but that it wasn't set in the present day anyway!  If Mowgli had spotted a girl on her way to the office where she'd compete with the best male executives on an equal salary, the movie would have entered a fantasy land less realistic than the one in which a bear can sing.<br/><br/>In truth, The Jungle Book boasts the kind of charm and innocence and magic that we used to associate with Disney ourselves, before the company began telling us about its charm and innocence and magic in every advert for every video it rams down our throats.  It's this genuine Disneyism that makes The Jungle Book a classic despite its wafer-thin plot.  Mowgli, a man-cub raised in the jungle by a family of wolves, is to be returned to the man-village to keep him safe from Sher Khan, a tiger whose fear of man's gun and fire, and whose links with the notorious Combat 18, make him a dangerous addition to the local population.  From there, the movie spends the remainder of its running time wandering around the jungle rather aimlessly, and its episodic structure means the movie sags at times while soaring at others.<br/><br/>Every scene with Baloo is a winner, and the King Louie episode is perhaps the most entertaining, but these are dragged down slightly by two rather repetitive scenes with Kaa the Snake, whose career hit its nadir with his infamous appearance with Britney Spears at the MTV Awards.  Your enjoyment of the two scenes with the Dawn Patrol depends entirely on how funny you find a forgetful elephant, and on how well you can forgive Colonel Hathi's crypto-fascist, militaristic obsession.  The lowest point is the sequence with the Beatles-lookalike vultures, managing to include the poorest characterisations, the least memorable song, and the most half-assed of ideas.  The vultures are clearly a nod to the Fab Four, but only one speaks with a Liverpudlian accent, and when they break into song, it's in the style of a barbershop quartet and not a rock and roll group.  The homage is therefore compromised and becomes pointless.<br/><br/>But The Jungle Book is more than the sum of its parts.  Its highlights may be unevenly distributed, but nothing can argue with the fact that I didn't stop smiling through the whole thing.  Baloo is the absolute star of the film, one of the great Disney characters that ranks alongside Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket and Mulan's Mushu, and it's his presence that accounts for most of the film's immense charm.  He has the best song, the best lines, and the best scenes, and his loveable slobbiness can't be praised highly enough. Even his entrance, where he strolls onto screen singing `Well it's a doo-be-de-doo, yes it's a doo-be-de-doo' is inexplicably hilarious!  I know it's not the greatest line of dialogue in the history of cinema, but it makes me laugh every time I hear it.<br/><br/>This is simply classic Disney.  Great characters, great songs, stunning animation, and a heart to shame most of the vacuous 90s output this generation has had to suffer."

","There is an interesting - possibly unintentional - racial subtext with this film, which ends with two of the lead characters returning whey they ""belong"". Maybe such things weren't intended with a cartoon film about singing bears who give boxing lessons, but it makes it one of the thematically more intriguing Disney offerings.<br/><br/>Technically this doesn't always look like it was made 25 years after Bambi - while the art has a certain elegance in places, it's also scrappy and looks almost pencil drawn at stages. This isn't an express criticism, as it gets by on charm, which it has a considerable supply of.<br/><br/>Centrepiece of the film is the sequence with King Louie, a jazz/scat singing orangutan. Although the idea of having someone possess the mannerisms of black culture while in the form of a monkey is a questionable feat, his signature song - wanting to appropriate the manner of another man in order to share in his freedoms is nicely sardonic for 1967.<br/><br/>However, if there's one criticism of the film that holds up, it's how episodic the whole thing is. Introducing a great villain like Shere Khan three quarters of an hour into the runtime is quite a novel feat, but other characters are picked up and dropped throughout, with very few constants. Louie doesn't appear again, and just as the film begins to wind down, we get some vultures with ""what's that supposed to be?"" English accents. It's telling how old-hat Disney could be at times in that what were inspired as parodies of the Beatles end up singing a Doo Wop number.<br/><br/>Ultimately while the film has touches of greatness, and is a very pleasing time-filler, the unevenness of the story progression causes it to feel a little flat when viewed as a whole."
"Foux_du_Fafa","7","4","8","20 April 2012"," Certainly a Disney classic but perhaps not one of the best
","""The Jungle Book"" was the last animated feature that Walt Disney worked on before his death, and the film's immense success probably helped prove there was an audience for Disney animation. The character animation is superb; it's no wonder why so many of today's top animators cite this as being among their favourite films. The laid-back, episodic nature of the story (far removed from Kipling's highly strung original, which Disney actually advised his staff NOT to read) allows for some delightfully entertaining scenes; the encounters with King Louie and the Liverpudlian vultures spring to mind. The characters also have a certain warmth about them that hasn't been seen in many Disney films before or since. The score is equally wonderful, and a good number of the songs - ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and ""The Bare Necessities"" in particular - have become standards.<br/><br/>Having said that, I can't help but find ""The Jungle Book"" to be rather slight, and perhaps even overrated. As far as I'm concerned, the aforementioned individual elements seem better than the film as a whole. In particular, the lack of structure is as much a curse as it is a blessing; for every engaging scene or two, there can be a truly boring scene. Regardless of these inferior aspects, ""The Jungle Book"" is a good film that rightly deserves the label of ""Disney classic""."

","The thing that usually makes me a hard sell with Disney movies is that they're synonymous with musicals Something like ""Beauty and the Beast"" overcomes this with no problem.

These are the kinds of songs you find yourself humming in the halls at work; I mean, really, can you think of a more pleasing ear worm than ""The Bare Necessities""? <br/><br/>It's not just the outstanding soundtrack, but the general upbeat mood this movie strikes. To this day, I love the back-and-forth between Baloo and Bagheera, and King Louie's sequence has to be some of the most fun you can have with one of these movies.

"MartinHafer","8","2","3","7 February 2015"," While it's not up to the standards of many of the earlier Disney films, it is quite enjoyable.
","I noticed one reviewer who called this film 'the best animated of the golden era'. Hmmm. I beg to differ. While I LIKE the film, the single biggest weakness is its animation. It's good but not at all of the same quality as earlier artistic triumphs such as ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"" and ""Peter Pan"" (among many others). So don't try to tell me that ""The Jungle Book"" is Disney animation at its best. It's a pared down form of animation--done with copy machines like ""101 Dalmatians"". I am NOT complaining about the use of Xerox machines instead of hand-drawing every scene but it did tend to make the films look a bit rougher. After all, Disney had to save money as production costs were skyrocketing and the public seemed to be embracing cheaper animation (hence the rise of UPA and Hanna-Barbara Studios).<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it has two big things going for it. First, the songs are mostly very, very good. You cannot hear ""Bare Necessities"" without bouncing along with the tune and several other songs are just plain fun. And, this brings me to the second reason- -the movie, over all, IS fun. You simply cannot watch it without smiling and enjoying yourself. Well done overall."

The boy isn't happy to leave the jungle. On the way, he encounters elephants led by Colonel Hathi, orangutans, Kaa the python and the irresponsible fun-loving bear Baloo.<br/><br/>It's a fun collection of memorable animal characters. The plot is a little random but I don't think that matters too much in this movie. Compared to its other Disney cohorts, this ranks slightly lower than the classics. The story just isn't that compelling. On the other hand, 'The Bare Necessities' is a great song and there is a childlike joy that permeates much of the movie."
"Atreyu_II","7","2","3","27 August 2007"," A movie that appeals to life
","The 19th animated Disney classic is, like the other Disney classics produced in the 60's, not one of their greatest. Yet, it is entertaining and great fun.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is an appeal to life and a hymn to life. They never say the words ""Hakuna Matata"" here, but there's no doubt that the ""Hakuna Matata"" philosophy from ""The Lion King"" is the same philosophy that we see here: a life full of joy, fun, no worries and which the problems are to be forgotten. In fact, it isn't any lie to tell that ""The Lion King"" was inspired by the idea of this movie.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is a traditional animated Disney classic. Although some of its designs look simple, the artwork is very good and full of ""life"", following the classic Disney's standards. The songs are full of life and rhythm, making one wanna dance at their sound (that's the case of ""Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You""). Speaking of this, I'm surprised that initially the song ""Bear Necessities"" wasn't going to be in the movie - I'm glad they changed their mind, because this song is so joyful and very important: after all, it symbolizes the main idea of the movie.<br/><br/>The characters aren't the very best on Disney, but they're still good enough. Baloo (the bear) adds a lot to this movie. He is a very cool bear, not to mention humorous and jolly. Baloo is probably the best character of this movie. And all this charm is combined with the inimitable voice of the legendary Phil Harris.<br/><br/>Bagheera is a more serious character than a funny one. Bagheera is wise and, to tell the truth, it's pleasant to see a black panther being portrayed as a wise character for once instead of another owl. Bagheera is voiced by one of Disney's legends, Sebastian Cabot (at his best here).<br/><br/>Mowgli is an alright man cub, but strangely his voice changes very much: during a while he has the voice of a teenager and suddenly he speaks with a more ""babyish"" voice - perhaps a sign that he was voiced by more than one actor? The same thing happens with Arthur from ""The Sword in the Stone"".<br/><br/>Kaa (the snake) and Shere Khan (the tiger) are the villains, but their role is small. Kaa is voiced by the unforgettable Sterling Holloway, while Shere Khan is voiced by George Sanders. Shere Khan is mean but cool, because of his delicate and charming voice (very much like Scar from ""The Lion King"").<br/><br/>Colonel Hathi is an interesting elephant. Everybody knows the myth that «an elephant never forgets». Well, Colonel Hathi is an elephant that forgets! But that is exactly what makes him so funny. King Louie is a cool orangutan, brilliantly voiced by Louis Prima. Rama is a loving and caring wolf, voiced by Ben Wright. <br/><br/>An unusual story, great animation, the designs, sceneries/backgrounds, the jungle/forests of India, the soundtrack, generally good characters (apart the vultures, which I consider boring characters), the friendship between Mowgli/Baloo and classic humor make this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is known for being the last one with Walt Disney himself involved. Sadly, he died during its production and never got to see the final result and its success. But he will never be forgotten and, even after his death, the «9 Old Men» knew how to keep faithful to Walt's spirit in the following movies because of their long-time experience with ""uncle Walt""."

He has been with the wolves for ten years when news of Shere Khan, the man-hating tiger's, return to that part of the jungle reaches the pack. It is decided that for Mowgli's safety he must be returned to the man-village; Bagheera, a panther, volunteers to take him. On the way they meet various dangers as well as some friendly creatures; most notably a sloth bear named Baloo.<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun with a combination of a simple but solid story; enjoyable characters and a variety of catchy songs. 'The Bare Necessities' and 'I Wanna Be Like You' may be the best known of the songs but the others are pretty good too; especially 'Trust In Me', sung by Kaa the hypnotic python. The story contains elements that are mildly threatening but these are balanced by the comedy and songs. The characters are great; I particularly liked Baloo and the way he was portrayed with a John Wayne like drawl; and Kaa's hypnotic stare and hissing voice. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all top notch. One or two gags might have dated a little... today's children might not spot that a quartet of vultures are based on The Beatles but that doesn't matter as the characters are still funny.

Infact this was the Walt Disney's intent.
When I was a kid I liked this movie. I liked the casting, I liked how they drew the jungle and of course, I liked the songs. The songs are made by Sherman brothers and Terry Gilkyson. Particularly ""Bare Necessities"" was so catchy. I rewatched this movie, but sadly I didn't like it in the same way I usually did when I was a child. I found a lot of defects. There were a lot of recycled scenes and they were distracting. Sometimes this scenes are recycled from other Disney's movies.
The movie itself was ok, but I think the story could be deeper and more interesting. In the book Mougli and the other characters had more developments.
Now let's talk about what I loved of this movie. The first thing was the villain, because I liked how intimidating and elegant he was. The second thing I loved was Kaa who was funny and enjoyable.

"JamesHitchcock","10","1","1","7 January 2019"," One of the most magical children's films ever made
","""The Jungle Book"" was the last film to be produced personally by Walt Disney, who died before it was completed. The story is loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name. Mowgli, a young orphan boy, is found abandoned in the jungle and is raised by a pack of wolves. Some years later the wolves learn that Shere Khan, a tiger with a hatred of humans, has returned to their part of the jungle and decide that, for his own safety, Mowgli must return to the ""Man-Village"". The problem is, he wants to stay in the jungle, which is the only home he has ever known, with the animals he regards as his friends.<br/><br/>Apart from Mowgli, the main characters are Bagheera the black panther and Baloo the bear. The wolves play a surprisingly small part in the film, and Shere Khan does not make an appearance until more than halfway through. Bagheera and Baloo are both friendly towards Mowgli and both believe that they have his best interests at heart, but they cannot agree what those interests are. Bagheera is portrayed by Sebastian Cabot as a serious-minded, rather fussy individual who sees it as his duty to make sure Mowgli leaves the jungle as soon as possible. Baloo, voiced by the comedian Phil Harris, is a laid-back layabout with a carefree attitude, believing that if he only has a little patience the good things of life will come to him without any effort on his part. Unlike Bagheera, he sympathises with Mowgli's wish to stay in the jungle.<br/><br/>Along the way Mowgli, Bagheera and Baloo meet various other inhabitants of the jungle, including Colonel Hathi and his troop of military elephants, the treacherous snake Kaa, King Louie, the jazz-singing orang-utan King of the monkeys, and a flock of friendly vultures. (The original idea was to have the vultures voiced by The Beatles, and although this idea fell through the group's influence can be seen in the vultures' ""mop-top"" hairstyles, or should that be feather-styles, and the fact that one of them has a marked Liverpudlian accent).<br/><br/>The original scriptwriter Bill Peet wanted to follow Kipling's work closely and envisaged something dark and sinister in tone. Walt Disney, however, was dissatisfied with this concept, and he sacked from the project not only Peet but also the original composer Terry Gilkyson, whose songs had mostly been written to fit in with Peet's conception of the story. (One of Gilkyson's songs, the cheerful, upbeat ""The Bare Necessities"", survived into the finished film). He brought in Larry Clemmons as his new writer and the Sherman Brothers as songwriters, and the result was the lighter and more family-friendly film we know today.<br/><br/>This was one of my favourite films as a child. Indeed, I might even go so far as to say it was my favourite film as a child- certainly my favourite Disney cartoon, just ahead of ""101 Dalmatians"". I always enjoyed films about animals, and I loved the dancing, singing bears and monkeys in this one. I knew all the words to ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna be Like You"" (and probably to the elephants' marching song as well) off by heart. What I particularly liked about the film was its excellent balance of humour and drama- just enough thrills without ever getting too frightening for young children. Shere Khan, portrayed by George Sanders with a plummy, supercilious upper-class British voice, is a villain, but no more frightening than King Rat in a pantomime. He might want to eat Mowgli, but we know he will never stand a chance. It is notable that not a single character is killed throughout the film- even Shere Khan is merely driven off.<br/><br/>The one thing I did not like about the film was the ending, which survived from Peet's original story. Mowgli leaves the jungle because he has fallen in love with a girl from the man-village. Even in my childhood this struck me as inappropriate; Mowgli is supposed to be a little boy, not an adult or even a teenager, and little boys generally do not fall in love with little girls.<br/><br/>I recently watched the film again for the first time in many years- the BBC showed it on New Year's Day, having shown the 2016 live-action remake on Christmas Day- and I can report that my youthful enthusiasm for it remains intact. It remains one of the most magical children's films ever made, with a great story, superb characterisation, infectious songs, plenty of laughs and wonderful animation. Another great admirer of the film was Gregory Peck, at the time President of the Academy, who lobbied hard, but without success, to get it nominated as ""Best Picture"". I am not sure that it would have won my own personal ""Best Picture"" award for 1967- that would probably have been ""The Graduate""- but it would certainly have been on my list of nominees. 10/10. (Yes, I know that objectively speaking the disappointing ending means that I should drop that to 9, but this is a film about which I am quite unable to be objective).<br/><br/>A goof. I know that zoologically-inclined goof-spotters will have plenty of fun with this one- orangs aren't found in India, and so on- but I not too worried about these aspects as the world of the film is so obviously a magical fantasy land and not intended as a realistic recreation of the jungles of India. The name of the hero, however, is consistently mispronounced- Kipling indicated that the first syllable of ""Mowgli"" should rhyme with ""cow"", but here it is always pronounced to rhyme with ""slow""."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","1","1 May 2016"," It's simple that's it needed to be
","Disney in general has made numerous films that are deeply layered with themes that first time viewers may not recognize. It's one of the reasons why Disney is so successful at making films. They also have their fair share of poor writing too but the entirety of them is not as voluminous as the ones many people remember and enjoy. Even with this though, Disney has also made films that weren't as richly textured and scaled up to a more complex level of understanding. That is not to say that the movies that are simpler are lower on an intellectual basis, no. Instead, they are just as influential if not more because of just how simple they are compared to Disney's other laminous movies. It would seem most of these particular types of films would go back to Disney's classical period of all their hand drawn animated features that everyone considers classics today. Of this group of films, the film that best represents the one note feature is this movie. It doesn't explore much other than one plot and that's fine.<br/><br/>The movie is based off of the ""Mowgli Stories"" written by Rudyard Kipling. Audiences are introduced to Mowgli, an orphaned boy in the middle of the jungle who is found and observed by Bagheera the panther as he's raised by a wolf pack. After 10 years word gets out that Shere Khan the tiger is returning to kill Mowgli, so Bagheera decides to try and bring Mowgli back to the man village. The problem is, Mowgli won't go because he loves the jungle and all of his friends are there. Helping solidify his belief that the jungle is where he belongs is Baloo the bear. A lackadaisical beanbag that loves to just enjoy his surroundings. Adapted by the writers of Bambi (1942), Peter Pan (1953), Robin Hood (1973) and 101 Dalmatians (1960), it's obvious to why mostly everything about what goes on in this feature film is so amiable. The characters and the voice actors that play the characters are exceptionally fun and likable to watch on screen.<br/><br/>Of the cast, the only one who is still living is Bruce Reitherman who voiced Mowlgi. At the time he was only 12 and his voice matches the look of Mowlgi well. Today Reitherman has filled other filmmaking positions but mostly has appeared as himself for various documentaries. Voicing Bagheera was Sebastian Cabot, who speaks from time to time but also narrates. Some might recognize him as the narrator to all the classic Whinnie the Pooh tales as well. Phil Harris as the lazy bear Baloo doesn't stray far from his natural voice but nonetheless has made Baloo one the more memorable characters from this period in the mouse house's filmography. Shere Khan the tiger played by George Sanders was amazing. Naturally the voice matches the presence of Khan and although he's the antagonist, there's a lot to like about him too. There's also appearances from Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake, Louis Prima as King Louie of the Apes and J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi the Elephant.<br/><br/>There's really only one thing that should be addressed and that's the fact of how sexism plays a small role. It's difficult to say without giving it away but there's a moment where it plays a turning point for a character. Fine, it's understandable but at the same time more than just one character could've played a part to help serve their purpose for the turning point. This was a different time when the movie was made but it seems a bit one sided. This is it though, the animation still has the Disney classic look to it and it's important to know that animating is a very time consuming task so kudos to those who worked on that part of the film. There are a number of other discrepancies that don't make sense like why is called the jungle book when it really doesn't have to do with a book except the intro. Or how is that Kaa can hypnotize his victims with his eyes so easily. At this point, these are questions that are just asking for too much, so it's not needed.<br/><br/>The songs are also very catchy. With lyrics written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert M. Sherman, the same song writers from The Parent Trap (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963) and Mary Poppins (1964), how could one not see why the songs in this film are so timeless. It's hard to find anybody who doesn't enjoy or at least tap a toe for ""Bare Necessities"", ""I Wanna Be Like You"" or ""We're Your Friends"". For the film score, George Bruns composed the music. Bruns also composed the film scores to 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Love Bug (1968), Herbie Rides Again (1974) and Robin Hood (1973). For this feature, the music again calls back to the classic Disney sound of orchestras from that time. There are a lot of strings, trumpets and drums. Plus considering the setting is in the jungle, it suitably fits. If still works, then there's obviously no reason to knock it then.<br/><br/>The writing is very simplistic and that is all the story needed. It does suffer from one apparent sin at a certain point in a story arc but the voice acting, animation and music make it difficult to really fault it at all."

","Everybody knows this movie as the last animated movie Walt Disney ever worked on, the following animated movies ripoff some of the animation from the movie, and for its long lasting memorable songs. In many ways that is what Disney's The Jungle Book is.<br/><br/>Basically the story revolves around Mowgli ""a man cub"" and his many adventures in the jungle which include being raised by wolves, escaping the possibility of going to the man village, joining an elephant bootcamp, kidnapped by monkeys, befriending a carefree bear, escaping a hypnotizing snake, and staying out of Shere Khan the tiger's way, who has vowed to kill man. <br/><br/>The older I got the more I realized that this movie doesn't have much focus in its story, it's just Mowgli going from character to character and song to song. Obviously the book is nothing like that, but I kinda wonder if that's the charm of the movie being only about characters and the timeless songs to identify them. Though there are times I wonder what would have happened if we spent more time with the monkeys, elephants, and the vultures what more adventures could be had with them. But then again, it's a 75 minute movie taking chances with a whole series of stories combined into one book. Adapting any story into a movie is difficult no matter what.<br/><br/>The characters are mostly two dimensional and yet they are so likable. I don't know if it has to do with their design, songs, personalities, how they satirize so much from the time (like the army, old catchphrases, celebrities, and so on), pitch perfect voice actors - who were famous at the time like Sterling Holloway, Louis Prima, Phil Harris, and George Sanders - or all of the above. One way or another we all remember them, know their songs, laugh at their jokes, and enjoy them for lasting generations. I still love Shere Khan having nothing to fear and that rich voice, I love King Louie's song, the friendship between Mowgli, Baloo, and Bageera, and Colonel Hathi's army obsessed nature. <br/><br/>One thing I love about the animation is how timeless and unique it is. It's not watercolors or like tapestry work, it's xerography (or hand drawn animation). While Disney has done hand drawn animation before, this kind of sketching seemed a bit rougher. The environment feels like a real jungle. Also the art makes the characters and environment seem unlimited in what they can do or where they can go. <br/><br/>Of course the music is excellent. What makes it even better is when it combines with the animation and environment in the right way. When it does that, you feel the atmosphere of the jungle, the danger, the suspense, and the fun. The fun just about always comes from the songs, which are done by the Sherman Brothers (except for Bare Necessities which was done by Terry Gilkyson), and as usual, they're a lot of fun to listen to for their creativity in lyrics. Each time you hear them you wonder how much fun the songwriters or singers had fun with it. The main song everybody remembers is Bare Necessities and how laid back and carefree it is. Even the new movie knew that they could not leave out that song for such a laid back character. <br/><br/>The final song is such a perfect way to wrap up the movie after all the fun is over. It's not an epic conclusion, it is just a nice, calm, and soothing way to say goodbye to Mowgli as he goes back where he belongs as do the other characters. I guess in some symbolic sense it was also a nice way to say goodbye to Walt Disney as he went back where he belonged. <br/><br/>While this may not have been an epic story or one with much focus, it's mostly just charming a lot of fun to watch. If you want a real story, I would recommend the book more, but if you're in an absolutely good mood, then this movie is perfect to brighten up your day."

","Absolutely wonderful. The last animated feature supervised by Walt Disney. Based on the Rudyard Kipling story of Mowgli(voiced by the director's 12 yr old son Bruce Reitherman),a young boy found abandoned in a jungle in India. Mowgli is first raised by wolves before being put out on his own and his adventurous travel through the jungle to find the human village. He learns the meaning of real friendship and trust from inhabitants of the jungle like, Baloo the bear(Voiced by Phil Harris); King Louie of the apes(voiced by Louis Prima)and the hypnotic snake Kaa(voiced by Sterling Holloway). Then there is the wise panther Bagheera(voiced by Sebastion Cabot). Beautiful cinematography and brilliant songs like ""The Bare Necessities"", ""I Wan'na Be Like You"", ""Trust in Me"" and ""That's What Friends Are For"". There is plenty to make you visit THE JUNGLE BOOK again and again. Fun for all ages. Other voices you may or may not recognize: George Sanders, Verna Felton, Lord Tim Hudson and 8 yr old Clint Howard."
"OllieSuave-007","10","3","6","22 October 2013"," Fun-filled jungle adventure!
","The Jungle Book is a full-filled adventure about Mowgli, who grew up in the jungle with animals, but, as he got older, is urged by his wise panther friend, Bagheera, to return to the human village to avoid the wrath of man-hating tiger Shere Khan. When Mowgli refuses and wants to stay in the jungle instead, he encounters a host of unforgettable characters. This includes the carefree and adventurous Baloo the Bear; the marching, militaristic Colonel Hathi the Elephant; the swinging, singing orangutan King Louie; and the cunning but hilarious snake Kaa.<br/><br/>It is one exciting journey to the next as Mowgli meets these host of characters one by one, trying to find the right friend to lead him into the jungle life. Each character has his unique brand of humor, fun and personality that is a treat for the entire audience to watch. I love Baloo's carefree philosophy of no worries and King Louie's crazy swinging song and dance. My favorite character is Kaa; I love his devious and mysterious personality and his song, ""Trust in Me"" - very mesmerizing and catchy. Actor Sterling Holloway voiced Kaa, and was also the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh.<br/><br/>At 78 minutes, this movie is just the perfect one for the entire family to enjoy - full of non-stop adventure, lovable characters, catchy songs and a compelling story.

"Boba_Fett1138","7","3","6","14 October 2011"," Nothing too bad but hardly a Disney classic or must-see in my book.
","Out of all the Disney animated movies, this is one of the few I did not grew up watching with. Don't tell anyone else but I think it was because me brother was scared of Baloo. A singing and dancing huge bear was more than he could handle and the sight of it was more than enough reason to never purchase this movie. But I must say I did not missed much with it. ""The Jungle Book"" is an average Disney entry, with average animations, average songs, average characters and a very average main plot line.<br/><br/>The lack of story and character development really disturbed me. Basically the movie is an adventure movie, in which the main character has to travel from point A to B and on his way he meets all sort of different characters. And this was something that just didn't worked out too well for me. First of all the movie because of this way of storytelling never really flowed well enough and I can actually imaging some kids getting easily bored with this movie, especially now days. But second of all, it made the movie look too much like it was hanging together from its coincidences. All of the events and characters pop up at random and also often disappear out of the story pretty fast again. Because of this the movie never finds the right pace and also never has the time to develop anything or any of its characters properly enough. <br/><br/>So this wasn't really a movie I could ever feel involved with but it of course isn't a bad one. You can still get plenty enjoyment out of watching this movie, since it definitely has its moments. It can be a funny and charming movie at times and even though they don't get developed properly enough; the movie still has some memorable characters in it. <br/><br/>But a character that the movie is lacking is a good main villain. I know that the movie was more about its traveling and adventurous elements but it would had made the movie so much more interesting and powerful in my opinion, if the movie had a clear main villain and treat in it. The movie now instead has like 3 small villains, who pop up every now and then.<br/><br/>Animation-wise this also isn't Disney's greatest moment. It's not like it's bad looking or anything but it's all very average, for normal Disney standards. This goes for the backgrounds, as well as all of the characters animations and looks. Seemed to me like they spend more this time on studying the movement and behavior of the animals, rather than spending time on creating a good and distinctive look. <br/><br/>The only thing the movie does stand out with is with its voice cast. Everyone seemed perfectly picked for the part and the movie actually used some big known Hollywood names as well, such as George Sanders.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound harsh, since I still actually for most part still enjoyed watching it. It just isn't really a Disney classic in my book.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ed_two_o_nine","9","3","6","6 December 2008"," The Greatest Disney of em all.
","Quire simply put this is animated story telling at its purest and best. This is a joy from start to finish. The story of Mogli the boy brought up by wolves forced to flee the jungle might not be as grand as the normal Disney fare and as a result actually feels like a smaller film, but that is by no means a bad thing. Instead what we have here is attention to character and this is achieved with excellence. Every character here is beautifully created all with their own nuances and traits. We have the main animal characters of Baloo and Bhaghera who are a superb odd couple duo and they and supported by a fantastic supporting cast including the magnificent King Louie and Khaa the snake. With the menacing villain Shea Khan casting a shadow over precedings we get a series of superb set pieces all set to the greatest tunes ever in a Disney film. This is a film I loved as a child and still enjoy regular viewings of today. Gold."
"Wilson102","6","3","6","14 October 2008"," Jungle book, a good movie but not a great one.
","Now before you die hards spew fire at me for giving this movie three stars let me explain myself. Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid children's film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for children's films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own. Just not as good as Peter Pan or Mary Poppins in this consumers honest opinion."
"philfromno","Null","3","7","8 September 2002"," My fave Disney film
","I have to say, I'm not overly fond of the whole ""Disney Magic"" sacred cow. For every classic (Snow White, Pinnochio) there are three or four Disney features that range from mediocre (Fox and the Hound, Lion King) to godawful (the horribly annoying Winnie the Pooh, Mu Lan).  But this one is completely enjoyable for me, and is one of the few movies that my daughter and I anjoy equally (one of the others, by the way, is the Marx bros. Duck Soup.)<br/><br/>The songs are catchy, bouncy, and clever.  The story is warm without any of the treacly sentimentality that so often colors these movies.  If you don't bob your head whenever you hear ""I Wanna Be Like You"", then there is no hope for you.<br/><br/>By the way, in answer to a review below dealing with racial stereotypes in this movie:  I understand your point, but you should note that King Louie is played by Louis Prima, a white man.  And he wasn't aping (rimshot) an African American accent.  That was really the way he talked."
"Spleen","7","3","7","19 July 1999"," Superb character animation
","The tiger, the panther, the snake and the orang-utan may be the best animated animals the screen has seen - and the bear isn't bad, either.  In a way it's the last great fling of Disney's old veteran animators.  (Most of them were still some distance from retirement, but never again did they fire so magnificently, all at once.)  Anyone who appreciates fine character animation HAS to see this.  Despite the rough outlines favoured by Wolfgang Reitherman (he presided over some extreme cheese-paring after Walt Disney's death), there's also a sumptuous feel to this film, at least while they stay in the jungle.<br/><br/>The lack of a story is a problem.  ""Flabby"" is the word that comes to mind. It's really just the story of Baloo and Mowgli bumming around in the jungle. Now and then something happens.  At one point Mowgli is pinched by some monkeys, and taken to some old ruins, just so that the orang-utan can stage a musical number.  It's a pretty good musical number - did I mention that the orang-utan is skillfully animated? - but that doesn't disguise the fact that it's unmotivated.  After enough running time has passed the incidents stop and the film ends.<br/><br/>It's enjoyable enough, and worth seeing for visual reasons, but be warned."

He's a well grounded, down to earth, sensible character type - but he knows how to have fun too. A very enduring toon. <br/><br/>King Louie is just insanely fun, so are his band of monkeys. I love their catchy tune ""I Wanna Be Like You"". I am like Baloo, ""Oh man what a beat"". ""I'm gone man - solid gone"". Yes it's a groovy little tune.<br/><br/>And Baloo is the best - ""Bare Necessities"" all that jazz. I would love to have a (cartoon) bear friend like him because he could liven up any boring day - just like this Disney classic film: The Jungle Book.<br/><br/>Simply worded: This film rocks!

","Four years after ""The Sword in the Stone"", Walt Disney's final animated feature was released in October 1967; 10 months after his death. This film would be the last major memorable hit the studio would have Dow a few decades.<br/><br/>The story is about a boy who was raised by wolves (Mowgli), has to return back to the man village because of the tiger Shere Khan's return to the jungle. Bagheera the panther, Baloo the bear, and Mowgli have a fun and dangerous adventure back to the village.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are all memorable and likable. Mowgli is the typical 10 year old who wants to live a carefree life by not going to society, Baloo is the bear who is very fun and relaxed (he sings the famous ""Bare Necessities""), Bagheera is the responsible one who wants the best for Mowgli. Shere Khan is the perfect intimidating yet classy tiger villain, and Kaa is a sneaky, manipulative snake who just wants to eat.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very memorable and to a lot of people, it is the best aspect of the film. The songs ""Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" are catchy, jazzy tunes and all of the other songs are nice. The score in this movie is very effective.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie is OK. It does not really mesh well with the background, but at the same time, the animation is not horrible. Here is where the reused animation is very noticeable, which gives it a cheap look. It being animated using Xerography does not help.<br/><br/>With an alright story, memorable characters, memorable songs, and alright animation, this film is a bunch of fun. Good, not great or bad, but it will be an enjoyable film for the entire family."

It was sad that Walt Disney and Verna Felton (who voiced one of the elephants) died the year before it was released and never got to see it on the big screen.

","The Jungle Book, one of Disney's ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. I'll admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my fav's though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.<br/><br/>Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the fun-loving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and won't rest 'till he kills him.<br/><br/>Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the ""bear"" necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that we've all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disney's most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldn't be surprised if he was Scar's inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you haven't seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, it's worth the money. It's a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, it's a good time.

","If there's any film that truly marked the end of an era, it would have to be Walt Disney's film adaptation of The Jungle Book, as it was the last feature made under his involvement before he passed away almost a year before it was released. When it did come out, not only was it a critical and commercial success, but it helped spark the company to move forward in animated features, and more than 50 years later, it's gone through ups and downs to become the animation powerhouse we remember it as. But as for the movie itself, while its legacy remains as strong as ever, I wouldn't place it among the studio's strongest efforts.<br/><br/>Now the film's main storyline involving the little human boy Mowgli being forced to go back to the man-village is well remembered, not because of Mowgli himself, but because of the bizarre characters he encounters along the way. From the snooty cynical panther Bagheera trying to do what's best for Mowgli in spite of their differences, to the upbeat slacker bear Baloo showing him the fun of living carefree in the jungle, to the crazed scat-singing King Louie, so on and so forth. What's funny is that these characters have been cherished by audiences for decades for their exuberant personalities and specified voice actors whom the crew based off to form them, from the hip Phil Harris, to the stuffy Sebastian Cabot, to the energetic Louis Prima, to even the pompous George Sanders. However, the one that people care about the least is Mowgli himself, as he's the most forgettable and annoying character in the whole feature due to his whiny demeanor and obnoxious personality. Similar to Walt's Alice in Wonderland from the 50s, the main protagonist is so bland that everyone else around them sticks out way better.<br/><br/>Another strong quality of the feature are the musical numbers by the Sherman Brothers, as even the ones that don't carry the story forward are entertaining enough on their own. Some are utilized as character exposition like Colonel Haiti's March, I Wanna Be Like You, and My Own Home, whereas others show both the positive and negative sides of the jungle like Trust in Me and the Oscar-nominated Bare Necessities. Speaking of Bare Necessities, it was the only song written by Terry Gilkyson, as it spawned from an previous version of the movie that wasn't produced. That leads into how distinctive the movie was from the original Rudyard Kipling novel, down to where Walt told the head story writer on the film Larry Clemmons to not even read the book. Whether or not the original draft of the movie would have been better is certainly debatable, but Disney's reputation with their animated films has often consisted of going in altered directions from literature with their own twist, and considering this film was uncle Walt's swan song, none can deny the charm it displays with what it offers differently.<br/><br/>As for the overall visuals, some of Walt's finest animators really put their ""all"" into each character. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston once stated that presenting emotions onto the fun loving Baloo proved to be difficult after Walt had died, and yet they managed to pull it off very well through subtle gestures. However, as fun and expressive as the animals are in the movie (seriously, Milt Kahl really hammed up Shere Kahn), Mowgli's more realistic animation is somewhat of a weird contrast, although that may be due to inconsistent rotoscoping and minimal facial variation. On the other hand, the backgrounds are gorgeously painted and composited within each shot, as they feel like 18th century British literature images brought to animation. In addition to some scratchy looking effect work that blend well with the environments, the Xerox-handled characters stick out distinctly from the backgrounds to give better contrast to their flat albeit bold features. Even though Walt himself never cared for the Xerox process, it certainly gave the animated movies for the next decade a unique style to say the least.<br/><br/>So is The Jungle Book the greatest Disney film of all time? At least in my eyes, not exactly. However, even with its straight forward narrative, uninteresting main protagonist and deviations from its original source material, what the movie does offer on its own is very entertaining in its own right. Even for the next century, there's high doubt we'll forget about the charming animal characters and timeless songs that left an impact after a legend's death. Of course the Rudyard Kipling novel will go down in history as a classic too, but this feature will always remind the world why Walt Disney's passing meant so much to it."

The voice cast - especially Phil Harris as the bear and George Sanders as the tiger are great; Louis Prima as ""Louie"" the King of the Apes provides us with one of the best songs ever to feature in a Disney film - and the Sherman brothers provide a great slew more of them for us to enjoy, too. The detail in the animations and the humour in the script are super - this really is a must watch."

","I used to watch this movie as a kid and needless to say I loved it and I still do now. Anyone who's read the book knows how far this movie strayed from the source material but in this case it turned out ok. The movie's about a kid named Mowgli who's taken in by a pack of wolves and becomes their adopted son. When word gets around that Shere Khan wants to kill the kid, his friend and mentor Bagheera the black panther offers to take him to the man village for his protection. Along the way they come across colorful characters such as the laid-back bear Baloo who introduces Mowgli to The Bare Necessities of life, a creepy snake named Kaa who wants to eat the boy, an orangutan named King Louie who desperately wants to learn how to make fire or ""man's red flower"" in his words and some Buzzards based on the Beatles while also learning more about the jungle and themselves as well as if Mowgli should leave the jungle or not.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else there is to say about this movie other than this was the last movie Disney approved of and produced before his untimely death. He also told his staff not to read the book which normally i'm against but given how dark the original source material is this's an exception. The animation's a little scruffy like their later movies such as Robin Hood but it still looks good. The chemistry between the actors is believable and the pacing is wonderful. There's a balance between the light and dark moments from the songs to the final confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan. What more can I say? Check it out for yourself."

"filipemanuelneto","8","0","0","7 February 2017"," Timeless.
","This movie is one of the most remarkable of my childhood and I am sure it was part of the childhood of hundreds of other children. It tells the story of a human child who is found and raised by animals in the middle of the Indian jungle, living there until being forced to return to the human village due to the hatred that Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger, fed to humans due to the hunt. It is a light adaptation of a famous novel of the Victorian era. Visually, it is a magnificent movie, using the luxuriant Indian forest to brighten the screen. The animations were very well done and the colors are great, just like most of the sound effects. Its one of the animations of the Disney's golden age that more focuses on song, with several being created for it. Most of them have been in the ears of generations, like ""Wanna be like you"" or ""Bare Neccessities"". There are some critics who advocate the idea that the use of black jazz rhythms at a moment when many monkeys appear is a symptom of racism or prejudice. I don't know to what extent that was the intention but I feel it is something to be devalued. After all, the film has been done for decades and, especially in recent years, social censorship points out all that can, even slightly and unintentionally, have racist connotations, in a nonsense witch hunt that is as dangerous as the racism itself. Controversy aside, it's a timeless movie that will definitely continue to make the delights of kids and adults."

There's nothing bad with this repeat, in fact it's good to see the repeats sometimes.<br/><br/>I caught on real quick to the classic, simple yet true 'bear necessities' song, I loved the snake, the scene near the end was very amusing as it was taking the idea of the female and exaggerating it which I found funny. And of course the fighting scene with the tiger near the end and the 'death' of the bear, was all very funny.

","I've always loved Disney movies, but just some of them becomes ""classics"" and others becomes embarrassing childhood memories. So was the case with ""The Jungle Book"". I loved this film a kid and saw it several times. But I found it childish and senseless when I became older.<br/><br/>I recently saw this movie again and still liked it. It's enjoyable and one of Disney's funniest features ever. <br/><br/>The mood is at times a little bit darker comparing to the other Disney features from the 60's, certainly because of the jungle settings, but the film mixture well the darks and funny moments. The film biggest strength is the enjoyable characters. Now my favorites are the elephants, the monkeys and especially the vultures. Shere Khan is a great villain. Kaa is also funny sometimes, but his song is extremely boring. Bagheera is the only main character that I don't like, while Baloo was my favorite character as a child, by the way.<br/><br/>The animation is great. Of course not so stunning like ""Tarzan"", considering that this picture was made in 1967, but the jungle is beautifully drawn. The dialog is successful and the songs are very catchy (and have became one of Disney's most memorable tunes). But I didn't like the score.<br/><br/>HERE COMES SOMETHIN THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILER: The story doesn't have the same scholastic lessons and logical structure like for example ""Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" and that's why I found this movie senseless for a while... It's also a shame that the greatest characters doesn't get enough screen time. But it doesn't ruin the movie.<br/><br/>PS: Have you noticed that ""The Jungle Book"", ""Lion King"" and ""Tarzan"" (who all have jungle settings) have a rainy sequence after the big climax?)<br/><br/>SPOILERS OVER. <br/><br/>""Jungle Book"" is a enjoyable picture with good moments and the climax in the movie is one of my favorites.

Most movies have one or two best characters, but in this movie you come to love almost all characters on the same level! Baloo will always be the go-to for favorites, being the goofy trouble-making big bear that befriends Mowgli. You can come to love the sly, realistic and fatherly Bagheera. Kaa the hypnotizing snake gets several laughs, voiced by the talented Sterling Holloway who gave us Disney gold such as Winnie the Pooh and the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland. This might be Disney's greatest villain as Shere Khan the tiger is coy, deceitfully honest, and frightening.

","I'm afraid I cannot comment on the English and original voice-track, for I have not been able to summon a copy (for free) of it without Danish dubbing(as is the custom here... we dub what children would watch, but apart from that, thankfully, we leave the sound as is... I am opposed to the idea, the audio track is part of the original, it's part of the finished product that the film-makers put together, possibly even a part, significant or otherwise, of the director's vision), but for any Dane reading this who hasn't already seen it... some of the voice acting isn't too bad, and it features Ove SprogÃ¸e, in at least one, possibly several, parts(including Bagheera). I have not seen the sequel, and I don't believe I've seen any of the Disney sequels to their animated features, save for Jaffar Returns(and I was a kid, less trustworthy judgment). I haven't read the book, either. Or seen any of the other versions of the story, including the 94 version(not that I'd want to, Sommers isn't exactly my favorite director... he helps furnish the bottom of that list). But enough of that, on to the film. The animation still holds up remarkably well. It's dynamic, dramatic and comic, when it tries to be any of the three. There did seem to be some reused footage(in a film that doesn't even reach a full hour and a half, no less), but that can be forgiven. The songs are catchy enough. Shere Khan makes a pretty cool villain. The plot is fine, though some of the developments have simple writing. At one point, our heroes are fortunate enough that an opponent takes the trouble to sing his plan while they are close enough to overhear it... not sure even Bond could get away with that one, but maybe middle-aged to old men with dreams of world domination or destruction make dreadful performing artists. The humor contains slapstick. Editing and shot composition are well done.

"Quinoa1984","10","2","5","1 May 2006"," should likely appeal to kids right now, and adults grew up with it
","The Jungle Book was of a nice crop of Disney films I would watch numerous times as a kid, to the point where I would have not even the songs, but full passages of dialog, memorized to heart. It's the last film Walt Disney himself was involved in, and it shows, sort of. But it also shows Disney moving along on its legs into its quiet, and under-appreciated, period of films in the immediately post-Disney's death world of the 70's. <br/><br/>If you read the book it's not much like this one aside from the same characters and some plot points. But what it is is a film that survives well on its own feats of strength- catchy songs (including the very popular ""Bare Necessities, though Louis Prima's song is the best of the bunch and the Vulture's song the funniest), and a lot of fun action thrown in with some good, everlasting pathos. Obviously, kids wont need to take lessons on how to escape from the monkeys or from a Bengal Tiger. <br/><br/>It does carry enough of parts from real life that kids can take as piece of mind; the coming-of-age idea is in there with the ""man-village"" to be sure. And throughout the film itself is a technical knockout, with great visuals and animation, colorful characters (in more ways than one), and spectacular voice talent that's rarely gotten this good in just pure ensemble form. I mean, where else will you get Clint Howard as a baby elephant and Sterling Holloway as a snake? Phil Harris is also indispensable and about as memorable as possibly can be here. <br/><br/>Maybe its best quality is that it isn't too much stuck in its time and place (save for the vultures being like the Beatles crosses with Marty- ""what do you wanna do""). It's all in an exuberant, only-out-to-entertain-you style and in solid storytelling that the film is successful, as a family film and as just a terrific piece of entertainment in and of itself. Probably among the best in that crossover period of Disney's from the traditional ""9 Old Men"" animation period and its later renaissance."

It was too commercialized, and I sensed this. So what if Louis Prima sang some of the numbers? I did not know Louis Prima from Adam because I was not a sophisticated grown up. All I knew was the movie lacked heart. <br/><br/>The only good that came of my seeing this film was becoming interested in reading the original works by Rudyard Kipling.

It also kind of soured me on all subsequent Disney movies, which even Pocahontas could not fully cure."

","When I saw this movie first, I enjoyed it. It was funny, the animation was good and the songs was enjoyable. Yet I must say that the movie is very roughly based on the actual book by Rudyard Kipling, which is far better than the movie.<br/><br/>If it stood to me, the actual story is far from a children's basic bedtime story. Many important factors was excluded from the movie, which I am very disappointed of. Kaa, who originally was a wise old python and one of Mowgli's best friends, was turned into a greasy bad guy, helping out Shere Khan. It's almost like he took over the role of Tabaqui the jackal, who didn't appear in the movie at all. Akela, Raksha and the rest of the wolves, did hardly have any part in the movie, unlike in the book. Also, the originally smart, bold and righteous Bagheera was completely out of character, and so was Baloo the bear. From a strict old teacher of the wolf pups, he turned into a carefree goof ball without any connection to the Seonee Pack at all. I suppose that the added character King Louie, only was a comic relief.<br/><br/>Of course, this is meant to be a children's movie, but still I was very disappointed when I saw it as child. I just wish Disney had followed the book more properly.<br/><br/>I can recommend this movie to people who just wants to have mere fun out of it (because this is a classic Disney movie, with a lot of fun!), but fans of the book shouldn't get their hopes up."

","As a kid, I loved this film. The Jungle Book was one of the first films I ever saw and is probably one the reasons I decided to pursue a career in films and I will always be fond of that. However, today, as a film, it's OK. That's not bad or good; it is just OK.<br/><br/>For one thing, the film is very slow, which for an animated film can be quite tedious at times. My second (and probably biggest) problem with the film is that it simply plays it too safe; I can't help but wish that if this film had come out during the era of the Disney Renaissance (Aladdin, The Lion King etc.) then a few more risks would have been taken, e.g. I felt the climax between Mowgli and Shere Khan was very underplayed and could have been a lot more tense and dramatic, for example, it would have been a lot more powerful if Mowgli had defeated his enemy for good and killed Shere Khan (in the manor that heroes normally defeat their villains in Disney films) or some of the characters could have been a bit more menacing such as Kaa or Louis. I also feel that film tired much too hard to make comedic moments through out the film. The songs themselves did not really measure up to the Disney standard (with the exceptions of The Bear Necessities and I wanna be like you) and felt that they where very dumbed down. I also felt the animation was somewhat lacking and again, I felt could have benefited had this film been made during Disney's golden age in the 1990's.<br/><br/>The film did have some positives as well, the best bit of the film is Shere Khan, and he's just a great villain. George Saunders gets the balance between Khan's sophisticated demeanor and his bloodthirsty intentions, the contrast is very effective and in my opinion, Shere Khan is one of the most memorable villains in Disney history. Baloo the bear was also a lot of fun, and it was really a shame when he appeared to have been killed at the end. Mowgli and the other characters are OK, and they all do their part.<br/><br/>Overall, I won't say I don't like the film or it's not worth watching because I can't imagine that anybody watching it would hate it. However, I can't see anyone today putting it at the top of their film watching priorities. With two film versions of The Jungle Book coming up (one by Disney, the other by Warner Bros.) I will be very interested to see how they deal with their adaptations."

Bagheera knows that the baby would perish without any care. He then decides to take the boy to the wolf pack...<br/><br/>My thoughts: For the young, this will be a pleasurable film. They will instantly fall in love with the characters and be excited for them all, watching this film over and over again, maybe enjoying it a little more each time. Then, as they grow older, they may prefer other films and find some parts of this a little ""eerie"" as I did (of course, some may not pay attention to the weirdly spooky music which appears at times). They may get scared of Shere Khan. Then, they may read the book and realise what a floppy mess of the book this is. They may not like it for a long while afterwards, constantly reading the beautiful book instead. Then, at golden teenager hood, they may slightly go back into this film again, watching it more often than usual, reading the book as well. For the rest, I do not know. All this happened to me and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to at least one person in the world (for one thing, SOO many people have watched this).<br/><br/>This film is better for you to watch if you're in a VERY good mood. Otherwise, it kind of gives a flop. Luckily for me, I do not find it as spooky as I did for a few years and I like parts. I see Colonel Haiti as a tribute to Rudyard Kipling, as he enjoyed writing books about the army. Mowgli in this is basically a spoilt little young boy, not noble unlike in the books. Baloo will be likely not to impress those who have read the books as he is a bit silly. Although him teaching Mowgli happens in the book and he is a goodie through and through (although in the book Baloo teaches Mowgli the laws of the jungle). Bagheera, as the film starts, is very likable but then his performance fails into about twenty minutes of the film as he starts to become fed up with Mowgli. The wolves are good, although they have a much bigger part in Rudyard Kipling's work and the mother wolf in the book is fiercer than her mate, unlike in this film. Kaa has the character of Tabaqui the jackal's and he is not a nice character (although Sterling Holloway does a good job, I have to admit). Shere Khan is much more evil than in the book and he is more of a ""main character"". King Louie is pointless really, I do not see why Wolfgang Reitherman had to put in a dancing Orangutang that wanted to make fire. I am very grateful for the Beatles vultures, they CERTAINLY do not appear in the books and they are good in this. <br/><br/>The title of this film is not very good to the book, it would be better being called something like ""Adventure of Mowgli"" or ""Story of Mowgli"". In ""The Jungle Book"" many more characters appear beside our ones here.<br/><br/>Recommended to: People who HAVE NOT read the book (after you've watched the film please read it!), very young children and maybe grown-ups. <br/><br/>6 and a half out of ten."

","I have loved this movie since it came out! Not only do I think it is this the best Disney animated movie (Shrek is a close 2nd, but definitely 2nd), it is the best animated movie period. It has so much going for it: a great heart warming story everyone will love, fantastic and really enticing music and songs, and absolutely marvelous voices to match each of the main characters. The outstanding voices are George Sanders for Sher Kahn the tiger, which is such a full and powerful voice (you can almost feel the tiger's presence when he speaks), Sebastian Cabott for the panther Bagherra that is in your face always, Phil Harris for that rascal bear Bahlu, and Louis Prima for the orangutan King Louie, with there marvelous beat and song throughout the palace scenes. And of course, there is Moglie's voice, which is fitting and pleasant, but not stellar like almost all the others. The ending is still befitting in today's world, 40 years later!"
"Neal","7","2","6","8 May 2000"," This time it's the sound, not the pictures
","Generally acknowledged as the end of Disney's golden age (it's the last animated feature Walt supervised before he died), and the more modern, streamlined style successfully introduced in 101 DALMATIANS is starting to look bland and (gasp!) a bit cheap.  Fortunately, THE JUNGLE BOOK features just about the greatest voice cast the studio ever assembled, and for once it's the human performances in the recording studio that really make the movie; perhaps only Robin Williams as the Genie in ALADDIN has created as forceful impression on the screen without ever being seen in the flesh.<br/><br/>The Sherman Brothers, perhaps still aflame with inspiration from MARY POPPINS, contribute their second-best song score, although the tune everyone remembers, ""The Bare Necessities"", was an interpolation by pop songwriter Terry Gilkyson.  (And for an example of how fast and completely the Shermans cooled, see the same year's megaflop THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE.  How could the same guys who wrote so cleverly for magical nannies and anthropomorphic animals turn so dim when it came to writing for actual humans?)  Phil Harris, a huge radio star who didn't have the same success in films, is completely wonderful as Baloo, the sybaritic bear -- a kind of jungle Hoagy Carmichael or ursine Dean Martin, his rascally warmth transcends sentimentality.  Sterling Holloway, Disney's erstwhile lovable Pooh, is equally perfect as a sibilant snake, hissing the excellent ""Trust in Me"". When the masterful George Sanders speaks, he supplies all the grandeur and menace the animation can't quite muster; too bad he only gets one line to sing (if you don't believe Sanders had one of the most impressive and underutilized singing voices in film history, rent CALL ME MADAM sometime.) The ultimate showstopper, of course, is lounge legend and professional wildman Louis Prima as the Orangutan king, infusing the inspired ""I Wanna Be Like You"" with his anarchic humor and fevered swing sensibility.  By the time this becomes a scat ""cutting contest"" with Harris (Baloo, in the best non-Disney, Bugs Bunny tradition, has disguised himself as a female Orangutan to distract the king), the number has risen to a level of jazz-inflected ecstasy achieved by only the best movie and stage musicals.<br/><br/>The low point, and an unfortunate omen of what would follow up until THE LITTLE MERMAID breathed new life into the form, occurs at a critical juncture late in the action.  The boy Mowgli, now wandering the jungle alone, encounters a trio of Cockney buzzards.  One of them is clearly modeled after Ringo Starr, and I remember vividly thinking, watching the original theatrical release at age nine, how exciting and cool it was to see a Disney movie acknowledging my then-idols, The Beatles.  But when they launch into song, it's immediately clear that Prima was as ""far out"" as Uncle Walt would ever get.  Instead of the anticipated rock 'n' roll pastiche, the mop-topped birds sing in insipid barber-shop harmonies. Luckily, the movie winds up so quickly afterward that the harm isn't fatal. In spite of its flaws, it's hard to imagine a child, or even many adults, who won't find sufficient pleasure in THE JUNGLE BOOK.<br/><br/>A note on the stereo sound mix on the laserdisc (and, I assume, the DVD): it's grand.  As in so many technical departments, the Disney sound engineers staked out the cutting edge of movie technology, and the happy result is a 1967 release that sounds as fresh and vibrant as if it were recorded last week."

","The Jungle Book is one of Disney's most well-known films before the Renaissance. It's based on Kipling's classic collection of short stories, and even though this adaptation isn't exactly true to the book it is quite entertaining.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with The Jungle Book, it's like this: An orphan child is raised by two wolves, who call him Mowgli (""The Frog""). As he matures, he is guided in the ways of the jungle by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther. But he must avoid the despicable Shere Khan (and, in this version, Kaa) if he wants to survive.<br/><br/>The characters in Disney's Jungle Book are a mixed bag. For me, Bagheera (played brilliantly by Family Affair's Sebastian Cabot) and Shere Khan (George Sanders) are the standouts; they're very close to what Kipling wrote. Mowgli is rightfully curious but his use of 60s slang like ""yeah man"" is hardly endearing. Baloo is probably the most famous character from Disney's adaptation, and although his laid-back persona is a far cry from the book, he's still likable. While I don't mind changing Baloo's character, Kaa, my favorite character from the book, might as well not even exist in this movie. Disney changed him from a sage into an old kook. Though he is scarier in the book, he's a far deeper character that actually befriends Mowgli. Here, he simply tries to strangle and eat the kid, a difference of night and day.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are creative and enjoyable, with memorable hits like ""Bare Necessities"" and the elephant march. The tune for ""I Wanna Be Like You"" is catchy, but the dance number? I seriously wish I'd never seen that.<br/><br/>Overall, The Jungle Book is a decent movie. But without that ""I Wanna Be Like You"" dance segment and the terrible rewriting of Kaa, it'd be much better."
"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","23 September 2014"," A Disney movie that stands out from my childhood
","This is one of the most memorable Disney movie from my childhood. And watching it now, I have more appreciation for it. It's actually based on a story about a human boy that was raised by wolves in the jungle. And how the boy adapts and becomes part of his environment. It's actually quite a tragic story, but this is a Disney movie so they want to liven things up a bit. I would say the chemistry is still intact when it comes to the human boy Mowgli, 'Bagheera' the Panther and 'Baloo' the Bear. As a matter of fact, this movie revolves around the chemistry between the three and different opinions amongst them. So yeah, this is a Disney movie that has some good elements to make it worth a watch. Maybe even worth a re-watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I first saw this movie as a child when it was first released in the cinemas and then read the book and then, again saw the movie when it was re - released in the 1990's.<br/><br/>Bagheera, the panther,roaming in the jungles of India, hears a cry of a baby that has been abandoned and upon reaching the ares, he sees that it is a human baby - man cub. He calls upon all those living nearby, including some wolves to see what can be done to take care of the man cub. They all agree on looking after him but they fear that one day, Shere Khan, the tiger will find out and come after the man cub, whom they have named ""Mowgli."". One day, they all get together, after being informed that Shere Khan is nearby and they decide to send Mowgli to the man village and Bagheera, the panther should take him back. Enroute, they bump into Baloo the bear and some monkeys, who try to kidnap Mowgli.<br/><br/>Inspired by Rudyard, Kipling, who was born and lived in India during the British rule, from his novel ""Mowgli Story,"" this is very well adopted for the screen by the master of animations, Walt Disney. And who can forget the song, ""The Bare Necessaities?"" The Colonel Haathi and his elephants marching through the jungle and Mowgli meeting Baloo. This is one of the classic Walt Disney movies that cannot be forgotten ever. You can sit and watch this with your children at any time and enjoy it."
"Ibuk","10","1","2","7 November 2007"," Jungle Book - Classic Disney
","This has to be one of my favourite Disney movie, ahead of Lion King and Toy Story. I have very fond memories of this classic. Disney's movies these days lack the magic of classics like Jungle Book, 3 or 4 years they would be forgotten. Even the sequel of Jungle Book was woeful and tired and was an insult to the original.<br/><br/>This Disney movie had everything. Classic songs, my favourite is the Bare Nessecities, Memorable characters and a decent story.<br/><br/>The story of Jungle Book goes like this, Mowgli is abandoned by his Mother as a child and was brought up by Bagheera. Years pass and Mowgli is now a young boy when Bagheera hears that man hater Sher Khan is returning to the jungle. It is decided that the jungle is now unsafe and Mowgli must go to the city to live with his own people. Mowgli and Bagheera start their journey through the jungle where they meet Baloo, who can I say is my favourite character. Baloo refuses to let Mowgli return to the village but goes along with them anyway, cue lots of memorable songs and heaps of fun.<br/><br/>On their travels they bump into several interesting characters (Kaa, King Louie, Haathi etc). In the end what happens is Mowgli falls in love and leaves the jungle(please forgive me if I have missed anything). Pure Disney Gold that will live forever."

","In this movie a boy who has been raised in the jungle and lived with the animals, must now leave to join his own ""people."" The story centers around a panther (Bahgeera) and a bear (Baloo) who agree to take the boy to the man-village, and an assortment of other creatures with their own agendas. The beach-bum bear and the up-tight panther's verbal sparring is classic. The social commentary (that went over my head when I was a kid) is funny too. The Jazzy orangatang (King Louis) ""I've reached the top and had to stop"" and the bored vultures ""I dunno, whata' you wanna do?"" are great. I saw this movie when I was a kid, and loved it. My sister and I got the LP and we played it all the time. Now, decades later, I find myself singing (or humming) the songs to this movie. Many kids now-a-days are unfamiliar with this movie (at least this version of the story) but they enjoy even my (amateur attempts) at singing these great songs. There is definitely something about this version. This movie is truly a classic!"
"malkane316","7","1","2","25 March 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Another true classic from Disney, a film almost everyone saw when they were small, and one of the few which they all remember. Based loosely on Kipling's novel, The Jungle Book tells of Mowgli- a boy raised in the jungle by wolves, hearkening back to the Romulus and Remus legend. Mowgli is sent back to humanity by the wolves as Shere-Kahn, a monstrous tiger is coming, and enjoys the taste of 'man-cubs'. along the way, Mowgli meets Baloo the singin', dancin' bear who teaches him the Bear Necessities of life, Bagheera the panther who protects him, King Louie an Orang-utan and Kaa the hypnotic snake. But Shere-Kahn is on their trail.<br/><br/>The Jungle Book has many memorable characters and musical numbers, directed brilliantly into the plot. The animation is a success and it is a story which everyone can enjoy. The funniest moment, for unanswerable reasons is King Louie using his own arms as a skipping rope. I've always found the ending a sad one as I didn't want Mowgli to return to the apparent civilisation; the jungle seems much more fun. Most of the colonial themes are of course absent from the original story, but it is not difficult to read these into the film. However, why bother, as it is not meant to be seen in such a way. Every child will enjoy this, less to enjoy for the older viewer compared with later films.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

"knsevy","9","1","2","28 November 2003"," Disney's classic best
","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The combination of cast, roles, and music never worked as well on any Disney film from the classic era as it did, here. The great voices of Disney feature films are all present, and they all define their characters in an unforgettable way.<br/><br/>Sebastian Cabot, Phil Harris, George Sanders, J. Pat O'Malley, Sterling Holloway, and especially Louis Prima make their animated avatars come to brilliant life in this film, well-adapted from Kipling's book. In watching all the Disney animated features, from Snow White to The Emperor's New Groove, it's hard to find another film in which the voice actors gave such life to the characters they were portraying. Even Monsters Inc. doesn't surpass this.<br/><br/>It might sound a little hokey, but the reason that Monsters Inc and Toy Story couldn't surpass this film is because of the songs involved. The scores for the Pixar films were typical Randy Newman crap, with no real personality to be fixed to the characters. In this film, we have three fantastic, character-driven songs: 'Trust In Me' (Sterling Holloway), 'Bear Necessities' (Phil Harris), and 'I Wanna Be Like You' (Louis Prima). These are powerful, driving songs that not only advance the plot, but establish the characters singing them. Even though he didn't have a whole song to himself, George Sanders' booming voice lent a beautiful close to 'That's What Friends are For.'<br/><br/>If the singing is good, the acting is better. I wish Disney had made greater use of the operatic voice of Sebastian Cabot (try him out in his guest appearance on 'The Beverly Hillbillies!'), who is in perfect feline characterization as Bagheera. Phil Harris was a Disney bear in this movie as Baloo, and again in 'Robin Hood' as Little John. The animals are the bulk of this movie; Mowgli could have been any competent child actor, but only Sterling Holloway could have voiced Kah, in that way.<br/><br/>The character who steals the show, though, is Louis Prima as King Louie of the apes. King Louie is an unbridled, over-the-top character who has probably the greatest complexity of any character in the film. He's ambitious, sneaky, but also simple, and the audience gets the feeling that he's mainly dangerous because he just doesn't think.<br/><br/>I love the old Disney animated films (up to 'Lion King', but not after), and I believe that 'The Jungle Book' is the absolute best of the bunch. This is a great place to start your Disney collection."

","I saw TJB in the theater as a child, and as my own children reached the ages where they could enjoy Disney films, I started stocking up on videos.  I'd forgotten all but 3 or 4 scenes, but as it rolled on the video player, I was literally awestruck at the vivid characterizations.  This is a landmark film, in that it was the first to use established actors (with recognizable voices) for the vocal characterizations.  There's also an excellent ""making of"" short after the film on the Disney video, with trivia, e.g., Sterling Holloway, the classic voice of Winnie-the-Pooh, was Kaa, the python in TJB."
"irishm","3","3","16","14 April 2014"," Didn't like it in 1967, don't like it now
","I remember seeing this at the drive-in probably not too long after its release, so I would have been about 7 years old. For some reason I didn't have good memories of it the way I did with other Disney features, so when I recently had an opportunity to see it again I figured it would be interesting to take a second look at it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I still don't like it. I can understand how I was bored at age 7 in the back seat of my dad's Studebaker, and I was just as bored in my living room last weekend in my early fifties.<br/><br/>So what's the problem with Jungle Book? Well, we can start with the disjointed storyline: Mowgli is sent off to the man-village without so much as a 'so long, son' from his wolf-parents, and viewers never really get an idea what it is that he's leaving or why he should feel bad about not being there anymore. He encounters several jungle creatures, including King Louie who has a long drawn-out musical number and then vanishes from the storyline altogether. Why was he even there, except to eat up ten minutes of screen time? The villain, Shere Khan, doesn't even appear until the film is half-over. And the stand-by villain, a huge snake, just isn't very scary with Winnie The Pooh's voice coming out of his mouth.<br/><br/>The musical numbers and some of the characters are also extremely dated: there are beatnik vultures with Liverpool accents, and King Louie himself is also pretty full of late 1960's attitude. And when Mowgli decides to join the man-village just because a pretty girl winks at him well, Mowgli's around 10, right? A little young for that kind of thing, isn't he? <br/><br/>Some reviewers have criticized the animation; I didn't have a problem with that myself. I'm familiar with the slightly rougher style and as it's a product of its time, it worked for me. I also don't mind when animals and humans speak English together, or when bears sing and dance (ARE there bears in the jungle, by the way?). The story just wasn't very good. One catchy song and that's it. Disney had much better efforts in that era, and I'd recommend just about any of the others over this one. If you liked it as a child you might still like it today, but this kid needed prodding from her parents just to stay awake for the end."

","'The Jungle Book' is a Disney animated film about a boy who was raised by wild animals, and this film is basically a musical representation of his time with these animals and to celebrate his growing up, into an adult and to leave the wonderful animal world behind. Later, Baloo the bear and some of the other characters of this film would go on to be a part of a cartoon series ""Tale Spin"" on the Disney channel. Regrettably, I did not enjoy this Disney animation. The only thing that it had going for it was the music. It's an easily-forgotten Disney animation, and I would not particularly recommend this film. Try 'Bambi' or 'Lady and the Tramp'."
"San Franciscan","Null","2","9","22 April 2001"," Was it old age or nicotine frenzy?
","""The Jungle Book"" was the last film of any kind to have Walt's personal guidance and overall stamp on it. He was very specific on precisely what he wanted to do with it, and his notes and instructions on it were massive. Then just before it was finished, he died of lung cancer (he was a heavy smoker) and the rest of his staff was left with the painful task of completing it without him. Fortunately, they had all his notes he had left behind and bent over backwards to be sure it was exactly as he had envisioned.<br/><br/>Now I would very much love to say that the end result to all that talent, dedication and determination to stick to Walt's intentions was proved worth it in the resulting film, but I can't.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is the weakest and most odious of all of Walt's animated features. <br/><br/>The plot is not exactly the best in the world (plot: Bagheera is taking Mowgli back to human civilization, that's it). The film is basically a string of animated music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot, structurally making it the only animated movie in history to resemble Prince's ""Purple Rain"". Many have complained that it is really Disney's animated ""Robin Hood"" that is the weaker film because it has virtually no plot at all--and that is true in terms of the story, but at least ""Robin Hood"" had genuinely catchy songs from start to finish, boasts truly inspired character design and has memorable, likeable characters with fully-developed personalities and emotions. ""Robin Hood"" is considered a staple on TV and in the hearts of Disney fans everywhere for those very reasons, not to mention far more memorable. In sharp contrast, none of the characters in this version of ""The Jungle Book"" appeal very much--although, of course, Baloo is a lot of fun (Phil Harris is perfect for this role), and Bill Peet's idea of putting in a song called ""Bear Necessities"" was a stroke of genius, especially since it basically could have been fit in a stricter version of the story. Maybe if Peet (who was also responsible for the wonderful animated version of ""101 Dalmations"") had stayed on with the staff instead of leaving after Walt's upsetting him one time too many there would have been more of such moments. The fact that all the other characters are so cardboard is completely inexcusable considering the richness of the source material.<br/><br/>But the biggest and weirdest problem with this movie is how it thoroughly mangles the original classic and considers itself clever for doing so. It would normally be thought that the rest of the staff screwed things up after Walt's death, but no: Walt originally INTENDED the final result to be like this! According to the original artists who worked on it, he brought in Kipling's book and said, ""Here's 'The Jungle Book'. The first thing I want you to do is to not read it.""<br/><br/>Bizarre errors of judgement are present all over this film, weird and odd errors which a younger Walt would never have allowed in, say, a masterpiece like Pinocchio or Fantasia or Peter Pan. Even the animated ""Sword in The Stone"" can be excused from this fact because the original T. H. White books, which ""Stone"" was based on, were every bit as goofy as Walt's version. Was it old age or nicotine frenzy?<br/><br/>An excellent example of strange ideas inserted into the film getting more messed up than they originally were: the puzzling vultures with moptops and Liverpudlian accents. Disney had decided for some strange reason that they would originally be charicatures of The Beatles and was going to invite The Beatles themselves to voice them and perform a song for them (now believe me, it isn't The Beatles themselves I object to here--I adore them!). But at the very last minute, Walt decided to have the vultures sing like a barbershop quarter instead because he decided that The Beatles were merely a flash in the pan and wouldn't remain very popular for another year or two (THIS is ""great genius""??!). Now while it can be argued that this was all Walt's opinion and that he had the right to correct what he felt was a mistake, it nevertheless begs the question: if Walt was so convinced that the old idea was a bad one in the first place, then WHY DID HE LEAVE IT IN AND MERELY EDIT IT INTO ONE THAT WORKED WORSE INSTEAD OF REMOVING THE WHOLE PORTION THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE IN THE PAST? The resulting scene, rather than being ""corrected"", is instead even more confusing and bewildering than it might have been in the first place. Walt's instincts must have really been exhausted for some reason or other... did Mary Poppins take that much out of him?<br/><br/>Judgement like this abounds all throughout ""The Jungle Book"", and while its soundtrack boasts gorgeously hypnotic orchestration and three thoroughly wonderful songs (""Bear Necessities"", ""I Wan'Na Be Like You"" and especially ""My Own Home""), the others are simply awful. (The most annoying one of all is the one from the previously-mentioned section, ""That's What Friends Are For"".)<br/><br/>The film as a whole moves on in a droning, sleepy pace, never once picking up its molasses-running speed. You keep hoping it will pick up, but it never does.<br/><br/>All of these points I've mentioned, and many more, have all been pointed out over and over again since its release by not just paid critics, but also by animation fans and especially Kipling admirers, who rightfully feel that this movie is an appalling travesty and a dreadful mockery to the original stories, but none of this criticism has affected its performance at the box office and as a home video release--in this respect it has been a shocking success.<br/><br/>I have no idea how pleasing this is in the long run, though: ""The Jungle Book"" remains the only Disney animated film I ever saw as a child which, on all three occasions when I saw it at different ages while growing up, bored me to the point of nearly putting me to sleep."

The soundtrack is fantastic with classic songs including ""I Wanna Be Like You"", ""Bear Necessities"", ""Trust In Me"" and the Water song at the end.

It is pure joy captured on film.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not a perfect movie, but I love so many things about it: the characters, the setting, the music, and the animation. It looks even better now with DVD restorations with eye-popping colors and beautifully done backgrounds.<br/><br/>For me, the heart of the film is the character of Baloo. As a big Disney fan, I would probably pick him if forced to choose my favorite character. His relationship with Mowgli is some kind of cross between a big brother, a playmate, and a surrogate father. I know that when I was a preschooler, I wanted nothing more than to hang out with Baloo.<br/><br/>I could never write an objective review for The Jungle Book. I've loved it all my life. The Disney team has given us a timeless gift in this film."

"CinemaClown","Null","2","11","4 May 2016"," Too Juvenile, Innocent & Sugarcoated For My Taste.
","Disney's adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's legendary book of the same name does filter out the dark tone of its source material in an effort to make it more family friendly and certainly was a cinematic gem of its time but looking back now, it's a tad too juvenile, simple & innocent for my taste.<br/><br/>The story of The Jungle Book follows Mowgli, a feral child raised by a family of wolves who is being escorted by Bagheera the panther to his own kind & for his own safety as Shere Khan has returned to the jungle. On their way, they meet Baloo the Bear who takes the young kid under his wing.<br/><br/>Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, this is one of those lighthearted, sugarcoated musicals that are in tune with Disney's early animated classics & is clearly aimed at kids. The hand-drawn animation is admirable but the plot becomes repetitive after a while, is slow despite its 78 minutes runtime & nothing interesting ever happens in it.<br/><br/>The songs aren't catchy, the dance numbers are distracting, and the overly juvenile portrait makes it a tedious film to sit through. Leaving me bored for the most part & unmoved by everything it had in store, The Jungle Book is a film that very much belongs to its era and the only way I can imagine it working today is on the strength of nostalgia."

Only two good songs (the Oscar-nominated ""The Bare Necessities"", and Kaa the Snake's ""Trust in Me"") highlight the music score, and though there's fine voice-work from Sebastian Cabot and Sterling Holloway and some lovely background detail, much of the slapstick is short on inspiration.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","27 December 2011"," The greatest combination of animation, action and ... music ...
","Released at a pivotal time in Disney's history, the difficulty to classify ""The Jungle Book"" in terms of generation, of eras: not from the Golden Age or Disney Renaissance, gives it a sort of privileged place in Disney's list of animated classics.<br/><br/>Most fans would say this is one of the best Disney films, if not the best, and despite my sentimental weakness for ""Aladdin"", I concede that ""The Jungle Book"" is the one I enjoy the most. No other Disney film beats it on the entertainment department: it has the catchiest set of songs: jazzy, swingy, and sometimes hypnotic and the most colorful gallery of characters combining human's stereotypical traits with a realistic drawing. From the villainous Kaa, the sneaky snake and Shere Khan, the evilly refined tiger, to Hathi, the so-military elephant and the groovy vultures, ""The Jungle Book"" is a Disneyan 'Animalistic Comedy' conducted by animators at the top of their game. But again, as the bare necessity of any Disney film, the movie works thanks to the story.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" finds the perfect balance between two universes too often dissociated, humans and animals. Disney films can be divided into two main categories. First, there are the human-centered stories, notably those adapted from fairy-tales like ""Snow White"" or ""Pinocchio"" where real animals are reduced to peripheral purposes and hardly communicate. The more defining of Disney touch are the animal-centered films, which feature the world from their perspective and their interaction with humans mostly made of antagonism, to better understand the level of 'humanity' we can learn from those creatures and question ours, three masterpieces come to mind ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"" and ""Lady and the Tramp"".<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" transcends this antagonism to a more psychological level, through the story of a little boy, virtually made an animal from his raising by a family of wolves and his tutoring by a black panther named Baghera, who must return back to the men's village to escape from the terrifying Shere Khan, the tiger who made every man a personal enemy, a hatred rooted in his irrational fear of fire: the element that interestingly differentiates humans and animals, fire as synonym of weapon, the same that killed Bambi's mom, or the same fire that almost destroyed the forest when men were hunting. Although Mowgli never learned how to make a fire, because he's still an animal, he carries his own race's dangerous heritage, his life is threatened because of his 'human nature', which makes the assimilation of 'animal culture' totally pointless. The irony is that the 'animal culture' is very similar to humans: elephants constituted an army, monkeys a kingdom, so the line between the two worlds becomes very uncertain.<br/><br/>But ""The Jungle Book"" insists on making these two worlds totally incompatible through various episodes starting with Mowgli trying to adapt, becoming an elephant, dancing and partying with the monkeys, even standing up to Shere Khan but ultimately, his weakness as a human prevents him from being accepted. This is the point, Mowgli can become stronger only with a human entourage, it's not about differences as weaknesses, but as potential strengths. And Mowgli's coming-of-age can only be achieved when he'll understand the foolishness of wanting to be what we are not, a lesson that should also learn the zany King Louie who wants to know the secret of fire from Mowgli, to be 'just like humans'. Mowgli's dilemma is to accept his own condition and do what nature commands is undermined by an emotional conflict: Baloo vs. Baghera.<br/><br/>During the first act, Mowgli is lead by Bagherra whose mission is to conduct Mowgli to the village. Baghera is a serious and no-nonsense character with an admirable sense of responsibility. But Mowgli chose Baloo as a fatherly figure because Baloo is simply a big kid who takes life just the way it comes. The ""Bare Necessities"" song is the ultimate hymn for all the lazy, easy-going and positive-attitude guys in the world and this is what drives the bear's life. Baloo and Baghera are the perfect yin and yang for the story, the fun and the serious, the classic polarization of Disney. And this duality made of constant argument reaches its pinnacle in one of my three favorite scenes of the film, when Baloo reassures Baghera that he'll handle everything until the name Shere Khan is mentioned and suddenly, the tone of Baloo dramatically changes, and we can already feel that the two animals are inspired by the same love and desire to protect Mowgli.<br/><br/>My two other favorite moments, although not the most 'impacting' occur when Mowgli finally meets Shere Khan, and is given ten seconds to run away, Mowgli confidently gets himself ready to fight where Shere Khan suddenly jumps roaring at Mowgli's terrified face, in one secondÂ… before Baloo's providential interaction, Mowgli as a vulnerable little child. My last favorite moment is when Baghera starts singing at the end of the film after Mowgli chose to go by himself. It was a nice twist from a very serious character, adding the same level of three-dimensionality than when even the cool and good-natured Baloo decided to take Mowgli to the village. And speaking of the ending, although it's not a canon of adaptation from Rudyard Kipling book, it's morally faithful to the spirit of the film that commands to each creature to be among its own, and Mowgli didn't need to be pushed by Baghera or kept by Baloo, he made his decision alone, after being hypnotized not by a more pleasing form of Kaa-like creatures.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is a cheerful and dazzling celebration of the Disney heritage, talking animals, coming-of-age story, music, dance, thrills and chills and for every laugh, a little tear, but not so much tear in a very feel-good film, except one for the great Walt Disney who couldn't have a greater epitaph honoring his extraordinary contribution on the field of animation and entertainment."

"lee_eisenberg","5","2","23","18 January 2007"," stick with the 1994 movie
","For the most part, ""The Jungle Book"" is another situation where Disney took a classic novel and padded it with songs. I liked the 1994 movie because it focused on colonialism. This version piques my interest nowadays because of who provided the voices: Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima and Sterling Holloway to name a few. To add to that, the vultures were a semi-tribute to the Beatles; I wouldn't have expected Disney to do a tribute to them.<br/><br/>But for the most part, I think that Rudyard Kipling (happy birthday, Rudyard!) wouldn't really approve of how they sanitized the story*. If we accept it as brief entertainment, then it's OK. Is it racist how they portray East Indians? Maybe, but as long as we understand that, then it's OK. After all, there are lots of bare necessities out there.<br/><br/>*As another example of Disney sanitizing a classic story, there's ""Cinderella"".

","Disney's ""The Jungle Book"" was an epic dissapointment for me. I love animation and am normally very pleased with the studio's films (I find now that they get about one right per decade). But ""The Jungle Book"" is a complete contradiction of the original text. I love the voices selected for the characters, no question, and the animation is superb. The introduction perfectly catches the book's feel, with the narrative by Bagheera. The characters are well balanced (although I must declare that I really do find Phil Harris to be funny).. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the story is that Disney instructed the supervisors of this film NOT to read the book while making the film. It shows. The plot is without the complications of the book, the characters make brief appearances (Kaa, Hathi, etc..) and then vanish. Maybe I'm just upset because they left out Ming the Bat. I don't know. They also decided to turn it into a pseudo-jazz musical.. I don't know about that either. I just prefer the book. There's too much sugar in the Disney version, the songs aren't GREAT, and the two human characters are irritating little prigs. I dunno about this movie, maybe I'd have more fun with it if I hadn't read the book. Pinocchio was anything BUT Collodi, but that's a good thing. This is just plain wrong."
"FilmFlaneur","Null","1","11","22 September 2000"," The King of the Jungle
","Criticising The Jungle Book - or Disney's most popular film titles generally - is probably seen as close to heresy in some quarters. After all, it's just for kids, right? Wrong - it's the things that are 'just for kids' which are often the most insidious. It's where layers of misty-eyed memories and nostalgia prevent a clear assessment of what's on offer, or how dated or questionable a favourite story can be. Fear of 'reading too much into it' often precludes critical engagement.<br/><br/>The Jungle Book has many strengths (and the rating I have given it echoes that feeling). Its characterisation is bold and colourful. Sherman and Gilkyson's songs are justifiably classics. Bruns' music is evocative and apt. The plot is well paced and structured. If the animation is not outstanding (particularly when compared to the triumphs of Fantasia and Snow White) it remains perfectly adequate. And yet, and yet...<br/><br/>Why the hesitation? Elements of racism in the movie are certainly stumbling blocks. Louis Prima, although Italian, sings like a black and to modern eyes at least his monkey-man routine should be taken less lightly than it usually is. Baloo speaks for himself, jive daddy talk and all in comfortably stereotypical fashion. Creatures with dignity and power, in contrast, like Shere Khan or Bagheera, tend to have upper class 'English' accents implying disapproving class and authority.<br/><br/>Then there is the question of women - or rather the absence or them. Mowgli one of the long line of orphans in Disney animations (an honourable exception being 101 Dalmations which, constrained by an original, actually has both surviving mother and father figures for the main characters). Sadly Mowgli is one who merely encounters one potential father figure after another. When a female of his own species finally appears, at the end of the film, she is diminutive, housework orientated and apart from singing, singularly bereft of conversation. For the Disney animators, the whole forest is a male playground, one created for jokey bonding and Mowgli's rite of passage, in a scheme that is especially peculiar to the studio. The only exception to this rule of thumb is Colonel Hathi's wife, and remains in vaguely mutinous isolation, happy to support Mowgli in his quest.<br/><br/>Disney's cutsie anthropomorphism is such a common occurrence in his output that it seems natural and all of a piece here. Indeed so used are we to this way of showing nature, that sometimes we forget what we know must be the truth. This is a world, like all of the studio's others, where animals are treated either as objects or, more reassuringly as 'people' with no species life of their own. Its the ideal jungle for Uncle Walt: no creature need be considered at all except in human terms, and everything knows its place. Nature, normally 'red in tooth and claw', sings a comic song for its living, and then is divided into a facetious social system of character actors, ugly and sweet, cunning and charmingly dozy.<br/><br/>And what of Mowgli's journey, his travelling from place to place, from animal kingdom to man-village and from childhood to the brink of manhood? At first sight it seems to be a rite of passage, a period of trial bringing him to maturity. But Mowgli actually learns very little. All Baloo teaches him is how to eat fruit without worrying about the little unnecessary issues in life. His fight with Shere Khan springs more from ignorance and stubbornness than any acquired sense of self preservation or knowledge. Mowgli make some temporary friendships, grows dewy eyed at his first sight of a female.. and that's about it. As a moral journey, it is a failure. (A similar vagueness attends Pinnochio's 'education' where any benefits of experience are overruled by the Good Fairy's largesse) If The Jungle Book intends to provide a lesson of some sort during Mowgli's procession through the undergrowth, then it fails.<br/><br/>Millions have enjoyed Disney's classic before and will do so in future. But at least if we face some of the issues raised, and take a critical look at a characteristic reworking of the source material, it will make the walk through the jungle more interesting."

","When it comes to the Jungle Book, the things that make Disney my idol are few and far between. Firstly, it doesn't merely cross the dreaded line of believable human-animal interaction, it pounds that sucker into the ground. You cannot expect me to take a film seriously that spends its entirety in talking-animal land. It smacks of a film that is squarely aimed at kiddies, and not even moderately intelligent kiddies, but kiddies who scream at the McDonalds to get their happy meal for the next animated tie-in toy (now we're getting into the root of my beef with Pixar). And honestly, that isn't what Disney is about.<br/><br/>Once again, the style of animation is not the quality I would prefer. Yes, this film was born out of the turmoil surrounding the death of the master, but his involvement with animated films had been greatly lessened since the arrival of Disneyland in the 50's. And the thick, blocky lines are simply clumsy to watch, smacking again of cheapness and low quality because ""kids wouldn't notice anyways."" Even as a little child, I could tell that plenty of animation was recycled throughout the film, as huge chunks would play out exactly the same frame for frame.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the savior of the film is the animal characters. They are all wonderfully voiced by their respective actors. If Mowgli had been dropped in his entirety, I probably would actually tip towards liking it. The character was irritatingly stubborn and idiotic, and then I wouldn't be bothered by the ""he speaks the language of the animals"" paradox. Honestly, they might as well have, as Disney was infamous for strictly ordering his team to ignore the original text. Sher Kahn was a smooth and menacing villain- he should have been given so much more screen time. Phil Harris' wonderfully jazzy, booming voice made Baloo, and who can forget ""The Bare Necessities?""<br/><br/>Which brings me to the music, which while distinctly juvenile and has nothing to do with the time period or setting of the film, is just too darn catchy to ignore. The ""Wanna Be Like You"" song is delightful in its Louis Armstrong-ness, but the best number for me was the Beatles- inspired ""Thats What Friends are For"". Just think how mind-blowing it would have been if the Beatles had actually spared some time to record for it.<br/><br/>So all in all: Great music: poor animation. Interesting characters: poor utilization of them. Sure it's tons better than a Saturday morning cartoon, but come on, is that the level you should be comparing a Disney film?"

","'The Jungle Book (1967)' has an odd sort of structure, or lack of it, which leads to a lax pace and utter absence of urgency that's evocative of an overall aimless experience. In the end, it's a somewhat lazy - and, indeed, somewhat lazily put-together (see the multiple pieces of readily apparent reused animation, sometimes just minutes apart) - slumber through extended but unexciting set-piece after set-piece that actually seems in dire need of a proper 'story' - that is, one with character arcs, proper conflict, rising tension and generally more traditional 'beats' - regardless of how closely it follows the events of its source material. The picture isn't devoid of merit, however, as it is a traditionally animated Disney movie and, no matter how stuffy or stiff it seems or how obvious its 'corner cutting' is, there's always a general sense of an unshakable charm, a feeling that the flick is a free-flowing story-book come-to-life like most of the studio's attempts usually are. A couple of song-and-dance scenes stand out not for their narrative merits - or even, particularity, their musical ones (though the songs themselves, sung solo, are certainly good and have stood the test of time) - but for their lively animation and cheerful choreography. These pop off the screen as sequences that deviate from the rest of the movie's slightly 'lower rent' status and easily align themselves shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best of their peers, to the point that they feel like the only reason you'd ever actually watch the movie. Ultimately, there's little here. It's a decent if dull picture that plays it by-the-book and only has a couple of scenes that really stand out, as well as the odd quirk indicative of the style and time. 5/10"

","There are any number of versions of ""The Jungle Book"" out there, ranging from the 1942 film featuring non-actor Sabu, up to the 2016 modernized epic, quite vibrant and colorful but maybe a bit too intense for young kids. This is undeniably the most kid friendly version, at least of those I've seen, and would be a nice introduction to the Rudyard Kipling stories of Mowgli and his animal friends for young viewers. All of the characters are entertaining, up to and including the villainous Python Kaa and Tiger Shere Khan. They aren't drawn or voiced in such a menacing manner that it would send the youngsters hiding under the bed. The jovial animals like Baloo the Bear and King Louie add an amusing comedic element to the story and with the upbeat songs, the film has the ability to transfix it's audience throughout. I had forgotten all about the comical vultures, and while listening today, I couldn't help thinking that yet another modern day remake might make use of Ringo Starr for one of the British voices; that would be just about perfect. With it's fairly short run time of seventy eight minutes, I thought the ending could have been handled just a little bit better as it seemed quite abrupt once Mowgli met the young Indian girl. Be that as it may, the picture has a nice message of friendship and loyalty, and serves well as the nineteenth and last animated feature that Walt Disney would have been personally involved in.

The short, snappy bursts of comedy don't provoke any reaction from me but I'm sure they will with some people.<br/><br/>Best Part: 'Oh the Bear Nescessities!' 9/10"

","As the first film in Disney's Dark Age, The Jungle Book is nothing short of an experience for new moviegoers, who can appreciate a majority of the music, and movie veterans who can appreciate the timeless charm given out by the voice actors, like Louis Prima and Phil Harris. Minor bits of the animation are recycled (Mowgli getting cuddled by the wolves was copied from a similar scene in The Sword in the Stone, but unless you are a die-hard Disney fan like I border, it's unlikely you will notice). The humor hits almost every time, the action is stimulating, and the songs are nothing short of classic. While the 2016 version is better in my personal experience and opinion, I can still appreciate this for what it is: a relatively light-hearted musical comedy, compared to the dramatic thriller of the 2016 ""remake"". Either way, Rudyard Kipling would enjoy the film despite the changes made to the story to banish dark parts."

","This is hands down one of the greatest films ever made! it doesn't matter that its an animated film or that it was made in 1967, or that it is only 78 minutes long. The story, and the characters are all exciting and have a lot of depth in them. Much more then modern day 3 or 4 hour epic adventure movies. <br/><br/>The film, has a very balanced pace with a lot of drama, musical scores and even comedic moments. This what all films should strive to be. Not boring and not long, and always play with the viewers emotion.

Baloo is one the most iconic bears of Cinema, his song The bare necessities is considered to be one of the greatest cinema songs of all time!<br/><br/>If you get the chance to have a look at this film, do not hesitate!!<br/><br/>It is one of the greatest films of all time"

","The Jungle Book is a great movie with a well written storyline and a stellar voice cast. Its filled with very lovable characters, which I think is the main highlight, the relationship between Mowgli and Baloo is very sweet, Shere Khan is a great villain and King Louie is simply a delight to watch. As far as plot goes, it is very weak in comparison to other Disney classics, its extremely straight forward, lacking any extra layers to make it a more compelling story, its simply following a boy who lives in a jungle, eventually being threatened by a tiger, and is eventually saved. The musical numbers are terrific, with the likes of ""Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" always being a pleasure to hear, they are catchy, upbeat and will leave you in a good mood. Though its story may be weak for todays standards, The Jungle Book is a fun, light hearted animation that the whole family can enjoy. <br/><br/>A boy who lives in the jungle with his animal companions is threatened by a ferocious tiger."

","Listed as number 19 in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, The Jungle Book is one of the House of Mouse's most beloved films. Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, Disney demanded a sure-fire hit after the underwhelming response to The Sword in the Stone (1963) and removed any hints of the darkness of Kipling's text in favour of a more child-friendly experience. The last movie to be produced by Walt before his death in 1966, the result is one of the most effortlessly charming films he ever presided over. Featuring possibly the most memorable and catchy song in Disney's history (Bare Necessities), he at least he went out on a high note.<br/><br/>Mowgli (voiced by director Wolfgang Reitherman's son, Bruce) is a young orphan boy who, after being discovered in the deep jungle in a basket by Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot), is raised for the next 10 years in a wolf pack. After learning that the monstrous, man-eating tiger Shere Khan (a wonderful George Sanders) has returned to the jungle, the pack decide that Mowgli must be taken to the nearby 'man-village' to be with own people for his own safety. Bagheera volunteers to escort him to safety, but he soon becomes frustrated with Mowgli's insistence on staying in the jungle and leaves him the hands of Baloo (Phil Harris), a laid-back bear who promises Mowgli to never take him to the man-village.<br/><br/>With animation far below the standard set by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and a group of insufferable vultures modelled on the Beatles, The Jungle Book remains great despite its flaws by being so damn heart-warming. The final scene, as Mowgli gazes upon one of his own kind for the first time, is truly wonderful in its unsentimental simplicity. The music, by the Sherman Brothers and Terry Gilkyson, is one of Disney's best soundtracks, with Louis Prima's jazzy I Wanna Be Like You proving particularly toe-tapping. Cabot and Harris are fun as Mowgli's bickering escorts, but Sanders and Sterling Holloway - as the hypnotising Kaa the Snake - steal the show as the bad guys. One of Disney's very best."

","The Jungle Book is one of the most well-known Disney films ever made and a very good example on how Disney excels when it comes to memorable characters and fantastic songs. Based on Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, it tells the story of Mowgli, a small boy abandoned in the jungle and raised by wild wolves and various other jungle animals, including a panther, a bear and some vultures.<br/><br/>What sets The Jungle Book apart from the other Disney films of the same era is the overall quality of all of its parts. Granted, the animation style is still a bit rough thanks to the Xerox method used to essentially copy and paste certain frames so as to cut corners. But it is a lot better than in the other films they made with it, plus the characters designs are a lot better than was the norm. The songs by the Sherman Brothers are some of the most memorable Disney has ever done and are only surpassed by those in Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>Plus the story and the characters are a lot of fun, and the whole narrative flows absolutely without a hitch, depicting Mowgli's journey out of the jungle as they find out that Shere Khan, the tiger, is returning and is sure to kill any human he comes across.<br/><br/>If I had to name one flaw, I'd say that the villain is something of a letdown in the end. At first he's great, and I totally understand why he's considered one of the strongest Disney villains. Plus it's great that he has something of a competitor in Kaa, the python. But the final confrontation with him and Mowgli was an extreme disappointment, not going to lie. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.<br/><br/>But, aside from that, The Jungle Book is a great deal of fun. Do check out this born classic, you're not going to regret it."

","The Jungle Book is a Disney adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's collection of short stories. The story starts of with a back story of our main character named ""Mowgli"". We also meet the black panther known as ""Bagheera"". The plot is that a child has been found in the jungle and has been delivered to a family of wolves to be taken care of, but time passes and the other animals begin to see that he does not belong in the jungle, and that he belongs with the other men in the village. This idea soon becomes interrupted when another one of the main characters ""Baloo"" he flips Mowgli's world upside down and gives him a new feel on life. After talking to Baloo, Mowgli then decides that he wants to stay in the jungle and never leave his new friend. Disney brings a wonderful twist to the writings of Kipling, the animation is rustic and delivers that old time charm. The characters really do grow on you and you start to develop a connection to them as the story progresses further. The musical numbers in this movie are truly magical, and range among the greatest of Disney. From beginning to end the songs just get better and better. This movie is for audiences of all ages and is really a masterpiece to behold. Overall, this movie delivers a steady plot with lovable characters and memorable music. I recommend this movie for all to enjoy."
"MyNeighborFanboy","7","0","1","14 October 2010"," The Last Gasp
","The Jungle Book is, for me, the last gasp of classic Disney. It's the last Disney movie until the latter half of the eighties that I would qualify as the least bit good, yet, it also suffers from many of the problems of the seventies films. This may also be the first case of mass celebrity voice casting, which works fine here but would set a horrible precedent for American animation that lasts to this day. Thankfully, while it's not quite the sum of those parts, many of its parts are highly entertaining...masterful even.<br/><br/>As Disney himself was now fully committed to other projects, and died before the film could be completed, this is easily the most episodic and scattershot of the Disney projects under his rule. It takes Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli stories, strips them of its issues on human nature, ignores all the later stuff, and instead uses them as a vague suggestion to set up a bunch of characters and fun situations. It particularly hurts the character of Bagheera, whose commitment to getting the child home doesn't make quite as much sense, and Shere Khan's delayed entrance, though well foreshadowed, doesn't have quite the weight or the mythic sort of relationship with Mowgli. Mowgli himself is the cute little scamp Disney requires by this point, which has its value but isn't' as interesting as if they'd made better use of his whole ""raised by wolves"" thing like in the book. Not Disney's forte, perhaps, but one reason why this isn't as good as Princess Mononoke to me (strange comparison, I know).<br/><br/>Animation wise, thoughts are liable to be mixed on this one. There's more shortcuts here than in any previous Disney movie. Reused animation aplenty, funky relationships with the cels and the backgrounds, lots of the kind of stuff director Wolfgang Reitherman would abuse in the seventies. There's one bit in particular that's a straight lift from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.<br/><br/>What at least mostly makes up for this, however, is the fact that this is a tour-de-force of master animators doing some of the best work of their career. Ollie Johnston and Milt Kahl do a great bit with Bagheera trying to get Mowgli into a tree that has no real plot significance but which is a masterpiece of timing. Bear Necessities is an iconic number, but would it be so memorable without Ollie Johnston's fantastic work on Baloo? Johnston also does a remarkable job with Baloo's more emotional moments, such as the scene where he tells Mowgli that he has to leave the jungle. John Lounsbery gives a wonderful feeling of weight and caricature to the elephants, arguably his masterpiece. King Louie works mostly because of his animation by Frank Thomas and Kahl, which is so intricately composed and full of personality that it looks easy (even though it's a monstrous bitch to pull off something like that, especially with his hyperactive movement). However, my favorite bit is the restrained yet perfectly controlled, Picasso-influenced work on Shere Khan by Milt Kahl. It's not the most bombastic of these pieces, but his graceful movement combined with his sinister presence (George Sanders' voice work helps quite a bit). The exchange between him and Johnston's Kaa is brilliant animated acting between two of the greatest animators who ever lived.<br/><br/>Yet, while all these moments are wonderful to watch, there comes a point toward the end where things seem to just fall apart. Three Beatles-influenced Vultures sing a silly barbershop toon that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie. This scene was finished after Disney's death, and hints at the kind of goofiness that would undo the next few Disney pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, The Jungle Book is problematic, but remains an enjoyable picture if one can get past its rough edges. It's the last gasp of the golden age. That's right, folks, my next few reviews are going to be pretty negative, but since very few Disney picture are completely bad and some great work does go into even some of the worst of them, I'll point those elements out too. The Jungle Book, to me, is the mildest example, since the good elements still make this movie work, but the practices of this film never really worked again."
"Herbest8","10","0","1","13 June 2010"," My all-time favorite Disney film
","Off all the Disney animated movies from 1937 to the present, ""The Jungle Book"" has always stood out as something special. This movie is quite simply FUN. There is no romance, no attempt to break new ground with it's effects, no dramatics and none of the hokey ""if you dream it, you can be it"" bull. This movie succeeds in it's simple goal to bypass all that and just entertain you.<br/><br/>The story is inspired by the classic books written by Rudyard Kipling. We follow the man-cub Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman in an appealing performance) as he treks from the jungle to the man-village. Along the way he encounters a strange parade of figures including the sniveling Kaa (voiced by the great Sterling Holloway), the evil Shere Khan (George Sanders) and the rambunctious King Louie (Louis Prima, who gets the film's best song).<br/><br/>His two parental figures are Baloo the Bear and the sage Bagaheera. They are voiced by Phil Harris and Sebastian Cabot and their chemistry together really makes the triangle of Mowgli, the bear and the panther really work. It is probably the most dysfunctional family ever seen in a Disney film.<br/><br/>Everything else works just fine. The songs are cute and catchy, the characters interact well with each other, the setting is stylish and the ending is a departure from the clichÃ©d happy ending. This one feels more ambiguous but altogether more satisfying.<br/><br/>Although there are some things that will make P.C. nuts squawk (the alleged racism) and the animation buffs cringe (the reused animation) that doesn't change the fact that ""The Jungle Book"" is fun, unique, jolly, and full of heart."

","This is one of many Disney flicks I remember from my childhood, but unlike many of them, I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing. From an early age, I was familiar with two of its songs, ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wan'na Be Like You"". I first heard those on an album of songs from animated Disney movies, and then saw where they came from. I also saw the live action 1994 film of the same name on the big screen. I've watched a bunch of full-length Disney cartoons again in recent years, some produced by Walt Disney himself and some made after his death. It took me a while to get around to ""The Jungle Book"", but I finally rented it a few days ago, and as usual with these movies, I still found this one entertaining after all these years.<br/><br/>In the jungles of India, a panther named Bagheera finds a human baby boy (or ""man cub"") in a boat wreck, far from the nearest human village. He takes the boy to a pack of wolves for the parents to raise him with their newborn cubs. The boy's name is Mowgli, and he lives in the jungle for the next ten years. The wolves then learn that Shere Khan, a human-hating tiger, is back in the jungle, and Mowgli will have to be returned to the ""man village"" to be safe! Bagheera volunteers to take him back, but Mowgli is reluctant, as he wants to stay in the jungle. On the way, they encounter creatures that make the journey more challenging, and after the two of them separate due to the human boy's resistance, Mowgli meets a bear named Baloo. This laid back bear teaches him about living a care-free lifestyle, and he now wants to live with him, but Shere Khan is still a major threat, especially after he learns that there's a human in the jungle! <br/><br/>Like many other Disney movies, one thing that helps this film's entertainment level is the animation, most notably the backgrounds here. You obviously can't expect the computer generated backgrounds we see today, but the backgrounds here are still beautiful with the faded colours, especially the green. The story isn't the most interesting one I've ever seen, at least not early in the film, and for a while, I kind of wondered if it was enough to carry the film. Fortunately, I think it gets better along the way, and is often suspenseful, without being too scary. There are also a number of memorable characters, including the lovable Baloo (I might have been introduced to him as a little kid with ""TaleSpin""), Kaa the Snake, King Louie the Ape, Shere Khan, and the vultures based on the Beatles. A lot of the characters provide comic relief. The voice acting is mostly good, with the exception of Bruce Reitherman as Mowgli. The songs are not the best to ever be featured in an animated Disney film, but they are acceptable.<br/><br/>This was the last animated feature, of many, that Walt Disney produced in his career, and it came into theatres nearly a year after his death. It was apparently a box office success, which it deserved to be. It showed that Disney's movie franchise was still going strong thirty years after the release of the flick that started it, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". I'm not familiar with the source material (a collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling), which is usually the case with me and these Disney adaptations, but judging this version of ""The Jungle Book"" just as a film, I think it's good family entertainment, and obviously many would agree with me. There may be more for kids in the film than there is for adults, but many adults could enjoy it as well (that can be said about any good Disney movie), adults who still like animated family adventures."

","My Take: A fine treat for the whole family. <br/><br/>I can honestly say I enjoyed my childhood, if not to say it was definitely the best years of my life (I could go on with describing what made it such a treat, but then again I wouldn't have much time to talk about this movie). So I guess it's safe to say I remember much of it, especially one of the key moments of it. Particularly, I remember what movies I tuned in as a kid. Yes, I used to sit down on the sofa and pop in a VHS of JURASSIC PARK and at least one or two (okay, maybe three) of the LAND BEFORE TIME video sequels. But before other than the VHS, there's the Laserdisc, and other than THE LAND BEFORE TIME, there was THE JUNGLE BOOK.<br/><br/>Recalling it know, however, I have a few minimal afterthoughts. While I can honestly say THE LAND BEFORE TIME (only the first one!) eventually emerged as a contemporary classic on my book, THE JUNGLE BOOK was a fine family entertainment, but quite not up to being the classic I presumed. Still, if entertainment is what you wish it will have when you give it a quick rerun, it sure won't disappoint. From the voice casting to the animation, down to the beat of ""Bear Necessities"", THE JUNGLE BOOK is fine family fun.<br/><br/>Based on the story by Rudyard Kipling (with a purely Disney twist on it of course), jungle boy Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman) is accompanied by Bagheera the black panther (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) and the wacky, groovy Baloo the bear (voiced with glee by Phil Harris) to head for the fabled ""Man-village"" which they believe is where he belongs. Mowgli, reluctant to leave, prefers to stay and groove it with Baloo, while the man-hungry tiger Shere Khan (voiced with menace by George Sanders) and a slimy serpent named Kaa (a familiar voice by Sterling Holloway) looks at him as supper.<br/><br/>It didn't look to me like a classic as it used to be, but it's fine entertainment nonetheless. A fast-paced, often funny adventure for the young and old.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

The animators got his 'stunned' expression perfectly."

","""The Jungle Book"" is a classic Disney film that will go down in history as an important milestone in the history of Disney animation. For starters, this was the last animated film that Walt Disney himself personally supervised. This film ended Walt Disney's animated features with a bang, a fine film that's an improvement over the previous Disney animated feature, ""The Sword in the Stone"". The film is not without its flaws, but it is an effort that is much more confident than the previous Disney animated films that came after the box office disaster that was ""Sleeping Beauty"". Disney took several liberties with Rudyard Kipling's classic. It was originally planned to be a very faithful adaptation of the two books, with Bill Peet outdoing himself on the original treatment. The complex, and rather dark version of ""The Jungle Book"" that he wrote screamed potential, but Walt did not approve and Peet left the studio.<br/><br/>The result is a more comedic musical take on the books, and the liberties taken with the book are there. This allowed the animators to outdo themselves, which they did not do with ""The Sword in the Stone"". The character changes allowed the animators to have a lot of fun with the film, and it can be easily seen. It's more exuberant than the previous two films and it boasts a strong selection of songs. The plot is episodic, but it works for the most part. The characters are well-developed and the animators masterfully get the audience to love them. Baloo is a delight to watch, and Shere Khan might be one of Disney's finest villains with his sophistication and his attitude. Kaa has comic genius written all over. King Louie is probably the best character, and his musical number ""I Wanna Be Like You"" definitely shows it.<br/><br/>One surprising element in the film is how very 1960s-esque it is. Four great vultures resemble The Beatles, and being a Beatles fan, I personally love that. There's some 60s-style slang and dialogue like that. It somewhat makes the film a bit dated, especially with its then-celebrity voice cast. However, the cast perfectly fits each character, so that's not a major complaint. Everything works well, except for one thing. In the 1960s, Walt Disney was losing interest in animation after ""Sleeping Beauty""'s performance in 1959 and his hatred of Xerography, used on Disney films since ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"". Animation from other Disney films and shorts is recycled, and parts of the film feel slightly rushed. However, Walt wanted the animators to deliver a great picture, and that they most certainly did.<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is a musical masterpiece and an important film in animation history, and it's success after the death of Walt Disney convinced the studio to keep going at a time when animation seemed to be on its way out as the 1970s rolled in. Despite some slight flaws (some dated elements, some lazy moments and a couple other flaws with the story), ""The Jungle Book"" succeeds on all fronts. I can excuse these criticisms, and personally for me, the film is one of my favorite Disney films.<br/><br/>A 9.8 out of 10."
"sethn172","10","0","2","31 July 2006"," I like the animals; I like Baloo and Shere Khan the best!!!!!
","1967 had brought us a wonderful animated feature from Disney called ""The Jungle Book."" It had taken place in the jungle; there was a boy in the jungle, and he hung out with some wild, musical animals! The two I know the most are Baloo and Shere Khan; they would end up being characters in ""TaleSpin"" in the early 90s. (Oh, and don't forget Louie, too!!!!!) The most memorable part is the song ""Bare Necessities,"" which gets us into a ""jungle boogie"" while basking in the greatness this film has to offer!!!!!<br/><br/>""The Jungle Book"" is marvelous. It's a great family film, and a sad thing to say: this was released around the same time the man of this company, Walt Disney, had died. May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>(1901-1967)<br/><br/>10/10"
"CKCSWHFFAN","10","0","1","2 March 2006"," My all time favorite Disney film
","If I had to choose my all time favorite classic Disney film, I put them in to 2 groups, between the older & newer film, this would be my favorite of the classic/older films.<br/><br/>Why? The music!! The Sherman Brothers out did themselves with this one, just like they did with the Oscar winning music from 1964?s ?Mary Poppins?.<br/><br/>Without question, my all time favorite Disney song ""I Wanna Be Like You"" with Louis Prima.<br/><br/>The music from this film I can play over & over again.<br/><br/>Then, the scenes in the film with the music I can play over & over as well.<br/><br/>Disney NEEDS RIGHT NOW, A SPECIAL EDITION DVD WITH EXTRAS FOR THIS FILM.<br/><br/>No doubt in 2007 they SHOULD release a 40th anniversary edition on DVD. Will purchase it promptly.<br/><br/>Great voice talent for this film as well."
