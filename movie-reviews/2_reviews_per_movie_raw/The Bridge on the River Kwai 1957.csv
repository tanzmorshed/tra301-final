","After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""Summertime"", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.<br/><br/>The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of ""Colonel Bogey March"" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.<br/><br/>Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to ""Summertime"", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.<br/><br/>The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, ""The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai"", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short."

","I have watched this movie several times and it is just getting better and better all the time. Why? Because this movie actually has a message built-in, this isn't a violent story, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - also a good movie with a message - but it is still not a slow story.<br/><br/>When I last saw it, I realised that there was something in the movie that I had never understood, this isn't a movie about war, torture or how it was to be a prisoner of war; this is a movie about madness and pride. The pride shows both in Saiko and Colonel Nicholson, they are so full of it that it is almost impossible for them to come to a civil-conclusion with the problems they have with each other. The madness is shown in Colonel Nicholson and Holden's character - here they are, two prisoners of war and they don't want to help each other out, instead they try to reach separate goals, and they are both willing to die for it.<br/><br/>After you have watched this movie one is amazed by the performances made by Alec Guinness and William Holden and I must say that this is therefore one of the best War/Drama movies ever made My vote? 9 out of 10 naturally."

","I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular.  Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography.  Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson.  The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable.  Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men.  Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy.  The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined.  Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge.  In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.  One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances."

","Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,' director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  <br/><br/>	As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.<br/><br/>	Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan' Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  <br/><br/>	From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.<br/><br/>	Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.<br/><br/>	Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai' is one of David Lean's masterpieces.  It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."
"Wormtongue1","10","118","156","10 December 1999"," A powerful film experience
","I heard a film critic once say that there really aren't ""war movies""; there are only ""anti-war"" movies.  I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right.  -Kwai-, I believe, is both a ""war"" and ""anti-war"" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.<br/><br/>There is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy.  David Lean's direction is tight and evocative.  The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen).  The acting is top-notch.  I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable.  William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.<br/><br/>The musical score is also right on.  Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.<br/><br/>Clearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film.  There is no glorification here.  War is brutal, period.  It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles.  Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly.  Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity.  One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them.  The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film.  War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.<br/><br/>So, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie?  I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Regardless,  -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none."
"Doylenf","Null","67","86","5 April 2003"," Nothing less than a masterpiece...
","About as Oscar-worthy as any film made in the '50s is David Lean's gripping BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean's direction.<br/><br/>The jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.<br/><br/>Some of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get."

"Sickfrog","9","100","142","14 August 1998"," Far Ahead of Its Time
","First off, what is so amazing about this film is that, for the time that it was made, how modern it looks. David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white.<br/><br/>   William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not.<br/><br/>   Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British's own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil. <br/><br/>   And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece ""Saving Private Ryan."" But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago."
"gcaplan","6","378","570","29 June 2002"," Good film, but a travesty of history
","I am normally an admirer of David Lean. But it is difficult to understand why he chose to base this film on a real event at the River Kwai, as it grossly misrepresents the real ""Colonel Nicholson"" and caused considerable distress to both him and the River Kwai veterans.<br/><br/>The Colonel Nicholson character is based on the allied camp commander, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey, who was a remarkable officer by any standards.<br/><br/>Awarded the DSO for heroism during the defence of Singapore, he refused an order to join the evacuation so he could remain with his men during captivity. In the hellish conditions of the camp, he worked courageously to ensure that as many of his men as possible would survive. He endured regular beatings when he complained of ill-treatment of prisoners, but as a skilled negotiator he was able to win many concessions from the Japanese by convincing them that this would speed the completion of the work. Behind their backs, however, he did everything possible to delay and sabotage the construction without endangering his men, and also helped organise a daring escape, at considerable cost to himself. For his conduct in the camp, he won the undying respect of his men.<br/><br/>After the war, he showed great generosity of spirit by saving the life of Colonel Saito, second in command at the camp and a relatively decent officer, when he spoke up for him at the war crimes tribunal. He worked for the veterans all his life, and became President of the National Federation of Far Eastern Prisoners of War.<br/><br/>He refused repeated requests by the veterans to speak out against the film, being much too modest to seek any glory or recognition for himself. However you will find his achievements documented in a book by Professor Peter Davies entitled ""The Man Behind the Bridge"".<br/><br/>Toosey hoped that no one watching the film would believe a British Army officer could be so stupid in real life. But with the film being rated on this site as one of the top 50 movies of all time, this hope may have been misplaced. Enjoy the film by all means as a work of fiction, but it is surely important to set the record straight and recognise the heroism of the real man involved."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","48","66","25 April 2006"," Unlike The Bridge, This Movie Holds Up
","SPOILER: This film is long (161 minutes), is almost 40 years old, and yet still is terrific, still holds up and will forever, I suspect, be considered one of the greatest war movies ever made.<br/><br/>'Kwai' is particularly amazing in that there is very little action in it, yet it consistently entertains - during the actual movie and no matter when you see it. It entertained me when I saw in the theater as a 12- year-old as years later as a 50-something-year-old seeing it on DVD. I say this to encourage younger people to check this film out, and give it a chance. <br/><br/>Anyone who is fascinated with character studies might find this particularly interesting with Alec Guiness' role in here as Colonel Nicholson. He was mesmerizing in his role. William Holden, Sessue Hayakawan, Jack Hawkins and the rest of the cast are all excellent, with the four mentioned above perhaps playing the roles of their lives.<br/><br/>The gorgeous countryside of Ceylon is photographed beautifully. David Lean, one of the all-time great directors, did this film, too, so it certainly has good credentials. A winner of seven Oscars, this great movie has stood the test of time."
"Spleen","10","65","92","6 September 1999"," Ageless and all but perfect
","Of all war movies this is the one with the best idea behind it.  Think how easy it is to make a bad war movie.  A group of people must blow up a bridge, and this is the story of their quest ...  Actually, that DID serve as the premise for a film: it was called `Force Ten from Navarone', and it was dire.  Or how about this one: we see close up the brutalities of war. (Then we see them again.  Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.)  Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive.  Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.<br/><br/>They're all present, in a sort of a way: but ALSO present is a magnificent, long, suspenseful, tight story, around which these apparent clichés wrap naturally.  If the clichés don't wrap naturally then they, not the story, are bent out of shape.  Just when we think that the American pragmatist will turn out to be the hero, we see him cut a rather shabby figure, and it seems that there really WAS something to that highfalutin talk of honour and glory, after all.  But then we discover that he has standards of his own, and they appear to be better ones.  But THEN it seems that ...  I could go on indefinitely, since there are many people here with something to be said for them, and it requires some thought to see who has the most to be said for him in the end.<br/><br/>There's almost no need to mention the excellent performances, photography and music.  The only thing one might have qualms about is historical accuracy.  Nothing like this ever happened.  Still, that makes the movie much less dishonest than those that base themselves on historical events, and then proceed to get them all wrong.  You can only be misled by `The Bridge on the River Kwai' if you don't know that it's pure fiction.  Well - you know now."

","The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean's first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the ""intimate"" epic of the late 50s and early 60s.<br/><br/>We are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.<br/><br/>The problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman's multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952's The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.<br/><br/>Lean's use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean's crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director's work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.<br/><br/>Lean's handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That's a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn't get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille's The Cheat (1915) – and it's great to see him at the top of his game again here.<br/><br/>Bombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean's assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since."
"theowinthrop","10","15","19","1 September 2006"," ""Madness, Madness""
","Let's face it - war is organized madness, and although the stakes in World War II were tremendous for whichever side lost, the individual effects of the war on the men and nations involved caused madness on several levels.<br/><br/>Pierre Boule's short novel brilliantly discusses the madness in the crazy situation that sweeps up Colonels Nicholson and Saito. Under normal circumstances, the two men might never had been friends but they might have had a degree of respect for each other. Both come from nations that have long histories and traditions, and whose officer corps prided themselves on leadership and withstanding privations. The Japanese formalized these traditions in the code of Bushido (which was twisted, unfortunately, in World War II). It included sharing privation with one's men and was similar to the concept of noblesse oblige that the aristocratic officers of Britain's army tried to maintain. Nicholson's stoicism when put into the isolation box was as much in his tradition as Saito's tradition would have included willingly reducing his own share of his rations for the benefit of his men in a siege.<br/><br/>The situation that develops is a racial rivalry. The Japanese, in 1943, have won so many of the campaigns, and witnessed the surrender of Allied (i.e. Western - American, British, French, Dutch troops) that they really have a contempt for them. As we now know was true, the Japanese soldiers frequently fought to the last man (think of Saipan and Okinawa in the last stages of the war, where flame throwers were frequently used to force Japanese soldiers and civilians out into the open). Westerners could do this too, but traditionally the western states saw no shame in surrendering after putting up a hard fight. Not so the Japanese military.<br/><br/>Saito is identifying with this tradition. In the novel, he is also disappointed that he is in charge of a prisoner of war camp - he'd prefer to be back in the fighting. But they need the prisoners to build the railroads throughout the new Japanese empire (as mentioned on another comment, the ""Greater East Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere"") that can have men and material race from one end of the empire to the other.<br/><br/>In reality this frequently ended up more like slave labor than what Boule arranges (or what Saito probably had in mind). Nicholson insists on treatment under the Geneva convention for P.O.W.s, but Saito thinks it's typically Western and wimpish. As punishment for his presumption he puts Nicholson in a hellish underground cell in solitary. But Nicholson's men refuse to cooperate until he's released, and when he is he sneers at the Japanese engineers and their mistakes, and insists on the English army engineers taking control of the building - and this works well for the Japanese Army but not for Saito, who seriously feels like he has lost face and should commit suicide.<br/><br/>Director David Lean wisely shot the film on location, capturing the heat and disorientation of a humid jungle war front. His wide screen film manages to make the locale of the prison camp and the Kwai River (and the bridge) look like it is the entire world, and that escape is impossible from it (indeed the one man who escapes - Holden - has to return eventually). <br/><br/>The novel does not include the character played by William Holden, one of his typically laconic Americans who retain a clear sightedness when compared to the British. Holden's ""Shears"" sees the prison camp as a massive graveyard (he's on the burial detail) and hates it to the point of escaping. He reaches safety in a recovery hospital in Ceylon, but he's forced by Jack Hawkins to return to the campsite to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>Hawkins' too seems a realist - he is trying to destroy an enemy target that is nearly completed, and will make the enemy's war effort far easier. But his resolve to do this involves blackmailing Holden into assisting him, and forcing himself to continue on his mission after being seriously injured. At the end the mission kills hundreds of men. Hawkins has succeeded, but the local natives who assisted him look at him like he is a mass murderer.<br/><br/>Guinness' Nicholson is one of the most myopic soldiers in film (or fiction for that matter) totally forgetting the purpose of himself and his soldiers even in a P.O.W. situation but thinking solely in terms of oneupmanship and morale. It was a splendid performance. One might make a case that he behaved like a man who was hallucinating after an illness, and indeed he does (accidentally) get back to reality at the eleventh hour - too late to save himself, but in time to save his military honor.<br/><br/>Sessue Hayakawa had a film career in Hollywood that went back to the silent period (even appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in a Cecil B. DeMille movie), but the coming of sound and the deterioration of Japanese-American relations caused him to leave American movies. Like Swanson's sound comeback in Wilder's SUNSET BLVD., Hayakawa's appearance as Saito, a harsh foe but ultimately sympathetic given his code of behavior and how he is humiliated, brought him belated recognition and an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Finally there is James Douglas, a highly useful, plain looking British actor who frequently brought dollops of common sense to his films. His P.O.W. Major Clipton tries to rouse Nicholson's sense of reality, but fails (in fact he soon sees that Nicholson's unreality is far more catching with the rest of the British P.O.W.s than he imagined). He sees natural foes, British and Japanese, joining together building a bridge of friendship in a time of war. And the final result is just destruction, confusion and death from that war. Is it any wonder that at the end, he mutters the two words in the ""Summary Line"" as the story's conclusion."

","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a prinoner-of-war drama at its best, masterfully directed by David Lean.<br/><br/>Amazing direction, and the whole approach to making this film is timeless - a study in being ahead of its time. Stunning set pieces and production design - such and effort was put into this. Fantastic cinematography, filled to the brim with pitch-perfect pans, wide-shots, and tracking-shots. Intense and dramatic score, deservedly receiving one of the total of seven Academy Awards. Brilliant cast and in particular Alec Guinness, who perfectly portrays a man of honour.<br/><br/>What is a big shame is the way Colonel Philip Toosey - the original colonel, portrayed through Nicholson - was misrepresented, in that he actually acted very differently and much more courageously than in the film.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, as a look into the historic event that took place in 1943 Burma, it is absolutely brilliant, and although the film does not carry loads of emotional moments, it is technically excellent, and greatly entertaining.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"cwente2","10","12","16","29 June 2005"," An Intimate Epic
","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is neither an anti-war, nor a pro-war (if there is such a thing) film. I'm not really sure just what such designations actually mean. ""Bridge ..."" is richer and more personal than a simple depiction of epic events. In ""Bridge ..."", the epic supports the intimate. If you miss this, you miss a lot. ""Bridge ..."" is about the human heart first, and war second.<br/><br/>After 47 years, it remains a powerful illustration of our failed hopes as human beings. (something sorely lacking in the more technically pre-occupied action films of today.) Oddly, it's an able companion to the less cinematic ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", or ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof"" -- full of irony -- brilliant, subtle, and ultimately believable because we've all, in one way or another, experienced the feelings and the fears of the principals.<br/><br/>You can't miss, entirely, this interpretation if you watch the film carefully, and open your senses to the quieter moments: Saito weeping alone having lost the battle of wills, or sending a letter home (Even a brutal camp warden can do that -- nation, race, codes of honor notwithstanding); Saito's confession to Nicholson that he had wanted to be an artist but that his father thought he ""belonged in the army""; the scene on the completed bridge, which Saito begins, looking at the sunset and quietly declaring - ""beautiful!"", with a detached Nicholson attributing the observation to the bridge (his obsession); Nicholson, in turn, speaking of his thoughtful realization that he is ""nearer the end than the beginning"", and wondering, aloud, what the sum total of his life has meant ""to anyone or anything"". . . Rescued by the bridge, Nicholson, at last, has something of value to leave behind.<br/><br/>. . . Neither, are the supporting characters free of the ironies of our existence. Shears yearns for a world in which there's no place for war, but who's final act is the ultimate act of war -- killing the enemy close-up, with a knife, and ending his own life in the same cause as did the prisoner he buried, and who's name he could not recall. Joyce, the recruit, who's pre-war occupation consisted of checking and re-checking columns of figures, wants the challenge of ""thinking"". The denouement of his aspiration nearly costs Warden his life and, ultimately, costs him his own.<br/><br/>The climactic irony (Shakespearian to be sure) comes with Nicholson's realization that he has been living in ""his own"" and not ""the world's"" reality. A ""friendly fire"" mortar round, exploded behind him, shakes him back to ""the way things are"". . . ""What have I done?"", he asks before he falls on the plunger that will explode his own -- his only -- ""beautiful creation"" (ironically, again, his enemy's confirmation).<br/><br/>We all strive to create, or just contribute to, a world in which our dreams can flourish. This includes the powerful, who approve the wars, and the powerless, who fight them. But, often, we find the realities of that world make the dreams of our part in it impossible to realize: The ""madness"" which, above the carnage, Clipton desperately verbalizes.<br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a true classic because it can be so many things to so many people -- and it is timeless: The kids and many adults will enjoy the action, the historians will enjoy critiquing its accuracy, veterans will re-visit the comradeship of the ""trenches"", and film buffs will revel in the picture's rhythm, drama, and well-executed technical elements.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, the settings, costumes, historicity, etc. are only ""helpers"" (however beautifully provided by Lean and company). Its bigger theme -- the aspirations of the human heart, and the painful surrendering of those aspirations -- are what we are most urgently invited to experience in this extraordinary film. 10 out of 10."
"hnt_dnl","10","8","10","14 March 2008"," Great film from a year of great movies.
","Man, 1957! What a year of great films: 12 ANGRY MEN, PATHS OF GLORY, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Sometimes, I think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one of the great years of films and that's a shame. BRIDGE won Best Picture in this year, one of the very few in film history that I think is at least deserving. That said, PATHS OF GLORY is amongst the top 10 films of all time as far as I'm concerned, but I don't think it was released immediately in the U.S. in 1957, so I can forgive the Academy that one!<br/><br/>This film is about a band of British POWs at a Japanese internment camp in the Burmese jungle during mid-WWII. They are led by career military man Colonel Nicholson (Best Actor Oscar winner Sir Alec Guiness) and the camp's Commander Saito forces Nicholson and his men to build a railroad bridge which trains will be able to cross to transport enemy troops and dignitaries, and to get supplies to enemy forces. Nicholson, ever the 'loyal' British officer, agrees to build a quality bridge in exchange for Saito treating his men in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some of his officers question Nicholson's collusion with Saito and wonder about his patriotism. Also questioning Nicholson's motives are an American POW Shears (William Holden, who actually has top billing in this film and gives a terrific performance in his own right). Shears escapes the camp, only to be drafted by Major Warden (2nd billed Jack Hawkins) to be part of a team of Allied soldiers to return to the camp to destroy the bridge. Shears is necessary to lead the expedition since he was at the camp and could lead them the quickest route to get there.<br/><br/>The film speaks a lot about the duality of man: on the one hand as 'prisoners' of war, Nicholson wanted he and his men to be treated accordingly to the Geneva convention, but he knew that to get this treatment, he had to make compromises with Saito; on the other hand, they were prisoners of 'war' and Saito is the enemy and it is unspoken rule that you should never collude with the enemy, even if it means mistreatment and taking uncalled for punishment. Nicholson is very prideful, prim, and proper and let these properties shine through. In his mind, he was doing his duty as a 'British' soldier, but in the end realized that what he was really doing was betraying the core values of what it really meant to be a British 'soldier'.<br/><br/>The film is also very watchable, even today. You get completely enthralled by the story and characters. It never seems dated. The climactic bridge-destroying scene at the end always blows me away (no pun intended). And the last line in the film is one I've never forgotten and sums up the point of the whole film. A true classic."
"whatalovelypark","5","18","27","2 October 2015"," Satire on Kwai
","This movie can only be watched as a comedy. Very English, and played dead straight.<br/><br/>The Japanese are clueless idiots that can take over huge areas of territory, but have no idea how to make a bridge. A British officer (Alec Guinness), confronted with the uncivilised scoundrels, decides he'd rather spend a month in a heat box in Burma than have his officers work, following the Geneva Convention. Behind schedule and desperate for assistance, the British educated but cringeworthy Japanese commander offers the officer good food and wine, but is rejected. Eventually the Japanese commander relents. After a mere month in an amplified 100% humidity 35 degree Celsius environment, the British officer, showing few ill effects, decides to take over the building of the bridge, to bring a little British civilisation to the jungles of Burma. It's all jolly good show, and very capital, what. It brings great spirit to the men, and they respond with a bespoke bridge, built to last 600 years. They even place a nice plaque on the bridge, celebrating their achievements - written in English, of course.<br/><br/>Unknown to the officer, a group of British-US-Canadian 'commandos' (all four of them) are bringing plastic explosives, with young Burmese ladies to carry their possessions and assist in their baths. They encounter only three Japanese soldiers on the way to the bridge, and are soon viewing the bridge from the nearest hill, alongside the Burmese ladies. One of the team sets plastic explosives on the bridge, with a wire from the bridge that is so obvious, that only a British officer can spot it, and he immediately tries to stop his piece of British colonialism being destroyed - even if it does aid the enemy.<br/><br/>The ending is so absurd it has to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>This movie is Englishness to its core. If someone asked me to give them a movie exemplifying English culture, this would be hard to go past. It isn't a war movie, it's an attack on the rigid English class system, English superiority complex, and servile masses pushed to its extreme limits. There are so many clues, such as one English officer presenting a suicide pill to the American soldier, but when placed in a situation where he might use it, he is instead carried by several lovely Burmese ladies on a stretcher, right to the bridge. When Guinness, the epitome of the English class system, falls on the detonator, the film is brought to its natural conclusion. You can almost imagine Lean and co's wry smiles if only one person in the cinema actually got it, and roaring with laughter when the Americans gave him an Oscar for a 'war film'. <br/><br/>You can admire it as a satirical comedy. But it is a bit slow. <br/><br/>It is also a bit hypocritical, the English upper class using the hideous treatment of British soldiers for their high farce. So what if a few working class men died, this is art damn it."
"Local Hero","Null","14","21","19 January 2001"," A true classic, despite one disturbing aspect
","In my opinion, David Lean is one of the cinema's greatest directors, in the highest pantheon along with the likes of Kurosawa, Welles, De Sica, and Bergman. Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and his vastly underrated ""A Passage to India"" are unmitigated masterpieces, and some of his 'smaller' films, such as ""Summertime,"" ""Great Expectations,"" and ""Brief Encounter"" are true gems.<br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" should justly be grouped with ""Lawrence"" and ""India,"" as all three are sweeping in scope, and all three are some of the most thematically ambitious films ever made, reflecting a mature filmmaker at the peak of his craft. Like ""Lawrence,"" ""Kwai"" does not flinch for a moment while it forces the viewer to gaze deep into the chasm of the human condition, and it is not an easy film to take in, as it presents us with profoundly symbolic (archetypal, you might say) character types, most of whom elicit both admiration and repulsion, sympathy and frustration. And while the film explores these character themes at length, it is ultimately content to leave the conflicts unresolved, happy simply to present us with the Hamlet-like paradoxes that are the human condition in all its glory and stupidity.<br/><br/>If there is any clear, unequivocal message that can be gleaned from ""Kwai,"" it is an ode in praise of stoic virtue and the struggle for dignity and meaning in the face of a hostile universe-- in this case, in the face of an inhuman and absurd war. However, ironically, it is in this very aspect that the film, in my opinion, has its greatest failing. In retrospect, it would seem that in order to distill the film's philosophical elements down to universal themes, and perhaps in order to make the story palatable to 1950s audiences (and more Oscar-worthy?), the film greatly tones down the very inhumanity of the historical situation it portrays. In reality, the Japanese were perfectly capable of engineering their own bridges and, far more importantly, the building of the Burma-Thailand Railroad was an atrocity so vast and inhuman that it can only be rightly compared with the Nazi Holocaust and the Khmer Rouge Genocide. The true ""stiff upper lip"" displayed by the surviving prisoners-of-war from that hell in the jungle was not an insistence that a bridge be built right if it is to be built at all, etc.; the true ""stiff upper lip"" was mere survival itself, as thousands upon thousands were dying of starvation, overwork, constant beatings, summary executions, disease and exposure. While it is true that not every film about war needs to be ""Shoah,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""The Killing Fields,"" and ""Kwai"" should be viewed on its own terms, as a film solely about the themes and characters it has chosen to depict; nevertheless, by so greatly downplaying the horrors of the actual historical situation it portrays, the film ultimately does a great disservice to the hundreds of thousands of people of several nationalities who suffered and died in the building of this monstrosity of a railroad. While it seems to me that the intentions of the filmmakers were noble, that Lean sought to explore the struggle of the human spirit under the greatest adversity, the film's light treatment of the still-seldom-discussed topic of Japanese war crimes inadvertently trivializes that very struggle.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I still feel that ""Kwai"" is an amazing cinematic achievement in its own right. And while it would only be with heavy reservation that I place it on a list of ""greatest films,"" it does manage to squeak onto my hypothetical Top 100."

","British Army Colonel, captured along with his regimen by the Japanese on the island of Burma in 1943, refuses to abandon the rules of his government and build a railroad bridge across the Kwai river according to the plans of his mercurial Japanese counterpart, Colonel Saito. Saito, under orders from his superiors to have the bridge completed by a certain date, eventually yields to the Britisher's demands and construction gets under way, but a POW escapee from the American Navy has been recruited by British officials in nearby Ceylon to return to Burma and blow the bridge up. Complex clash of personalities, with Best Actor Oscar Winner Alec Guinness nimbly helping us to understand his character's motivations (he not only engineers the building of the bridge to aid the enemy, but helps construct a masterpiece--while underlings wonder if perhaps a temporary structure might have sufficed). To be engrossed by this Best Picture Academy Award winner is to eventually sympathize with Guinness' Colonel Nicholson, who figures it's better to build something worthwhile and long-lasting (even as a prisoner) than to do a sloppy job. David Lean (winner for Best Director) does some of his liveliest work behind the camera; opening the film carefully, like a good novel, he lays all these difficult, stubborn warriors on the table and allows us to get close to each one. That said, the big climactic finish--while suspenseful--is ultimately a let-down. Lean's staging is sufficient...perhaps the editing is at fault? Throwing out the people we've come to know so intimately for the sake of rousing visual action leaves a sour taste behind. Yes, it is the madness of war to finish with no winners, only losers; however, the way it plays out here feels half-hearted, and a line of dialogue from Jack Hawkins' Major Warden adds a curious layer of dissatisfaction and confusion. Pierre Boulle was also awarded an Oscar for adapting his own novel (he was fronting for blacklisted screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson); Jack Hildyard won for his cinematography, Malcolm Arnold for his commanding music, and Peter Taylor for his (rather spotty) editing. *** from ****"
"votarus4","Null","36","64","3 September 2002"," KWAI -- NOW
","Without belittling `Kwai,' it does seem, looking backwards at David Lean's career, to be a dress rehearsal for the more operatic, tightly controlled (and better written) `Lawrence of Arabia.'  Alec Guiness's passionate, detailed performance as Colonel Nicholson, above all other factors, makes Kwai a still watchable and important experience.  The screenplay, however, divides unevenly between those who must build the Bridge and those who must destroy it.  Ebert, in his Great Movies article, correctly identifies William Holden's character in Kwai as undergoing an implausible transition from escaped POW to martini-guzzling playboy to selfless war hero. Verbatim:  `Holden's character, up until the time their guerrilla mission begins, seems fabricated; he's unconvincing playing a shirker, and his heroism at the end seems more plausible.'  That, I believe, is also Kwai's greatest weakness.  Holden's relationship with Jack Hawkins (playing a parallel role to his General Allenby in Lawrence) seems pallid next to the mighty Guiness/Hayakawa standoff  in fact, it seems to be in another movie altogether.  Also, Malcolm Arnold's score, which I loved when I was a kid, seems now jarringly inappropriate from start to finish.  I am too much influenced, I suppose, by the rock and roll jungle menace of Coppola's `Apocalypse Now.'  Lastly, it is many decades past 1957.  Images of whistling soldiers, marching proudly after months of captivity, then putting on an `entertainment' more expected in the world of Rodgers and Hammerstein, may ring very false to today's viewer.  But keep your eyes fastened tight to Alec Guiness.  Kwai is the Everest of his career, and very few actors climb that high."
"rmax304823","9","18","31","2 September 2004"," Among the Best.
","This may be the best war movie -- if that's what it is -- that was ever put together. I don't think it would be made today. It was expensive and there were no women in it to speak of, and any committee member with an MBA reading the script would wonder why there wasn't more action. Further, the movie hasn't got any magnificent computerized graphics going for it. And we hardly see any blood. And nobody's head gets blown apart. And there's not a foul word in it.<br/><br/>David Lean has pulled off a neat stunt, making a superb film with a good script, great performances, effective location shooting, a subtext that provokes thought, a marvelously believable set of characterizations -- and no gimmicks.<br/><br/>It begins traditionally enough, with red mud and brilliant green foliage, and an authentic prisoner of war camp into which Nicholson's captured battalion marches proudly. The first real hint we get of the film's originality is when the men are marching in place to Colonel Bogey's march and we get one or two shots of feet stomping up and down on the wet gravel. One pair of feet wears only half shoes. The toes are pointing out of the right shoe. On the left shoe, the upper has separated from the sole, and it flaps up and down as the foot inside it drives into the earth. Not only is the shot THERE but it's lingered over, just long enough.<br/><br/>William Holden is running through the bushes, trying to escape from the camp, disturbing flocks of bird that chirp madly at him. One of his Japanese pursuers shoots him and he tumbles into a turbulent river. In any Hollywood movie, the drop would be done by a stunt man in the usual manner -- head over heels, arms flailing, off the cliff. Not here. Holden falls feet first, hands and palms held out at his sides, as if expecting to land on a trampoline. He simply doesn't FALL like a professional.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with grace notes like this. It's difficult to imagine a director willing to take the time to fine tune his film like this today because both the people making films and the viewers themselves are impatient to get on with the story and reach the next scene that has sex, blood, or comedy in it. I wonder if it's coincidental that people now categorize themselves as fans of one or another basketball team instead of a baseball team. Watching a baseball game calls for patience while the batter digs his cleated shoes into the dirt around the plate. Basketball is all momentum and no patience is required.<br/><br/>I won't go on about the movie except to say that it's masterly in almost every respect. But I guess I will mention one more thing of the sort that impressed me, dealing with characterization. Throughout the movie, we've been told and shown that Nicholson cares for nothing so much as the bridge itself. He began by thinking of it as a way to keep up the men's morale and a reason for keeping discipline, but it has come to have functional autonomy, eclipsing everything else in importance. Note the way Guiness's eyes light up in the day-for-night scene when he's told that similar bridges built of English elms have lasted for three hundred years. ""Three hundred years!"", he marvels.<br/><br/>Likewise, the supporting character of Joyce, on the commandos, is shown as being uncertain of whether he could use his knife in hand to hand combat or not. When an armed Japanese soldier appears at arm's length, Joyce freezes and Jack Hawkins dashes in to kill the man. <br/><br/>These two traits -- Nicholson's obsession with the bridge and Joyce's inability to use a knife -- are set up so that the final (and only) confrontation between Nicholson and Joyce can take place the way it does. Nicholson screams, ""Blow up the BRIDGE?"", grabs Joyce's legs and pulls him down to the sand, preventing Joyce from reaching the detonator. Commandoes be damned, nobody is going to destroy his bridge. Hawkins and Holden shout from the opposite bank of the river, urging Joyce to ""kill him!"" But Joyce can't kill him without using a knife, which we know he will be unable to do.<br/><br/>It's a perfect payoff for what we've learned about the two men.<br/><br/>Did Nicholson deliberately throw himself on the detonator as he was dying or did he fall on it by accident? Who cares. If he did it deliberately it would be a heroic act since he finally ""came to his senses."" But an accident would be more in keeping with the ironic tone of the rest of the film. At the end, everyone and everything of importance is dead except Clipton the humanitarian doctor who tells us unnecessarily that this is ""madness"" -- and those floating vultures with their Olympian view of these goings-on.<br/><br/>It's a gripping movie from beginning to end, a magnificent job by everyone involved."

","I have a deep admiration for David Lean as the director who pushed the boundaries of film making far beyond, and set the marker not only in technical aspects of the craft, but often in atmosphere and feel of the film. His movies are beautiful to watch and that's why sometimes we can't see how bad the cake tastes from all the icing and decorations. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is like that, sticky sweet but ultimately nauseating. Every time a movie parts from reality we observe a genre, and the intention of film maker, along with symbolism it's trying to project. War movies in particular have to be true to the bone (unless they're parodies) because they represent the bestiality of mankind, and duality of man. This film tried to portray those essential elements but fell into Hollywood blender and came out silly and unrealistic.<br/><br/>First and foremost, anybody who even remotely knows anything about Japanese tradition, military culture social and military codes and character of Japanese man, can only laugh at pitiful Colonel Saito who is not only without any remorselessness, but looks like a powerless teacher on the first day in a new school, being played like a flute by honorable Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness),who not only survives days, locked in a tin box in tropical heat and humidity, but wins every concession for his troops he can think of, making the poor Colonel Saito cry at the end of one of his parades of will?!? Japanese soldiers and camp commanders were ""very well known"" for their compassion, sensitivity and sensibility which was expressed many times during the war, especially in Wake Island massacre, Manila massacre and Bataan Death March, so even the hint of Colonel Nicholson's behavior would result in quick decapitation. William Holden with his tanned biceps glowing in the sun is a true picture of starved Japanese prisoner, and his escape, along with return through the jungle in 50's style loafers (observe the scene where he and his band of sturdy man are being washed by Burmese women prior to attacking the bridge), is down right preposterous. Building a bridge as a monument to his ego is possible way of expression for ""open only in a case of war"" type of character Col. Nicholson apparently is, but convincing other prisoners to join in that venture simply on ""let's show 'em"" premise, in those times and circumstances is not likely to happen. To complete the three-ring circus, Japanese soldiers show solidarity and play along, so at the end you're not sure what did you just see. The battle of wills, winner makes history film, anti-war film, or simply a Hollywood action movie/spectacle without any plausibility or logic? Judge for yourself.

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is about a culture clash of two different races going to war and how they view each other. It's also about a British colonel's concern for the morale of his men and observation of the rules of war that it blinds him to the situation he's in.<br/><br/>I like to compare The Bridge on the River Kwai with The Great Escape. Though the prisoners in the former are in a far worse predicament than those in that 'escape proof' stalag in the latter, note the differences in how they view their captivity. No one in The Great Escape ever forgets that they are at war and who the enemy. Their morale is kept very high with the diabolical escape plan they devise.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness who is a stickler for protocol reminds us that escape might not be justified under the rules because they were ordered to surrender. But as prisoners he will not be denied the rank and privileges of being an officer. So he gets the sweat box until the commandant, Sessue Hayakawa, gives in for his own reasons.<br/><br/>His reasons involve the building of a bridge on a railway the Japanese are constructing from Bangkok to Rangoon, part of their Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity scheme. Hayakawa reminds us that his code of honor is Bushido, the Samurai code which does not entertain surrender. The British to him are an inferior people for doing that and not fighting until the last man.<br/><br/>That's not going to sit well with Guinness who's going to show the Japanese who's inferior. He notes that the bridge being built is not sound structurally and he determines that to combat the idleness of the men and the bad effect on morale, he'll build a bridge that will show Hayakawa who's inferior. And Hayakawa loses control of his own bridge construction to the enemy and breaks down because of it.<br/><br/>The Bridge on the River Kwai as a film wouldn't work at all if it were not for Alec Guinness. He's clearly not kept his eye on the ball to use an American baseball term, forgotten that two countries are at war, that it's not a private spat between him and Hayakawa. Yet his concern for his men is genuine and he must have been a pretty good commander in a combat situation to retain the affection his men have for him. Executing the complexity of Colonel Nicholson won him the Academy Award and it carries the film.<br/><br/>Taking a different view of the perks of being an officer is William Holden. His role is not in the original novel by Pierre Boule, but was created to justify a big American box office name for the USA market. But it was a good thing because Holden as an American does bring a different perspective to the events. <br/><br/>Holden having won his Oscar in Stalag 17 as a prisoner of war brings his former role of Sefton to this film. That's not as flip as it sounds because Sefton in Stalag 17 did remark about escaping and then being sent to the Pacific and getting captured and doing time in a Japanese prison. Of course he'd have had to have changed branches of the service. And we never do learn Holden's real name.<br/><br/>Seems as though when his ship went down, Holden the survivor exchanges uniform and dog tags with a Navy commander named Shears. It doesn't get him quite the perks he thought he'd get, but he's resourceful enough.<br/><br/>It took me several viewings of The Bridge on the River Kwai to figure out why Holden didn't go back to his real name and rank after he escaped and after he arrived in the British hospital in Sri Lanka. It's the reason why Ann Sears has a small, but critical role as the WREN that Holden enjoys a little romantic idyll with. She might not have given him the time of day if he was a seaman first class instead of a Lieutenant Commander. <br/><br/>But the British get on to Holden's charade and Jack Hawkins blackjacks him into going on a mission to destroy the bridge that British Intelligence has found out the Japanese are building. If Guinness has forgotten what side he's on, Hawkins sure hasn't. Jack Hawkins's role tends to get overshadowed by Guinness and he never gets the credit due him for this film, but he does well as the determined man on a mission.<br/><br/>One other part worthy mentioning is James Donald as the medical officer of Guinness's battalion. He has great affection for Guinness, but apparently he's the only one in the POW camp that sees the implication of what the British prisoners are being ordered to do by their commander and also who'll tell Guinness ever so gently.<br/><br/>And Donald puts the final coda on The Bridge on the River Kwai with his words that end this great film achievement."

","In the luxurious jungle of Thailand , British prisoners (Alec Guinnes, James Donald , Percy Herbert , among others) of WWII captured in the fall of Singapur are taken by Japanese wards for building a railway bridge on the trail since Bangcock until Rangún . With extraordinary appearance when the prisoners arrive in the POW war camp whistle the title song,the Colonel Bogey March . Central plot is the troublesome relationship between the obstinate Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinnes) and a cruel ruler , Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and parallel efforts by escaped convict (William Holden) , officer (Jack Hawkins) and soldier (Geoffrey Horne) to destroy it.<br/><br/>This excellent film , winner of numerous Oscars was magnificently directed by David Lean . However , first was slated Alexander Korda , but he withdrew due he deemed wrong the main roles . Also was originally considered Howard Hawks , but he abandoned , especially concern was the all male lead characters and because his previous film, Land of the pharaohs, failed at the Box office . Gary Grant was firstly hired , but declined due to other offers and was substituted by William Holden . Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson were uncredited , but were blacklisted as suspect communists and only appears credited Pierre Boulle who won Academy Award for best adapted script , though he didn't know English language . In 1984 when the movie was restored , they retrospectively won the prize , but sadly they had dead, however their names were justly added to writing credits . The famous march whistle by prisoners , is original from 1916 titled ¨Bollocks and the same for you¨ by Mayor Ricketts , a chief of musical band and the actual words were obscene , later being re-titled Colonel Bogey March . Deservedly won the Oscar for best musical score by Malcolm Arnold . The authentic bridge was built by prisoners in two months and constructed for film was four months with help elephants and by hundred workers and length 425 feet long and 50 foot above the water , in Ceylon location . But was demolished in a matter of seconds , as it is splendidly reflected in the movie."

","Rightly BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is considered a classic of cinema , it`s well made , well directed and most of all well acted by the cast , but this doesn`t stop a major problem with the script from nearly wrecking the whole film and it`s this : The imperial Japanese committed the worst crimes against humanity in the whole 20th century . Of course they weren`t alone Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot et al murdered millions upon millions of innocents and for that their can be no excuse , they have the blood of countless people on their hands , but these unreasonable murders were committed for the reason of utopian idealogy . Imperial Japanese barbarity had little if any idealogy behind it . Defeated armies and civilian prisoners were treated as cowardly "" Untermenschen "" to be treated with the utmost inhuman contempt and without mercy . As many as ten million Chinese died at the hands of the Japanese and millions of more Asians died across Asia during the Nipponese occupation . And it`s this rewriting of history in order to bring about a dramatic story that comes close to destroying the film . Nicholson stands up to his captors and refuses to be broken by them . Very dramatic ( Helped no end by Sir Alec`s performance . Perhaps the greatest actor of all time ) but in reality Nicholson would have been tied to a stake and left to starve to death . In fact Nicholson wouldn`t have had to show any defiance it was very common for Japanese guards to use prisoners for live bayonet practice just for the sheer hell of it . I take it because it was made  during the cold war that Hollywood tried to rehabilitate both Germany and Japan by showing them in a less cruel light , but whatever the reason it is rather annoying to see prisoners holding concert parties in a Japanese POW camp . So treat this film as a drama not as a history lesson . For the record the real bridge was bombed by the American airforce"

","A struggle for morale, camaraderie and general human compassion in the dregs of a harsh, tropical POW camp during World War II. The cruel conditions and flagrant disregard for prisoners' rights cause conflict between the guards and a new troupe of British captives, but the pride and determination of leadership in the face of such adversity gradually earns the men a measure of due respect. Alec Guinness won an Oscar for his portrayal of said leader, a determined military man who takes no quarter despite terrible punishment and still harbors the notion of brotherhood with his captors.<br/><br/>Therein lies the moral conflict, as Guinness and his men develop a strained kinship with the Japanese officers while an escaped American works in secrecy to undermine the entire operation. Tricky waters to navigate, since we feel a mix of enthusiasm and reluctance for both perspectives. Everyone has a distinct, relatable motivation - even the seemingly-merciless captors - which makes this something much more than your usual yay-rah, blow 'em up wartime picture. An astonishingly even-handed take on a racially charged historical conflict that was still very fresh in national hearts and minds at the time of its release."

","This week I watched the adventure-war-drama The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). The logline reads ""After settling his differences with a Japanese P.O.W. camp commander, a British Colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors, while oblivious to a plan by the Allies to destroy it."" Although I thought this was an interesting story, I can see the heavy sense of American Nationalism that bled through due to the era it was created in. I think that one of the best technical aspects of this film had to be the sound design. Aside from the technical aspects, the acting was really spectacular. Naturally Alec Guinness really did his part in the lead role of Colonel Nicholson. However, I think that Sessue Hayakawa is severely overlooked. He did a standout job as Colonel Saito. The film did seem to drag on in parts, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again."

","If you watch The Bridge on the River Kwai and find yourself simultaneously admiring the spirit, the cheer, and the competence of the English, and finding it strangely insufferable, you are meant to do just that -- because this is a movie ultimately about the strange contradictions in the human heart. Alec Guinness is beyond superb, and I choose the word ""beyond"" advisedly: You cheer for him as he outlasts the hapless Japanese commandant, and yet it is all for what to the Japanese must seem a frivolous rule, a distinction between officers and men that should not have any purchase upon ragged soldiers in such a sweltering malarial hole as the valley of the Kwai. And the bridge, which is meant to transport Japanese supplies in occupied southeast Asia, the bridge, quite an impressive little feat of engineering, is built. Why? What is it for?<br/><br/>All the principals in the film are at their peak: Guinness, the overmatched but deeply human commandant (Sessue Hayakawa, who won an Oscar for his role and deserved every gilded ounce of it), William Holden as the cynical American who detests Guinness more than he does Hayakawa, Jack Hawkins as an English don with a taste for explosives, and the young Gregory Horne as the all-in English schoolboy; and that's not to mention the beautiful and haunting-eyed Burmese women who lead Hawkins, Holden, and Horne through the jungle back to the Kwai.<br/><br/>I'm an admirer of David Lean's films. This one has all the broad grandeur of Lawrence of Arabia, without the latter's occasional lunge into the baroque. <br/><br/>""My God, what have I done?"" Mr. Lean, what you have done is create a nearly flawless movie about some of the most important existential questions in human life."

","I've read through the reviews here hoping to see someone mention what it is about this movie that is supposed to be good.<br/><br/>My wife and I have been working our way through the IMDb Top 100 list. Even movies we didn't particularly enjoy watching (Raging Bull, I'm looking at you) we could still finish and realize why it is considered a good movie.<br/><br/>But this one? The soundtrack is horrible, almost Disney-esquire. The corny trumpet music whenever someone just steps out of the jungle or is entering a room, it was terribly distracting for this viewer.<br/><br/>The cinematography? As mentioned elsewhere if you are going to shot a ""night"" scene with just a blue filter on the camera, at LEAST try to not show the sun in the sky or reflecting from water, eh? That's not a big deal, that's just a matter of directorial competence. In general the camera work was uninspired, but in some cases it was actually bad.<br/><br/>The dialogue? There were parts that were so contrived and forced that it made me cringe. It bordered, indeed crossed, the line of ""campy"" at times.<br/><br/>The story itself? Cheesy and predictable. I had hoped maybe for a heroic end for the Guiness character, maybe standing on his bridge distracting the Japanese commander long enough for the commandos to do their work? Something? But no, we got the most trite and predictable of all endings.<br/><br/>Holden's character? Easily the worst parts of the movie. British commando's have native bearers for their gear? And these native bearers are all pretty young Philipino girls? Who spend their time soaping and bathing the American soldier in photogenic waterfalls while on their ""commando"" mission? Damned ridiculous, almost expected Elvis to step out with a guitar and start a sing-along.<br/><br/>Guiness's portrayal was very well done. I'll give it that. He did the role well. I can't say the acting by any other member of the cast was worth praising though, truly.<br/><br/>I had hoped to find out what was good by reading reviews here. But instead there are a bunch of hollow praises followed by summaries of the plot. Those who didn't like the movie dislike it on historical inaccuracy grounds, but that isn't even it for me.<br/><br/>I do not understand what was good about this movie."

","I first saw this film several months ago.  I was stunned by what I saw. How is it that such an awful movie came to be known as a classic?  What disgusted me most about it was the portrayal of the arrogant British officer (played by Alec Guiness) as an admirable and principled hero.  What makes him arrogant?  Trying to use laws to exclude him from working with the ""grunts"".  What made this even more ridiculous was that the soldiers still obeyed and respected him after his little protest.<br/><br/>Another problem was the portrayal of the camp itself.  The film sugar coats the real-life consequences POW's face for insubordination (there was not a single beating or execution in the entire film).  I don't say this because I'm bloodthirsty, I say it because the lack of such violence trivializes the horrors of war.<br/><br/>So in summing up, I watched Bridge On the River Kwai expecting something worthy of being called a classic.  What I got was a nearly farcical take on the war genre.  Excellent performances (who plays a pompous englishman better than Guiness?) could not save this movie from its unintentional silliness."

Holden's portrayal was ridiculous- surely inspired by the films financiers who wanted to portray Americans as inexplicably 'cooler' and more easy-going than others. What possible other reason could there be for him receiving top billing over the great Alec Guinness (who's performance as the flawed Nicholson was one of the best performances in cinematic history)."

He talked to me (with some persuasion needed, and not a little difficulty on his part) about his experiences, and I've also had the opportunity (and the honour) of talking to other men who had undergone a similar fate. I also met up with POWs of the Japanese who worked on, not just the bridge, but the actual railway, and some on different projects entirely. They all said the same things about this movie. It was an utter travesty, and a diabolical insult not only to the men that died, but also the survivors. And I have to agree with them.<br/><br/>Those people who think this film is a true reflection of what really went on, should seriously consider a brain scan, and/or maybe several visits to a psychiatrist, or three. They could however begin their return to the real world by watching the ""History Channel"" on digital TV, and start learning the true facts.<br/><br/>I don't intend to list everything that is wrong in (and about) this totally inaccurate movie, I would be writing all day, and probably get steamed up in the process.

I couldn't do anything but see the film for what it really was. Absolute hogwash from start to finish. And to think that at the time of it's release, David Lean (and others) made a hell of a lot of cash out of it, whilst the true heroes of the ""bridge"" and the ""railway of death"" still had to live with the hell... and got damn all.

","When this film appeared, in 1957, it naturally garnered many an award and much personal acclaim for director David Lean. The story itself, originally written by none other than noted French writer Pierre Boulle, who wrote the book, Planet of the Apes, was pleased with the finished project. The story is very loosely based on the actual construction endeavor, called building the Kwai bridge, is herein incorporated to include the British prisoner of war camp, run by the Japanese during World War Two. A culturally traditional, hard-nose commandant, one Col. Saito (internationally acclaimed Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa) has been given the task of constructing a railroad bridge over the river Kwai and is further ordered to have it completed by a given date. Failure is not an option. To his camp arrives an equally stubborn and somewhat arrogant British officer, one Col. Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) with several hundred POW soldiers. Already in the camp is a small detachment of American and allied soldiers who have been assailed and threatened to build the bridge. Among them is, Commander Shears (William Holden) an American POW who manages to escape the hell hole and makes it safely to a British base. Though Saito and Nicholson begin a battle of wits as to who is in command of the camp and its men, Shears is confronted by another British officer, Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkings) who asks him to return to the site of the bridge, to help him blow it up! James Donald plays Maj. Clipton, a British medical officer who watches as the various conflicting officers strive to give logic to insane goals. Every audience who views this movie, has to decided for themselves who among the officers, makes any sense to a mad-cap project. The film should be a testament to the insanity of every war. ****"
"adrian-43767","10","3","4","31 March 2018"," Anti-war masterpiece
","In my humble opinion, this is Director David Lean's finest film (just above BRIEF ENCOUNTER, OLIVER TWIST and GREAT EXPECTATIONS) and, albeit less famous, spectacular and beautiful than LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, it is a more self-contained and perceptive film, in regard to human emotions and pitfalls.<br/><br/>Frankly, I do not give a toss whether this film is historically inaccurate. It does not claim to be true to life, and there is a great lesson to learn from it, notably that following principles to a T does not pre-empt the emergence of contradictory situations, such as when Colonel Nicholson (sublimely played by Alec Guinness), who had refused on principle to have his officers work 'like coolies,' ultimately is quite ready to relent on that demand when he becomes entranced by the notion that the bridge could last 600 years, and the British Army remembered for its construction.<br/><br/>Guinness deservedly picked up the Best Actor academy award for his role as Col. Nicholson, who stubbornly wants to maintain conventional and civilized values in the jungle and in the face of an enemy of a different and opposing culture, embodied by the Japanese camp commander, brilliantly played by Sessue Hayakawa.<br/><br/>Holden acts as a kind of comic relief, an American caught in the middle of British POWs in Burma, and his role is reminiscent of the one which won him an Oscar in STALAG 17, where he acted as the in-between fellow who managed to bribe the guards and get the goodies, but who has enough decency in him to earn the viewer's sympathy.<br/><br/>Jack Hawkins is superlative as the British commander who leads the operation to destroy the bridge on the River Kwai. Why he did not pick up a best supporting actor Oscar beats me. He is the very embodiment of the stiff upper lip British officer with touches of sardonic humor and complete professionalism.<br/><br/>And, finally, James Donald, as the medic with the bird's eye view (an eagle is seen flying over the forest some 3 or 4 times during the film), who sees all with detachment and concludes that war is madness. His is a minor but crucial role, and he delivers with great aplomb.<br/><br/>Photography, action sequences, script, and soundtrack are all of the highest quality. THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites and perhaps the greatest anti-war war movie ever made. 10/10"
"atlasmb","10","3","4","5 March 2016"," A Classic Story and Brilliant Acting
","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is, as others have said, an anti-war film. It concerns the struggle between a British officer, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), who is confined with his men in a Japanese POW camp, and the Japanese commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who has orders to finish a section of railroad using prisoner labor.<br/><br/>The conditions in the camp are brutal. The tropical sun makes for punishing working conditions, especially for men whose health has been compromised by injuries, punishment and jungle diseases. Despite the hardships, Nicholson is dedicated to proving the superiority of the British will. He is an admirable figure, but he has one fatal flaw.<br/><br/>The other major character is Shears, an American naval officer whose knack for self-preservation helped him survive Saito and the sun before Nicholson's men ever marched into the prison camp. Shears is a cynic who is dedicated not to military rules and regulations but to his own welfare. He views Saito and Nicholson from the sidelines. Like Puck, he seems to say ""Lord what fools these mortals be.""<br/><br/>Shears is the most complex character in the film. He makes decisions that might appear contrary to his basic nature. As such, the role of Shears can be viewed as a companion to William Holden's performance as Sefton in ""Stalag 17"". Sefton is a prisoner in a German POW camp. Like Shears, he is cynical and pragmatic. <br/><br/>Viewers might find elements of heroism in the behaviors of Nicholson, Shears or Saito, depending upon their points of view. Regardless, the story of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""--from the novel by Pierre Boulle-- is fascinating. David Lean's direction pays attention to so many details, creating a vivid world that envelopes the characters and makes the jungle a significant character itself. His framing of the final scenes (and some brilliant editing) create an ending filled with suspense and blinding insight."

So many things going on as Colonel Nicholson and Saito contemplate the completion of the bridge and what may lie ahead for both of them, while the commando group of Warden, Shears and Joyce have realized that the explosives they have set to blow up the bridge are likely to be discovered as the river depth has receded. Which will require them to set off the charges by hand, hopefully to as blow up as Japenese troop train as it crosses the bridge. It's a scene that lasts for about .15 suspenseful minutes Bill Holden becomes a reluctant hero and Alec Guinness realizes his obsession with building the bridge for the Japanese army is indeed treasonous. <br/><br/>""MADNESS"""
"antagonist117","10","3","4","22 January 2015"," ""Kwai"" is a thing that hardly exists anymore: a big-budget war film that is observational and cerebral, not triumphalist
","""Bridge on the River Kwai"" is two big movies in one, and they're both fantastic. Both tell fantastic tales of duty and self-sacrifice through big personalities brought to life by incomparable actors. But there are no idealized heroes here; everyone is as much wrong as they are right, and they are as motivated by pride and stubbornness as much as principles. While a power-tripping General Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) tests Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness)'s commitment to the international rules of war, a crack saboteur (Jack Hawkins) dragoons a deserter (William Holden) into doing a soldier's duty. These stories are ingeniously structured and interwoven so that all threads come to unexpected and compromised conclusions. A character may appear to win his battle, but if so, we may be certain that he will lose his war, and vice versa. Nicholson manfully (as the British might say) makes his point about the treatment of prisoners, and it is stirring to see him submit to severe mistreatment for the sake of an idea. But his real objective is not to uphold the rule of law, but to wound the pride of his foe, Saito, and to establish himself as the most influential— albeit imprisoned—figure in the camp. Once done, he zealously carries out the task Saito always intended for him, and in the fullness of his pride he does it better than he otherwise might have. Meanwhile, the would-be deserter Shears escapes from the prison camp and nearly escapes from the army as well, but the saboteur Warden traps him with the rule book. Nicholson and Shears are each prisoners, and each is used as a means to an end, but their arcs are also inversions of one another. Nicholson faces down his captor, but the determination that brought him that victory is also what leads him to undermine the army he loves. Shears submits to Warden and to the inescapable logic of the army he longs to leave, but in the end his personal sacrifice is a net gain for the cause. Lest the army come out smelling like a rose, victorious and free of compromise, Hawkins plays Warden as a cold man who in a second would sacrifice not only the charming audience surrogate Shears, but a group of female Thai porters as well. His Pyrrhic destruction of Nicholson's magnificent if misguided bridge is the occasion of the film's final word: ""Madness!"" There is a great deal of madness on display, but it is conveyed through wide-awake plotting and characterization.<br/><br/>David Lean's direction and Jack Hildyard's cinematography convey sweltering heat: the heat of the jungle, of Saito's tent and Nicholson's box, of Shears's beach and Warden's bungalow. But there is also a conscious distance separating audience from action. Whether framing a huge, explosive set piece with dozens of extras or a tense huddle over a table, the cameras are detached observers rather than participants. We see the big picture and think about why people act the way they do in their particular settings. We know them better than they know themselves, and understand each truth before it dawns on them. ""Kwai,"" then, is a thing that hardly exists now: a big-budget war film that is observational and cerebral, not just gritty and melodramatic. Nor is it a simple matter of good versus evil. Though not at all a complicated movie to follow, its moral complexity is such that British audiences (and even some of the British actors) could feel it was anti-British, while Japanese audiences found it anti-Japanese. The movie is critical of all blind zealotry, and no wonder: screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson had to go uncredited as a result of a Hollywood blacklist. Despite being an an uncomfortable watch for partisans and flag-wavers of all stripes, ""Kwai"" was a huge hit with audiences and critics, winning the 1958 box office and heaps of awards. Not everything has held up in the nearly 60 years since. The day-for-night shots, standard at the time, are particularly unconvincing. But the challenging messages and the flawed characters still hit hard and loom large, and the dramatic finale remains one of the great benchmarks of cinema."

","British officer goes daft in a sweat box, builds a bridge, and finally falls down on the job.<br/><br/>A masterpiece, but a difficult movie. The point of the movie is the tangled nature of duty, ethics and morality, but it always seemed to me that they get even more tangled up than the movie intended. Just what is good and evil, at the end? I'm darned if I know. The movie seems to indicate self-discoveries by both the British and Japanese commanding officers, and yet the end of the movie makes a hollow mockery of those discoveries, and pretty much everything else beyond killing and destruction. Even the final destruction of the bridge is mere accident. It's just about the bleakest picture painted by any movie.<br/><br/>I always found the soundtrack a bit overblown, to tell the truth, and a little distracting. Especially during the hike of the demo team to the bridge. The obligatory love interest is tacked-on and never feels like anything more than the obligatory love interest.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie is engrossing, the performances are riveting, the scenes are awe-inspiring, and the ending is shattering. If, as I said before, difficult. At 161 minutes, this is a very long movie, and I am very rarely willing to grant that any movie should be longer than about 100 minutes. In this case, every one of those 161 minutes are worthwhile. (OK maybe a few minutes could have been trimmed from the hike, and the lovey-dovey stuff.) It's a shame we'll never see the likes of Guinness again. (I say that not because a Guinness could never be born again, but because I can't believe we'll ever see movies that can provide these kinds of roles again.) His performance when he emerges from the sweat box and marches to the commanding Japanese officer's hut is alone enough to put him into the highest rank of acting. Sessue Hayakawa was also brilliant but overshadowed. Holden was good but frankly he looked a bit hackneyed when considered against the rest of the cast.

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie that is often very entertaining, but it sets itself apart from other war movies. Unlike those other movies, this particular film is a provocative film that asks complex questions, but doesn't answer them easily. It is all up to the audience to believe what happened and why it happened. Of course, everyone may have different opinions and the movie seems to ask for that. Usually in war movies, they are concerned about the bigger picture such as who wins or who loses, which is all very fair questions. But the reason this film works more than most war films is because it poses questions that are deeper than the winner or loser. The movie talks about individualism. It's not all about who wins or loses the war, but who is in that war and how does war affect the individual.<br/><br/>This film takes place in 1943, at a Japanese POW camp during the middle of World War Two. The Japanese have captured British soldiers, led by Colonel Nicholson. Nicholson and his soldiers are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate a railway. Nicholson convinces his soldiers to build the bridge for British morality and to show the Japanese what they stand for. But over time, Nicholson develops an obsessive disorder with completing the bridge, which is being seen as collaborating with the enemy. Unknowingly to Nicholson or Saito, there is a plot to destroy the bridge. An American named Shears, a former POW who escaped the camp, is part of the team that is tasked with blowing up the bridge.<br/><br/>If you put the movie on about three-quarters into it, you would be forgiven if you thought Saito and Nicholson were allies. But the a good portion of the beginning of the film, it was quite the opposite. The film opens with Nicholson and his troops being led into the camp and being introduced to Saito. It became clear right away that each man's morale opposed each other. It also became clear that Nicholson possessed a brave spirit. He endured torture for the sake of his beliefs, and he risked the chance of being killed. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Nicholson took out a copy of the Geneva Convention out of his pocket (to prove to Saito that officers don't have to work on the bridge) and gave it to Saito, in which Saito used it to slap Nicholson across the face drawing blood. Then, he was dragged to ""The Oven,"" a hut that stands in the fierce sun. But once Nicholson was released, that is when the two men began to work together, drawing up some interesting questions.<br/><br/>My favorite sections of the movie was when Nicholson, played wonderfully by Alec Guinness was on screen. However, the other half of the film is based on the plot trying to destroy the bridge. Shears was a former POW, but as an escapee and at a local hospital imitating an officer, he is coerced into the plot so his imitation as an officer wont become public. I liked the slow, grueling pace of these scenes, attempting to reach the bridge because it shows what it would be like in reality. It certainly was no picnic. It's not nearly as convincing as the scenes in the jungle, but it's good enough.<br/><br/>This film was the film that gave Alec Guinness his Oscar. He gave such an intense performance as the colonel who slowly begins a moral descent, perhaps the only thing that kept him alive. Guinness deserved his Oscar for his powerful performance. William Holden does an expert job in playing a typical American, Shears. He likes the booze and the women, but also is compelled by adventure even if the outcome seems a little murky. I also liked the performance of Sessue Hayakawa, as the strict Japanese commandant. He was actually one of the first Asian stars in Hollywood, from the era of silent film. So it was nice for the film to harken back to its beginning. Finally, the movie boasts excellent supporting turns by Jack Hawkins, as the leader of the crew headed to destroy the bridge and James Donald, the doctor of the camp and the man who questions the sanity of Colonel Nicholson. His expression on his face in the scene where Nicholson recruits sick and injured soldiers to help with the bridge was yet another powerful moment in the film.<br/><br/>The film is directed by David Lean, who excels at directing these kind of big, explosive films. Lean is famously hard to work with. It is on record that Guinness and Lean did not like each other during filming, but somehow Guinness was still able to deliver a powerhouse performance. Despite his personality, Lean is experienced in such films. He delivered a film that is entertaining, but still was able to put important themes and messages in the movie such as what it takes to stay alive under times of duress (such as this war).<br/><br/>Overall, The Bridge on the River Kwai is an incredibly powerful, expertly-made war film that shows how war can make people mad. From start to finish, I was glued to the movie taking in all the excellent performances and a excellent story thanks to the Oscar-winning screenplay by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson. One note to mention is this film is not based on historical truth. It's a fictional story, despite a similar event that actually happened. The only thing that is real is the harsh treatment of the soldiers in the POW camp. Everything about the film: the acting, directing, cinematography, score, and story just screams perfection. This is one of my all-time favorite war movies.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"Desertman84","10","4","6","7 March 2012"," A War Film About Individuals
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British World War II film by David Lean based on The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942–43 for its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa. The film was shot in Sri Lanka (credited as Ceylon, as it was known at the time). The bridge in the movie was located near Kitulgala.<br/><br/>The Bridge on the River Kwai opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma in 1943, where a battle of wills rages between camp commander Colonel Saito and newly arrived British colonel Nicholson. Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various ""persuasive"" devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears, having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. <br/><br/>Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals for it speaks of the code of honor amongst men during war, the respect shared by enemies of war, and the madness which war evokes.In short,this complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean."

","I heard a film critic once say that there really aren't ""war movies""; there are only ""anti-war"" movies. I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right. -Kwai-, I believe, is both a ""war"" and ""anti-war"" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.<br/><br/>There is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy. David Lean's direction is tight and evocative. The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen). The acting is top-notch. I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable. William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.<br/><br/>The musical score is also right on. Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.<br/><br/>Clearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film. There is no glorification here. War is brutal, period. It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles. Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly. Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity. One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them. The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film. War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.<br/><br/>So, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie? I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Regardless, -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none."

","""We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency that will put them to shame! We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing!"" - Colonel Nicholson <br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" stars Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson, a British officer who has been captured by the Japanese Army and placed in a prison camp somewhere in western Thailand. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito, orders Nicholson and his men to build a bridge across the river Kwai (in order for a rail-link connecting Bangkok and Burma to be completed) but Nicholson refuses.<br/><br/>What follows is a battle of wills. The Japanese camp commander seeks to break Nicholson, turning him into a slave labourer. Nicholson, however, remains steadfast in his pride and dignity. A caricature of stiff-upper-lipped Brits, he's proud of the Empire, proud of British engineering, dutiful, cultured, and a stickler for rules, regulations and the Geneva Convention. If he is to be made a slave, then by God, he will do it with dignity! He will do it on his own terms! <br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" was, of course, directed by David Lean, that master of location photography and beautiful compositions. In our CGI age, its refreshing to see a director who went to such extreme lengths to find great scenery. Lean, from this point onwards, would paint on an increasingly grand canvas.<br/><br/>Though ""Bridge"" works on an archetypal level, there are some nagging problems. Following WW2, the British and Americans suddenly needed to portray the Japanese as ""our allies"". After years of portraying them as screaming savages, Japan was now our new ""friend"" in the ""war against communism"". They were needed as a bulwark to prevent the Russians from moving further southward and so efforts were made to paint them in a more ""friendly"" manner. As a result, all Asians in ""Bridge"" are portrayed in a ridiculously cartoonish light. They are all teary base commanders, resourceful peasants or big breasted sexy women who fall head over heels for American boys. The film's titular bridge itself eventually becomes a hokey symbol for uneasy cultures working together to bridge their differences because, ""someday, after this war, what we build here might help somebody."" <br/><br/>Compare this to ""Hei Tai Yang 731"", a Chinese film which documented the atrocities that the Japense army regiment of Camp 731 carried out on innocent Chinese and Russian families. Of course that film is merely propaganda from another perspective, but in its extremities it nevertheless highlights how absurd ""Bridge's"" portrayals of camp life are; Lean's prison camps are far too homey.<br/><br/>Strange too is Nicholson's comment that he ""refuses to work like a coolie"". ""Coolie"" is a derogatory slang term used to describe Asian and Indian slaves or indentured workers. Today the term is still used in some Caribbean islands to describe West Indians brought over during the slave trade. The irony that Nicholson is condemning the Japanese for using the very same practises used by the British Empire is completely lost on Lean. Nicholson isn't a hero for ""retaining his humanity"" and ""refusing to work like a coolie"", he's a hypocrite.<br/><br/>But still, the film works on a primal level. Why does everyone love a good prison break movie (""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Shawshank"", ""Papillon"", ""Birdman of Alcatraz"", ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Great Escape"" etc"")? Probably because they're all thinly disguised existential tales centring on captured heroes who must break free, emancipating themselves from some phantom Order. Having escaped the constrictions of this immoral system, they achieve a kind of Nietzschean freedom or spiritual transcendence. It's all quite silly, but hits people on an archetypal, almost primal level.<br/><br/>What's unique about ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai"" is that there is no ""literal"" freedom. Nicholson and his men don't escape the constrictions of the camp, rather, they change the camp to adhere to their own standards, their own ""British"" way of life.<br/><br/>At the end of ""Bridge"", Nicholson and Saito stand on their bridge, and Nicholson remarks ""isn't this beautiful?"" Saito nods, the duo sharing their only moment of agreement, though Lean subtly implies that Saito is really referring to the rising sun in the distance. One man sees beauty in British engineering, pride, duty, strength and solidarity, whilst the other quite literally sees beauty in the ""rising sun"" of the Japanese Empire. With the bridge blowing up at the end of the film and Saito eventually dying, the film ends on what Lean has insisted is an ""anti-war note"", suggesting that it is the ""madness of war"" that keeps cultures apart. For Brit audiences, though, the film tends to fan the passions of patriotism.<br/><br/>8/10 – An attempt to rewrite history, yes, but the film is nevertheless iconic, its characters have gravity and Lean in many ways invented huge chunks of cinematic grammar. We take his influence for granted now, but there are numerous little shots, compositions and trends in this film that Lean is responsible for starting. Worth two viewings."

","Before director David Lean (Oscar-winning) made ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1962, he created arguably the best film of the 1950s with ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". The film is an intense World War II epic about a group of British POWs (led by Oscar-winner Alec Guinness) who are forced by the Japanese Military (led by Oscar-nominee Sessue Hayakawa) to build a railway bridge to assist the Axis Powers. Naturally Guinness, by the book all the way, tries to get out of the job by debating and using British wit. All that falls on deaf ears though as the bridge will be made. Guinness then decides to show that England is the greatest country on Earth by building the finest bridge possible. As all this goes on, American William Holden has been assigned to lead a group of troops into the jungle and destroy the bridge before it can transport supplies and troops for the enemy. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is an excellent film that shows the best of the 1950s. The 1950s were great cinematically because of large budgets and amazing spectacles. This film has that but is better than most other productions of the period due to top-notch writing, directing and out-of-this-world performances. Alec Guinness (best known for ""Star Wars"") had his greatest performance here. His character unwittingly becomes a willing ally to the enemy and starts to develop a subtle type of war fatigue that will directly affect all the other key players within the film's vast landscape. Outstanding and definitely memorable, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is one of the finest films ever produced. 5 stars out of 5."

","One of my Top Ten films.  This film was remarkable in 1957 because it followed a long line of ""war movies"" after World War 2 which glorified war and the soldiers who fought.  This film displays the absurdity of war, and the corresponding absurdities of humanity, and toys with the notion that the two are firmly linked.  Many may compare it to the more recent Saving Private Ryan, but the two films have completely different lessons.  Bridge is about the absurdity of war and the irrationality of those who fight, whereas Ryan is about the way in which brave men deal with the horrors of war, and the debt owed by all of us for their sacrifice.<br/><br/>This film shares many of the same undercurrents as another one of my personal Top Ten motion pictures,  Planet of the Apes (1968).  I was surprised to recently learn that both films are based on novels by the same French writer, Pierre Boulle.  The screenplay for Planet of the Apes was written by Rod Serling (TV's Twilight Zone) and bears his unique style. If you have not seen either of these films, and like films that make you think, watch Bridge first, then Planet, and note the similarities."

","Even though a lot of people complain about the inaccuracy of the film's portrait of POW's conditions in Asia during WWII, this is not really what I dislike about this movie. Explaining the first part of my comment, I think that we all have to bear in mind that movie making is a form of art, and as so, does not have to be a letter-perfect rendition of reality. Some literary licenses are not only allowed but expected. That said, my real problem comes from the adaptation of the book. Even if the scriptwriter won an Academy Award, the ending in the book is a lot more emotional. Probably it clashes with Hollywood's idea of happy endings, probably it was changed to show the actual destruction of the bridge instead of Coronel Nicholson's discovery of the charges and his subsequent successful stopping of the sabotage. I would have loved to see the real ending on the silver screen (or rather on TV since I was born more than 10 years after the film's release), but the adaptation was not totally faithful."
"Quinoa1984","10","5","9","27 January 2007"," one of the quintessential POW/WW2 movies, with unforgettable characterizations
","What does it mean to be a solider versus a prisoner? How about the meaning of a Colonel's duty, pride, and everything in a male-centric view in times of war? And really, what everything seems to come down to- in the case of The Bridge on the River Kwai- is that priorities end up being eschewed with moral ambiguity and heroism in the oddest circumstances. David's Lean's masterpiece takes a compelling look at men who wont give in, and when they do they somehow lose a piece of themselves in the process- a big part really depending on point of view &/or country- and how being ultra-tough and stubborn and headstrong may get you killed for the wrong reasons. Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guiness in a very well deserved Oscar winning turn) and Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, who is actually a really great actor as well) both don't want to give in when Nicholson arrives at Saito's camp, and refuses adamantly to work alongside the fellow soldiers on the bridge- he sees it's against the Geneva conventions, and makes it a point of principle not to do it. He's put away for a while, but then finally Saito can't take the stubbornness any more- as he knows he's been evenly matched perhaps- and has no choice (ala seppuku if not achieved) but to let him direct the building of the bridge. But what this turns into for Nicholson, as a further elongation of the principle of the matter for his men and the situation, into a really mad situation.<br/><br/>So in this there is also the other main section of the story, where the idea of what it is to have principles starts to pick up via 'Major' Shears (William Holden, the conventional 'star' who grows more interesting in the second half). He's not really a major, but he's done in a quasi-cowardly quasi-pragmatic move to take a major's place when taken prisoner in the camp. When he achieves escape, however, he's caught between a rock and a hard place when he has to go with Major Warden (also a headstrong, 'war is a game' character played by Jack Hawkins), otherwise he'll be dishonorably discharged as an impersonator, already with a criminal record. There's a pivotal scene when he and Warden are on their way to the bridge, which undercuts the whole bond between Nicholson and Saito, when Warden wants to be left for dead after injuring his foot. Does it make more sense to hold one's own sense of duty to a mission, or to one's self, or not? What becomes Shears's gain- a sense of obligation as opposed to being a 'have no choice' scenario- becomes Nicholson's loss. The bridge to Nicholson becomes something abstracted from what is really going on, and his original ideal of not giving in to being a prisoner becomes muddled, leading up to that incredibly tense, maddening climax where his final words punctuate it all: ""what have I done?"" <br/><br/>But it's not all completely a serious endeavor, and what's so brilliant about Lean's approach to Boulle's material is that it's also a grand old entertainment, where the characters are rich and fully engrossing (albeit with Shears's/Holden given an obligatory ""I'm the star"" scene with a blond on a beach that seems from a different movie), and with a scope and direction that is just as ambitious in its own right as Lawrence of Arabia. Lean occasionally lets some visual metaphors in that do work very well (the huge flock of birds flying around, and the bridge itself being a metaphor in itself of colonial interests). But for the most part he lets the atmosphere of a war-time adventure work by itself, with the cinematography and editing sometimes working in ultra-suspenseful ways (particularly with the setting up of the wires around the bridge, and 'go time'), and in a traditional way of solid storytelling. He lets the themes work through the characters, which gives the actors a lot more to work with than with pushing it down the viewer's throat. There's a sense that the boundaries of the typical POW/war movie, particularly from a British viewpoint, are stretched and expanded, questioning the means of the main characters while still showing them, in spurts, to have great merit.<br/><br/>And if for nothing else, the acting's really what stands out, especially in the subtle notes and turns that seem over-the-top like with Hayakawa but are really nuanced too (he, especially, has a crux to deal with in suddenly losing his own sense of duty to country as a Brit takes over his job essentially). Guiness, meanwhile, gives something extraordinary in practically every scene, when he's either reserved or having to finally break down and show emotion (it's not the first bridge he's over-seen, hence the extra amount of pride that it'll be a ""British-built"" bridge). As Shears notes, there's something dangerous to a man like Nicholson who wont give in, and Guiness undercuts this dangerous quality with the elegance that he's perfect at, and then lets it become full-circle when he meets his all-too-ironic end. Holden, by the way, is also quite good here, if sort of given the almost thankless role of the star who's typically cocky, and only when finally on the mission is there some opening up in relation to Hawkins's Warden; his speech to Warden is especially engrossing.<br/><br/>Featuring the catchiest of all whistling in the movies, and a dynamite cast and graceful and distinctively superlative directorial vision, this is one of those rare films about war where character takes precedence over action (compared to the common war movies of the period, it's only sporadic and more suggestive in the violence), not to mention in big-budget splendor, and ends up truly memorable."

","Although I heard several times the quality of The Bridge on the River Kwai, no review can prepare you for the sheer jaw-dropping, absolute perfection that this movie is.<br/><br/>The movie, set in World War II, begins with a pan down to a batallion of British soldiers whistling a very recognizable tune, and marching in step into a Japanese POW camp in the jungles of modern-day Burma.  The camp is run by Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakowa, a part-time artist and wine connoisseur, and full-time prison warden and sadist.  Colonel Saito tells his captives, members of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers, that they must build a rail bridge over the Kwai River, or be executed ""without honor"".  He also orders the officers of the corps, led by Colonel Nicholson, played by Sir Alec Guiness, to assist in the manual labor.  Colonel Nicholson resists, citing a book of the rules of warfare written by the League of Nations forbiding captured officers to serve manual labor.  In honorable protest, they stand at full attention in a hunger strike for a full 24 hours until Colonel Saito relents.<br/><br/>Colonel Nicholson goes to the construction site and realizes that the bridge should be built on more solid ground further downstream.  He convinces Colonel Saito that they should build in another site.  If his men are being forced to work, Nicholson argues, they will work to build the best possible construction.  During the second construction, an American soldier Shears escapes the camp and ends up in Ceylon, a British Territory at the time. His British liberators use him and his knowledge of the project, and they assemble a small team to go back to the bridge to destroy it.<br/><br/>And therein lies the conflict.  In most movies, there is a person or group that you can ""root"" for without conviction, like the Americans in Saving Private Ryan.  If you root for Shears and his team, they are destroying something that their countrymen slaved hard labor to build.  Rooting for Nicholson means you are upholding the Japanese in their goal of expansion. Even Saito, although very brutal, is honorable.  He fights and does what he does for his country, not his own glory.  Honor is usually a virtue, but here it is a fatal flaw.  The pointlessness of war becomes completely apparent.  Pardon the cliche, but there are no winners in this movie, or in war, just degrees of losing.  Two points drive this home.  The first is Shears's exclaimation ""...you're all worrying about the proper way to die, when you should be worrying about the proper way to live!""  The second is after the bridge is completed, Colonel Nicholson gives a final lookover and sets a placard on the bridge that states that although it is under a Japanese flag, it was build by the hard work of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers.  The final end sequence is totally gripping, and one that you will never forget.<br/><br/>This movie won 7 Oscars, and it deserved every one.  Every element, the plot, acting, characterization, editing, is stunning.  The cinematography of the jungle and the bridge itself is among the best ever, and is a real treat in widescreen.  It's 2:45 running time will amaze you when you realize it after you are over, because it doesn't seem the least bit overlong.  Even the visual effects do not seem dated, and it was made over 40 years ago. I don't give out 10's very often, but this movie more than earns it.  There are absolutely no flaws in this movie, and is director David Lean's (Dr. Zhivago,  Lawrence of Arabia) masterpiece and is truly timeless.  A perfect movie that marries blockbuster entertainment with cinematic artistry, this should not be missed.  And you'll be whistling that tune for days after seeing it."

I can't answer that, but what I do know is that this piece of cinematic trash is just another notch in a southern Californian metroplex film industry that seems to never get anything right when it comes to history.<br/><br/>What's even more insulting is that people have voted it so high as a quality film. Between the Russians not getting credit for their massive effort in what they call ""the Great Patriotic War"" and people like my family who were there when it happened, it's a wonder the entire film industry hasn't been run out of town and forced to setup shop in Mexico.<br/><br/>Respectably shot, egotistical acting, poor SFX (notably the miniature), and a script that is just so idiotic I can't believe anyone green-lit this thing, it's a film that's definitely got some massive flaws.<br/><br/>If you need to see a WW2 film about the Pacific Theatre, then check out Tora Tora Tora (Tiger Tiger Tiger).<br/><br/>See this movie once, then do your brain a favor and pick up a book on the subject to learn what REALLY happened."

Another thing I don't understand is that when most people I know refer to ""The bridge on the river Kwai"", they only talk about the script and naturally, Lean's directing and Guinness's performance.  I think that it is William Holden who steals the show and he didn't even get a nomination in it.  His performance as Shears is absolutely incredible and totally convincing.<br/><br/>  The movie begins with an English platoon giving in to a Japanese prison camp in WWII on a Japanese island.  When they arrive to the camp, their leader, Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) asks to see the chief of the camp.  He is presented to Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and announces to him that his platoon is surrendering.  Colonel Saito tells Colonel Nicholson that his men will have to work hard to build a bridge that goes from one side to another of the river Kwai.  Saito also tells him that if the men work hard, they will be treated well.  <br/><br/>  This whole conversation takes place right before the American grave-digger, Shears (Holden), held prisoner by the Japanese.  He also witnesses a little scene where Nicholson comes incredibly close to getting shot and so he understands just how hard-headed he is.  But Shears's only goal is to escape and that he does.  <br/><br/>  After his escape, Shears accidentally hooks up with Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who he doesn't know.  However, Warden, with the help of Nicholson's private work in the prison camp, knows a lot about Shears.  He explains to Shears that Nicholson is one of his men and that his platoon surrendered because that's what Warden had ordered Nicholson to do.  He also tells Shears that he gave that order because he knew about Saito's plan to build a bridge and that Nicholson's mission was to (WARNING: SPOILER) blow-up the bridge when the Japanese train which contains the ammunitions and weapons is passing on it.  And since Shears was able to escape from the camp, Warden convinces him to help him get close to the prison camp to set-up the explosives.<br/><br/>  ""The bridge on the river Kwai"" is a gripping, flawless movie and even though I said that Holden nearly steals the show with his performance as Shears, Guinness's performance is excellent as well.  Hawkins delivers a great performance as well and Lean's directing is nothing else than perfect. He seems to have that touch of being able to make three to four hours long movies without boring the viewer.  ""The bridge on the river Kwai"" was ranked #13 on AFI's list of their 100 all-time best movies which is exactly the rank it deserved.  It is really exceptional."

","Of David Lean's three most celebrated films -- ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dr. Zhivago,"" and ""Bridge"" -- this is probably the most entertaining. But it is also a marvelous bit of film making. Alec Guiness made a lot of movies, several of them with Lean. He's unbelievably good here. I always liked William Holden, but he's completely outclassed in Guiness' company. Jack Hawkins, who rarely got the credit he deserved, holds up his end pretty well. Critics usually put ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago"" ahead of ""Bridge"" on their all-time lists, and I don't quarrel with that. But ""Bridge"" ain't too shabby -- and, as noted above, it's a lot more fun. Although the outcome is predictable, I was on the edge of my seat the first time I saw this movie, and I find that it is still remarkably effective in generating suspense, even after you know what's coming. ""Bridge"" is definitely a 10. Okay, maybe ""Lawrence"" and ""Zhivago"" deserve 11s."

"sddavis63","6","3","5","18 June 2011"," More Of A Psychological Study Than A War Movie
","""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" is not your typical war movies. There are no battle scenes and there's little carnage; hardly any of the action you're conditioned to expect from a ""war"" movie. Even for a movie set in a prison camp there are no mass escape attempts (the one escape attempt I believe consisted of three prisoners.) This is instead more of a psychological study of the effects of captivity on soldiers - maybe even an early hint of what's come to be known as ""the Stockholm Syndrome"" - as prisoners begin to identify with and in some ways sympathize with their captives.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a Japanese prison camp where the prisoners are ordered to work on building a massive railway bridge over the River Kwai. Alec Guinness put on a strong performance as Col. Nicholson - the senior British officer among the prisoners who fights for the respect of the camp commander Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa in another strong performance). The movie for a while offered a pretty good depiction of the harshness of Japanese prison camps, and was interesting in portraying Nicholson as ultimately besting Saito as he first gains the right (guaranteed by the Geneva Convention) for the officers not to be used as manual labourers and then gets the British officers in charge of building the bridge, thus ensuring that his men would be essentially under British command. That was well portrayed, as was the fact that somewhere along the way the lines of loyalty got tested. Nicholson devotes himself to building the bridge, making an even better bridge for the Japanese than the Japanese themselves were going to build - all in the name of keeping up the morale of the British troops and building a monument to the abilities of the British army. But - as was questioned in the movie - at what point does the legitimate duty of POWs (the Geneva Convention allows for enlisted prisoners to be used by their captors for manual labour) become treasonous? The bridge and railway will be used to transport Japanese troops. Did Nicholson have to ensure that it would be so well built? And Saito suffers some of the same psychological challenges, depicted as being in torment after realizing that, while he's going to get his bridge built, he had to do it by giving up control to those who were supposed to be his prisoners. It all builds up to a powerful last scene as Allied commandos try to blow up the bridge and Nicholson tries to save it before realizing what he's doing.<br/><br/>The psychological study is interesting and the acting is good. I thought the movie itself was a bit too long at almost three hours. William Holden's role as an American officer who escapes from the camp and then becomes part of the commando team seeking to destroy the bridge was well played but struck me as rather unnecessary - at least I wasn't sure of the need for him to have been in the camp with Nicholson and then to have him return to blow up the bridge. Some of that seemed to me to add unnecessary filler to the movie, especially the scenes in which Shears is recruited to go back to the jungle as part of the commando team.<br/><br/>It's a good movie and interesting enough - just a little too much extraneous material and therefore a little bit too long. (6/10)"
"travis57","10","3","5","2 March 2008"," not history but fiction
","Just in answer to gcaplan's observations, anyone worried about the historical aspects of the film should remember that the movie is based on Pierre Boulle's novel, not specifically on historical facts. Boulle based his characters on soldiers and collaborators he had known during his own service in French Indochina during the war. His decision to use a more famous episode and British officers rather than French is perfectly understandable for a French novelist writing during the last stages of the war in Indochina. The main theme of his book is the difference in attitudes between the Japanese (and Asians generally) and the Europeans."
"ackstasis","9","3","5","24 September 2007"," ""Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of cricket!""
","Nobody could craft an epic film better than David Lean, as I learned earlier this year when I watched the magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' for the first time. Though he had achieved earlier success with such films as 'Brief Encounter (1945)' and 'Great Expectations (1946),' 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' was the first of Lean's multi-million dollar wide-screen spectaculars, for which he is now most fondly remembered. Shot on location in the jungles of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the film concerns the building of a railway bridge by Allied prisoners-of-war during World War Two. As it becomes less and less likely that the bridge will be constructed before the deadline, conflict escalates between the proud British leader, Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and hot-tempered Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). The film proved very successful at the 1958 Oscars, taking home seven awards (including Best Picture) from eight nominations.<br/><br/>Whilst William Holden's cynical, hard-edged American was likely considered the main star attraction, the film's most memorable character  and, indeed, one of the greatest in cinema history  is Alec Guiness' Col. Nicholson. The embodiment of British courage and dedication, Nicholson finds himself in a battle of wills with the ruthless Col. Saito, who, despite representing the enemy, nonetheless exhibits many of the same qualities: egotistical pride, obstinacy and unwillingness to compromise. For Col. Nicholson, the construction of the railway bridge becomes something of an obsession, its completion symbolic of ""Western methods and efficiency that will put {the Japanese} to shame"" and the culmination of his 28 years in the military. When he uncovers the plot to destroy the bridge, Nicholson betrays his fellow countrymen to the Japanese, his narcissistic pride in the landmark prompting him to neglect his sworn duty to Britain.<br/><br/>I'd like to take some time to consider the film's climax, undoubtedly one of the most awe-inspiring cinema spectacles of all time. I had initially anticipated that, after the intricate task of planting the explosives overnight, the detonation of the bridge would be a rather straightforward task. However, David Lean weaves so much action and suspense into the finale that the closing credits left me reeling. As the distant rumble of a train announces its impending arrival, Col. Nicholson notices that the reduction in river-level has exposed the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. Not yet comprehending the situation, he summons Col. Saito and they both descend to the riverside to investigate. Once his fears are confirmed, Nicholson  to his subsequent dismay  attempts to thwart his army's attempt to destroy the enemy bridge, and both Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) and Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) are fatally shot.<br/><br/>Interestingly, there have been suggestions that Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkins) fired the lethal shots at his own comrades, abandoning the mission objective in an attempt to prevent their live capture by the merciless Japanese. Whilst this isn't explicitly shown in the film itself, it reportedly corresponds with Pierre Boulle's original novel (in which, notably, the bridge is not destroyed) and would certainly explain why, afterwards, Warden tries to rationalise his actions: ""I had to do it. I had to do it. They might have been captured alive. It was the only thing to do."" Alternatively, Warden didn't shoot them, but is attempting to justify his use of the mortars, which basically obliterated any slim remaining chances on their survival. Meanwhile, Nicholson, struck by shrapnel from a mortar attack, crumbles hopelessly onto the detonator (either intentionally or inadvertently) just as the train begins to cross the river. The actual collapse of the $250,000 bridge, a shot which owes a lot to Buster Keaton and 'The General (1927)', is an amazing spectacle, and Maj. Clipton (James Donald) sums up the entire climax - and war in general - with his horrified exclamation of ""Madness! Madness!"""
"slokes","8","3","5","11 September 2005"," Col. Nicholson's Private War
","Disguised in the garb of a boy's-own adventure film, ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" succeeds in being one of the most cleverly subversive films ever to capture mainstream success. As adapted for the screen by two then-blacklisted writers, Michael G. Wilson and Carl Foreman, ""Kwai"" sends up Western notions of heroism and race identity and dares to question not only the needfulness of war but the very value of winning it when weighed against the cost of one peacelover's life.<br/><br/>It's a simplistic, perhaps off-putting message, but a unique one for an action-adventure film from the 1950s. As presented by director David Lean and four terrific lead actors, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa, and Alec Guinness, the film is not one you want to pass by.<br/><br/>The focal point, especially in the movie's first half, is Guinness's Col. Nicholson, who leads his ragged troops to a Japanese prison camp after being ordered to surrender in Singapore. Camp commandant Saito (Hayakawa) wants to break the morale of his charges through forced labor, turning them into either productive slaves or else cheap corpses. Nicholson of course wants his troops to be neither. So intent on keeping order he won't even allow his men to discuss escape, he rigidly follows a by-the-book code that winds up getting him shut up in a tin shack.<br/><br/>Nicholson may be admirable, but as Saito says, he is too proud. At one point, when told he is beyond the markers of civilization, Nicholson breezily replies: ""Then we have the opportunity to introduce it."" Later on, he talks up the idea of building a bridge for his captors. ""We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods of efficiency that will put them to shame."" Saito's no barbarian, though, just another soldier trying to do his job by a code even more stringent than Nicholson's.<br/><br/>Pride is not a bad thing when it helps keep your men alive, and this Nicholson manages to do. But that same pride becomes all-consuming, to the point where he allows himself to forget his duties to his country and bends himself to a task designed to help his enemy win the war.<br/><br/>Another British soldier, completing a triangle with Nicholson and Saito, is Hawkins' Maj. Warden, a commando of almost casual heroism as he totes a sleeve full of plastic explosives around his neck. Seeking to blow up the bridge Nicholson is so intent on building, Warden presses into service an American (Holden) who only wants to go home and chase women. As Holden's character says, Warden would prefer to ""die by the rules when the only important thing is to live like a human being."" Yet Warden isn't only willing to risk his life, but the American's, too.<br/><br/>The movie's philosophy of disengaged pacifism and the ""madness"" of war gives it much of its strength, though for my money it goes on too long making the same points. The subplot with Holden feels tacked on and detracts too much from Nicholson and the rightful center of the story. Saito slinks to the background too quickly after his face-off with Nicholson, hardly mattering by the end despite the fact he is a critical player throughout the first half.<br/><br/>The point of Saito's character seems to be that he becomes disillusioned as Nicholson helps him accomplish his mission, his sense of honor offended by the prisoners' help it is his duty to accept. Here's another example of the limitations of a warrior's code, especially as we witness Saito's preparations for hari-kari and his admission he really wanted to be an artist.<br/><br/>""Kwai"" may be one of the most visually perfect films ever made, every scene framed and set with a jeweler's care and taking full advantage of a lush Far Eastern landscape. Add to that the unusually complex storyline, and Lean's first epic proves a very good one, a classic to many. If it isn't everyone's cup of tea, well, neither is war."

As a result the first thing I ever whistled as a youngster was Kenneth Alford's Colonel Bogey march. It's unfortunate that it's now known as The ""River Kwai"" march. The performance by Alec Guinness is matched by that of Sessue Hayakawa who my parents told me had been a well known actor when they were young. William Holden, Jack Hawkins and James Donald were also impressive. I decided to read the book. The first change was the book has ""over"" not ""on"" in the title. SPOILER AHEAD.

"Wulfstan10","10","3","5","22 March 2005"," Powerful Drama
","My first remark about the Bridge on the River Kwai is that it is not really ""history"" or a WWII story, but it is simply set in WWII, taking various general events in that war as the inspiration for this story. Instead, the film, and the novel (not historical account) on which it is based, should be viewed as being about deep, meaningful themes of war and human character rather than an attempt to portray actual events or an action adventure. Many times I have talked to people who entirely misunderstood the entire story, be it in the book or the film. They misconstrued it as an action film/story, looking only at the surface, and thought that the main characters were the guys going to blow up the bridge, or criticized the book for its ending (quite different from the film in one major respect that really doesn't impact either one negatively since both have value).<br/><br/>That said, this film is simply outstanding, despite a few rather minor flaws and the limits of 1957 film technology. Except for the end and the fact that it changes a couple relatively minor characters around in minor ways (probably to make it more appealing to the mass audience), the film excellently and faithfully conveys the themes and issues of the book, providing deep, compelling drama.<br/><br/>The key character is really Nicholson and Sir Alec Guinness is utterly superb in this role. He conveys the man's conviction and character beautifully and I doubt anyone could have done it better. It is the examination of his views and actions that forms the central theme of the story and its examination of human character, the desire to maintain one's humanity or dignity, a battle of wills, etc. The context means that Nicholson's conduct is also ironic (even more so in the novel itself), provoking further contemplation about these themes, the relative value of the characters' goals, good and bad, etc. It is thus beautiful, rich and compelling drama with many layers and facets to ponder. It is one of those stories, in fact, where there is so much going on below the surface that one could easily explore themes that the writer and filmmakers themselves may never have considered."
"Danusha_Goska","Null","3","5","16 May 2004"," Suprisingly Timely
","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is one of those movies that is so good, so well-received, and so much a part of international culture that it is hard to comment on it.<br/><br/>Even if you've never seen it, you probably know the plot. At least you know enough to whistle the Colonel Bogie March, the movie's theme, which became an international hit after the movie was released. <br/><br/>You know the movie is about British prisoners in a Japanese prison camp during WW II. These prisoners build a bridge, and the interaction of the Brits and the Japanese, the lone American in the camp, and the bridge itself all become huge metaphors for ... well, watch the movie and then develop your own interpretation.<br/><br/>Does the movie really want us to believe that everything that has gone before is mere ""madness,"" as one character pronounces? This viewer finds that hard to believe. <br/><br/>Alec Guinness plays British POW Colonel Nicholson, who directs construction of a bridge while he is a captive of the Japanese.  <br/><br/>Guinness does his usual expert job. One thing I adore about Guinness, here, and also as Faisal in another Lean movie, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" is that he commands my last bit of attention without ever raising his voice, or doing anything especially dramatic. He isn't even especially good looking or sexy, unlike his fellow British actor Richard Burton. <br/><br/>Guinness, just, ever so quietly, commands the screen. The force is indeed with him, and never so much as here.<br/><br/>Again, with complete quiet, he conveys the role perfectly, but leaves the viewer with the impression that a good ninety percent of him is in reserve. And he also leaves the viewer with the impression that that ninety percent is completely inaccessible, something we'll never know.<br/><br/>
The movie itself, especially in theremin-sounding soundtrack effects, and characters within the movie, suggest that Guinness / Nicholson may be over the edge, to put it mildly, and that the bridge of the title is an example of complete folly. <br/><br/>And yet this viewer could not help but strongly admire Nicholson. In short, things are more complex than they seem.<br/><br/>Certainly, Nicholson was more admirable to this viewer than William Holden as the American Shears. Here Holden repeats the role he had in Billy Wilder's ""Stalag 17,"" the good-looking, good-timing American soldier who is heroic in spite of himself, and desires his own personal survival above all. <br/><br/>Jack Hawkins does his usual excellent job in a small role as a linguist/soldier. James Donald is touching as a sort of ""Hawkeye Pierce"" doctor who comments on the folly of war. <br/><br/>Sessue Hayakawa plays Col. Saito, the Japanese prison camp commander. Both the character and the actor were sold short by the script. Saito is never given a moment when we see more than a bumbling, sadistic, barbarian warrior. Compare this to the much more complex portryal of Amon Goeth by Ralph Fiennes in ""Schindler's List."" <br/><br/>Interestingly, in the silent era, Hayakawa played the ""Asian Male as Sexual Threat,"" sort of comparable, though not as wildly popular, as Valentino as the Sheik. See 1915's ""The Cheat,"" in which he attempts to buy sexual services from a white woman.<br/><br/>There is a scene in ""Kwai"" where Hayakawa / Saito breaks down into tears. Perhaps because of all the stereotyped roles he had to play?<br/><br/>""Kwai"" is surprisingly timely in 2004, as the US confronts the abuse scandal of prisoners in Iraq.  The Geneva Convention was one of the central plot features of ""Kwai."" It is also a central question for American political life in 2004. <br/><br/>Oh, how I wish they still made epics like this -- movies that really are eye candy -- Sri Lanka, where the film was shot, has never looked so lovely -- and yet cause the viewer to think and feel as well."

","I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago on TCM. When I sat down to watch it I had no idea what to expect. The openings scene with the troops marching and whistling was confusing at first but then everything fell into place. I have noticed that many people seemed to think the film was too long. But for some reason I don't think the film would have worked if it was chopped in half. For about an hour of the movie it is just British troops toiling in a Japanese prison camp, while Alec Guinness is caged in a box. That hour of the film set everything else up and everything fell into place.<br/><br/>
I doubt a movie like The Bridge on the River Kwai could ever be made again. If viewers don't see sex and explosions in the first 45 minutes people get bored. If this movie was released in 2003 it would be a major box office blunder. This movie really shows how cinema has changed in 40some years. Too bad movies like this can't be made today."

But here's a chance to create something good, here's a way to preserve human dignity in inhuman conditions.

","A quite well shot, well-acted depiction of extremities under war, and how war affects different people. It manages to portray the setting and the times unforgettably well, aided by some good music. Hayakawa is excellent, giving off a commanding performance as the Japanese general in charge. Despite its merits, the film still does have a number of vices. At times it is difficult to understand what is happening, and the film appears to be deficient in terms of providing the audience with background information. Also, the film is awfully overlong and none of the supporting characters (except for Hayakawa) are well developed. This is nonetheless a film that can be liked for its virtues insomuch as they over-weigh the film's vices  but they do not override the negative aspects of the film.

Apparently the real Colonel he played was indeed an atypical man--most Japanese officers in a similar situation would have most likely just killed Alec Guinness and the other officers who refused his orders.

William Holden was essentially the same character he played in Stalag 17--almost like a close in fact of the same opportunistic ""hero"". I liked this as a counter-point to the usual tough-guy hero in movies.<br/><br/>As for Guinness, he plays an excellent, but very odd British officer who is a great example of an Obsessive-Compulsive nut! He is so bent on maintaining self-control and a ""stiff upper lip"" that he completely loses sight of the war and the fact that the Japanese are the enemy! He and Holden both are amazing psychological portraits.<br/><br/>Other than the acting, the cinematography and music were excellent. A very odd and atypical war film that is worth your time."
"tedg","Null","6","14","30 May 2002"," Episode II
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Except for the historical interest as preparation for ""Lawrence,"" this film deserves to be on few best lists in my opinion. It has some fine cinematography (mostly experimental) but otherwise no center. The rewritten Japanese history bothered me. Seen `Paradise Road'? So I invent my own cinematic pleasure.<br/><br/>I write this a couple weeks after the invasion of `Star Wars, Episode II.' Here is where we find out about how the storm troopers were made and we see the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. We see two factions at war, each leader sticking to their principles. An evil force and barbarism drive the plot. Lean's film is much better than Lucas' and serves the same purpose. Precisely while Americans were making this film, Kurosawa in Japan was making `Kakushi Toride no San Akunin' (`Hidden Fortress') from which Lucas stole much of `Star Wars' most famously including the storm trooper costumes. Here, in `Bridge,' we see the young Obiwan in his first important mission as a Jedi actor. (He would be knighted the next year in large part for this role.) `Star Wars' ended up being the bridge between `Bridge' and `Fortress.'<br/><br/>Or alternatively, you could see this as Paul McCartney did, as one of the inspirations for `Sgt. Pepper.' (Just the idea for the band of four led by the joker Billy Shears, mixed with the whistle march, destroying things and conceptions that other parts of British society were building -- or at least maintaining through doggedness.) This is where the line `All you need is love' comes from as well. (And Ono?)<br/><br/>Or you can see this as David Lean's apprenticeship in Cinemascope. The acting is rather stilted, especially with Holden. In fact everyone but the medical officer was living in a prior world of `Great Expectations' acting -- stagy readings of lines. But Lean came through it well enough to next make essentially the same picture but in the desert. That had a better score, superb superb editing, and an inspired actor. This film is merely competent. But you can see him testing out the epic in this new medium, especially the framing of a man's emotion in a long shot.<br/><br/>Or -- here's another take. War films are a primary means by which a nation redefines itserf. And there's major change evident here. The Japanese committed the worst barbarisms of the century in this time and place, but since the Cold War was gearing up and the US needed the Japanese as a buffer against the Russians, here they are depicted mildly, no less intensely than the British and somewhat comically. Here we have the first appearance of the Brando type of American, not as a rebel but as the prototypical American: no guff, ladies' man; somewhat dishonest but only on minor matters; inventive; and brave when the chips are down. (See `Great Escape' for the next step in this evolution.)<br/><br/>At this very same time (in a picture also advised by Washington) Brando himself was in Japan making `Sayonara' where he as a war hero falls in love with a Japanese girl. We needed to rewrite history and make friends.<br/><br/>And Siamese peasant girls from this period with bras and makeup? See, that's indicative of the inherent ""let's pretend"" stance of this purportedly realistic world."

","Supposedly based on a true incident this is a story of a group of British POWs forced to build a bridge for the Japanese during WWII. The prisoners are led by Alec Guinness (winning a well-deserved Oscar) who keeps butting heads with the Japanese commander (Sessue Hayakawa). Meanwhile another group of British and Americans (one played by William Holden) will do anything to blow up the bridge.<br/><br/>The popularity of this film completely escapes me. It's much too long--the script really drags everything out--this could have been done in half the time. I was actually falling asleep a few times and looking at my watch constantly. Also, Hayakawa's thick accent makes 90% of his dialogue unintelligable and his performance is pretty bad. And the ending is a washout--it contains bad special effects and it doesn't carry any impact at all.<br/><br/>On the good side--Holden and Guinness give out very good performances, there is some admittedly beautiful scenes (director David Lean did know how to shoot epics), the whistling song has become a classic and there's a wonderful dinner scene between Guinness and Hayakawa. For all those things I'm giving this a 5.<br/><br/>But overall, I found this a big, bloated, boring movie. I can't recommend it."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","3","13 November 2017"," The defining piece among David Lean's magna opera
","The defining piece among David Lean's magna opera, THE BRIDHE ON THE RIVER KWAI ushers in Lean's artistically ripe years with his epic-scale storytelling coming about in the most picturesque locations among our mundane world. In the heart of its hearts, TBONRK is an anti-war infotainment, as it is book-ended by British Major Clipton's ""it's madness!"" exclamation after its breakneck finale, madness is constituent of war, no one can say otherwise, but as in any superlative narrative-leaning cinematic conception, Lean cannily adopts an ambiguous route in lieu of stating the obvious (one must also lure those ticket-buyers who are steeped in nationalism, patriotism and heroism into the auditorium) and lets the rousing spirit prevail among those allied WWII POWs in Burma, under the high-handed command of Japanese Colonel Saito (an Oscar- nominated Hayakawa, giving a forcibly layered presence against the role's discriminated condition), to build a bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. <br/><br/>The meat of the film's first half is a duel of will between British Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Guinness, walks away with his Oscar with august poise and solemn diction) and Saito, and who is the winner? The answer is as plain as the nose on anyone's face. Nicholson's obduracy ostensibly stems from his admired patriotism, to safeguard the last remnant of dignity against the ghastly adversity, but there is just a fine line between patriotism and jingoism, he will not bat an eye if he dies for his alleged good cause, naturally, it entails that no other lives can alter his mind, and shall we really extol such hidebound doctrine? This is where the film daringly touches a raw nerve in Nicholson's final triumph, why is he hailed by his fellow prisoners? He has done nothing for them from a pragmatic angle, what he achieves only fulfills his ego, an ego Lean beguilingly links with British's own colonial pride, to build a sturdy bridge in a foreign country and have his name inscribed in the plaque, disregarding its utilitarian consequences which will further extend the warfare and compound the affliction. <br/><br/>On the other hand, we have the American Navy Commander Shears (an omnipotently, effortlessly charismatic Holden), who miraculously escapes from the prison camp alive, and swears that nothing can haul him back to that living hell. But, ""there is always something unexpected"", that is the tag-line of the picture, in the exchange between him and the British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins, spiking a dosage of empathy into his martinet blood), Shears is literally coerced into ""volunteer"" the mission to blow up the bridge because of his inconvenient ""imposter"" identity, yes, he is not a commander but a common soldier taking the uniform to secure better treatment in captivity (a very understandable action, surely is below Nicholson's hallowed principles). What happens in the second half actually shows that Shears' ""insider"" distinction makes no import in their mission or whatsoever, the army might just as well command any soldier as willing as the Canadian Lieutenant Joyce (Horne, a tenderfoot but swell swimmer), there is cruel irony seeping underneath the shock troops' daredevil heroism. <br/><br/>As a rule, the mockery shouldn't be too offensive (it is not a vehement agitprop), Shears' penchant for hedonism and pragmatism alternates with Nicholson slippery to self-indulging delusion is the constantly battling tenors thrusting this film to the crunch, as Nicholson's ""what have I done?"" epiphany dished up with a ghost of vague contrition and followed by a chancy act of detonation, all we want to ask in the aftermath, is it really worth it?<br/><br/>Apart from several peccadilloes, for instance, the technical incapacity of the Japanese party comes far too convenient (as it is not the case in reality) and the unpleasantness of war prisoners' state- of-play is categorically diluted, TBONRK is a sensational journey, peopled with vivid characters (its nearly male-exclusive cast, saving for some female exploitation footnotes, is all in full mettle), sublime landscape (including a striking worm's-eye view shot with collective wing-taking avifauna in the wake of gunshots) and well-imposed suspense, not to mention the food-for-thought deliberation it triggers in hindsight, one must see it to experience it!"

","Bridge over the River Kwai (1957)<br/><br/>A superbly well crafted World War II movie about British POWs working on a bridge in the Thai jungle for their Japanese captors.<br/><br/>That may sound like a summary, but along those lines it's simply a really well made (and fictional) movie. What makes it rise above (much as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" by the same director does) is the psychology, and the aggrandizing pro-British agenda. It's all feel-good stuff (if you're not Japanese, at least). And smart, sharply filmed, and increasingly complicated.<br/><br/>There are some welcome contrasts quite intentionally worked out at the start, including a common one in these film—the different military culture of the British (in Asia still very much of the British Empire mindset) and the Americans (represented by William Holden). The Japanese are really only present in the form of the prison commander, who is a combination of cruel and pathetic. You eventually feel sympathy for the fellow in a way, as the Brits show an unlikely but well-hones superiority in engineering and in morality.<br/><br/>There is some true basis to the movie but there were so many liberties taken with the truth that there is no need to dig into that (except for some sense of what the war was really like in SE Asia before 1945). So you really can't watch it for a glimpse of prison life in a Japanese camp. Instead think of it as a larger tale of dignity and perseverance. Alec Guinness (as the leading British officer) is wonderful.<br/><br/>The eventual climax is filled with irony and difficulty (and tragedy), but I can't go into that and the meanings here. Let it be said that you need to stick it out if the three hours starts to seem long. It has both a resolution to the plot and to the ethical issues that turn up.<br/><br/>Powerful stuff. In the big picture this will seem ""by the book,"" an epic that is excellent but takes few chances. But it's so well made you need to appreciate it for what it is."
"oOoBarracuda","8","2","3","3 February 2016"," ""The only important thing is how to live like a human being.""
","Few movies tell the story of war in such an unbiased way, only to show its dehumanizing effects. About midway through Bridge on the River Kwai, the viewer no longer is too interested in who will ""win"" the conflict (how do you do that anyway?—But that's for another conversation), but rather about the lengths these men have gone away from their beings. We see people who were driven to the brink of what one can survive, and not all of them did. A true test of the boundaries of the human spirit, Bridge on the River Kwai, directed by David Lean, took home Oscar's top prize in 1957.<br/><br/>Brash, yet civil Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) commander of a group of British soldiers captured as POW's by the Japanese military in the midst of WWII has a single vision in mind. Armed with the promise of the Geneva Convention, Nicolson is determined to lead his men with honor. Determined to conduct himself and his men with the honor betrothed to those that don the British uniform, Nicolson endures more than anyone thought he could survive to gain the respect of his captors. The Japanese eventually realize that Nicholson is a force to be reckoned with, and as much as they may wish to kill him, their hands are figuratively tied. Gaining respect, Nicholson eventually becomes an integral part of the Japanese plan to build a bridge over the river Kwai veiled as a useful wartime measure that actually only serves as a monument to Japanese commanding officer Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Although his men don't want to do the work that glorifies the Japanese, Nicholson ensures them that completion of the bridge will actually serve as a testament to the will and honorability of the British. Construction goes on, with the help of the British, all the while allies have hatched a plan to burn the bridge down, led by escaped American prisoner Shears (William Holden). The two plots work together to form one cohesive story of men afflicted with battle and the concessions that some won't even allow themselves to make in a time of war.<br/><br/>This film shows Alec Guinness at his best, a raw look at a man in the heart of battle that refuses to leave his morals behind. He excels as a man leading his men with the dignity each deserves as a human being. William Holden is also a standout in this picture. Holden plays the role of the disillusioned prisoner who has given up hope with ease, coming off both believable and lovable. The cinematography of this film was a thing of beauty. In scenes with hundreds of men marching, the audience is graced with seeing the vast landscape that is so grand it appears to completely encompass the men. There were also incredible shots through binoculars that show, in part, the directorial genius of David Lean. The acting and technical elements came together to create a strong film that explores the depth of the human spirit.<br/><br/>It is sometimes difficult to watch a movie with no clear hero. Everyone comes off a little crazy in this film; which perhaps, may explain why the final lines in this film were ""the madness, the madness"". I don't want a cookie-cutter movie by any means, but I also don't want to travel half way through an almost three-hour film rooting for someone, only to realize he's a bit off his rocker. I suppose, however, that is what happens when you have a movie like Bridge on the River Kwai, with such heavy themes as honor, strength, and valor. Technically, I understand why this film took home Oscar's top prize; the acting and writing allows one to understand this as well. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war films, of course, even though this one is quite different from the standard. Also, I would recommend Bridge on the River Kwai to anyone who needs reassurance that the human spirit can overcome even the darkest of evils."

","Short Review :-<br/><br/>Watched The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957)<br/><br/>Tactical understanding of filmmaking at its best. David Lean will go down in memory lane for giving some epic war and classy films that were ahead of their time. That doesn't mean he hasn't given non war films but his war films have been universally acclaimed. I have seen many directors and critics now days mentioning this film oftenly in thier speeches and the excitement started building up even more than earlier. The Bridge On The River Kwai is a fine example of tactically brilliant filmmaking. Why i say Tactically? Because you must know, you must understand what are you trying to show in the film and David Lean got all the tactics correct and like never before, never after. The film is visually spectacular but that just doesn't enough for a movie lover but it is about the entire scenerio that makes it a great film. Acting, locations, cinematography, presentation of that particular era everything is top notch and this is how the scenerio is made. It is not arguable that whether the film deserved 7 Oscars or not, but the question is, how far it lives upto the standard of those awards. Well, this one lives upto those standard by every mean. If one would have just gone for the grandeur then The Bridge On The River Kwai might have been even bigger film but it wasn't just about grandeur, it was about handling the Content with care. Overall, The Bridge On The Kwai River is War/AntiWar film that was made to set an example for upcoming films in this genre.

","A compelling work engulfed with human nature embellished by a grand design, it's a monumental testament to the condition of war and nationalism. The still frame shots of a cascade of bats darkening the Indian sky, disturbed by the brutality of soldiers. And that's how you feel when it all ends. Lean captures that unabashed pride that inhabits every countrymen, and, in a close up shot on the brilliant Alex Guiness, he captures that horrific gaze, the kind a soldier possesses before uttering ""What have I done?"". Tragic, suspenseful, and altogether beautifully done, Bridge On The River Kwai feels essential, significant in every way."

"frankwiener","7","1","1","29 November 2017"," The Forest From the Trees
","Many of the most negative reviews about this film object to the alleged falsification of history by the creators. Although I was disappointed with this latest viewing of the movie, I don't agree with these reviewers. The film is a work of fiction that is loosely based on a true, historical event, and that is how it is to be viewed. I recently watched ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", another film, much more to my liking, that is also centered on World War II but focused on an entirely different aspect of that war, the challenge that adjustment to civilian life poses to combat veterans in a world that is supposed to be peaceful but isn't. As in the case of this film, that product is a work of fiction based on true experience, but neither film was ever intended to be a factual documentary or a work of non-fiction. The actual combat disability of actor Harold Russell in ""Best Years of Our Lives"" is very real, but he doesn't portray himself or his own, personal story in the movie. In this case, no one is denying that Allied prisoners were treated much more harshly by their Japanese captors than depicted here or implying that the real colonel, upon whom the story is based, collaborated with the enemy as the fictional Colonel Nicholson did.<br/><br/>While the film opens with a very dramatic battle of wills between Colonel Saito and Lt. Colonel Nicholson and ends with an even more spectacular finale, I found very little action in between. Although the scenery of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the movie's actual location, is quite spectacular and the Siamese (Thai) women are very pleasant to behold, much of the dialogue is dull and even banal.<br/><br/>Alec Guiness, who was very reluctant to take the role of Nicholson, creates an intriguing portrayal of the officer in charge of the Allied prisoners. Sessue Hayakawa is equally as good as his counterpart, the Japanese officer in charge of the prison camp. Many notable actors, including Charles Laughton, refused the role of Nicholson because they didn't understand his motivation, a view which should be appreciated. Others believed the material, based on that of a French author, to be viciously anti-British, which is also a reasonable interpretation. I was unimpressed by the rest of the cast, and I consider myself to be a fan of William Holden. His exchange with the bribed Japanese guard, for example, is nothing short of ridiculous. In general, Bill doesn't seem to be emotionally involved in the lame dialogue and may have even found some of it embarrassing.<br/><br/>As a result of the commendable performances of both Guinness and Hayakawa, the beautiful cinematography by Jack Hildyard, the film's trademark whistling of ""Colonel Bogey's March"", and an unforgettable ending that is worth the long wait, I rate it a 7 out of 10. I strongly disagree that fighting the Japanese and the Germans in the most effective way possible during World War II amounted to ""madness"" as this film seemed to suggest at the end. That is just wrong."

","8.5 / 10 IMDb points? 66.th best IMDb movie? Many reviewers' favourite movie of all times bar none? Has the world gone quite mad? To me it's a highly forgettable movie. I'm not really addressing those lost souls who actually enjoyed this, to quote Bill Hicks, p. o. s. film, but to warn those impressionable souls who still haven't seen it: beware! Beware this p. o. s. film!<br/><br/>As for the plot, this movie falls roughly into two halves; in the first we follow a contingent of British soldiers in Japanese captivity in Burma during World War II (the one with the funny mustaches). When the dastardly Saito orders the officers to work alongside their regulars -- a breach of the Geneva Convention -- he is faced off by the impeccable colonel Nicholson. Eventually Saito gives in and the British soldiers build him a magnificent railway bridge.<br/><br/>In the second half of the movie we follow an American soldier, Shears, who has managed to escape from Saito's jungle camp. Against his will he is sent back on a secret mission to blow up that very bridge.<br/><br/>At the climax, two men are pitched against each other: Nicholson, to whom the bridge is a symbol of his perseverance and supremacy, and the American, who has gone through hell and back to destroy it and do damage to the Japs.<br/><br/>My major problem with the movie is that colonel Nicholson is obviously a complete idiot. His nemesis Saito may be an evil sadist, but at least he has a weak and human side as well. He is a pudgy little fellow who's been to art school, but now has to make do as a CO. My heart went out to him, whereas I fail to see how anyone can sympathise with the blimpish Nicholson.<br/><br/>It's only after the bridge has been completed that a single officer mildly questions the wisdom of building the most magnificent bridge of all times for the Japanese, who are, after all, not exactly their allies. And I never saw what was so unethical about officers working alongside their troops in the first place.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it's a pretty conventional, John-Wayne-style war movie. The enemy is inscrutable and evil, Asian women are almond-eyed, servile foxes, the soldiers are undyingly loyal and war is hell but fun (in a rough, it's-a-man's-world sort of way). The production is excellent but overall it's a very dated movie. I'm surprised how anyone would consider this a classic rather than just an old movie. Its only benefit is that it allowed director David Lean to make Lawrence Of Arabia."

","Certainly 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' has a gorgeous and epic sweep. If viewers simply want an entertaining evening, just cue it up and enjoy. For that matter, if you want encouragement, The AFI 100 once placed 'The Bridge' as the 13th best film ever and it has garnered more 4 of 4 and 5 of 5 star reviews than can be counted.<br/><br/>However, The AFI now places the Film 37th and perhaps it is past due for re-vision. Although larger problems develop more slowly, it is a bad sign when there are not one, but two, obvious editing problems before the end of the credits! We are right behind the mounted machine gun on a train. The view is of the at least 2 carloads of wood for fuel and the engine. But now we see the same view with no fuel cars, OR EVEN THE ENGINE. Where did they go? <br/><br/>In the same scene, the train now stops as the rail ends amidst about 15 workers. But now the dramatic score kicks in and there suddenly are several dozen workers on the rail line. In a low-budget film, this could be overlooked. But this is a major production that won an Oscar....for best direction AND editing! <br/><br/>Moving on to the more serious issues, we are told that the British Commander (Alec Guinness) has been ordered to surrender, along with over 100 men and about a dozen officers. No explanation is offered for this. Really? He was just 'ordered to surrender'? According to historical estimates, over 100,000 men died building this railroad. For that matter, although there are ample references to men dying in this prison camp, all the men who have already been imprisoned there, even those in the infirmary, look well-fed, some even in 'beef-cake' condition. Again, this sort of over-sight would be fine for a 2nd rate 'action-genre' flick. It's Bill Holden-he's tanned, buff, and sweaty. Enough said? <br/><br/>The central problem with 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' has at least been occasionally mentioned. Guinness' Commander not only helps the Japanese build a crucial bridge in their supply line, he goes to great lengths to make sure the bridge will hold and be finished on time. This to prove superior British logistics and character. Along the way, he is warned of the possibly treasonous nature of his collaboration, and yet he continues on without a doubt. Nothing is made of this...he just comes across as 'funny that way'. <br/><br/>However, as far as I know, it has not been pointed out that all of his men and his officers would therefore have had to join him in this inexplicable lapse. This despite what appears to be a very democratic officers meeting and over two months time to reflect on the matter. Treason?...well...no problem! What a credulous bunch of guys. And more to the point, what a credulous bunch of reviewers have failed to notice this. <br/><br/>Clearly the original 1957 release of 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' struck a cord. To portray an American, (British in the book), played by William Holden, as cynically detached from the war effort and yet ultimately humane was not new. Several Bogart films prepared audiences for this. But to sum it all up as 'Madness', this before Catch-22 and Mash, was ahead of it's time. This progressive spirit, some great cinematography, and a rousing combination of star-power and studio support make for an entertaining evening. But as a 'Closely Watched Film', it is almost as much train-wreck as classic."

The other is a lot of hell, which is based on real experience, such ""To End All Wars"" (2001) which is much more realistic portrayed, such as the amount of efforts required to build the bridge, the destruction of bridge, the clash of cultures, the resulting friendship after the war, and much much more.

He could have just let Guiness die in the hole and forced labor under the threat of death. Instead, he liberates him and the English man is victorious and the Japaneses cries by himself. By the way, I didn't see much Japanese or even much Asians in an area that's supposed to be Asis. Hayakawa even gets stabbed by death to show a young English recruit to prove courage.<br/><br/>Guiness played the stiff upper lip Englishman who pridefully supervises the buildin of the bridge for the Japanese. It turns out to be his downfall as Willian Holden and Jack Hawkins come to destroy it.<br/><br/>Holden is definitely the most likable of the group but then I did start by saying I'm an American. Odd scene where the white guys get muddied up by the yellow girls as if the whites were gods.<br/><br/>But the dialogue is thoughtful and brings up interesting issues.

The mission of a team going over to this foreign enemeys camp and blowing up their bridge was pretty cool. The planning of it was handled nicely and then the actual moments of execution were terrific. These moments were the climax of the movie and it became so much more complex than it looked like it would be. Simply pushing a button became a difficult task and this conflict gave the movie a lot of energy. The second half of the movie is incredible. I only wish they hadn't taken so long to get it.

","I'm pretty tepid about David Lean's epics. Yes, they're some sort of cinematic development, but the best are a zero sum game (Laurence of Arabia) and others are just unfathomable (Zhivago, Passage to India, this). It's just not enough to go on location and get some pretty footage into a camera. Terence Malick has probably worn out a few copies of this.<br/><br/>What to make of a movie where an hour is killed in a non-cinematic protest about using war prisoners as a workers, only to toss that hard-won development out the window so the movie can actually get rolling..? It's a twist so corny they don't even acknowledge it; and it doesn't result in any decent debate. Everyone here who has an opinion, just takes some half-understood, poorly-argued stance, for which the movie itself offers no supporting evidence. All I take away from it, is that the British are a bizarre race of people; more concerned about afternoon tea than figuring out a coherent moral viewpoint. William Holden's discomfort with the obtuse British is a proxy for my own. They might as well be aliens. Do we really need a British film to demonize the British? Isn't that Hollywood's fulltime job? The movie has already emasculated the soldiers, symbolically by the time it puts one of them in drag in it's hideously belabored last hour.<br/><br/>Every conceivable piece of footage is tossed in to delay the end from arriving. When it finally does arrive (""Oh, give me a break!""), I was imagining about 20 more legitimate ways to structure a movie that needed to get to that big finale, which is the movies sole reason for being. Don't kid yourselves. There is nothing to think about in this movie. Structurally it's mush, making it excruciatingly tedious to sit through. I couldn't even be bothered to look up from my work every once in a while after hour two, to watch the exciting (snooze) mining of the bridge The DVD format is very odd.

","This story was not believable and I checked the FAQ's to make sure this was not based on a true story. The prison camp conditions were so unrealistic. The POW's didn't seem to have it that bad. Col. Saito the head of the prison was supposed to be a bad guy just because he made the officers do physical labor. I thought surely Col. Nicholson would get a bullet for challenging the authority of the prison guard commander. In what prison (civilian or military) does a prisoner get to protest and actually get his way? Then, I thought for sure Nicholson would get a bullet when he threatened to report Col. Saito for violating the rules of war, but it never happened. The story is completely ridiculous and the film is highly overrated."

I remember being shown this film in a movie appreciation segment by a teacher in elementary school. I then would watch it every chance I got as I grew older. Alec Guinness and William Holden give what may be their best performances. Younger people raised on fast-paced CGI hyper-edited ADHD movies would probably complain that this is boring. Their loss, and dead wrong. THIS is how films should be made. Take your time with location work and character development. There is one particular shot in the jungle where the commandos are hunting a stray Japanese solder. They startle hundreds of bats from sleep, and the bats fill the sky. The shadows of the bats flicker on the jungle below, making the search even more difficult due to the eye being drawn all around to the shadows flickering on the leaves. Brilliant scene.

"silverscreen888","8","2","4","21 September 2005"," An Allegorical Epic About Responsibility; Artful, Colorful, Very-Well Acted
","Critics' failure to comprehend this film was due to postmodernism. The film is not about its individuals; it is an allegory about 3 groups, U.S. amateurs, exemplified by William Holden as Shears; the British Empire represented by Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson; and the Japanese Empire represented by Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito. The titular bridge is the center of the symbolism. Shears wishes he were not at war at all--the bridge has no meaning to him; Nicholson in building the bridge performs an ""Elephant Walk"" ignoring of the situation; and Saito wants to build the bridge to show the British the Japanese are as good imperial dynasts as they are, and fails miserably. The film by my lights is long, but logically plotted. Characters are not developed, as in most males' films; but the central characters are given values, actions, reactions, speeches, purposes. The epic can be summed up in three sentences; ""A reluctant US warrior escapes from a Japanese prison camp just as newly-captured Brits led by a colonel arrive. He is forced to return, to blow up a bridge which the Brit, after refusing to allow involuntary work by officers on the bridge, has lovingly built, even recruiting his sick, wounded and dying men to show what British efficiency can do. The Japanese commandant was ready to kill himself if he failed to meet the bridge's deadline, so he reluctantly helps finish the bridge--which the U.S. soldiers and his team are sent to blow up, with the Brit's equally-reluctant eleventh-hour aid."" The central battle in the film is one of wills. Nicholson refuses to ignore the Geneva Convention and have his officers work on the bridge; he is thrown into ""The Oven"", a tin-box baking in the sun. Once released, he becomes the charismatic leader of his men. And wanting to show the superiority of British methods over Japanese, he and his team choose a new location and agree to finish the bridge on time. Saito accepts though this almost kills him to do so. And the efforts succeeds. There is a fine railway bridge, which Nicholson hopes future users will appreciate--he puts up a plaque saying British soldiers built it; but it's to be used by the enemy in WWII to send troop and ammunition trains through to kill British and American soldiers! So when a demolition team led by a commandeered Shears arrives and Nicholson discovers their goal, he suddenly realizes what he is--a totalitarian aiding an even more barbarous empire than his own, no better than they; so even shot and dying, he cries, ""What have I done"" and detonates explosives planted by the team whose other members have been killed. The final judgment on the entire bridge-building project--symbol of a ""bridge"" from the imperial past to a human future--is spoken by the camp's doctor, James Donald, who calls the entire affair, ""Madness, madness."" (Postmodernism--the ignoring of reality to construct a plausible or enforced alternative--the Japanese ordering Saito to be able to build a railroad using reluctant conscripts on a swift timetable was insane; the Colonel's agreeing to construct it after having opposed the concept of officers working on the project at gunpoint is insane; forcing a realist like Shears to die at gunpoint to have to prevent its building which he knew was a wrong project for either of the empires' representatives is insane. As the US soldier, William Holden is quite good. Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Haykawa as Saito are both award caliber, as is James Donald, the lone British realist, a doctor whose men are urged from hospital to labor at completing a bridge whose name should have been ""treason to humans' values"". Others in the large cast include Heather Sears, Percy Herbert, Jack Hawkins, Andre Morell, Geoffrey Horne, Peter Williams and many others. David Lean directed very artfully from a script by Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, developed from Pierre Boulle's French-language novel. Jack Hildyard's cinematography, Malcom Arnold's music (except for ""The Colonel Bogey"" March) used in several places, art direction by Donald M. Ashton all are first-rate. If as some note this is bad history,no one has problems following its points of view; given its modest and ironic source, author Boulle's distrust of human civilization in totalitarian hands (he also wrote ""Planet of the Apes""), the most admirable feature of the film is how much was made out of a sketchy narrative basis"
"ggh6","Null","2","4","16 October 2001"," Despite flaws, a brilliant technical and artistic achievment
","""Bridge on the River Kwai"" is many things, both good and less so: a powerful study of the way war drives men to madness; a false document that ignores some of the more unpleasant facts about the use of slave labor in the far east during WWII;  a showcase for at least two of the finest performances ever set to film (Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa); a borderline racist tract that reduces whole cultures to caricature; a masterclass in cinematography and the use of ambient sound to convey mood, and for better or for worse, a blueprint for the modern tendency to emphasize dazzling style and epic scope in mainstream films.<br/><br/>Using the construction of the infamous WWII Burma railway as a backdrop, ""Kwai"" mainly concerns the clash of wills between two stubborn failures: Col. Saito (Hawakawa), a Japanese prison camp commander who is trying to get a crude wooden bridge built, without notable success; and Col. Nicholson (Guinness), a British officer who, we learn, was supposedly ordered to turn his troops over to the Japanese and now must watch as they are gradually worked and starved to death.  Proceeding from a fundamental misunderstanding of each other's cultures, they immediately clash over the absurdly trivial issue of whether Nicholson's eight or so officers will work alongside the enlisted ranks.  Each obviously has little to hold onto except their authority over the ragged prisoners, and each refuses to back down.  ""I could have you shot!"" bawls Saito, and indeed, in real life he would probably have done so.  Instead, he gradually becomes aware that the British officer actually is willing to help construct the bridge, as long as it is on his own terms.  With with the deadline for completion fast approaching, Saito finds himself granting more and more authority to Nicholson, despite the almost unbearable loss of face this represents.  Meanwhile, Nicholson becomes caught up in the chance to finally demonstrate just how competent an officer he really is, even though his efforts to complete (and even improve!) the bridge amount to collaboration with the enemy.<br/><br/>Observing from the sidelines is a sole American, the lazy, sardonic 'Commander' Shears (William Holden), one of the few survivors of an earlier group of prisoners.  Not liking his future chances with two madmen in command, he makes his escape, not without difficulty, only to find himself dragged back into a harebrained commando raid (led by Jack Hawkins' gentleman/adventurer) to destroy the bridge before it can be used.<br/><br/>Despite the highly 'realistic' presentation, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of the period and location.  Nevertheless, Lean's brilliant use of image and sound, and the mostly excellent performances, make this a truly essential film.  Be sure to see it on DVD, or better yet, on a full-sized movie screen, where the wide-screen compositions can be appreciated."

","I have trouble just trying to describe David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" in less than five words to summerise my review.

Although I loved the film's dynamic climax, I also liked the psychological battle of wills that Nicholson and Saito (Sessue Hawkaya), the camp's leader have.  James Donald, who portrays Major Clipton, the medical officer, says that unforgettable line at the end - "" Madness...Madness""<br/><br/>The performances here are definitely memorable ones, Guinness and Holden most notably.  I can't forget to mention the film's lavish photography (Jack Hildyard) of the jungle and Malcolm Arnold's clever musical score which includes the famous whistling WWI song ""The Colonel Bogey March"".  There's a strange fact that since the movie's two screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were ""blacklisted"".  Boule, who didn't speak a word in English, received credit for the script."

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a very good film, if not particularly accurate historically. The story as told is brilliant and the characters, bar one, are consistently fine representations of those brave men who found themselves in terrible circumstances in the war.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness and his Japanese counterpart, the doctor, Jack Hawkins and many more are superb throughout. However, and very sadly, William Holden's character is completely misplaced and is often simply ludicrous. As the apparently cynical token American, presumably brought in simply to appeal to US audiences, his shenanigans are implausible. As the super fit resident of the camp hospital, he hardly looks like a put upon prisoner of a Japanese labour camp. When he escapes, his principal occupation seems to be chasing young women around, something that has absolutely no relevance to the film. In fact, his character serves very little purpose in this respect.<br/><br/>But wait ! Of a sudden, the womanising, skiving layabout is transformed into a killing machine. Conscripted into Jack Hawkins commando group, he takes control when Hawkins is injured and magically becomes a hero, leading the final assault on the bridge. Again, I presume this was a sop to American interests who always seem to need their boys to be saving the world to the exclusion of all others. One Yank in the film and he has to be the hero - what a joke. There is no reason at all why his part couldn't have been played far more realistically by almost anyone else and without the silly womanising element.<br/><br/>Without Holden's stupid character, this film is a 10 all day long. With his inconsistent, ridiculously implausible and completely out of place character, it's reduced to an 8."

","My view is that this is Director David Lean's finest film (just above BRIEF ENCOUNTER, OLIVER TWIST, HOBSON'S CHOICE, IN WHICH WE SERVE and GREAT EXPECTATIONS) and, albeit less famous, spectacular and beautiful than LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, it is a more self-contained and perceptive film, in regard to human emotions and pitfalls.<br/><br/>I am astounded that some viewers criticize BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI as historically inaccurate. The film lays no claim that it is based on a true story, let alone that it is historically accurate, so the historical aspect has no bearing whatsoever on the film's quality, and should not be used as an interpretation tool.<br/><br/>THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is an anti-war film that presents a situation that could happen with any army in the world in a war situation - history has zip to do with it.<br/><br/>There is much to learn from it, notably that following principles to a T does not pre-empt the emergence of contradictory situations, such as when Colonel Nicholson (sublimely played by Alec Guinness), who had refused on principle to have his officers work 'like coolies,' ultimately is quite ready to let those same officers do manual work, and he even encourages men in the sick bay to help build a bridge for the enemy - which, as the medic understatedly played by James Donald points out, could be misconstrued as treason.<br/><br/>THAT is the contradiction at the heart of this sublime film, that will stay like a thorn in the flesh until Col. Nicholson realizes that his dream of a bridge that could last 600 years, like London Bridge, and the British Army remembered for its construction, is as fallible as all dreams inevitably are.<br/><br/>Guinness deservedly picked up the Best Actor academy award for his role as Col. Nicholson, who stubbornly wants to maintain conventional and civilized values in the jungle and in the face of an enemy of a different and opposing culture, embodied by the Japanese camp commander, brilliantly played by Sessue Hayakawa.<br/><br/>Holden acts as a kind of comic relief, an American caught in the middle of British POWs in Burma, and his role is reminiscent of the one which won him an Oscar in STALAG 17, where he acted as the in-between fellow who managed to bribe the guards and get the goodies, but who has enough decency in him to earn the viewer's sympathy.<br/><br/>Jack Hawkins is superlative as the British commander who leads the operation to destroy the bridge on the River Kwai. He is the very embodiment of the stiff upper lip British officer with touches of sardonic humor and complete professionalism.<br/><br/>And, finally, James Donald, as the medic with the bird's eye view (an eagle is seen flying over the forest some 3 or 4 times during the film), who sees all with detachment and concludes that war is madness. His is a minor but crucial role, and he delivers with great aplomb.<br/><br/>Photography, action sequences, script, and soundtrack are all of the highest quality. THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites and I rate it the greatest anti-war war movie ever made. 10/10"

","There are many Second World War films that will definitely stand the tests of time and be looked at as - almost - 'historical' representations of the events that transpired. I'm not entirely sure that 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' will be one of those, as it's far too 'niche' to maintain its popularity, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad film. For a start, if you're looking for huge 'Saving Private Ryan' style battles involving the heroic Allies blasting their way through legions of German troops, you'll be very disappointed here. With the exception of a couple of brief shoot-outs and the odd knife to the back, there's little in the way of action here.<br/><br/>It's about an unfortunate bunch of British (mainly) prisoners of war who are incarcerated in a Japanese POW camp. There, they're forced to help build a bridge (over the river Kwai, believe it or not!) in order to aid the Japanese war effort. You may think that a WWII film based around a POW camp would mean that our plucky Brits would spend their time and efforts devising new and ingenious ways to tunnel their way out of there. Not here. The camp doesn't even have any fences due to it being on an island, therefore there's nowhere really to escape if they tried. <br/><br/>Instead, the story predominantly focuses on two character - one is the Japanese warden who runs the facility and the other is the British officer 'in charge' of the captive prisoners (there's also a sub-plot regarding how the rest of the Allied war effort perceives the camp and what they're doing about it, but that's secondary to the one-on-one between the two leads in my opinion).<br/><br/>Now, I wouldn't go as far as saying you'd be able to 'identify' with the Japanese guard, but you will definitely get to know him and his motivations and, dare I say it, his character even develops as the film progresses. However, the most interesting character is his British opposite, played by none other than (the original) Obi-wan Kenobi himself, Sir Alec Guinness. He's a man in charge of both keeping his soldiers' morale up, but also the 'good name' of the British army/Empire. He'll go to almost any lengths to ensure that neither are brought down in reputation in any way. And, his choices lead to some interesting outcomes which I won't go into in great details here.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for an outright war film, you won't really find it here. Instead, you'll get (quite a long) character study about stubborn madness, maybe even a little 'Stockholm Syndrome' and - what I perceived as - a variation on the 'Captain Ahab and his whale' type story. Alternatively, if you're just looking to see what old Ben Kenobi looked like without a lightsabre, you'll find that here, too."

The bridge was giving a wooden performance. There is nothing that ruins a film more than a wooden performance. I'm sorry but its true. Take the Godfather for instance, part I and part II sucked. Totally sucked. There is no way around it. But part III was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Part III had everything you could ask for and more. Except one fatal flaw. Francis ford Coppola casted a wooden performer. His own Daughter! What was he thinking! She completely ruined the movie! As does any wooden performer.<br/><br/>David Lean has done the same thing here with this bridge. I haven't seen a more wooden performance since Geppetto gave birth to Pinocchio! However that wooden performance mellowed out half way through. Unfortunately there was nothing mellow about this film. If anything the bridge got more wooden as the film wore on. In fact once it started sharing scenes with Obi One the bridge looked more wooden than ever! He really nailed the scenes. Brought out the wood in the bridge and vice versa. Which is often the case when you have two bad performers sharing a scene.<br/><br/>The ending was also terrible. Besides the wooden performers the film really had a bad ending. It was like watching the phantom of the opera or something Chaplin directed. The final scene is just absurd.

First, we have Alec Guinness who would rather suffocate in a small, hot room than allow his officers to build a bridge. when finally released and realizes the bridge won't be finished in time for the enemy's use, he allows his officers to work on it and even the men that are wounded to work on it.<br/><br/>THen... at the end of the film, he shows the enemy that there is a bomb under the bridge and almost messes up the entire thing.<br/><br/>What officer in the US army would do this? Doesn't make much sense to me. The film had its moments but one of the all-time best? no."

","I expected more from that so-much lauded classic with so many great actors as main stars. Yeah, I watched it with all my patience and was a bit shocked - so? and that is that? Is that it? Is that the classic of cinema that so many people praised so much? I say, this is terribly long, very boring, very slow and rather tepid. And yeah, lukewarm. It did not hold well and left a very mixed impression. Yes, a great job was done and the final blow-up is a must-see. But then, there are so many buts and ifs. I was appalled by a slow tempo and very boring dialogs. My advice - yes, you can try and watch this one, but with a certain grain of salt, as not so many old films stood the test of time and preserve the fidelity and decency of other works.

"jboothmillard","9","4","13","6 June 2006"," The Bridge on the River Kwai
","From Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated director David Lean (Brief Encounter, Great Expectations, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago), the leading British actor and the ending are what most people remember best about this film, I'm glad I got a proper opinion on it watching it again. Basically, set during World War II, British POWs (Prisoners of War) have arrived at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. Commander of the camp, Colonel Saito (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sessue Hayakawa) informs all prisoners that, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sir Alec Guinness) informs Saito that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind. Nicholson also forbids anyone from attempting to escape as survival in the surrounding jungles and other areas is considered unlikely. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. British medical officer Major Clipton (James Donald) warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder. Saito punishes all the officers by forcing them to stand all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box. Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two of them are shot dead, but United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Shears (William Holden) manages to get away, although he is wounded. He wanders half-dead into a Siamese village, where he is nursed back to health before completing his escape downstream and eventually to the British colony of Ceylon. Meanwhile, the prisoners start work on the bridge, but do as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Saito has a deadline to meet and would be obliged to commit ritual suicide if it is not completed. Desperate, Saito finds an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour. After recovering, Nicholson inspects the work of the men, and is shocked by the poor job they have done. It is also clear the Japanese engineers have chosen a poor site, a part of the river with an unsteady bottomless surface. Nicholson believes they can do a much more professional job and is sure the bridge will later be used to transport troops and medical supplies. Despite protests from some of the men, the original construction is abandoned, and they begin to build a new bridge further downstream. Meanwhile, Shears is enjoying his stay in the hospital in Ceylon, when British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it can be used by Japanese forces. Shears is so appalled he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy want him to join them to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears ""volunteers"". Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. He believes the construction is maintaining morale, and the completion of the bridge will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the British Army long after the war's end. The Japanese officers pitch in as well. Nicholson erects a sign commemorating the bridge's construction by the British Army. The commandos parachute in, one is killed, but Warden, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) reach the River Kwai in time with the assistance of Siamese women and their village chief, Khun Yai (M.R.B. Chakrabandhu). During the night, while the British and Japanese officers celebrate the completion of the bridge, Shears and Joyce plant explosives beneath the bridge under the water line. A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, Warden waits to destroy both. However, the next morning, the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. Nicholson and Saito hurry down to the riverbank to investigate as the train approaches. Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is shot by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but he shot himself. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson comes to his sense and exclaims, ""What have I done?"" As Nicholson runs towards the detonator, Warden fires a mortar, wounding the colonel. The dazed and wounded Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator, he dies and collapses on the plunger, just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head and says, ""Madness! ... Madness!"" Also starring André Morell as Colonel Green, Peter Williams as Captain Reeves, John Boxer as Major Hughes and Percy Herbert as Grogan. Guinness absolutely stands out with his superb performance as the very English, dignified, and patriotic colonel, Hayakawa is also memorable as the Japanese commander, and Lean deserved the Oscar for his direction. It is an interesting story, it has splendid locations and scenery, it is well written and well-acted, and the conclusion is one of the most iconic sequences in film, it is a little long, at 2 hours 40 minutes, but a fantastic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Music Score for Malcolm Arnold, it won the BAFTAs for Best British Film, Best Film from any Source, and Best British Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Sir Alec Guinness was number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 11 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 33 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest War Films.

"trochesset","5","3","9","26 May 2007"," No Classic
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I've heard some people call it boring, and they were railed on for being young and stupid- always a nice way to show you are an adult, attacking a young film-lovers age. As for my self, I don't know if I would call it boring, it did hold my attention, I did not fall asleep, even though I only slept 3 or 4 hours the night before, but I do think that the film is a failure on many fronts. I would rate it a 6 out of 10, and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>First the film is slow, one of the very slowest films of that I have ever seen. There is no pacing, it never picks up at all, except at the end where it goes into second gear. The film is slow in every aspect, from the pacing to the camera movements and worst of all, is that this only hurts the film in times when it is supposed to be a moment of reflection in the movie- like Nicholson's speech on the bridge- but you hardly notice because it just continues the same pace as the rest of the movie. The action does pick up at the very, very end; but still not even at a level that John Ford would move at. Its just slow, and for no real reason. So much time is wasted in this film on nothing, and there is never any anticipation, except at the very very end, and it does not have nearly as dramatic an effect as it could have. <br/><br/>Secondly, in this movie, that runs at close to 3 hours, there are only 4 real characters in the movie. Nicholson, who only develops enough to come to a point where he wonders about his legacy. Saeto who becomes softer, though still undoubtedly a bad man. Shears, who becomes less of a whiner, and almost courageous at the end-at least enough to get himself killed. And of course Wardon, whose only change is physical-he'll probably end up losing his foot.<br/><br/>Not that a movie must have characters who grow to make it a good film, but if it doesn't have that than it better have other things. The photography was outstanding, but I am sorry to say that there was no cinematography in this film. The camera seemed like it never moved, and there seemed to be less than five tracking shots in the whole picture. I can watch this with Ozu, but not in an adventure/epic. Though I understand that the colors have become drained over time, I didn't see much there other than green, so I can't imagine the film being all that lush even on opening night, 1957.<br/><br/>It is plain to see that Lean did learn a few things from this film, and put those lessons to good use in the much better ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It still is a very long movie, with only one real character, whose development is rather vague, but at least it is sumptuous and colorful, and the supporting cast has personality and more talent. And LoA had action to pick the movie up a bit, though neither film contained much humor.<br/><br/>I must say that I haven't been this disappointed in a film in a long while. ""The Bridge on the Rived Kwai"" is a film that never once moved me in any real or even 'artificial' way. I never felt anything...oh except for the end, when something perhaps could have been resolved, but all we get is Nicholson Accidentally fainting and falling on the plunger. What kind of ending is that? The main character doesn't make a decision to blow the bridge or not, NO, he is given a pass, a scape goat and it is an accident, maybe if he would have blown it up or NOT the audience would have been forced to feel something-David Lean obviously did not want that."
"popeman89","6","3","9","10 January 2005"," Unclear messages spoil an film that looks brilliant
","When watching this, I found that the messages and subtexts contradicted themselves. For example, when Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) refuses to lose his dignity because of his pride of the British army, he inadvertently helped the Japanese, so his patriotism got in the way of his patriotic duty. So is it wrong for a soldier to be patriotic? But right for them to do their patriotic duty? Another problem with this film the portrayal of the Japanese prisoner of war camp. At times it portrays the Japanese officers as brutal but at other times they are kind and fair to the prisoners. From the way it was portrayed in the film, the British soldiers probably had a better time working on the bridge than fighting in the war and risking their lives. Therefore I see no problem with them helping the Japanese even thought they are supposed to be the enemy.<br/><br/>Despite all the contradictions, ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" looks stunning especially considering when it was made and is easy to watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>6/10"

","OK! Lets get it out there right away, for historical facts of the real Bridge on the River Kwai story, one should research elsewhere, this film is a fictionalised account of the said events. Sadly there are those out there who simply refuse to judge this purely as a piece of cinematic art - and cinematic art it is.<br/><br/>A squad of British soldiers are held in a Japanese POW camp in the Burmese jungle. The respective Japanese and British leaders clash but an understanding is finally reached to build a bridge across the River Kwai. The importance of which could prove crucial in more ways than one...<br/><br/>It won 7 Academy Awards and 4 BAFTAS, and it was the film that saw the great David Lean enter his epic period. And what a start it is. Kwai is a masterful piece of cinema, it has a magnificently intelligent and complex screenplay - with tough edged dialogue in the script, is bursting at the seams with high quality performances, and beautifully photographed (filmed in Ceylon). Thematically it's about the folly and psychological madness of war, which in turn is ensconced in sub - plots of genuine worth. It all builds to a tremendous finale, where everything we have witnessed is realised with a deftness of talent from across the board. 10/10"
"BeneCumb","7","2","5","26 October 2013"," Definitely great then, but slightly timeworn now
","This large-scale and realistic film was just a decade after the World War II had ended, without much technology assisting in creating credible atmosphere and effects. Even colour films were not so common... As the Brits had maintained more or less normal relations with their former colony Ceylon, they were able to film there, using lots of mass scenes and manual labour.<br/><br/>The idea behind is intriguing, and after a certain escape, the film consists of two parallel set of events intertwined in the end. However, many scenes are depicted too lengthily, bringing along temporary uneven pace and and diminishing excitement (or current viewers have just become too impatient...) As for the cast, only Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito were catchy to me, I can't remember the others from other films, for example. Well, Guinness was awarded his only Oscar for the role (great, but lengthwise not a real leading one)... All in all, the film received 7 Academy Awards, showing that the opportunities of that period were used in a maximum way. I could particularly point out the directing and the music, with many songs becoming hits afterwards. A real pleasant supporting actor is the nature, forming a contrast to construction activities and prison camps (however, life of Japanese POWs was not as harsh as of German or Soviet ones).<br/><br/>Thus, The Bridge on the River Kwai is undoubtedly a great war film, but I am not sure it ""accosts"" modern viewers with Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and Clint Eastwood in mind..."
"laursene","9","2","5","15 January 2010"," Fascinating, bizarro variation on Grand Illusion
","Whatever liberties the filmmakers took with the actual incident, it seems they were also inspired by a desire to critique - and not pay tribute to - Renoir's classic prison-camp drama. The elements of Grand Illusion are all here: two tradition-bound officers gradually forming a bond of mutual respect; a somewhat earthier group of prisoners bent on escape; one of the officers (SPOILER) ultimately sacrificing himself for the cause he put on a uniform to serve; and the close-up view of the pecking order and odd arrangements between the prisoners and their guards.<br/><br/>There's even a cabaret performed by the prisoners, some of them in drag, much like the one staged in Grand Illusion. (In Bridge, of course, the prisoners cap it by singing God Save the King rather than La Marseillaise, of course.) But what Lean and his screenwriters do with the material is quite different. The bridge itself is a giant folly, and whether it's the prisoners or their captors who are the biggest fools is debatable. Different characters on several occasions refer to the Japanese and British commanders - either one or both - as insane. Guinness's sacrifice at the end is accidental, almost farcical; Hayakawa, the Japanese commander, is clearly prepared to kill himself if anything goes wrong. No one comes off well. Even Jack Hawkins, the commando leader, (SPOILER) leaves the scene in disgrace at the end, having shot two of his men for fear they would be captured and talk.<br/><br/>The last words we hear, from the medical officer who all along has been a sort of moral center of the story, are ""Madness! Madness!"" It's unclear, deliberately so, whether he's referring to something specific, or the whole episode: the bridge, the commando raid, the war itself. An unbelievably bleak ending for a '50s WWII pic, only rivaled by Robert Aldrich's Attack! What Lean has done is drain the romanticism and hopefulness out of Renoir's story, and the gallantry out the prisoner-of-war genre that was already quite familiar by the time Bridge came out. The reason it works is that the filmmakers pitch their story so perfectly. None of the characters is ever condescended to, even Guinness's officer, who is clearly quite brave and wins a victory over his captors early on. If there's madness here, we have to detect it in the general situation as it develops, not in anything specific the characters do.<br/><br/>This was the beginning of Lean's career directing blockbusters; over the years, he became the Great White Explorer of the film world, each of his films a bit more romantically overwrought than the last. But that process hadn't started yet when he made Bridge. As to the cast, the only clinker is Holden, clearly injected to appeal to American audiences but given little more to do than utter cynical zingers and show off his bare chest. Guinness is perfect, always keeping his character just the right side of Col. Blimp parody. Hayakawa does the same, matching him note for note.<br/><br/>Bridge was a huge hit, and it makes sense. It's one of those films that subverts a genre while delivering all the emotional and visceral thrills people love in such stories. The back-and-forth transitions between the POW work camp and the preparation and execution of the commando operation are beautiful, building exquisite tension. The let-down - the ""What was it all for?"" moment - only kicks in right at the end, as it should. ""A first-rate job"" indeed."

Which is ironic since, ""There is no barbed wire. No stockade. No watchtower."" Yet there is a sense of seclusion. The thought of escape is so impossible that Colonel Nicholson has no other choice to keep his soldiers occupied by helping out the Japanese by building a bridge that would link an important railway system.<br/><br/>The top notch performances are led by Guiness, Holden, Hawkins, and one of the best supporting performances ever by Hayakawa. The whistle march of the soldiers is something the audience should instantly recognize. And with the budget and the on location setting, it is ever a wonder how this film was made for an estimated 3 million when it would probably cost easily 50 times that today.<br/><br/>David Lean's subsequent 2 films of Lawrence (my #1), and Zhivago (my #90) make this probably the greatest triad of films a director has ever made."
"Aidan McGuinness","8","2","5","4 February 2002"," Rather excellent - well deserved place in the Top 50
","I caught this movie over the Christmas period and am very glad that I did - it's actually very good and I'd firmly recommend it. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" has a nice and simple plot - British POWs, caught in Japan in WWII are forced to build a bridge (over the Kwai river) while one escaped member brings back information about the plans of the bridge. The film doesn't rush itself to tell its story clocking in - as it does - at 161 minutes. It instead takes a nice, leisurely but never boring pace.<br/><br/>The acting here is excellent. It's quite unsurprising to see that Alec Guinness earned himself an Oscar for his portrayal of Colonel Nicholson. It's a show of great writing and acting that this character - who initially seems overly stubborn grows in the viewer's eyes to become a man whom we have an enormous amount of respect. The dynamic relationship with his captor Saito (Sessue Hayawka - who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) is brilliant and both characters have a dimension sorely lacking in many movies. The rest of the cast - including the contingent sent to destroy the bridge - similarly are fleshed out ably by a terrific script adapted from Pierre Boulle's book.<br/><br/>David Lean directed ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and his ability to do epics can be seen firmly in this earlier work. The eponymous bridge is beautifully framed throughout the movie and - it being a real bridge - we're always convinced of the sheer size of the task involved, which is highly important since the movie revolves around the various character's reactions to the bridge (and the natural metaphors that arise from a bridge). Everything looks beautiful and crisp - from the jungle to the camp to the whole Kwai river and naturally Lean easily deserved the Oscar for Best Director for his work here.<br/><br/>The film throughout moved fluidly along right up to the sharp, hard hitting ending. There is a great tale in this movie and - for once - something to think about. Everything about the production is polished and it's no wonder it got itself Best Picture at the Oscar ceremony. Firmly one to recommend I'd pitch it at - for myself - a well above average 8.5/10"

While I did find it to take some time before it really got going, there were more than enough great moments to keep me watching with enthusiasm throughout.  Everything about this film is first-rate, and there is no question that it deserved the armload of Oscars that it won over four decades ago.  Now, I'm not going to say that it's one of the greatest films that I've ever seen, but I did feel that it was a very good film, and considering how I usually regard films made from this era, that is VERY high praise."
"BoomquifaSchartzmugel","10","1","2","31 July 2019"," Top ten films of all time material, maybe top five.
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is as great a film as any, a lifelong rewatch movie, an epic well performed, across the board: there is no bad acting in it, I suppose, in all categories, it's as flawless a production as they come. It's among those movies that, if you've not seen it, your film arts education is incomplete and lacking, at a basic level. Nothing much more needs be said. Just watch it, or suffer deprivation.<br/><br/>I would only like to add a few comments on one matter, what is a miscarriage of justice. Though it's easy to see how the Oscar award was a tough choice, I have seen this movie many times. It would be obtuse to state Alec Guinness didn't deserve Best Actor, for anything lacking in his performance, but it was Sessue Hayakawa that delivered something extraordinary. From what I've always seen, this sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb. I'm not sure I could think of a more powerfully performed, and convincingly so, complicated scene, in any film, than the night scene, where Sessue Hayakawa, playing the camp commander, Colonel Saito, brings Alec Guinness, Colonel Nicholson, to his office, on the sly, to try and reason with him, from a Japanese perspective, really to save face. To avoid spoilers, let's just say you can feel the temperature rising, can see Sessue Hayakawa as if channeling Colonel Saito, like you're a fly on the wall of something really happening in a war documentary. Sessue Hayakawa had every nervous twitch and turn of the voice down, one of the most convincing acting jobs, ever, but Sessue received no Oscar award. He was also as convincing, as his character developed into a different Colonel Saito. Sessue Hayakawa was the Best Actor in this film, and the Academy could, therefore, bite me, except they did have the sense to at least nominate Sessue as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, though he lost that. Come to think of it, on that basis, bite me then, anyway. Sessue rules!<br/><br/>But seriously, a super movie. Films were perhaps at about their best, during those Lean years... alright, alright... I know... don't quit your day job..."

","The Bridge on the River Kwai opens in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Burma in 1943, where a battle of wills rages between camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and newly arrived British colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). Saito insists that Nicholson order his men to build a bridge over the river Kwai, which will be used to transport Japanese munitions. Nicholson refuses, despite all the various ""persuasive"" devices at Saito's disposal. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. Meanwhile, American POW Shears (William Holden), having escaped from the camp, agrees to save himself from a court martial by leading a group of British soldiers back to the camp to destroy Nicholson's bridge. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Filmed in Ceylon, Bridge on the River Kwai won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for the legendary British filmmaker David Lean, and Best Actor for Guinness. It also won Best Screenplay for Pierre Boulle, the author of the novel on which the film was based, even though the actual writers were blacklisted writers Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who were given their Oscars under the table."

","There are two parts of The Bridge on the River Kwai most audiences take away after watching it: the music and the famous scene in the end, which I won't describe for sake of spoilers. In the two-and-a-half hour movie, there's actually a lot more that happens than whistling the ""Colonel Bogey March"" and the ending. This is a pretty tense war movie involving prisoners of war and their quest to break free and continue to fight against the Japanese in WWII. William Holden stars, with Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins as the other main ""good guy"" soldiers, and Sessue Hayakawa as the head of the Japanese POW camp. If you remember Sessue from Three Came Home, you know that he brings a lot of depth to his roles.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness won the Academy Award for Best Actor, even though he wasn't really the lead. He happens to be instrumental in the most memorable scene of the movie, but that has no bearing on the wrong category of his award. He also didn't ""own"" the role as many actors who give award-worthy performances do. Any number of actors could have played his part in this movie and done just as competent a performance; my choice would have been David Niven. He would have owned the role, and he would have actually deserved a nomination, if not a win.<br/><br/>Still, this is a pretty famous movie to come out of the 1950s, so if you like to study cinema from that time period, you'll probably want to watch it. More likely than not, if you've seen a lot of other classic war films, you won't be that impressed by this one."

","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is well over half a century old. Both visuals and sound have been thoroughly restored, so that current electronic prints are quite nice.<br/><br/>It's a ""war film"" ...and it's also an ""anti-war film"" It's about individual characters more than the larger conflict. In both these regards it seems to me most similar to ""Apocalypse Now"" ...except ending with ""Madness, Madness"" rather than ""The Horror, The Horror"".<br/><br/>It's a ripping good yarn. Even though many individual moments and scenes seem ""hokey"" these days, somehow they all add up to something that will hold your attention for hours.<br/><br/>Although it's not an ""epic"", and although it's shot on standard 35mm film, there are already suggestions here of what we'd see in ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Even half a decade earlier, here David Lean showed that he was enamored of shooting on location, shooting huge vistas, and shooting in a very wide format.<br/><br/>I think one of the reasons the film still speaks to us is its considerable ambiguity. Did Nicholson fall accidentally on the plunger, or did he do it intentionally in a last cry of remorse? Did Saito intend the knife for a possible but unlikely ritual suicide, a certain ritual suicide, or to kill Nicholson once he'd fully served his purpose? Did Warden throw his weapon in a temporary fit of frustration, or as the first sign of a permanent decision to have nothing more to do with war? Did the women express revulsion at the deaths of men they were fond of, or at the realization of just how violent war was? ...and many more.<br/><br/>The film was adapted from a book, except with the ambiguity ramped up, a character added, and different subplots emphasized. The book in turn was _loosely_ based on some real events the French author had no first hand involvement in (and may have even wanted to portray the British in a poor light).<br/><br/>There are many things that one may accept in the moment, but that after a bit of reflection can't possibly be real: Temporary reassignment of a soldier to the army of a different country - A British medic running his own hospital with no supervision, having his own building, and making his own independent decisions about who could work and who could not - The Japanese not having sufficient engineering talent to design and build a permanent bridge - Prisoners often allowed to whistle a tune that was very derogatory to the Axis - Inmates in a Japanese prison camp appearing in good health, with good uniforms, and at normal weight - Inmates in a Japanese prison camp arranging their own entertainment ceremonies - Nicholson staying alive in an unventilated corrugated steel box in full sun in that torrid climate for many days - The Japanese commandant giving in to the British prisoner officer without any advance agreement on getting something in return - The very first detent between jailers and prisoners being in a lengthy joint meeting around a conference table, and with the prisoners controlling the agenda - A soldier with serious doubts about killing being selected as part of an elite commando unit - A sailor suddenly knowing how to handle a gun and how to be a commando - and more.<br/><br/>In fact there are so many such departures from reality I can't imagine how anyone could possibly think this film is in any way trying to pass itself off as portraying historical events. To me, it's very obviously more of an imagined morality play than a portrayal of actual events. Nevertheless there have been public questions about its historical accuracy right from the beginning. Despite its adaptation from a book, which was in turn loosely inspired by some poorly reported events, some of the characters in the film could be identified with real individuals. And some of those people were still alive. And some of them complained noisily."

","Okay, my summary is aimed at some of the, quite frankly) ridiculous poor reviews of this movie and in particular the reasons given as to why they have rated this movie so poorly, some of them are quite simply, anti British, one idiot even has a go at it's historical inaccuracies, this by a reviewer from America which has produced more historically inaccurate WW2 films than I can shake a stick at. Oh and the reviewer who said it was the worst film they had ever seen (there is always one) they must have seen a grand total of two in their lifetime, this and Raging Bull and tbh, this is better than Raging Bull in my opinion, some will agree with my view others won't, that's life, but, few will agree with that particular reviewer that this is the worst film ever.<br/><br/>This is a marvellous movie that won it's Oscars justifiably, Alec Guinness is unsurpassable as Nicholson, William Holden is pretty darn good as Shears and Sessue Hayakawa is excellent, if at time illegible as Saito. Not enough credit is given to James Donald as Clipton, who is almost the only voice of sanity among the main protagonists and there is a fabulous supporting cast of British character actors to boot. <br/><br/>My only quibble, and David Lean's too, was the Producer and studio's insistence of having a love interest put in for Shear's character, it was unnecessary and I'm sure if there had been a way to edit it out for VHS/DVD release then Lean may well have done it as it is a pointless distraction. But, at the time a film without a female in it was practically unthinkable, thank god times have changed.<br/><br/>One of the finest War movies, heck no, movies ever made. David Lean rarely put a foot wrong in any of his movies (Ryan's Daughter possibly, but, still a great, but, not fantastic film)"

","David Lean directed this superb, Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film set in a Japanese WWII POW camp for British(and one American) soldiers. Alec Guiness(Academy Award winner for best actor) stars as Col. Nicholson, who is subjected to harsh treatment(the sweat box) by Col. Saito in defiance of his authority, and for the respect he and his men are entitled to. Saito gives in, and Nicholson then proceeds with the original plan to build a railway bridge in the jungle to help the Japanese with their resupplying efforts. William Holden plays the American among them who escapes to freedom, but is persuaded to return with a Major Warden(played by Jack Hawkins) on a mission to destroy the bridge that Nicholson is now determined to complete! Fine war film and character study about personal vs. patriotic motives in war, and how they can both collide and collude... Memorable ending and final quote says it all."
"blazesnakes9","10","1","2","5 November 2013"," David Lean's best work since Lawrence of Arabia
","I've made a list of the top 10 favorite movies that I would to watch over and over again. These 10 movies will forever be near my heart and always influenced me to be a movie director in the future. The Bridge on the River Kwai is definitely one of the top 10 favorite films on my list. Of course, I also enjoyed and love other great movies as well. Other movies included on the my list are: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bullitt, The Terminator, Thief, Lethal Weapon, The Wild Bunch and Alien. The Bridge on the River Kwai is also included. The movie is set in Burma during World War II. The year is 1943, and British POW's are being held up in Japanese war camps. One of those British POW's is Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role in this movie. Nicholson and his fellow men are assigned to build a bridge that will be used for a railway that will go through the Burmese jungle. Meanwhile, another POW, an American, played by William Holden, plans to blow up the bridge and sets off into the jungle to escape from the camp. Eventually, Holden and his recruits are all rounded to destroyed what is being constructed. David Lean is a cinematic master. His work is eye-popping and very vivid to look at. However, he is not one of my favorite directors. But, what I like about this movie is the way he tells the story. Some people may called it a war movie. But, others, like myself, would say that this movie is both a war movie, but most importantly, a war movie about individuals. So many war movies reflect on the pain of war. A lot of them reflect on the horrors of war itself. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie about people. The people in this movie are devoted to be put into a plot that involves having to struggle and survive this snaring scenario. As we watch Bridge on the River Kwai, we are reminded that the two leading characters are different men coming from different backgrounds. One is honorable, but arrogant among his men. The other is not honorable and damaging, perhaps. These two men are stuck in a story where the only thing that stands in their way is a bridge. As a matter of fact, the bridge also plays a significant role in the movie. The bridge is a mark of the Japanese colonel, who assigned Nicholson to build the bridge. The Bridge on the River Kwai won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture. I like it a lot. Much of it is based on the story, direction and characters. I like when movies break new ground with their original stories. It's films like this one that reminds us how much we love movies. David Lean should be proud of making this movie, since it struggled through a troubled production. An excellent movie for the generation of film-makers. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","I thoroughly enjoy this film,though I find it to be a rather odd story.Looking at it realistically,I find it hard to believe that a British commander,or any other commander,would give in to the will of the enemy under any circumstances,but I realize that even films based on true events can never be told 100% accurately,so I have no problem seeing as a great fictionalized account of true events.All the performances were excellent,particularly those of Alec Guiness and Bill Holden.If you are looking for a different type of war story,you have a winner in this one,but I would advise not reading up on how things really happened on The River Kwaiuntil after viewing it.It may make the film a disappointment to you."

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a World War II film. One of those big movie war epics. But epic though it may be this film is not about the massive global conflict. This is a small story, a story really of two men and their war of wills. The fact that these two men are each in their own way quite mad makes for a fascinating story. It's a story with great moments of triumph and bitter moments of despair. It's a story of great bravery in the face of unspeakable brutality. But really, at its heart, it's a story of madness.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a Japanese prison camp in the jungles of Thailand. A large unit of British prisoners proudly and defiantly whistle a famous march as they are brought into the camp. They have no idea what they're in for. Perhaps some of them noticed the graves being dug as they were marched in. That should serve as a hint. This camp is an impossibly terrible place, led by a brutal, seemingly sadistic man in the camp commandant Colonel Saito. The strong-willed Saito will meet his match in the British commanding officer Colonel Nicholson, a man who lives by rules and stands on principle. But Nicholson will immediately find that in this camp there are no rules and there certainly don't seem to be much in the way of principles either. Saito has a job for his new British prisoners. They are to build a bridge over the River Kwai. And the British officers will be forced to perform manual labor alongside their men. Nicholson cannot abide the officers being put to work, it's against the rules. Where does standing up for the rules get Nicholson? Locked inside a small iron box that's where.<br/><br/>And so the war of wills begins. Saito has a bridge to be built and he has a deadline. He will complete this bridge by any means necessary because if he fails he will have no choice but to kill himself. Madness. Meanwhile Nicholson stands on principle which only leads to torture and a seemingly inevitable death for himself and his officers. Madness. From a certain perspective it can be said that Nicholson shows great bravery. But to what end? In playing this brave, principled, somewhat deranged man Alec Guinness turns in an astonishing performance. There is little doubt Guinness is the best thing the film has to offer. And he has a worthy foil in Sessue Hayakawa who plays Saito. Two great actors portraying two stubborn men who are too set in their ways to change. And their stubbornness can only have dire consequences.<br/><br/>The story of the camp and the building of the bridge is fascinating, dramatic and highly charged. Unfortunately there is a parallel storyline which does not work nearly as well. William Holden plays Shears, an American who escapes from the camp early on in the film. As he recovers he clearly enjoys his newfound freedom as he waits to be shipped back home. He's living the good life, including partaking in a romantic dalliance which seems to serve no purpose other than to shoehorn a female character into the film someplace. But Shears, much to his consternation, finds that he's not going home. He's going back to the prison camp along with a team of British commandos who are going to blow up the bridge.<br/><br/>Holden's performance is perfectly fine, as are those of the other actors in this section of the film, but the story of the attempt to blow up the bridge doesn't engage the way the story of the bridge's building does. Time spent away from Nicholson and Saito, Guinness and Hayakawa, is for this movie time not well spent. By this point in the movie we're utterly fascinated with Nicholson and the rather bizarre pride he takes in his men's efforts to build the bridge. His bridge. It's not Saito's bridge anymore which causes the Japanese commander no small sense of shame. The story of Nicholson and Saito, Nicholson mostly, is incredibly compelling. And Guinness is so perfect in his portrayal of this brave but mad man that you really miss his presence when the film veers away from its main storyline to follow the trek of the commando team through the jungle. But at least you know something quite spectacular is bound to occur when the two threads of the plot come together. Madness indeed."

","The ""Siamese Woman"" in the movie actually are members of the Karen Tribe. They are a national minority in Thailand that lives along the Mayanmar(Burma) border as well as in Mayanmar along the Thai border. Karen are a hill tribe that lives mainly along the northern Thai-Mayanmar border. The Karen were promised by the British that in exchange for their help, the British would help the Karen set up an independent state. Sadly, this never happened. Although the Thai/Mayanmar border is somewhat quiet now, every 10-15 years there are attempts by Karen to establish their independent state. This usually results in Karen refugees pouring into Thailand near a town in the north named Mae Sote. This town was also the location of the infamous border crossing in ""Beyond Ragoon""."

Overall, this film provides some good observations between the relationships that the soldiers and those higher in command (on both sides of the war). This is greatly helped through good acting, and the realistic setting puts everything in to perspective. Overall, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a feel-good film about characters and determination.

"andersonenvy","6","2","7","8 February 2006"," Good story, but not for people with short attention spans.
","WIth a great plot and well done performances for its era, TBOTRK is a fantastic view of one of the lesser known sides to WW2, the POWs on the Asian front. It's an exciting and often nail- biting look at life for British POWs building a bridge for the Japanse, and the true meaning of the term ""fog of war"". However, at over 160 min this film is not for people who want a quick fix. The horrific editing of this great film demands a lot of patience from the viewer. For instance, we are forced to watch a 10 minute cut of commandos placing mines on the bridge, a scene which could have easily been cut down to under 1 minute. The movie basically follows this pattern throughout, as long, drawn out scenes are constantly in the way of storyline. This film could have been cut down to under 90 mins and still had the same effect. Poor editing, but a great film if you have the patience."

It works more on a psychological level. I cannot understand the high votes here or all the positive reviews. The sceneries and cinematography were beautiful but I missed all the mentioned elements to get my attention. It was interesting to see Alec Guinness in a soldiers role.

"eric262003","7","1","3","21 May 2018"," Character Film Bogged Down to Anti-War Preachiness
","In the Golden Age of cinema, David Lean was dubbed as the king of epics. One of his more high-prolific entries into that category was the 1957 classic ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". To me the top priority of this movie wasn't emphasized on World War II. The film centres around a strict, but well-defined British officer Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a lesser disciplined American soldier Commander Shears (William Holden) and a tyrant prison officer Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who were placed in a Japanese prison camp where they were forced into labour to build the railway bridge over the River Kwai that connects from Bangkok and Rangoon. While this is done these three individuals try everything to co-exist with one another. You see very little of the war. The abysmal conditions of the prison camp is hard to swallow and cruelty that comes with the package is not for the faint of heart. This is where the best scenes take place, especially those who are into character-driven movies. This is where the performers truly exhibit themselves so that they can get Oscar recognition. And the harsher the conditions the better. Like a blessing in disguise for the viewers.<br/><br/> It's quite astounding that the characters come to life as we are invested in the main three characters (and a few supporting ones) become more fascinating as they develop. I was very pleased that Hayakawa was made into a great character, a lesser made film would've dismissed him into a one dimensional cartoon like villain. Lt. Col. Nicholson is a dedicated officer who's by the book persona gives him that edge of a true leader in his world. He will not budge unless Saito shows more respect towards the Geneva convention in which officers are forbidden to manual labour, in spite of his orders that prisoners in spite of their rank must build this bridge. But when Saito takes the request into consideration or else face ritual suicide, Nicholson goes through great lengths to humiliate the Japanese by upstaging and promoting how great the British Army is buy building a better bridge<br/><br/>In spite of how proud and dedicated he is towards the British Army, Nicholson is far from perfect, in fact his flaws are quite obvious. His role becomes that of the tragic hero in which even the good guys can get their comeuppance. His character blunder comes from the issue he was fighting against ends up taking over his life as his building of the monument becomes all that matters to him and what the purpose at to why this bridge is being constructed.<br/><br/>""Bridge on the River Kwai"" works on various levels in terms of great pace, remarkable characters and well put together plot, there is still a major flaw that holds this movie to being a masterpiece. While doing everything in its power to make this war film not emphasizing too much on the war, the last fifteen minutes ends up becoming all about the war and the preachy cliches there are about how bad war is. If they would've kept up with the human drama, this movie could've been pure gold, not that is was overrated. The political sentiments just takes over in the end and when the final quote, ""Madness, Madness"" comes around after all the chaos has happened, it leaves a sout taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have said that this movie has anti-war written all over the script and that the after effects of the war can cause even the sanest individual traumatized. No disrespect to the reviewers, but that is not the case. Up until the last 15 minutes it was all about men going out of their ways fighting through hard times during very complicated times. The war was used as a decoy to represent the setting of this film. and even if this film has the anti-war theme stamped all over, they should have kept it more hidden than blurted out in the end which was a cop-out to a potentially reasonable ending.<br/><br/>Sure I may be fixated on this flaw too much, but it's because I cared so much bout the movie and director David Lean got lazy and just rushed off the ending too fast making the ending way too inorganic. In spite of this flaw, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a remarkable movie to enjoy and it still holds well as one of the best classic epic films with a great cinematic achievement in character driven movies."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","3","11 March 2017"," What are the limits of pride, madness and opportunism?
","This film is very lightly based on a true story of British prisoners of war who served in the construction of Indo-Chinese railways during World War II. Of course, the film (as well as, perhaps, the book on which it's based) takes a lot of creative liberties and isn't entirely stick to historical truth, which is normally bad but, in this case, is mitigated by the quality of the film itself. In fact, the film seeks to use this incident to portray the madness of war honor: on one hand, we have a Japanese officer who will have to commit suicide if he doesn't complete the bridge in required deadline; on the other side, a daring English colonel who literally wants to take all by the book and demands the military status of the prisoners respected by his captors. Both collide at first but then end up joining forces, in a way that we don't even realize what side the English are because their pride demands that the bridge be ready on time and be very good! Alec Guinness is the most notable actor, with a truly exceptional role and performance, but William Holden and Sessue Hayakawa also deserve applause for the way they stand. There are other actors who have been great but I highlight these by the psychological game of their characters. There is a lot of psychology in this movie and its merit of this trio. Cinematography is also good, with warm light and colors giving us the true feel of the infernal heat of rainforest. Another point I want to highlight is the costumes, especially prisoners. An army of rags. A final word to Colonel Bogey March who, with the film, became one of the most famous military marches in the world."

","THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is a great war drama based on the conflict and ideals. Parodic moments are visible in a fictional story. Nevertheless, I think that this story, which is based on the novel of the same name, is very interesting and sincere. In the second part of the film, the story takes on the characteristics of an adventure thriller.<br/><br/>A large contingent of British prisoners arrives in a Japanese camp. The prisoners have to build a bridge on a river. Two colonels collide and one prisoner manages to escape from the camp. Failing to break the resistance, and facing a fact that the bridge will not be built in a given period, Japanese colonel accepts a proposal of a British colonel (prisoner) that he and his soldiers build the bridge. One of the protagonists considers that bridge must be built perfectly in order to remain an example of the skills and knowledge of British soldiers. However, a special unit was tasked to bring down the newly built bridge...<br/><br/>Conflicts are extremely tense and uncertain in this film. It is difficult to draw a line between the bad guys and the good guys or the winners and losers. Dialogues have been filled with quite a dose of irony and humor. Conflict of the characters is based on discipline, obsession and professionalism. Scenery is a little masterpiece. Mr. Lean has directed a story so powerful and so wise that time in the film simply ""flying"".<br/><br/>Alec Guinness as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson is, to say the least, a split personality. A brave and persistent colonel is transformed into a stupid snob. His character is incredibly interesting. Under the cover of a war hero and a true leader an idiot is hiding. Mr. Guinness has given us one of the best and the most important militaristic portraits in the film.<br/><br/>William Holden as Commander Shears is a soldier who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is resourceful and sarcastic .... and maybe a little romantic. The only protagonist who pays attention to women in this film.<br/><br/>Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito is brutal, stubborn and lazy. I would say, this colonel was incapable for any kind of action and work. This is a parody. That's the point. Jack Hawkins as Major Warden is determined character, who puts war aim ahead of human life.<br/><br/>The last words of one of the protagonists describe this movie the best .... in this case in a positive way of course.

He refuses to let any of the officers do manual labor, so Shears says that Nicholson is a maniac and makes an escape. Then Nicholson says that the Japanese camp commander is mad. When Shears reaches a British base in Ceylon it turns out that he is not an officer. He is just a sailor named Shears impersonating an officer in order to get better treatment. After he escaped he decided to continue playing an officer and was going to say that being lost in the jungle drove him mad. <br/><br/>But the British Force 316, commandos, wanted Shears to lead them back to the POW camp so they could blow up the bridge that the prisoners were building.

"Kubris","9","1","3","28 December 2011"," A beautiful bridge
","IMDb Top 250: 83 I found myself in the possession of three films after Christmas this year: The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago. These are all David Lean films, and so I decided to start my David Lean unit with the first of those films, the 7- Oscar winning ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". And oh my, what a start it was.<br/><br/>'Kwai' is a World War II film made 12 years after the war concluded. The film centers around the titular Bridge, and how British POWs build it under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, and how a small group of Allied commandos try to destroy it. It's a grand idea for a plot, about the conflict of ideas and lack of communication.<br/><br/>The film is loosely broken into three acts. The first act follows Nicholson's standoff with the Japanese commanding officer in the POW camp about the rules of war, and the subsequent building of the bridge under two different leaderships. The second act is about a small group of Allies who venture into the jungle to destroy the bridge, and their encounters in the wild. The final act concludes the story of the two camps in a magnificent way.<br/><br/>An interesting angle of the film is that despite being a war film, there is little violence, and no swearing. All of the action that does happen is necessary, something that has influenced even modern films like 'Drive'. Both plots could have inserted extra action but didn't, and this restraint makes good movies into great movies. The Bridge on the River Kwai is about the people of war as much as their actions.<br/><br/>A product of this decision is that the first act could be considered slow. There is lots of standing, lots of talking, and lots of stubbornness. But by the end a viewer realizes how necessary it is. In 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly', there is an extended sequence where the bad guy forces Clint Eastwood to walk through the desert, and for a while, very little happens. This scene could've been over quicker, but that would have defeated the point that Clint breaks down. That is an idea from 'Kwai'. A month goes by as the leaders verbally, and silently, duke it out with their ideals. The slow first act is necessary to emotionally invest in the scenario, and the film just gets better from there.<br/><br/>My summary of the film is 'a beautiful bridge'. The first half of this statement is beautiful, and it perfectly describes the visual aspect of the film. The cinematography is sublime. Sweeping jungle vistas, fauna, rushing rivers and more make simply seeing 'Kwai' a treat. I was lucky enough to get it on Blu Ray, and for an old film it looks fantastic. The bats in a certain river scene are absolutely breathtaking. You can simulate a lot in Hollywood, but this is an outstanding example of shooting on location in the jungles of what is now Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>But there's more than just looking at the film, the substance is even greater, starting with the actors. They are excellent. Alec Guinness, in his award winning performance, is the British general who we are so conflicted about. His decisions are both completely correct and absolutely wrong. He is an idealist, valuing discipline and honour above his duty as an Allied leader. His decisions beg to ask the question, ""What would you do?"" Nicholson is a layered character performed perfectly.<br/><br/>Colonel Saito is the commander of the Japanese at the camp, and is the primary... antagonist. His stance is portrayed ruthlessly and effectively. He and Nicholson butt heads, but are two sides of the same coin. They have an excellent dynamic, and their relationship is worth studying for its complexity.<br/><br/>Away from the clash of leaders is Shears, an American played by William Holden. In this film where ego reigns supreme, Shears is the realistic, reasonable, and wiseass one. He's the character who says, ""What's the matter with all of you guys?"" He's is well played and has the best line in the film: ""You..."" The casting is just excellent overall.<br/><br/>The second part of my summary is 'bridge'. Despite the obvious reason, 'Kwai' is a bridge between the old era of film and the new. Scenes with lots of talking, like the discussion about escape, are old fashioned, very 50's. But others, like the trek through the jungle and the ending, are far ahead of their time. The stealthy hunt for the Japanese soldier and the whole visual aspect of that scene is certainly influential on another war epic, Apocalypse Now. In general, The Bridge on the River Kwai is ahead of its time.<br/><br/>As I've said, the film gets better and better, culminating in the extraordinary ending. It is one of the best scenes in film and leaves much to discuss. A common statement from the Warden, the explosives-happy commando is to expect the unexpected. The event that makes the last scene unexpected is so obviously a factor but so easily overlooked, you'll gasp. Words to describe the climatic scene include explosive, awesome, shaking, and epic. And then you'll think. What did Warden mean? What did Shears mean? What did Nicholson mean? Did he do what he did on purpose? You can have a great discussion about those actions. And then to end it all, the realistic doctor saying ""Madness! Madness!"" And then zooming out, to admire the jungle... an amazing shot.<br/><br/>'Kwai' is a thinking film. You can wonder how you would do in that situation. The film also touches on the waste of war, honour and pride, and also the role of the young in battle. It's stupendous, a landmark film. 9.4/10"

","British prisoners of war in Burma are employed by the Japanese to build a bridge; meanwhile British agents seek to destroy it. The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.<br/><br/>The Bridge On The River Kwai is an ironic adventure epic with many fine moments but too many centres of interest and an unforgivably confusing climax. It is distinguished by Alec Guinness's portrait of the English Colonel who is heroic in his initial stand against the enemy but finally can not bear to see his bridge blown up: and the physical detail of the production is beyond criticism."
"deltajvliet","9","1","3","12 December 2009"," Creation vs. Destruction
","At its core, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a film about creation and destruction. It alternates between two story lines that start and end in the same place.<br/><br/>One revolves around the efforts of British POW's to build a bridge in the middle of a Thai jungle. Despite their hardships and poor living conditions, these men work diligently on a bridge they hope will stand as a monument to British ingenuity and resourcefulness for generations to come. Essentially, it's their way of inflicting defeat on the enemy, even while in the confines of a POW camp. This subplot represents creation.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a British Special Forces team is assembled with one simple task: to destroy the bridge the POW's are creating. Led by an ex-POW who had escaped the camp, the team manages to plant demolitions and explode the bridge as a train with high priority Japanese targets passes on it. These men are the harbingers of destruction.<br/><br/>What we're ultimately left with, then, are two inherently opposed forces that come head to head in the film. Traditionally, people associate creation with good and destruction with bad. It becomes less clear in a situation like this. Does the long-term vision of the POW's justify temporarily aiding the Japanese war effort? I don't believe so, and in that regard blowing up the bridge was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>So what Bridge on the River Kwai accomplishes is turning traditional preconceptions about destruction upside down. By taking out the bridge and the train on it, the Japanese will be that much closer to surrendering and the war will be that much closer to ending. This will save countless lives and prevent further destruction, so ironically the bridge is blown up in the name of preservation. It's a compelling and fascinating study of the greater good, and that only left me with one lingering question—is preservation not itself a form of creation?<br/><br/>9/10"
"edcar47","Null","1","3","14 July 2009"," Building the bridge vs. laying the track
","My big problem with this movie is simply this: when building a railroad why would you have two separate sets of engineers working independently (one to clear the jungle and lay the track and one to build the bridge to span a river)? And further, assuming that you do have two sets of engineers, should they not be in direct communication with each other so one can inform the other about any difficulties they are having? This would seem to be necessary if in the event that changes have to be made by the bridge builders then the track layers can adjust their calculations and vice versa.(Also, why wasn't the river bed checked for soundness BEFORE the first track was laid?) The entire premise of the movie rests on the idea that the train tracks on both sides of the river are being laid to converge at a very precise point (which is where the bridge has to be) and on a very precise (not too distant) date. When the British CO informs the Japanese CO that the location of the bridge needs to changed the Japanese CO should have complained about the massive delays this would cause in re-routing the track yet he does not. In fact, there is nothing to indicate that the track-layers know about the change in bridge location. Are we to assume the track-layers continued blithely laying track along the old route and yet still connected with the bridge at the new location? Ah, how marvelous is this movie magic!"

","A longtime friend with a shared interest in movies lately asked me to identify films that I appreciate more with age.<br/><br/>You can guess that gave me pause. I could think of only two. Bridge was one. The other appears among my IMDb user comments. I will likely think of and report more with time...<br/><br/>The climax and martial music notwithstanding, as a younger viewer I thought Bridge interminable and Colonel Nicholson a caricature if not a loon outright. Now I feel I know him and some of the other lead characters better.<br/><br/>Both he and Colonel Saito are duty-bound and presumably near the end of their respective service. They are consummate professionals. Yet in my view the true focus of either is not the bridge but each other.<br/><br/>Nicholson either instinctively represses the opportunity or purposely chooses to not want to understand Saito. Either could be for any number of reasons. The film provides no clues beyond an occasional and unsettling crescendo in the musical score. And David Lean knows better than to tell us.<br/><br/>For his part Saito comes to acknowledge and very nearly accept Nicholson, yet remains almost physically incapable of fully understanding him, not out of some cultural gap but with full realization that to do so is to lose face, which in his place is unthinkable.<br/><br/>In the above context the performances of Alec Guinness and Hayakawa Sessue are magnificent, and they converge in the sunset view from the bridge.<br/><br/>Though neither meets Major Warden, they all mirror each other. Warden too is duty-bound. The big difference is that his focus truly is the bridge. He ultimately attains his goal, and almost instantly recognizes what he has lost with that. Though an excellent actor Jack Hawkins never impressed me with a range of expressions...except here.<br/><br/>Shears is the joker in the deck. Self-preservation is his focus, and that's eminently understandable though not necessarily out of sympathy. But at the end of his day he is arguably the most duty-bound of all. The key to the portrayal is William Holden's apparent effortlessness.<br/><br/>Truly a screenful of superlatives, Bridge is not so much a film in which I see something new with each viewing as simply recognize more."
"Vomitron_G","8","1","3","22 May 2009"," Probably the most impressive war movie ever to come out of the 50's
","I am by far not a connoisseur when it comes to war movies. It's not even my favorite genre. But recently I've been catching up with a lot of classics my father likes so much. I had seen THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI before as a little kid, and now revisited it through a bit more experienced eyes. A lot of great reviews are written here on these pages, and maybe this film really comes close to being 10/10 material. But since I haven't really watched that much old war classics, I'm not going to attempt to write an in-depth review and just provide some random impressions in this user-comment instead.<br/><br/>How many times have you seen deleted scenes on a DVD where the director explains it was cut out ""for pacing issues, really""? Well, I'm convinced half of the time they're actually trying to say ""the producers were afraid audiences might find our movie boring if we left too much in it"". A lot of these deleted scenes ""cut out to improve the pacing"" could have easily been left in the film. But last week, I felt quite differently while watching THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The first hour of the movie actually felt too long (mind you, not too slow, but more like certain scenes went on too long and the plot didn't really progress like it should have). We're talking a movie here that runs about 160 minutes and I'm 100% sure if this film would have been made today, they would have cut out more than half an hour of footage from that first half. And not only because films have changed so much over the years and everything has to go fast. At first, the stretched out first half of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. felt like a flaw, but the movie's second half made me reconsider this. The plot shifts focus, and concentrates on an escaped Prisoner Of War, who fled from the camp and becomes part of a team sent back in to go and blow up the bridge. Suddenly, during the part of his recovery at a military hospital, the screenplay injects quite a bit of humor (the conversation between Warden and his superior officers about him not receiving parachute-training was a wonderful highlight) and from then on, when their mission starts, the film gets much more exciting. It made me appreciate the first hour more for the establishing reasons it was used for, and also because - to my surprise - the shifting in tone and pace worked wonders. <br/><br/>There's so much you could go into if you're looking to praise this film. Needless to mention what a fine performance Alec Guinness and other cast members gave, so I'll just point out how impressed I was when I saw the movie's climax. They way the script builds up to it, is one thing. Taking the time to lay out a strategy and incorporating the notion that this whole mission might even go terribly wrong at one point, successfully increases tension during those final scenes. But the fact that the filmmakers completely destroyed a real bridge and a real train...? No use of miniatures or other special effects. Now which movies made today would actually have the courage to show us something like that? Simply none. Those days are over.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have preferred, is having seen the first half of the film injected with a slightly more grim mood, because frankly, that cheerful (and very famous) whistle-tune of the prisoners and some of the fanfare-esquire parts of the musical score got on my nerves a bit. I'll just blame that on the fact that this foremost still is a Hollywood movie. And that's just the way anyone will have to take this film, regardless it was based on (and altered) real facts of war. From a historical point of view, the film might be insufficiently accurate, but it really feels like one of the greatest and most entertaining war-movies ever made."

","HAVING viewed THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (Horizon Pictures/Columbia, 1957) for the first time on the Telly as a 18 year old adolescent, the experience was not nearly as moving or as impressive that it would be some years later. This is due to several diverse, but equally compelling, causes.<br/><br/>FIRST of all, it was on Network TV, the American Broadcasting Company Television to be precise. The year was 1966, long before we would have referred to a Movie as 'Film'. Just about every one who had to be content with viewing the edited and commercially interrupted movie on the B & W Admiral, Zenith or Motorola that sat in the 'Fron Troom' (Chicago-ese word for Living Room; see also 'Front Room').<br/><br/>BEING so emotionally battered and culturally & economically deprived; one has to wonder how we ever made it through those dark days. (Ya know Schultz, we shoulda rioted!) <br/><br/>ALTHOUGH we paid little attention then to Directors, Producers and so forth, we did notice that it was from Columbia, the Stooges Home Studio. We made no connection between the KWAI Project and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (Horizon Pictures/Columbia, 1962) which claimed most of the same production team, including director, Sir David Lean.<br/><br/>ADDING to this disjointed view of their Cinematic Family Tree was the order in which the two were viewed; the latter film, LAWRENCE, was seen by our gang at the Highland Theatre, near 79th & Ashland Avenue, right here on Chicago's South Side, the ""baddest part of town."" This gave us a convoluted view of the two films time, not the period they were portraying, but rather of the real time of production and release.<br/><br/>NOW THEN, after many years of experience and 'wisdom building', we can state with a great deal of certainty that we can see the relationship of the two, make note of certain similarities in directorial style and overall impact.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH the settings of the two are similar, in that both tell their stories of Warfare in Asia; one (BRIDGE) is a story of a World War II incident (based in fact) set in the Equatorial Rain Forests of Thailand; the other (LAWENCE) being a World War I Biopic taking place in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. The modern countries involved would be Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.<br/><br/>IT is obvious that Sir David is fond of War themes that are meticulously rendered and tendered to the screen in a matter-of-fact manner. Lean gives no simplistic characterizations of these World Conflicts and takes no sophomoric stands against the actions taken by the Soldier in the field; those being represented by the Pawn on the Chess board.<br/><br/>David LEAN has shown a propensity for working with certain actors in his products; a tendency shared with names such as: Hitchcock, Ford, Capra and many others. Shared and admired talents seem to be a good recipe for success. But there is one screen personality that gets no credits in the cast; yet appears to be one of those that David uses again and again with great success. That would be the great outdoors.<br/><br/>WHILE concentrating the action of the story in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is centered on the interaction, conflict, alliance and eventual mutual respect of Japanese Colonel Saito, Commandant of the Prisoner of War Forced Labor Camp (Mr. Sessile Hayakawa) with the Ranking Allied P.O.W., the British Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guinness). The dynamics of the groups, both Captors and Captives, are determined by the conduct and integrity displayed by their respective Cox's. (That's ""Commanding Officers"" to you, Schultz) <br/><br/>THE COLLISION of not only personalities, but also that of Cultures, provides the motivational engine that moves the story along at a seemingly short 161 minutes running time. We are witness to the Hard Liner Saito and the Proper & BY-the-Book Nicholson being locked in a stalemate of both will and style; with the edge going to Nicholson; Saito being at the disadvantage of needing the aid and cooperation of the Brits in doing his assigned task of completing the construction of the Bridge within a certain period. As Saito explains to Nicholson, he (the Japanese Officer) would be expected to take his own life if he weren't successful.<br/><br/>THE SITUATIONS and their resulting outcomes are fine examples of two widely divergent psychological principalities; the first being that of ""Saving Face"", the other called ""The Stockholm Syndrome."" <br/><br/>IN THE FIRST case, Colonel Saito has taken extreme measures in order to convince ranking Allied Officer, Colonel Nicholson to allow his officers to perform manual labor, in violation of the Articles of the Geneva Convention. After a lengthy stay in the metal ""Sweat BOX"", the British Officer is taken to the Commandant's hut and told that "".in honor of our (The Japanese) anniversary of victory in Asia, we will not require your officers to perform labor."" This is a perfect example of ""Saving Face"" on Saito's part.<br/><br/>SECONDLY, the very intense Colonel Nicholson gets so caught up in constructing a fine bridge, that he loses sight of the reality of which side he is on and finds himself working against the demolition of the wooden structure by Allied Forces; being Jack Hawkins, William Holden and four Thai Women Guides! (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) This is classic ""Stockholm Syndrome"".<br/><br/>DIRECTOR LEAN is not above reusing a plot gimmick. Much in the same manner that Michael Curtiz reprised the gimmick of having contending groups singing opposing songs as in DODGE CITY (Warner Brothers,1939) with ""Marching Through Georgia"" vs. ""Dixie"", to CASABLANCA (Warners, 1942) pitting ""Watch On The Rhine"" (German) vs. ""Les Marseilles"" (French). Sir David uses not song, but rather in the use of spontaneous outbreaks of mass cheering and congratulations by the enlisted men in both THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.(Four Stars)<br/><br/>POODLE SCHNITZ!!"

","David Lean began the strongest stretch of his career with this fantastic anti-war film based on a novel about a group of British POW soldiers commissioned to build a bridge for the Japanese army. Trouble arises, however, when the leader of the British, Colonel Nicholson played remarkably by Alec Guiness, refuses to work the way of the Japanese. Meanwhile, a team of British commandos is put together to go and blow up the bridge that is to be erected.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is a masterful film that is terrifically well-made and builds great tension despite seeing it multiple times. The acting is very good all around, especially from Guiness and William Holden as the heroic yet cynical Shears. The cinematography is gorgeous as the scene is set in the jungle of Southeast Asia, and Lean directs at such a solid pace that the story never lags despite the film being two and a half hours long. Lean was a master at building a scene for a climax, and he does it very well here as we watch both sides of this story unfold and wonder what could possibly happen. All elements point to an award-winning, classic war film that will last for decades. And that is exactly what The Bridge on the River Kwai has become and will be."
"HelloTexas11","9","1","3","26 June 2008"," classic POW drama
","As with most war films utilizing a POW camp as the primary setting made prior to say, the 1970's, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' leaves most viewers to speculate that conditions were in all likelihood many times more brutal than portrayed on the screen. Surely the Japanese had more devious methods of torture than simply having officers stand all day in the hot sun, or placing their commander in solitary confinement, as miserable as either of those situations may have been. And it is doubtful the Japanese commandant would have been talked out of shooting several prisoners simply because it is pointed out to him there might be an inquiry into the matter. Those matters aside, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is very compelling and believable, the story of a large group of British soldiers led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), and one American, Commander Shears (William Holden), being held in a desolate Japanese prison camp in southern Burma during WW2. At the center of the story is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese camp commander Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Nicholson's defiance is genuine, but it is done in that peculiarly quirky British fashion which seems, especially in the film's latter sections, exaggerated to an almost unfathomable degree. When Nicholson finally agrees to build the bridge across the Kwai River that Saito wants built, he not only tackles the project with enthusiasm, he determines to build a better bridge than the Japanese themselves would have built. He doesn't regard what he's doing as traitorous; rather, he sees it as a way to keep his men busy and the bridge itself as a monument to their hard work while in captivity. One very interesting sidebar in the film is the contrast between Nicholson and Shears, and by implication, the British and American approach to war and life in captivity. Nicholson lives by certain codes and traditions and would rather die than violate them, even if they come to seem inexplicable in their practical results. Shears, on the other hand, is crafty and resourceful and doesn't give a damn about rules or regulations. He routinely bribes the guards to get out of performing physical labor. To him, the ends justify the means every time. He regards Nicholson and the other British officers as fools, and they regard him as a crazy American, gone slightly off his rocker from being a prisoner so long. Guinness gives one of his finest performances and deservedly won an Oscar (as did the movie itself, and the director, David Lean). The miserable conditions of the camp, and particularly the 'box' where Nicholson spends his solitary confinement, are very realistically presented; the unrelenting jungle heat is palpable. The characterizations are such that we are in sympathy with Colonel Nicholson, though we suspect he isn't completely rational, just as we come to dislike the character of Shears, even as we realize he is doing the right thing in blowing up the bridge. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is rightly regarded as a classic; I would say it is one of the ten best war movies ever made."

","Here war is just a backdrop to tell the story of how far one will go to maintain their sense of humanity amidst horrific conditions within a Japanese prisoner of war camp. For the soldiers of the British army, that means maintaining their regimental ways even IN the Japanese custody. While they come across as naive in their ways, they do endear themselves to the audience with this naiveté. Sir Alec Guiness (yes Obi wan Kenobi) is the shining star of the film despite the top billing of William Holden and Jack Hawkins; they were more familiar names to American audiences at the time. Here he's almost an immovable rock, upon which rest the hopes and dignity of the entire corps of soldiers he commands. His interactions with Sessue Hayakawa who portrays the initially ruthless taskmaster-like commander of the prison camp, brings a humanity to the often times tiring representation of the Japanese soldier as soulless monsters."

Director David Lean definitely displays it (from the Wilson-Foreman script) to some degree; other viewers brought-out the fact that ""Col.

Perhaps the ""honor"" Sessue Kayakawa's character portrayed was his respect for the ""tight-lipped"" Brit. As many viewers wrote, much of this film was fictional, as almost all war-films are.

","You can enjoy ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" with the sound off. Every image is magnificently composed, although fans of current thrillers that create atmosphere through darkness, claustrophobia and quick-cut editing will take some time getting used to Lean's technique of building tension with long, brilliantly lit tracking shots. (Their patience will be rewarded: there is a mesmerizing sequence toward the end of a character's perspective that is all the more remarkable for being two tiny figures in a landscape.) There are some overly cinematic, artsy touches, like the incessant panning shots of screeching vampire bats during a Japanese ambush, that would be annoying if they didn't look so cool. And bridges are the most hackneyed analogy in screen (and perhaps all) history, but this time, well, it just works.<br/><br/>But when you do pump up the volume, prepare to marvel at Alec Guinness' fantastically complicated performance as a rigid, proper British colonel engaged in a battle of wills with the sadistic Japanese officer played by the gifted (and now forgotten) Sessue Hayakawa. Trapped in an unfenced, open-air prison camp that feels as confined as Alcatraz thanks to Lean's capacity for manipulating light, movement and sound, Guinness offers Col. Nicholson as a character of Shakespearean complexity: is this man mad? Suicidal? How can he be so unaware of his collaboration with the enemy -- or is he? (I couldn't figure it out until the very end.) His insistence on forcing his opponent, Col. Haito, to follow the Geneva conventions seems a bit quaint nowadays, but no matter, the real issue is pride -- Guinness' stiff-backed but wobbly-legged walk across the prison camp to Col. Haito's headquarters is more articulate than most monologues. (You also wonder how a classically trained stage actor like Guinness made it look so convincing. Robert DeNiro probably would have had the key grip break his calves.) But unfortunately, ""Kwai"" loses some momentum and focus when it leaves the prison camp and follows cynical, ne'er-do-well ladies' man William Holden around Southeast Asia. Holden's character is, as always, an anti-hero and would be interesting to watch in pretty much any other movie. However, compared to Guinness' ferocious stoicism, Hayakawa's nuanced savagery and the primal battle for supremacy in the prison camp, poor Bill's journey from selfish survivor to noble hero feels a little corny. His character is necessary to make the point that both American improvisation and audacity and British discipline and duty were necessary to win WWII, and even then at great cost. But you can't help but wish that Humphrey Bogart were a couple of decades younger and, well, still alive to make this film -- his presence could have elevated ""Kwai"" to one of the three or four best films ever made. As is, it's a mere masterpiece."

Very surprising and suspenseful, even after seeing the movie about 8-9 times. Anyway, at that point, an entire platoon of Japanese begin running over to where Guiness and the commando are. My quibble is that except for one lone soldier, the rest of the troops all just disappear! One moment there's a whole battalion of men rushing towards and shooting at William Holden who's desperately swimming across the river to help blow up the bridge, and after that one lone Japanese soldier rushes him, misses and falls into the water, that's it! No more Japanese soldiers anywhere! They just all magically disappear which gives Guiness more than enough time to stagger, faint and fall on the plunger, blowing up the bridge. How convenient! In fact, EVERYBODY disappears at the very end with the exception of the one British officer who says ""Madness...Madness..."" It just gets me every time I see the film.

","The film deals with the situation of British prisoners of war during World War II who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy.

Sessue Hayakawa's acting was also good, giving a strong realistic performance.<br/><br/>This movie was great from the beginning to the end, although I find some scenes unnecessary because it's a long, long movie.

"drystyx","9","1","3","15 May 2007"," Brings up historical accuracy question, but has some truths
","By now, everyone has seen the History channel and knows there are flaws in the story. But are they major flaws or minor flaws? That said, there can be no doubt that this is a moving and great story. It centralizes on three characters mostly, and another three characters to a lesser degree. It loosely recounts the horrors of being a POW to the ruthless Japanese. The prisoners were forced to build a bridge under extremely harsh conditions. That statement doesn't begin to make a person feel the horror of the situation, and makes one feel as though it is whitewashed. This film, however, did little whitewashing. It begins with two prisoners explaining to the British officers that of all the hundreds of American and Australian prisoners who began the work, only these two were still alive. This pretty well explains it was horrible without going into details. The debate could go on about how far you make your actors go into portraying men who would be physically skeletons, but I feel that an audience can get the point without an actor forcing his body into severe hunger and malnutrition. Indeed, such an actor would be impossible to keep on his feet for retakes. The three main characters are the British colonel (Alec Guiness), a charismatic American rogue (William Holden) and the Japanese commander. A fourth player, Warren (Jack Hawknis) becomes a major catalyst with them, when he leads a small commando team to destroy the bridge. Most of the excitement comes from the commando team traipsing through a jungle. Two more characters serve as likable and identifiable observers (Joyce and the doctor). The story hops from the excitement of the jungle to the drama inside the prison camp. For most people, the jungle scenes will peak the most interest. But the drama in the camp is riveting for mature audiences. Guiness had the tougher role and was awarded the most acclaim, but Holden got the easier and most charismatic role, and gets the reward of being the most liked. There is a lot of sadness at the end. As a tragedy, this is a remarkable story. As a historical account, it doesn't deviate from the important things. It is probably accurate to compare real conditions in comparison, if not as completely true, with the major German camp movie STALAG 17 (also Holden) compared with BRIDGE OF THE RIVER KWAI. There is a line from the former movie in which Holden proclaims a reason not to escape the German camp is that you could get sent to Japan and wind up in a Japanese camp. Given a choice, an American POW would much prefer the harsh conditions of a German camp to the Hell of a Japanese camp."

","The jolly British soldiers march into a Japanese prisoner of war camp whistling the WWII song ""Hitler's only got one ball."" Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) expects his officers to be treated with the respect that officers are due (see ""La Grande Illusion""). The Japanese commander has other ideas. He has a bridge to finish and needs every man, including officers to work hard labor. The colonel flatly refuses and ends up spending days in the oven, a hot (they are in Thailand) tin box with no food and little water. After interminable waiting, the Japanese commander softens and lets him out. Well, the men are in disarray without a commanding officer and they're building a downright shoddy bridge. Col. Nicholson decides that if they are going to do it, they are going to build the best bridge that has ever been seen. He organizes the men and they set to work.<br/><br/>During the colonels oven time, Commander Shears, (William Holden) an American, escapes from the same camp and turns up in Ceylon, where he is recruited for a commando mission to blow up the bridge. They sneak in and get ready to blow up what has motivated the British soldiers for months. The strength of this movie is the attention to the varying, and evolving views on war and duty shown by the major characters. Shears hates war and regulation. Nicholson loves the military and duty is everything. The British doctor sums his (and the director's views) at the end with ""Madness, Madness."" This movie is like straw mushroom, chicken and coconut milk soup. The mushrooms and the chicken provide the substance of the meal, quite different from each other, but both are hearty. The coconut milk broth is flavored with lemon grass for a little sourness, fish sauce which stinks when in the bottle, but adds subtleness to the food and chilies for a little spice and to wake up the mouth (and sinuses). It is exotic, but earthy and natural. Nothing fancy going on here, just a good meld of different flavors which enhance each other. 7.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

","This one is a classic example of a past cinematic era. Epic and a little out of hand, it holds a great esthetic appeal. While the film ostensibly has the structure of a traditional action-movie, complete with climatic explosion in the end, the tone and subtext is unique.<br/><br/>It has a wonderfully complex narrative structure in particular in reference to the main characters, which are all flawed, sophisticated, and textured. The film simply does not allow for simple characterizations of protagonists and antagonists. Shears (William Holden) is the closest thing to a classic hero, but he is a malinger, impersonates an officer, and only ends up in the mission because the alternative is the brig. Warden (Jack Hawkins) is a quirky ex-professor who ends up killing his own men. Clipton (James Donald) is clear-eyed, but completely passive. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) is a fish out of water, cruel, vain, but in an odd way sympathetic because he is so completely beaten down by the end. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is perhaps the bravest and most charismatic character, but also a man of limited vision, possible insane. Guinness' performance is very subtle and careful. We get to identify with Nicholson and almost rooting for his mad schemes to succeed. And that is why, at the very end, his moment of clarity is utterly powerful and devastating."

"ALauff","10","1","3","6 October 2006"," Intersections
","One earmark of a great work is how strongly it defies easy classification. The Bridge on the River Kwai could reasonably be called a war picture, a P.O.W. escape picture, a dark farce, an examination of leadership, or a debunking of the Great Man theory of historythese would all be correct and also fall short of describing its essence. The film is about a proud, valorous colonel and his rival, the ruthless leader of the Burmese P.O.W. camp at which he and his troops are captive. As the story progresses, the division between hero and villain gives way to a more significant consideration: under such austere conditions, who will be able to navigate the messy intersection of personal and institutional codes of honor and conscience? At first, the deck is stacked for the colonel (played with conviction and inscrutable dignity by Alec Guinness), as in an early scene when he pulls out a copy of the Geneva Convention to prevent his officers from participating in construction of the eponymous bridge to India or when he's willing to sit in a tiny enclosure ominously named ""the oven"" without food or water to uphold his principles. Eventually, his unwavering integrity breaks Gen. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), whose great pride is exposed as he weeps solitarily at his failure. Providing further counterpoint is an American soldier (William Holden), whose code of pragmatic survival has kept him alive for many years in the camp, and who cautions Nicholson that they are miles away from a civilization that respects government dictates.<br/><br/>During these early scenes of attrition, note the question marks Lean drops about the price of Col. Nicholson's fealty to exact military letter in such an environment, as when an officer drops dead from heat exhaustion, or the scores of others locked up in ovens in the blazing heat as punishment for his obdurateness. There is something of a heedless pedant lurking inside of him, of a stubborn child who will stop at nothing to win his point. These flickerings of personal investment foreshadow consuming obsessions yet to comeLean's masterstroke is to leave this story just as his hero is beginning to show cracks and intercut with Holden's escape from the camp, his recovery at a military hospital and his tepid agreement to aid an allied bombing of the bridge, his disreputable colors exposed in the process. However, for all of his insouciance, his identity is anything but fixed. Like Nicholson, he is by turns fatuous, noble, obtuse, principled or highly sympathetic, our understanding of him constantly in flux. The difference may just be Holden's lack of adherence to any rigid code in contrast to Nicholson, who permits the construction of the bridge to become an act of personal value, crucially supplanting his impersonal militarism.<br/><br/>This changing of the internal guard is beautifully evinced in a late scene involving Nicholson as he stands quietly triumphant on the overpass contemplating his achievement. He has overtaken the project, commemorated it as evidence of Western superiority. Saito is eclipsed in these shots, pushed to the background or out of the frame altogether, curiously sullen considering the monument will likely be instrumental to the Japanese war machine. As the camera slowly zooms in past Saito's dejected mien, Nicholson's words tell a more personal story: ""you wonder, you ask yourself, what the sum total of your life representsI don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy; but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time. But tonight... tonight!"" As his jubilance emerges from some buried place, his prized officer's baton falls from his fingers into the river belowpride over duty. Momentarily, personal fulfillment has trumped national glory, and he has lost sight of the bridge's real significance. As will be proved, things of meaning and value have no dominion in such a place of madness. This is a great work."

","Made in 1957, now almost 50 years later Bridge On The River Kwai still looks and plays like a new movie.

They are all held captive in a jungle camp in Ceylon run by Japanese colonel Sessue Hayakawa whose orders are to have the men build a railroad bridge over the river Kwai.<br/><br/>This movie takes its time to develop the characters, something that most modern films avoid. Guinness, Holden, Hayakawa and Jack Hawkins share all of the screen time and at least one of them and usually more than one are in every scene. We get to see the relationship between Hayakawa and his prisoner Guinness play out and see Holden's true character develop as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>The picture won all the major Oscars in 1958 including best picture, best director and best actor (Alec Guiness).

","Not only does this movie provide great action, an interesting look into a somewhat civilized Japanese WWII P.O.W. camp, and a superb ending, but it does an excellent job of analyzing the psychology that was quite prevalent amongst the aristocracy, the rich, and higher ranking officers in Britain since King Edward III conquest of Wales and Scotland in the mid 14th century. While watching this intriguing movie, pay particular attention to Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guinness, better known as Obi-Won Kenobi), and his reactions towards orders, rules, and regulations, and his unwillingness to deviate from them: a tragic flaw of sorts for the colonel. Expand Guinness' character a thousand-fold and you will understand what many interpret as British ""arrogance,"" and how it fell out of existence from the government after WWII (for the most part), and why the empire collapsed."
"soxfan42","10","1","3","2 June 2005"," The finest study of war to be seen
","""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is not a war movie. It is a movie about war. As someone who dislikes the typically gory, generic war movies (e.g. Windtalkers, We Were Soldiers) that try to slip a belated message about the horror of war in between explosions, I find this movie to be an absolute masterpiece about how war can only destroy and how it shatters the world for all who fight in it. Alec Guinness (who, I admit, is my favorite actor) won an Oscar for portraying Col. Nicholson, a man who builds the bridge under various pretexts of creating better conditions for his men, a group of British P.O.W.s in Burma. However, his true need is for a feeling of creation amidst the destructive force of World War Two. William Holden is also masterful as Shears, an American concerned primarily with his own survival. The cast is rounded out with a gung-ho British commando, a Japanese colonel obsessed with his own possible death, a younger commando who must cope with his duties that call for the killing of other humans, and one poor medic who plays Cassandra to a world defeated by war. This movie is not about war. It is about humanity and how we may lose it in the currents of war."
"Poseidon-3","Null","1","3","27 December 2004"," Great epic film-making with strong acting, direction and production values.
","References to this WWII film almost always consist of the whistling, marching soldiers and the climactic tussle over the title bridge, but first time viewers may be surprised at what other great things there are to be found in it. Holden plays a slightly shifty American POW, slaving away in an Asian camp as commander Hayakawa tries in vain to complete a railroad bridge that will open up more territory for the Japanese to conquer and control. When new arrival Guinness is brought in with his band of officers and other enlisted men, he and Hayakawa form a stand-off, with Guinness refusing to take part in the bridge-building and Hayakawa going to almost any lengths to make him. Holden makes a break for it and is recruited by Hawkins to go back and destroy the bridge, but by then Guinness is so proud of his work on it that he loses sight of the big picture. Holden finds himself up against one of his own allies when it comes to stopping the bridge from fulfilling it's purpose. Director Lean took his cast deep into Ceylon to give an authentic and lushly gorgeous setting to his story. There are eye-popping sights of the landscape (just as his later ""Dr Zhivago"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" would also include), notably a massive and beautiful waterfall. Top-billed Holden has to take a back-seat to the far more intriguing character Guinness plays, but he adds a degree of charm to the film, at times providing the comic relief, and does get one strong scene against Hawkins. Guinness is superb as the impossibly stalwart and stern Colonel who lets his pride in his duties and in his work distract him from his overall commitment to his country's cause. Veteran actor Hayakawa does well as the antagonist, though he doesn't really get a particularly showy scene to chew on. Hawkins is solid and there's a fresh, nice performance from Horne as a green lieutenant who comes along on the mission and gets more than he bargained for. The film has a deliberate pace and takes its time to set up the characters, but the acting is so fine and the scenery so striking that it rarely seems too oppressive. Though their scenes are sometimes just a little too precious and unexpectedly romance-oriented, there are several Asian women to give a dot of female persuasion to the film (along with Sears' brief role as a nurse who can't quit with the bedside manner.) A beautiful musical score is often forgotten in the wake of the more famous Colonel Bogey March. Though the outcome of the story has been revealed in many film retrospectives and TV clips, there is undeniable suspense as the situation intensifies at the end. In all, it's a very satisfying film with great performances and sure-handed direction, consisting of far more action and drama than just soldiers whistling while they march."

","The unusual setting, conflict of wills, and memorable characters make ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" a worthwhile and engrossing drama despite some shortcomings. It would be hard to top the performances by Alec Guinness and William Holden, as two of the three main characters. (Sessue Hayakawa also has a couple of good scenes, although much of the time he is saddled with an unrewarding and rather thankless role.) Their portrayals and David Lean's direction make the movie work on a level far above the quality of the story itself. The story's historical distortions and implausible turns, which would have been fatal in a production of lesser quality, are concealed most of the time by the high quality of the other elements of the film.<br/><br/>Besides the good work by the cast, the remote setting and the tense story make all of it but a handful of slower stretches intriguing and satisfying. There is so much quality here that it seems a bit unfortunate that the story could not have been more true to the historical setting, rather than relying so much on developments and motivations that, while dramatically effective, are historically doubtful. There are also some implausible stretches that, though carried off well enough by the cast, were not really necessary. While most viewers probably won't mind them anyway, both of these are a little too plain to avoid being noticed.<br/><br/>As a movie, though, this is an absorbing story with strong production values and some fine scenes, and it is certainly well worth seeing."

Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), an angry, almost merciless leader who has troubles of his own.  Inside the camp - leading the British prisoners - is Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a strong-willed, by the book patriot.  Other characters include a major posing as a commander who recently escaped the camp (William Holden), and an honest, hard working doctor working there (James Donald).<br/><br/>The plot is set in motion when Nicholson is ordered by Saito to have his soldiers build a bridge at the camp and Holden's character is sent to destroy it.  It may seem unimportant, the whole movie about a bridge, but the way the characters grow obsessed over it is incredibly well done.<br/><br/>Most notably is Guinness' performance as the stubborn Nicholson who sees the bridge as his signature in history, all the while ignoring the fact that he's really helping his enemy.  Guinness took home a well deserved Best Actor Oscar for his role in this.<br/><br/>Also great are Hayakawa and Holden.  Hayakawa was nominated for an Oscar for this, and it is deserved, what could've been a cartoonish villain is presented in full, a truly three dimensional character.  Holden puts forth as well, his character so reluctant and angry to be on his mission.<br/><br/>David Lean's direction here is great too, his talent for adventure shown in the gripping climax when all the major characters meet in an exciting, suspensful and ultimately tragic climax.<br/><br/>A classic film, I recommend, 8.5/10."

","Another David Lean masterpiece (that's all he seems to make). I think in some ways this was the first great war Epic made. The great thing about David Lean epics is that he refuses to use cheap special effects or miniatures. Everything must be authentic in a Lean Epic. That included the construction, and destruction, of an actual full sized bridge. The only thing at all that dates this movie is the use of Day-For-Night, which looks very obvious by today's standards. Other than that, even on technical merits, Bridge On The River Kwai is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>
Alec Guiness not just deserved his Oscar for Best Actor, but I think he'd probably be worthy of a Best Actor of all time award, if it were ever handed out. There's one thing that David Lean does in all of his movies, even dating back to Brief Encounter. That is the use of unredeemable characters. It's not to say that everyone is a bad guy, just that all the characters have major flaws. Nobody can really be looked at as a hero. This is true in River Kwai with all the lead characters. Nicholson has pride and honor, but his obsession with The Bridge leads him to basically betraying his own country by aiding the Japanese. Shears is strong, but a coward. Warden cares more about a challenge than winning the war. And while Saito is the head Japanese officer, and technically the villain, he has several moments of redemption. You see that he is just another soldier doing his job.<br/><br/>What River Kwai has that epics today can't duplicate is a perfect balance. There's the right mixture of action, drama, comedy, and political commentary. I have seen this movie so many times and I'm incapable of getting sick of it. #4 on my All-Time list."

The acting is excellent, and Alec Guiness in particular is superb, but at no time does it call undue attention to itself. This is true of all the other elements of the film -- the directing, editing, music, set design, etc. All excellent, yet all working together to create a piece of art that works on many levels: as a pure adventure film certainly, but also as a gripping exploration of human motivation in the unreality of war. You lose yourself in the story quickly and forget you are watching a film, which is one of the best compliments that can be paid to any film.<br/><br/>
Repeated viewings also point out the deficiencies of so-called ""epics"" that have come out since. ""Bridge"" seems to me more timeless than ever as time goes on.

I think that the story is mainly based in visual effects like the jungle, the wonderful beaches and waterfalls but above all this story has a great script based in one of Pierre Boulle's master-pieces. In the movie we can see some great dilemmas such as Joyce's doubt about his ability to kill when needed; Saito's respect for Nicholson vs. wish to complete the bridge (and avoid hara-kiri); the final scene when Nicholson understands what I has done to his compatriots and then even death he completes their mission. I thing that no one can forget this story but if that happens, it will came back in a flash anytime someone starts whistling Bogey."

","Great movie and great acting performance by Alec Guinness.   With David Lean involved, the cinematography is excellent, as always.  Most movies involving war are either antiwar or in praise of heroism, so this interesting idea of mixed views is refreshing.  However, as great as all this and the film in general are, nothing qualifies it as ABSOLUTE best in any category--EXCEPT Score.   It is the best of all-time in my view--if anyone has any alternatives, please do a message board post."

","Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent film. It succeeds where recently made movies like Thin Red Line failed: it shows the awful madness that is war without the blood and guts element, which, by the way, almost always misses the mark. War is insane not because of what it does to our bodies but because of what it does to our minds. Great performances from William Holden and Alec Guinness. Definitely worth seeing at least once."

","What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already?  I recently borrowed this movie from a family member having not seen it in years and it's still as brilliant as the first time I saw it.  I think the thing that most makes this movie so brilliant is the turmoil that each of its characters experiences.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness truly earned his best actor for this movie.  His refusal to compromise his beliefs, as well as his eventual need to complete the bridge, perhaps for his own sanity shows the pain he feels.  It seems at many times like Guinness is against the world.<br/><br/>Hayakawa, to, plays a character filled with turmoil.  His internal struggle of sticking to his guns or compromising, and his fear of failure and dishonor.  One brief scene where we see Saito crying is interesting as he, despite being the antagonist to Guinness, becomes a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>William Holden's performance as a man unwilling to be a hero rounds out the spectacular acting in this movie.  Torn between his desire to return home and his fear of his facade being exposed, he to must make a choice.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, rent it now.  If you have seen it, watch it again. I could never tire of this movie."

","This movie turned into a mess halfway through when William Holden's character gets out of the prison camp and in touch with the British army. Not only did it add a lot of unnecessary length to the film, but made it a lot less interesting. Fortunately, Lean builds up that magnificent scene at the end, which makes the rest of the film worth sitting through.<br/><br/>I admired Guinness' performance and not much else. Possibly the most over-hyped war film of our time. If you want to see a film that takes on a more psychological aspect towards war, watch Malick's inconsistent, but very effective 'The Thin Red Line'.<br/><br/>*** / *****"

It is psychologically deeper and harder than every other war movie you will ever see, along with Apocalypse Now.

It sits at an interesting crossroads between highly patriotic work of the 1940's, and deeper satire of military madness (e.g. Catch-22) and the disillusionment of the 1960's. Aside from the leaders being a bit off-kilter, one young solider says ""I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime,"" and it's clear the escaped American (William Holden) wants no part of further battle.</li></ul><br/><br/>Lowlights:
<ul><li>Treatment of the Japanese. They're shown as incompetent at building bridges, and weak at controlling the prisoners. It's remarkable how little the Japanese are present in the film. Also remarkable is how much control the British commander has in his interactions with them, and in just strolling around. In one scene, Hayakawa privately weeps in frustration. These things are simply ludicrous and seem to me to stem from feelings of racial superiority.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Overall lightness of tone. After the opening scenes it's almost a cartoon, and I think it did the real-life POW's and civilians who worked under horrific conditions a real disservice.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>William Holden's character. He's the cool American who enjoys seeing a woman after escaping, hanging out in loafers, and acting in ways that are decidedly un-military. On the trek through the jungle on the daring mission, he's soaped and shampooed in a natural pool by a lovely young Thai woman, one of several who are (of course!) helping carry the gear.

"Tweekums","9","1","4","22 March 2017"," A classic war film
","In Japanese prisoner of war camp in Burma a camp a newly arrived group of British prisoners are told that they are to construct a bridge over the River Kwai. Their CO, Lt Col Nicholson, informs the camp commandant, Colonel Saito, that as per the Geneva Convention he and his officers will not work. Saito orders the officers placed in a punishment cell while Nicholson is put in an iron 'hot box'. While they are being punished the man work on the bridge but progress is very slow. There is also an escape attempt by American prisoner Commander Shears and two British prisoners; the latter are shot and killed and it looks as though Shears is dead too after being shot at and falling into the river. As the progress of the bridge falls further and further behind schedule Saito talks to Nicholson; the latter tells him that his men would do a better job if led by their own officers soon he has effectively taken over the project; moving the bridge to a better location, coming up with a better design and the moral of the men is improving but in the process is he guilty of helping the enemy.<br/><br/>Shears survives the fall into the river, and with the help of local villagers recovers and is eventually rescued and taken to a hospital in Ceylon. Here he is recruited, somewhat against his will, by Major Warden who is planning to lead a small group into the jungle to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>This film is rightly considered a classic; its cast doing a great job telling an interesting story. Alec Guinness is on top form as Col Nicholson as he gradually changes from an officer who bravely stands up to his captors to somebody who could be considered to be aiding the enemy; his motives are the moral and wellbeing of his men but as completion of the bridge nears he is clearly proud of the work they have done. William Holden impresses as Shears, a character who provides some of the films few lighter moments. Jack Hawkins is also on good form as Major Warden.<br/><br/>This can be considered a film of two halves; the first concerning what is going on in the camp with Nicolson risking all to stand up to the Japanese and the second which largely follows the planning and execution of the raid against the bridge with occasional returns to the camp where we see Nicholson accidentally slipping into collaboration. There are of course some problems; most notably the character of Nicholson; it is unlikely that a senior British officer would have behaved the way he did the officer he is loosely based on certainly didn't. This isn't an action packed film but it is certainly tense and never boring. What action there is, is impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic film I'd also recommend reading a little about the actual events which inspired this work of fiction."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","4","9 March 2011"," Among the best war films of all time
","David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" won the Best Picture Oscar for 1957 and is today revered as one of the best British/American productions of that, or any, era.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a battle of wills between a British colonel (Alec Guinness) and the commandant of a Japanese PoW camp (Sessue Hayakawa). The British PoWs are being forced to build a bridge over the river Kwai but, little do they know, a plan is already being formulated to blow it up. The story is compellingly told by screenwriters Michael Wilson & Carl Foreman but, unfortunately, they received no credit for their Oscar-winning script (based on Pierre Boulle's novel) due to the Hollywood blacklist.<br/><br/>The film's best performance belongs to Alec Guinness, so it's no surprise that he took home an Oscar. Sessue Hayakawa was also nominated for his surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of the film's main villain. As the requisite American hero, William Holden is outclassed by his peers but he still puts in a reliable performance. Meanwhile, James Donald & Jack Hawkins are standouts in support.<br/><br/>David Lean's Oscar-winning direction is impressively handled and the similarly honoured cinematography is routinely breathtaking. Malcolm Arnold's score also won an Oscar, though I admit that I found little remarkable about the music except, of course, for the immortal ""Colonel Bogey March"".<br/><br/>In the end, the film does have some imperfections but they are relatively minor ones. The movie doesn't really pick up steam until about an hour in but from that point on it's practically flawless. Therefore, I wouldn't hesitate to rank ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" alongside the likes of ""Apocalypse Now"" & ""Patton"" as some of the best war movies of all time."
"vanhelsing19","10","1","4","28 January 2011"," Jolly good show, jolly jolly good show...
","The film is set in 1943, in a POW camp in Burma, along the route of a rail line the Japanese were building between Malaysia and Rangoon. Seen through the eyes of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), commanding officer of a battalion of British war prisoners, the war narrows to a single task, building a bridge across the Kwai. The film then focuses on exactly what the viewer considers to be mad.<br/><br/>Nicholson and Saito, the commandant, are quickly involved in a face off. Saito wants all of the British to work on the bridge. Nicholson says the Geneva Convention states officers may not be forced to perform manual labour. He even produces a copy of the document, which Saito uses to whip him across the face, drawing blood. Nicholson is prepared to die rather than bend on principle, and eventually, in one of the film's best-known sequences, he's locked inside 'the Oven', a corrugated iron hut that stands in the sun.<br/><br/>The story in the jungle moves ahead neatly, economically and powerfully. Holden is extremely good as the malingerer and unlikely hero – you see his character come full circle as the film ends. Note should be made of Hawkins brilliant, perhaps his finest role, as the focused British commando. With all Hawkins military characters you really have faith that he is who he plays. The long march where he refuses to be carried is a good example of the stiff upper lipism that he carries so well. He and Holden handle the British humour well with Hawkins providing lines such as 'Jolly good show' to which Holden replies 'yes jolly good show, jolly jolly goodgood hunting' in perhaps the most humorous moment of the film. The film's central relationship is between Saito and Nicholson, a professional soldier approaching his 28th anniversary of army service 'I don't suppose I've been at home more than 10 months in all that time'.<br/><br/>The Japanese colonel is not a professional soldier, but he is a rigidly dutiful officer. We see him weeping privately with humiliation because Nicholson is a stronger willed man – a great insult to a Japanese officer. Most war movies are either for or against their wars. This film is one of the few that focuses not on rights and wrongs but on the individuals. Like Robert Graves' World War I memoir 'Goodbye to All That' it shows men grimly hanging onto military discipline and pride in their units as a way of clinging to sanity. By the end of the film we are less interested in who wins than in how individual characters will behave.<br/><br/>The scenes in the jungle are crisply told. We see the bridge being built, and we watch the standoff between the two colonels. Hayakawa and Guinness make a good match as they create two disciplined officers who never bend, but nevertheless quietly share the vision of completing the bridge.<br/><br/>The obsession is with building a better bridge, and finishing it on time. The story's great irony is that once Nicholson successfully stands up to Saito, he immediately devotes himself to Saito's project as if it is his own. He suggests a better site for the bridge, he offers blueprints and timetables, and he even enters Clipton's hospital hut in search of more workers, and marches out at the head of a column of the sick and the lame. <br/><br/>Liptons final words are perhaps a suitable epitaph for the film..."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","4","3 September 2010"," David Lean's first great epic.
","Seems that the only reason why some people don't seem to like this movie is because it isn't being historically accurate. This movie however never claimed to tell a true story or that it's being based on actual events. It's merely a fictional story and movie based on historical events and also real life characters but done in its own way and of course told in an Hollywood fashion. But even though this movie might not be an historically accurate one, it's still one that works out highly realistic.<br/><br/>I must say that this is probably one of the movies that does the best job at showing what life as a POW must have been like. Many movies tried to capture this but a very few actually succeeded as well with it as this movie did. The movie manages to create a great atmosphere of despair, fear but also courage and honor. The movie is dealing with a lot of inner conflicts that live within most of these people who had to endure a prison camp and hard labor. Most of these conflicts get personified by only an handful of characters, which in my opinion is one of the movie its strong points. It could had easily dwelled on and inserted many more different characters, mostly purely for dramatic reasons but instead it decides to focus mostly on only just a few key players, from all different sides as well. It keeps the movie more personal and all of its emotions and reactions more effective and understandable.<br/><br/>But what also makes the movie so great and intriguing is the fact that it isn't just being a melodramatic movie. Actually the movie has a more positive vibe to it than you might expect from a movie like this. Despite the premise, it's still mostly a movie about hope and trying to make a difference and do the right thing in given circumstances. It's a movie that despite everything also works out as entertainment. It's not always an heavy movie but also one that gets fun and pleasant to watch. In a way you could say that this is one of those first adventurous and entertaining WW II movies some got successfully made off, in mostly the '60's.<br/><br/>It's a movie that actually combines a lot of elements. It consists out of many genres and it also has some different story takes in it. But it does this all very seamlessly, so it doesn't ever distract or takes you out of the movie. The movie feels as one great whole, that despite its long running time, always flows very well. It's due to David Lean fine directing and storytelling skills. He was a director who knew how to directed epic movies and big stories. This also was the first movie that earned him an Oscar as a director.<br/><br/>This movie actually won 7 Oscar's in total, which not a whole lot of movies can say. It tells you something about the epic quality and impact of this movie.<br/><br/>It's a movie that for a large part also relies on its characters and actors playing them. It's perhaps Alec Guinness his most acclaimed movie role out of his career and it also won him his only Oscar. He definitely also plays the best or at least most interest character out of the entire movie, as an officer gentleman who does things literally by the book and all for the greater good and well being of his men and officers. Despite this William Holden always got billed as main actor, simply because he was a much bigger name at the time, that also appealed to a wider, mostly American, audience.<br/><br/>It's also a great looking movie, that got shot at location, which obviously add to the realistic look and feel of the movie. The directing and cinematography all take an epic approach, also due to the fact that this was cinemascope movie, that simply required a wider and more epic look. David Lean is mostly known for his epic movies but this was actually his first really epic one and he really didn't directed that many movies throughout his career.<br/><br/>Simply a great and unique, timeless epic.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","As entertainment, this is an exceptional film off course, like all Lean's films are.<br/><br/>My late uncle Jan, he died last year, happened to be one of the POW's working on the Birma railroad for about 3 years. Although he didn't like to talk much about his experiences, he left a little school paper in which he wrote down, after the war, his major experiences.<br/><br/>Well, most of his fellow POW's died alongside the railroad. Not just because of the hard work and mistreatment, not just because of the poor food, but very much because of the RAF bombing the railroad camps. Ar least, the railroad camps in which Dutch prisoners like my uncle lived. This is what frustrated him most, later: not the fact he had to work as a POW, not the mistreatment by Japanese and Korean guards, not the the hunger and thirst, but the danger of being killed by allies who, after the war, were celebrated as heroes.<br/><br/>In august 1945 my uncle was released, almost starved and practically blind because of the lack of proper food for many years, but alive. He has never returned to the Dutch East Indies and back in Holland, he married, became a sailor, got 7 children, and never a medal or any recognition.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is enjoyable, but it is just no more than that.

"johnmschofield","10","1","4","14 November 2009"," A very good film well worth watching
","This film is superbly well made and a credit to all the team that were involved in its creation. For me it hasn't got any obvious weaknesses and is well worth watching. I have only ever watched it about three times and the reason is although its subject matter is important and relevant I would never regard it as a film I would watch repeatedly over the years. Basically I see this film as more of a psychological drama than an action film and it seems to me to be a supreme study of multifarious emotions and states of mind under almost constant high levels of stress and danger. This description doesn't mean it will be automatically discarded and overlooked but perhaps seen in a different light, however there is something about this film which although a very good finished product has not resulted in many people voting or writing reviews. I can understand this to a certain extent because although it is a classic it is a very sad story and doesn't appear to leave the viewer with any positivity. Virtually nothing positive comes from War and this film is a perfect example of this. The film as a study of human behaviour under extreme circumstances it is a very fulfilling experience but I suspect it is not a film most people would grab for a night in with a beer. That is sad but such is the nature of the subject. Having said all of the above please watch this film not because it is historically accurate but because for me it is just over two and half hours of human interaction parts of which could have been extracted from any incident from any of the war torn parts during the duration of the second world war. It is a representation of the tragic possibilities of war and how logic and common sense are very rarely in evidence but horror, absurdities and suffering are there in abundance and a single viewing of this film would demonstrate this well"

","Alec Guiness and his men are ordered to build ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" in this magnificent 1957 film starring Alec Guinness, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, and Jack Hawkins, and directed by David Lean. Lean manages to give us an epic that manages to focus on fascinating and multilayered characters.<br/><br/>The story is based on a book about a real-life incident; however, in order to make the points made in the film, the story has many fictional elements, including the depiction of Colonel Saito (Hayakawa), who was actually a very humane Japanese officer, and he and the real-life Colonel Nicholson (Guinness), actually named Toosey shared a great respect. In the movie, Saito demands that the British officers in a prisoner of war camp participate in the building a bridge across the river Kwai in Burma during World War II. Colonel Nicholson refuses, and despite harsh imprisonment, will not give in. When his demands are met, he becomes determined to show the superiority of the British army and engineering in the building of the bridge. The bridge becomes an end in itself, although it will actually help the Japanese.<br/><br/>William Holden plays an escaped prisoner who is asked to return to the Burmese jungle to help destroy the bridge and the train that is supposed to go over it.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness gives his greatest performance as Nicholson - and that's saying something, since he did so many great ones. He has the stoicism, the determination, and the pride necessary for the role, contrasted with the frailty of his imprisonment. One really believes he has endured harsh imprisonment, given the way he looks, talks, and walks. Holden is fabulous as the soldier who, once he gets away, just wants to go home and is forced to go back to the jungle. In one scene, he yells at Major Warden (Jack Hawkins): ""You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman... how to die by the rules - when the only important thing is how to live like a human being."" Sessue Hayakawa does a brilliant job as a man as determined as Nicholson and furious that he cannot bend him to his will.<br/><br/>The end of the film is extremely suspenseful and builds tension throughout. This is a great film, and an antiwar one - Colonel Nicholson tells Saito that as he ages, he thinks about what his life has meant. Sometimes our goals become confused, and one forgets the real focus. The final line, uttered by Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) says it all."

","I think I am speaking for most women when I say that war movies are not my favorite genre. However, this is not your typical war movie. It is a fascinating character study of the madness of the men who have chosen, and are devoted to military life. It shows the impact of their decisions on the lives of the men and women who get swept up into their dustbin of insanity. Sir David Lean, the director, grew up in a Quaker family, which I believe helps to explain his perspective in this film and others of his. <br/><br/>As so many others have mentioned, the performances are wonderful. Even though I am not a big fan of Alec Guinness because I feel that he has a tendency to overact, I do agree that this is perhaps his best performance. I think this is largely due to David Lean's direction. He understood that an epic should be character driven. <br/><br/>I believe Lean to be the master of the epic, not merely because of his cinematographic genius, and his wonderful use of music, but because he realized the importance of closely focusing on his main characters. A good epic has to be about more than beautiful vistas and haunting music. We have to care about and be interested in the people involved. He knew how to pull all of these elements together. <br/><br/>The movie is best seen on a large screen in order to do justice to the cinematography and sheer scope of this film. A film treasure!"
"FilmOtaku","7","1","4","13 April 2004"," An excellent military epic
","*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>David Lean's epic about the British soldiers and officers captured by the Japanese who, in the name of pride and what could be construed as arrogance, build a bridge at the behest of the enemy is not only a great military film, but is a psychological study in the behaviors and motivations of men as well.  Alec Guinness is Col. Nicholson, a man who lets his pride and his allegiance to the rules of war nearly kills him due to his refusal to participate in the building of this bridge.  When he finally `gets his way' however, he takes on the project with full steam and craftsmanship. Unfortunately, the British Army is scheduling the destruction of this bridge because it will assist the Japanese in its occupation of India, something that Guinness realizes too late and with great consequence.  This is a long film, and probably could have been trimmed just a bit, but there is very little to complain about.  It is an epic in every sense of the word, and the rich character studies are just one of the elements that make this a quintessential Lean film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is not a typical military film, but is a fantastic addition to the genre.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is probably the only movie I have watched once and haven't had the time to watch again (it sits quietly on along with my other home video collection) that has had such an endearing effect on me. My goodness what a movie! David Lean succeeds again...though this was before Lawrence of Arabia. Again, Lean goes deep into the mind of a Colonel played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar winning performance. <br/><br/>The landscapes are again very real and therefore engaging. I think Lean knew that sets don't work too well. The story circles around human struggle and emotions where the characters are facing the horrors and aftermaths of war. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and his men are taken prisoner by the Japanese and are forced to build a bridge on the River Kwai. When everything seems to be going fine, a destructive climax scene ruins all.<br/><br/>

","10 out of 10<br/><br/>     British P.O.W.'s at a Japanese island prison are ordered to build a bridge for the Japanese army yet the bridge and the construction of it only serve as a metaphor for human nature and the overall human condition.<br/><br/>     This film is actually split up into six very distinct parts.  The first and by far the most interesting is the clash of wills between Colonel Nicholson and Colonel Saito.  The second part is the actual building of the bridge while the third is the planning for it's destruction.  The fourth is the slow and dangerous advancement through the jungle by the people hired to destroy the bridge.  The fifth consists of the actual completion of the bridge while the sixth deals with it's destruction.<br/><br/>     It is really rare for a film to grab your attention right away and hold it consistently all the way through.  Even through three hours length it never has a slow moment and thankfully is not filled with needless extraneous footage either.  It is one of the most compacted, tightly edited three hour films you will ever see.  Finally Director Lean has a found a story that is strong enough and profound enough to match his very expansive visual style.<br/><br/>     This film is tops in literally every aspect.  There is a terrific music score, lush photography, great location, acting, editing, and some really good special effects.  It is is also just a great all around adventure that balances it's profound moments with some really good action.  The ending is especially powerful and thought provoking.  There is also, believe it or not, some really good comedy.  Pay special attention to that calender in Hayakawa's office and how it changes from month to month.<br/><br/>     Of course there is some strong doubt whether any of this could really happen in a actual P.O.W. camp especially with that big variety show the prisoners put on after the bridge's completion.  Yet the film still represents some very universal issues.  The animosity between the Guiness character and the Hayakawa one is the best because it shows how even with the greatest of adversaries they are more alike than they are different.  It also shows that how sometimes the one thing that really separates people more than anything is nothing more than circumstance.  It is also great at how it examines that even with the strongest, most disciplined, and most intimidating of people they can still have weaknesses somewhere.  This is also a film that makes terrific use of it's silent moments and makes it one of it's strongest elements."

","This is an interesting war movie despite many of the main characters playing fairly generic roles. The best part about this film was the acting of the Japanese general. The worst part was the music, which was obnoxiously loud and often completely unfitting for the scene, such as ominous, suspenseful, dramatic music blaring while people walk through a safe jungle where nothing happens to them."

","I am very fond of David Lean's films especially Lawrence of Arabia, Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and Brief Encounter. While not my absolute favourite of Lean's work, it is definitely in my top 5 for him. I have heard it is historically inaccurate, but with everything else so good I didn't actually care that much. Besides I think there are films out there that do a worse job at history(Braveheart being one of the biggest offenders). As usual from a David Lean film, the images, cinematography and scenery are exquisite, and the music is sweeping and grandiose. The story is compelling enough, and the script is intelligent and beautifully written. While long, Bridge on the River Kwai never felt boring to me, while Lean's direction is faultless. I couldn't fault the acting either, everyone was superb but it is Alec Guinness who stands out prominently among the rest. Overall, wonderful, forget the inaccuracy and see it for especially the images. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","A group of British POWs is ordered by the Japanese to build a bridge over the River Kwai. While at first trying to stall, they eventually go along with the plan and take pride in their work. But what they don't know is that an American POW who was released from the camp has met up with British commandos who are determined to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>What we have here is the serious Nicholson (Alec Guinness) on one side against the slacker Shears (William Holden). While both working for the same side (the Allies) they are given two very opposed objectives. And only one of them can succeed... but who will it be? While not intentionally humorous, the film had something of a dark comedy aspect for me. Shears with his laid-back attitude, choosing to indulge woman and drink on the beach, and no love of authority, was a likable anti-hero. And the film as a whole had a message that screamed: war is pointless, banal and at times utterly mad. We the audience were watching collective, organized insanity.<br/><br/>If you don't mind war dramas and films almost three hours in length, this one is a must-see.

"zardoz-13","10","1","5","8 November 2009"," My All-Time Favorite War Movie!!!
","""Great Expectations"" director David Lean made what qualifies as the greatest World War II movie of all-time. I saw this fantastic film when Columbia Pictures released it, and the spectacle of an actual bridge being blown to smithereens with a real locomotive and freight cars on it captivated me at the tender age of four, and I have never forgotten it. I've seen it more times than I can remember, and this movie has never lost its allure for me. This stirring epic is based on Pierre Boulle's award-winning 1952 novel, but director David Lean and scenarists Michael Wilson of ""A Place in the Sun"" and Carl Foreman of ""High Noon"" took several liberties with the storyline. First, Boulle didn't obliterate the bridge. The British commandos were able to derail the train, but the bridge remained intact. Second, Colonel Nicholson discovered the sabotage, but he didn't collapse on the plunger and blow-up the bridge. Third, no Americans, specifically the character of Shears, appeared in the novel. Fourth, although there was a Shears, he was a British commando, but he tried to cross the river during the finale to kill Nicholson. Fifth, the British said that they had to send in commandos because the RAF couldn't fly the distance to bomb the bridge. In Boulle's novel, the British don't send in bombers because they felt the Japanese could repair any damage from bombing raids and have the bridge back in action. Nevertheless, this memorable film brims with irony and answers all the questions about life. This movie also immortalized the whistling march theme ""Colonel Bogey March."" Interestingly, former British POWs hated the movie and wanted to lambaste it, but they kept their silence for fear that their protests would provide more publicity for a movie that they felt deserved nothing in the way of publicity.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Photography, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Music, and Best Editing. This is a beautiful movie and the cast is stupendous. Although Alec Guinness won the Oscar for Best Actor, I believe that the incomparable William Holden as the only American prisoner of war steals the movie hands down. Holden made a specialty of playing anti-heroic roles. As Shears, he is at his anti-heroic best. Sadly, Sessue Hayakawa did not win for Best Supporting Actor, but he makes a terrific adversary.<br/><br/>Essentially, David Lean's masterpiece is a drama about a clash of wills in the middle of the jungle during World War II. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness of ""Star Wars"") and his British officers and enlisted men survive a grueling march through the jungle to a Japanese labor camp where camp commandant Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)orders them to erect a bridge across the River Kwai. Saito stipulates in no uncertain terms that British officers will work alongside their men, but Colonel Nicholson refuses to abide by these terms. He cites the rules of the Geneva Convention. Saito's reaction is incredulity, ""Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of ""cricket!"" Saito puts him in a sweat box and the intense heat very nearly kills Nicholson. Nonetheless, Nicholson refuses to give in to Saito's demands. Meanwhile, construction work on the bridge commences, but the Japanese make virtually no headway. At the same time, Shears engineers an escape from the camp and nearly dies in the process. The two British soldiers that accompany him die in the attempt. Natives find the destitute Shears washed up on the shores of their villages. They nurse Shears back to life, furnish him with supplies, and send him on his way. Eventually, he reaches British lines. Back at the Kwai camp, Saito loses the battle of wills and releases Nicholson and agrees that the British officers do not have to work Ironically, Nicholson decides to embrace the bridge construction so as to occupy his men and prove to the Japanese that the British soldier is the best soldier in the world. When Nicholson's chief medical officer, Major Clipton (James Donald of ""The Great Escape"") suggests that helping the Japanese erect a bridge could qualify as treason, Nicholson reminds him that they were ordered to surrender to the enemy. Nicholson goes on to say, ""If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your job or would you let him die?Would you have it be said that our chaps can't do a better job? You're a fine doctor, Clipton, but you've a lot to learn about the army."" Nicholson and his officers devise a way of building a suitable bridge and one of Nicholson's engineers tells him that a similar bridge built of wood survived 300 years. Nicholson becomes so obsessed with the project that he eventually has his own officers pitch in and finish it.<br/><br/>The British decide to dispatch a team of commandos led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins of ""Shalako"") to destroy the bridge. Warden convinces a reluctant Shears to lead them to it since he knows the way. Shears explains that he cannot because he isn't really an officer. It seems that when his ship sank, he swam ashore, appropriated an officer's insignia and impersonated an officer, erroneously believing he would receive better treatment than an enlisted man. Such was not the case. Warden informs him that they knew about his masquerade. He also gives Shears the simulated rank of major for the mission. Reluctantly, Shears agrees to lead Force 316 through the jungle to the bridge. They bail out over enemy territory and then they have to take an entirely different route because the route that Shears took is swarming now with Japanese. Our heroes have to make a forced march through swamps with leeches, across mountains, and eventually they reach the bridge.<br/><br/>This movie ranks as the greatest war movie ever made."
"cfloyd2643","5","1","5","1 January 2007"," Great Britain, USA, and Japan kiss and make up for WWII
","Just seen this movie - enjoyed it. I give it a 5 of 10.<br/><br/>I think that this movie is great therapy for the nations involved in WWII to take a real candid look back in hindsight at themselves after the war ended (movie was produced in 1957 using lead actors from each of the three nations I mentioned). While there ARE brief scenes of the soldiers shooting and swinging knives at each other, I can't help but feel that I am watching a cartoon of the likes of Inspector Gadget, not in WWII. There are British commandos mistaking an American sailor (who their own air force rescued from his sunken ship) for the enemy. Then the British commandos enlist this American sailor to help guide them through the jungle to find and blow up a strategic bridge. The British commando is so excited at having the chance to ""blow something up"" that it is amusing. At the POW camp where the Japanese are forcing captured British soldiers to build the ""bridge over the river Kwai"" for a train supply route through Burma, the Japanese wannabe camp commander feels inept as a commander because the British commander in his camp gets more respect from his subordinates than he does from his own Japanese subordinates. When the captive British commander and the Japanese commander were negotiating over how many of his men must work and for how long, I chuckled when the Japanese commander shouted, ""This is not a game of cricket, this is war!"". Yeah, this movie was ""war"" alright, GI Joe style. The ending was totally ludicrous, just as the medic said, ""This is madness!"" While this movie has EXACTLY the same message as far more poignant graphic war films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" do (WAR IS SENSELESS), ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"" was more of a psychological, even amusing, examination of why men do what they do in a war."
"pfrantz","8","1","5","24 February 2005"," Hayakawa was well known as a linguistics professor and author in California.
","The lead Japanese actor in the film, S.I. Hayakawa, was not only a prominent actor but a writer and professor of linguistics at San Francisco State University. He was teaching there in 1973 when Hawaii was becoming a largely Japanese island and when many Asian immigrants were living on the West Coast of the U.S.A. He was the chief spokesperson for the elimination of English as the sole official language of both the islands and mainland of the U.S.A.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from an article written about his quarrel with the U.S. government's policy of closest association with Great Britain: ""The late semanticist S. I. Hayakawa, the movement's elder statesman, never tired of quoting Theodore Roosevelt at his most intolerant: 'We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding-house' ([1919] 1926: XXIV, 554)."""
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","9","6 June 2011"," Lean's Epic is Certainly Among the All-Time Greats
","Bridge on the River Kwai, The (1957) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>British soldiers held in a POW camp must build a bridge for the Japanese but while the prisoners are building it they're unaware that there are already plans for it to be destroyed. THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI picked up seven Oscars and it's also picked up the reputation as being one of the greatest war movies ever made and in my opinion it deserves ever bit of praise it's gotten over the years. Yes, you could get upset that the ""true events"" weren't shown 100% accurate but this is a movie and not a documentary. With that said, Lean's epic is grand on just about every scale and it's truly amazing how much power the two halves of the film are. I say two halves because we pretty much get two different stories being told in the movie. The first half deals with British Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) battling with Japanese Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) over the rules of war. The second half of the film deals with the building of the bridge and the Allies plan on destroying it. Of the two portions of the film I must say that I prefer the first half due to the brilliant performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. The two men are so perfect in their roles and they bring such an intensity to their performances that you really do get sucked into their situation and try to see both points of view. Guinness has always gotten the recognition that he deserves and he even picked up an Oscar for his performance but I think it's unfair that Hayakawa has gotten overlooked in some ways. I thought Hayakawa did a remarkable job with the performance because you hate him for being the enemy and doing the things that he does but at the same time the actor is so good at showing someone doing the job put in front of them that you can look past him being a villain and see that he's a human as well. The scenes with the two actors battling and trying to break one another are tremendously done and certainly rank among some of the greatest stuff ever made. The supporting cast includes a strong William Holden as an American soldier caught up in the events and Jack Hawkins as a doctor who doesn't always see things the same as Guinness. The film on a technical level is pitch-perfect from the terrific cinematography to the striking music score and of course the landmark whistling, which has certainly became one of the most memorable things of any film ever made. Lean's direction is just right for the material because he can not only handle the more psychological stuff earlier in the film but also the more action paced finale. As for the ending, the final ten-minutes is pure, 100% suspense as the action really goes into emotion and ends in a very emotional and powerful way. People will always argue about what is or isn't the greatest pictures ever made and you can even break those arguments down into sub-genres. When the debate starts about the greatest war movies ever made it's nearly impossible to think of any list not including this movie."

","Throughout most of the film's run time this is a highly engaging and philosophically compelling war epic. Lean's masterful eye is evident throughout the film and the film's scope is what one has come to expect from Lean. The vivid colors are contrasted with the British stiff upper lip. The bridge is treated almost as totem. The film movies and feels much short than the 3 hour run.<br/><br/>Best of all Guinness' Col. Nicholson is a comic-tragic figure of propriety at the expense everything else. It is clear that his truly does miss the forests from the trees. Guinness is very engaging and he does not lean into the more comedic elements of the character; it might be his best role. All in all this is very stirring epic until the very end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the script's detached tone and commitment to not judge any of its character falters at the end. Nicholson's fate as well as the Clipton's repeated line of ""Madness"" hammers the point of the absurdity of war far to hard. The building of a proper bridge already made that clear; we do not need a sympathetic character to spell that out for us. It greatly mars the final film.<br/><br/>The ending is a let down for what had come before on every level; even Donald's reading of ""Madness"" is off putting. Fortunately what comes before is masterful. Good film. It could have been great."

A major contribution to the music score's success is due to Malcolm Arnold's use of K.J. Alford's ""Colonel Bogey March"".<br/><br/>COMMENT: Although I'd agree with a minority of critics that William Holden, fine actor though he is, doesn't quite belong in this movie, it still ranks as an outstanding achievement in all departments. I'm inclined to agree for once with the Press Book superlatives, headlined here as BRITAIN'S GREATEST MOTION PICTURE TRIUMPH! Maybe a little less than ""greatest"" as there are a number of films including The Red Shoes, Great Expectations, The Winslow Boy, The Third Man, Henry V and Owd Bob which have equal if not superior claims. But a great British triumph certainly. Thanks mainly to Guinness, Hayakawa, Hildyard, Arnold, and Lean.<br/><br/>ANOTHER REVIEW: The movie holds up reasonably well. The conflict between three national types represented by Guinness, Hayakawa and Holden is not only well observed and sharply presented, but still holds true these twenty years later. Holden is not outdone or out- acted or even over-classed. In fact he holds up his end remarkably well. Hawkins does not have a principal role, but heads the A-1 support cast... Not only a marvelous technical triumph, but powerful, perhaps even too forceful entertainment (to use that word in its broadest sense). Only the somewhat ambiguously too-ironical conclusion fails to fully satisfy and drive the message really solidly home. — J.H.R. in Sydney Shout (December 1977)."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","26 June 2017"," The battle of will between two monolithic soldiers of war
","Director David Lean's earlier war movie, this one taking place in the jungles of Burma. A group of British soldiers have been captured by the Japanese, but their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), instantly clashes with the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who he sees trying to undermine the rules of war by forcing the officers into manual labour alongside their men. Whereas Saito sees Nicholson as a traitor to the rules of war for having surrendered alive. Also, soon after the British have arrived, an American soldier named Shears (William Holden) manages to escape.<br/><br/>Lean takes us on a long journey in this film. The duality of war's conventions and rules being put against the sheer savagery of it is examined through the characters of Nicholson and Saito - and to a lesser degree Shears and the company he keeps. War is horrendous and oftentimes meaningless, but quite often men try to deal with this by forcing artificial rules onto it. Rules, which become so precious to them, that they cannot adapt them or operate outside of them. And in a way this is just as horrendous and meaningless.<br/><br/>This film lives by its grand scope and the talent of its actors. And luckily both of those work very well. Guinness is hands down the most memorable performance and the one that embodies the themes of the movie the best, but the rest of the cast is also very good. The film is also shot beautifully, with some great scenes and sets included.<br/><br/>The Bridge on the River Kwai doesn't quite live up to the grandeur of Lawrence of Arabia, but it is still a fine piece of war cinema and well worth a watch for all interested."
"henryonhillside","10","0","1","9 June 2017"," Historical Accuracy is Not Relevant Here
","I write this review as a response to another review here at IMDb.com (the first review listed, as of 6/9/2017, titled ""Good film, but a travesty of history,"" written by someone with the screen name ""gcaplan"").<br/><br/>The review by gcaplan states as follows: ""I am normally an admirer of David Lean. But it is difficult to understand why he chose to base this film on a real event at the River Kwai, as it grossly misrepresents the real 'Colonel Nicholson' and caused considerable distress to both him and the River Kwai veterans. The Colonel Nicholson character is based on the allied camp commander, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey, who was a remarkable officer by any standards.""<br/><br/>I have the greatest respect for the sacrifices of the warriors of World War II and for historical facts. I would urge upon reviewer ""gcaplan"" the following thought: making a great Hollywood film that will sell tickets to millions of people is not necessarily connected to historical accuracy. David Lean did not consider himself bound by historical fact as he made this film. He considered himself bound by the need to deliver a great and inspiring movie-going experience to movie-goers of the world. In my opinion, this is the only criteria a filmmaker should adhere to, unless he/she is making a documentary film.<br/><br/>History, generally speaking, is too squishy, too-spread-out, too ambiguous, too complex, too lacking in the elements of drama to produce a good two- or three-hour film or script or play unless you play around with the facts, compress stuff, tweak people's characters so as to make them more understandable and/or more dramatic. Shakespeare knew this. Robert Bolt (""A Man For All Seasons"") knew this. David Lean knew this. If you're spending a fortune making a two- or three-hour production that intends to appeal to lots of people, and you're dealing with history, you've got to simplify in spots, enhance in spots, move things around. Above all you've got to create drama and conflict that's readily graspable. Otherwise you're just doing a vanity project. If you've got millions of dollars to spend on a vanity project, fine, do what you want, but if you want a return on your investment, as most filmmakers do, you'd better create a great story with vivid and dramatic conflict.<br/><br/>Lean's creation of the Col. Nicholson of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (with a lot of help from Alec Guinness, needless to say) was a key step toward generating dramatic conflict in the script and thus creating a great film. Minus this depiction of Nicholson we have a lesser film - in fact, we probably have a nothing film that few people pay money to see.<br/><br/>I am skeptical of the assertion by reviewer ""gcaplan"" that the film has caused ""considerable distress"" to the brave and strong survivors of this prison hell. I'm inclined to think they're tougher than that. I would like to see substantive evidence for this assertion in the form of a specific citation, since this assertion is the crux of gcaplan's review. I suggest the possibility that the film has caused SOME distress to SOME of the survivors of this hell, and has been loved by others, who recognize that, minus Lean's monumental effort to create dramatic tension, virtually no one would have ever heard of the movie, nor of the bridge, nor of them - surely no one in the younger generation. As it is, everyone who loves great movies has heard of these men and regards them as great.<br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a true depiction of what might happen to men at war. It is not true in terms of actual facts and makes no pretensions in that regard. Down here in the real world, millions of people seek entertainment. They got it from this film. It's possibly the best World War II film; it has nothing to do with the actual facts; and I say to David Lean, WTG. Well done, to have the guts and talent to take a less-than-cinematic story, tweak it, massage it, re-write it and make a great cinematic story.<br/><br/>By the way, the facts of the great bridge can be found by anyone who cares to do a bit of looking. I urge them to do so."

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a remarkable epic by David Lean, and in my opinion, better than his later work of Lawrence of Arabia. The trials and tribulations of the various people on both sides, trying to make their way through a war and return home with honor, while separated from combat in the confines of a remote POW camp, makes for a gripping tale. It also provides provocative material on leadership and duty. <br/><br/>As a military man myself, it is interesting to see how Nicholson (Alec Guinness in his best performance) attempts to balance and justify helping and serving his men while also subjugating himself to a degree of collaboration with the enemy and gaining personal honor for himself. Saito's struggles in having to swallow his pride and admit reliance upon those he has imprisoned is also fascinating.<br/><br/>The resulting climax of this movie is a spectacular finish to an epic adventure through both the jungle and the human condition.

","Often cited as one of the greatest films of all time, David Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai is a colossal war movie, a big-budget action extravaganza, and, in many ways, a deep psychological study of the affects of battle and imprisonment. Bridge marked Lean's transformation from British art-house and kitchen-sink drama director to international mega-director, and while the film is nowhere near as perfect and polished as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), it is a thrilling and thoughtful story expertly executed, featuring one of the most heart-pounding climaxes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In 1943, a flock of British World War II prisoners arrive at a Japanese POW camp in Burma. The senior commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), instantly clashes with camp commandant Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), refusing to order his officers to help his men build a railway bridge that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon, as such an order is a violation of Geneva Conventions. Nicholson's refusal lands him and his officers in the 'oven' - an iron box out in the sun - while the construction of the bridge is left to the rest of the soldiers, who naturally sabotage the work every chance they get. With Saito facing ritual suicide should the bridge fail to meet the deadline, he allows Nicholson to take over, developing a reluctant respect for the stubborn Brit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, American prisoner Shears (William Holden) narrowly escapes the camp with his life, finding help in some native villagers who feed and nurse him, and send him on his way down river. As he enjoys his hospital stay with a pretty blonde nurse, he is approached by Brit Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who informs Shears that he has been transferred from the U.S. Navy to the British army to assist in a commando mission, that is to be led by Warden, to blow up the bridge over the River Kwai shortly after its completion. Shears is appalled at the idea, but with the threat of punishment for posing as an officer looming over his head, he has no choice but to return the deadly jungle terrain he thought he had left behind for good.<br/><br/>The two stories are perfectly paced and structured, with the first half of the movie mainly dedicated to Nicholson's arrival at the camp and his desire to keep up his men's morale, with the second half spent with Shears, Warden, and their near-impossible mission. Guinness wasn't convinced of his performance as Nicholson, but his proud, wilful and heavily conflicted Nicholson is some of the best work he's ever done. When he is finally given command of the bridge, he instructs his men to build the best damn bridge possible, and they obey, somewhat confused. While it may seem like he's giving his men something to live for in such horrible, sweltering conditions, it soon transpires that there is more going on. Is it obsession, treason, or madness? It never becomes clear, and this mystery is of the many reasons why the film is still so fascinating almost 60 years on.<br/><br/>A lot has been written about the lack of historical accuracy, as the events covered in the film are somewhat similar to the building of the bridge over the Mae Klong by a mixture of European prisoners of war. The criticism is somewhat unfair, as Lean's film makes no claim to be based on actual events, and is instead an adaptation of Pierre Bouelle's novel Le Pont de la Riviere Kwai. If there is a valid criticism to be had, it is that the conditions of the camp are incredibly softened, and the Japanese ineptness for construction seems extremely unfair. The film should instead be enjoyed for what it is, a riveting action movie with emotionally and psychologically complex characters, featuring some outstanding on-location cinematography during an era when movies were still being filmed using sets. It won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Guinness, Best Director and Best Cinematography, and deservedly so."

","The movie withstands the test of time, meaning that the story still resonates, decades after the movie's initial release. It depicts prisoners of war and deals with ethical issues that transcends time. A British commander deludes himself into believing that he is doing something good when in fact he is a shameless collaborationist who is selling out his country to satisfy his own vanity. Every member of the cast deliver excellent performances. That is especially true of Jack Hawkins and William Holden. Alec Guinness plays the Colonel. His performance is singularly impressive and iconic. He sets the standard for the depiction of the pompous and arrogant military officer type. The problem with the movie is its ending. It is too abrupt and given the Colonel's intense and deep emotional investment in the bridge, there is no way that he would suddenly realize the reprehensible nature of his actions. He is too deluded. But the movie redeems him, raising him to the level of a tragic figure, the good man who goes astray. The question is: was he really a good man?<br/><br/>Additional comments after having watched the movie again. The movie's final scene is harrowing. All the principal characters die over a bridge that had become the focal point of a power struggle between two men who hated each other yet were forced to work together. The bridge was built not out of love but out of hate. In doing so, both protagonists bring dishonor to themselves. Nicholson becomes a collaborationist while Saito forfeits his authority. When Nicholson finally realizes the folly of what he had done, it is too late. The bridge is gone along with the men who died for nothing."

","David Lean's epic about the construction of a bridge by POWs won him his first Oscar. I understand that much of what the movie depicts is fictional, but it's among the most impressive fiction. The ambient heat in the Burmese setting is nothing compared to the tension between the POWs and the captors. As Sessue Hayakawa's colonel proclaims, the rules don't apply in wartime.<br/><br/>Alec Guinness - still several years away from playing a certain Jedi mentor - is particularly impressive as the British officer. His refusal to let the Japanese break him reminds me of Louis Zamperini's will to survive and maintain his dignity in the recent ""Unbroken"".

","David Lean's epic The Bridge on the River Kwai is a formidable arsenal, a slickly calculated piece of entertainment, an angry razz at the thing called war, a despairing salute to the men war makes and above all, an ironic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Despite being held in a Japanese POW camp in Burma, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) still runs his regiment by the military textbook. However, Nicholson meets his match in the domineering prison commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), and the two find themselves on a collision course when Saito gets orders to build a railroad bridge vital to Japan's war effort, over the murky river Kwai. Initially, the English balk. But later, to Saito's utter confusion, Nicholson decides to uphold British military traditions with his men and uses the construction of the bridge to prove the mettle of the British soldiers, seeing it as an exercise in keeping up their morale. While the British see such a stance as nothing short of collaboration, the stiff upper lipped officer sees it as a matter of pride. Meanwhile, American Navy man Shears (William Holden) miraculously escapes from Saito's camp, only to be conscripted to return and destroy the bridge the inmates are building. While clearly a suicide mission, he agrees, hoping that Nicholson and his men won't somehow stall the raid. The daring mission is discovered, moments before fulfillment, by Nicholson, now unbalanced by the ""glory"" of his bridge-building feat, which in turn leads to an excruciatingly tense climax.<br/><br/>The Bridge on the River Kwai carries us through a particularly rough reality - that sometimes, the line between cooperation and collusion is razor thin. The best parts of the movie concentrate on this dilemma, delivered by David Lean in a way that makes even the most mundane concept seem superlative. He displays an artistic and aesthetic acumen that marries material to meaning in a way that is almost impossible to copy. He also guides his performers through a series of fine portrayals. Holden is easy and credible in a role that is the pivot point of the story while Hayakawa is solidly impressive as the despotic Colonel Saito, limning him as an admixture of cruelty and correctness born out of a lifetime of training. But the film unquestionably belongs to Guinness. He etches an unforgettable portrait of the typical British army officer, strict, didactic and serene in his adherence to the book. It's a performance of tremendous power and dignity.<br/><br/>What eventually elevates it to the rank of an artistic triumph is the engrossing entertainment it purveys. Suffice it to say, it's a masterpiece. And an epic one at that!"

","The Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent movie and definitely one of the best of it's time. Yes, it's another world war 2 story, however, it's completely different from all the rest and shows us some of the events that took place elsewhere during this time of war.<br/><br/>As many of you probably know, this movie is based on real life events. In many ways, I believe that the message being portrayed throughout the film shows us the ""other"" harsh realities of war, not just soldiers dying in battle, but soldiers fighting to survive under harsh conditions, the pride of a captain who stands by his code, the pride of a Japanese captain and overall how both parties realise that war is what it is and we have to make the best out of each situation to survive.<br/><br/>When I first decided to see this movie, I thought it was going to be very mediocre and plain. It was not. On several occasions they managed to keep the plot interesting and create new character developments from both the leading actors as well as the supporting actors that made the story enjoyable to watch.

","I saw this at the cinema as a 17 year - old and was most impressed by the sheer size and sweep of the film - a characteristic,I later learned of most David Lean productions.Mr A.Guiness represented the bulldog spirit and unquestionable integrity of the British officer - class and the various jolly cockney,witty scouses,dour northeners in the ranks were typical of the portrayals of rank and file soldiery we had come to expect in just over a decade of obsession with the role of the armed forces in the second world war. Mr S.Hayakawa was eminently hissable as the evil Oriental who was eventually outwitted by our brave and stubborn Col.Nicholson. Nearly sixty years and many viewings later I have come to realise that ""Bridge on the River Kwai is still a hugely impressive film and Mr A.Guiness is even better than I first thought,but that my reading of the film was all wrong. Mr Lean has in fact borrowed deeply from Joseph Conrads""Heart of darkness""with a plot about a rogue officer with his own agenda running what is virtually his own private army in cahoots with the enemy to the extent that an assassin is sent on a mission to kill him. Col.Nicholson,in short,is as mad as a sack of weasels and his obsession with building the eponymous bridge,rather than giving his chaps something to do and improve their conditions,is considerably aiding the Japanese Imperial Forces and the movement of their troops. The last third of the film detailing the efforts of Mr J.Hawkins and Mr W.Holden to destroy the bridge is amongst Mr Leans's best work,taut, with beautifully conceived editing,and a wonderfully managed climax where Nicholson finally realises the blind alley his obsession has led him into. ""What have I done?""he asks as the first train is about to cross the bridge and he stumbles around on the sand seeing the explosives set by Mr Hawkin's commandos exposed by low tide. In ""Heart of darkness"",Kurtz's last words are ""The horror,the horror"". As the bridge finally blows up, Mr J.Donald mutters ""Madness,madness"",which isn't too far removed from that. With the possible exception of ""Lawrence of Arabia""(maybe just a little self - indulgent)Mr Lean never again made a film so near to perfection that was so ambiguous and no character that was so complex. Undoubtedly one of the best ""British"" movies ever made."
"g-bodyl","10","0","2","26 February 2015"," A Flawless Piece of Cinema History!
","The Bridge on River Kwai is another example of great filmmaking from the Golden Age of Cinema. I shouldn't be surprised with the pedigree of the cast and that the director is the renowned David Lean. The film may approach three hours, but it a work of legacy and one of the greatest war films ever made. This film features underlying drama and some spectacular battle scenes towards the end. Also the ruthless treatment of the POW camp towards the British colonel was hard to watch, but it was fitting towards how the Axis powers actually treated the Allies. <br/><br/>David Lean's film is about a British colonel named Nicholson who he and his men were captured by the Japanese. After enduring endless amounts of torture, Nicholson is able to convince the commander of the camp, Saito to allow him to help design the bridge they are tasked to building. However, the Allies hatch a plot, whom Nicholson is completely oblivious of, to destroy the bridge. <br/><br/>If you want fine acting, you have come to the right place. Alec Guinness truly absorbs himself into the role of Nicholson and we see his acting ability fly high as Nicholson endures Japanese brutality to convince them to do what he wants. Sessue Hayakawa as Saito was indeed very good in his role as we see personal greed overcome his character. William Holden was excellent and does not hold back as the sarcastic American soldier, Shears. We also get a strong performance from Jack Hawkins as Major Warden, the man who knows his explosives. <br/><br/>Overall, The Bridge on River Kwai is probably one of the top ten films ever made. Any young person should view this film, as this epic holds up very well. It may be historical fiction, but it does have its place in history. This is the kind of film David Lean knows how to make, just like his other films like Lawrence of Arabia. Those who watch this film for the first time will be rewarded with such rich cinema Everything about the film: the acting, directing, cinematography, score, and plot just screams perfection. One of the greatest war films ever made. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"brchthethird","9","0","1","5 February 2015"," A powerful statement on the madness of war
","Why I waste my time watching all of the newest films that come out (of course, not all of them are bad) when there are plenty of tried-and-true classics waiting to be discovered is something I'll never completely understand. It's not even like I have the excuse that I don't know about them, or even don't have the time (because I do). Still, I do like the feeling of seeing something for the first time and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI delivered everything I expected and more. The story is set during WWII and is about a group of British POWs who arrive at a Japanese labor camp in the Burmese jungle (modern-day Myanmar). They are tasked with building a bridge over the Kwai River, but initially have difficulty because the camp's commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has a clash of wills with their own commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness). There is also an American POW, Shears (William Holden) who manages to escape but is ""recruited"" to lead a team back to the jungle to blow up the bridge.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that David Lean knows how to do, it's craft an epic film and that's exactly what he did here. It did drag a little bit for me in the first hour, but it was an engrossing watch after that point. It almost goes without saying that this film is perfect from a technical standpoint, and some truly great images were captured. The acting was also just as good, especially from the three key players: Alec Guiness, Sessue Hayakawa, and William Holden. Each of them brought their A-game and turned in probably the best performances of their entire careers. One aspect of the story I really liked was the psychological battle of wills that occurs between Saito and Nicholson. Both of them were equal in rank, but also similar in their approach to their own specific situations. One might say that they were cut from the same cloth. William Holden rounds out this trio of characters by portraying a man who is drafted for a difficult task in spite of his desire to just keep on surviving, and in a cruel turn of irony, puts him at cross-purposes with Nicholson who feels like he is doing good work by building the bridge.<br/><br/>Although the film plays it rather close to the vest in terms of message-making, only really making its statement in the final minutes, I thought that it handled the subject of war in a rather balanced and mature way despite taking a stand against it. Nobody is turned into a villain, instead having each major character be an unwitting foil to the other in a way that suggests what is later explicitly stated (by the medic) as madness. It's not perhaps the most original of anti-war statements, but it was portrayed to extremely good effect. Also, the last 20 minutes or so is as riveting and tense as anything that has come out since. Granted, it's not perfect as there is a rather superfluous romance between Shears and his nurse but, studio-mandated love interest aside, this film stands as not only one of the best anti-war films ever made, but one of the best films period."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","18 January 2015"," Slightly Underwhelming But A Memorable Piece Of Work Nonetheless
","There's a lot to admire about The Bridge on the River Kwai. It's a grand production put together amazingly well by David Lean & benefits greatly from his composed direction, some wonderful performances as well as its expertly executed third act. Yet when compared to its near- unanimous praise, it turned out to be slightly underwhelming experience for me.<br/><br/>The story of The Bridge on the River Kwai is set in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War where the newly arrived British prisoners of war are ordered to construct a railway bridge; a task which is later overseen by their senior officer after his conditions are accepted but he's completely oblivious of the allies' plan to destroy it.<br/><br/>Directed by David Lean, this is the second film of his that I've seen, first being Lawrence of Arabia & he really seems to have a knack when it comes to handling a huge cast. Production design work is breathtaking, camera-work is controlled, editing is what I've a problem with for the film felt overlong & its finely composed score has one really catchy piece.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins & others, and their performances are very good. Holden chips in nicely & also brings along the much appreciated humour. Hawkins enters the film quite late yet leaves his mark in the end. But this is Guinness' show all the way plus there's one scene showing him walking from one place to another & the way he did it, it's a classic moment right there.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, it's not difficult to determine why The Bridge on the River Kwai is considered a memorable classic. It's enjoyable, entertaining & even rewarding but being a long film, it also requires a bit of patience. The final act is easily one of the best ones around for it is incredibly tense, ingeniously filmed & culminates the story on a stunning high. Even though the film didn't match my expectations, I've no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. Definitely worth a shot."
"disinterested_spectator","10","0","1","6 January 2015"," American Versus British Values
","This movie is about a clash of cultures, partly between East and West, the Orient and the Occident, but even more so between America and Great Britain, between American cynicism, individualism, and egalitarianism on the one hand, and idealistic, class-conscious British collectivism on the other.<br/><br/>Shears is the sole American in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, while the rest of the prisoners are British. This underscores his individualism. It turns out later that he is really an enlisted man posing as an officer, showing his contempt for class distinctions. He thought being an officer would mean that he would not have to work as hard as a prisoner. Since that did not go as planned, he bribes the guards to give him light duty. And he regularly ridicules the British dedication to the war effort.<br/><br/>The British on the other hand regard the distinction between officers and enlisted men as sacrosanct. This is especially embodied in commanding officer Colonel Nicholson, who balks when he finds out, as did Shears, that the Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito, requires officers to work right alongside the enlisted men. He refuses to order his men to work and suffers several days of harsh punishment as a result. Saito eventually has to relent and let the British officers merely supervise the work of enlisted men, because he needs to get the title bridge built.<br/><br/>But then, half-way through the movie, after Shears has escaped and winds up in a British hospital, everything goes into reverse. Major Warden, a British officer, coerces Shears into going back to sabotage the railroad bridge in the camp he escaped from, which will allow Shears to avoid being prosecuted for impersonating an officer. The other member of the team will be Lieutenant Joyce, so Warden says he will make Shears a major for the purpose of the mission, so that the rigid distinction between officers and enlisted men will not have to be observed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the jungle, Nicholson is anxious to get the bridge built, and to build it as an example of British engineering excellence. The other officers are in favor of surreptitiously delaying the building of the bridge and making sure that it is inferior, so as to minimize their assistance to the enemy, but Nicholson thinks that building a bridge that will redound to British glory for hundreds of years is more important than its effect on the war. Furthermore, when he realizes that they are behind schedule, he violates the very code he fought for, and gets the officers to work alongside the enlisted men. He even asks men in the camp hospital to get out of their beds and pitch in.<br/><br/>In spite of himself, Shears ends up being the officer in charge of the mission, sacrificing himself in order to destroy the bridge, while Nicholson dies realizing the enormity of what he has done."

I am not implying that I have watched every war movie out there but of the one I have I can honestly say this movie is really unique. This movie is great for a number of reasons but what really makes this movie great in my opinion is that it does not glorify war like some movies (G.I Joe an obvious example) or show the tragedies of war (one example is Full Metal Jacket.) This movies shows war in a totally different light. War is not good or mad but a matter of principle. Both Colonel Nicholson and Colonel Saito are crazy and would rather dying than give in to the other. The struggle between these two for me show that war is not good or bad but a struggle and both you and your enemy are in the same struggle, the struggle to succeed, the struggle to survive. Not everything is black and white.<br/><br/>Another dynamic that plays into the movie is that at the same time this bridge is trying to be built the British forces are trying to destroy the bridge. This movie does a really good job of showing different sides to this struggle, not just the POW's side but also who the Japanese commander' side and also the British trying to destroy's side throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, This movie had some amazing performances by Alec Guinness who played Colonel Nicholson, Sessue Hayakawa who played Colonel Saito, but I really enjoyed everyone in this movie and I didn't think this movie had a bad performance. Also this movie had amazing directing by David Lean, editing by Peter Taylor and cinematography by Jack Hildyard. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the greatest movies in cinema history.

I remember watching it on TV a few times with my dad when I was about 7-12 years old and even then, with such little understanding of the world and its social workings, I was fascinated by the picture and knew it was great -- even then.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: A platoon of British soldiers are brought to a Japanese POW camp in Burma during World War II to help build a strategic railway bridge over the River Kwai. The Jap Colonel in charge of the camp, Saito, insists that the British officers work along with the enlisted men. The British Colonel, Nicholson, stubbornly objects to this based on the Geneva Convention, a copy of which he carries around in his pocket. He insists that there are rules to be followed, even in war. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two. Ultimately Nicholson is put in charge of building the bridge, which he takes so much pride in he fails to see that he's aiding the enemy. Meanwhile, an American sailor, Shears, escapes the camp and later leads a group of Brits on a mission to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>Although Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, is a fascinating character -- an ultra-proper stiff-upper-lip Brit -- and certainly worthy of respect as far as his utter boldness goes, he's what my dad would call a ""goon."" (My dad served during WWII and died in 1988). Nicholson is so infected by pride, stubbornness and a sense of superiority that he can't see the obvious. Yes, he's a realistic and fascinating character, but I find him to be a total moron who can't see the forest for the trees. It goes without saying that I can't relate to him at all.<br/><br/>Colonel Saito, the Japanese commander of the camp, ultimately accepts that it's in his best interest to allow Nicholson to believe he's running the show in order to get the bridge built. This is obviously a struggle for Saito because he has pride as well; but he refuses to allow it to get in the way of fulfilling his mission. 'Let Nicholson build the bridge and believe he's in charge and superior,' he seems to figure, 'In reality he's my pawn and a pawn of the Japanese military machine.' (Others may interpret this scenario differently, likely suggesting that Saito is the loser in the test of wills, moping around in bewildered defeat throughout the rest of the picture, but that's not what's really going on IMHO).<br/><br/>William Holden expertly plays Shears, the American who escapes the camp and comes back to attempt to destroy the bridge. He's the the character I relate to most. On the surface he appears completely selfish -- doing whatever he must to survive, including lying and bribing. Shears has lived with the madness of war the longest and naturally develops a sarcastic, anti-hero callousness to protect himself and survive with his sanity intact. Despite the negative, selfish vibe you get from Shears, he never loses his humanity. He refuses to become an inhuman machine like Nicholson or Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), the latter of whom leads the British mission to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>For example, as Warden and his party travel through the jungle Warden becomes injured and insists that the rest leave him behind to die, arguing that he would do precisely the same if anyone else was injured. Shears blows up at this point; he's seen enough of this idiotic machine-like do-or-die mentality. He yells, ""You make me sick with your heroics! ... You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like gentlemen? How to die by the rules? When the only important thing is how to live like a human being!"" As captivating as the first hour is with the psychological conflict between Nicholson and Saito, the remaining hour and 41 minutes is even more engaging as the two story lines develop and ultimately converge: Nicholson building the bridge and celebrating its completion, along with his now-comrade Saito, while Shears & Warden and their team travel to the bridge and attempt to implement it's destruction.<br/><br/>I just saw the film the other day but hadn't seen it for 8 years or so and I actually forgot exactly how it ended, as far as who dies, etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any major details away; you've probably forgotten the details as well, that is, if you've even seen it before. In any event, the ending is brilliant and potent. The Allied doctor of the camp looks on in utter disbelief at the climatic results. ""Madness... madness..."" is all he can manage to mutter. Powerful.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is filmmaking of the highest order on every level. The Sri Lanka locations are breath-taking. The only negative I can muster is that parts of the score are understandably dated seeing as how it was released in 1957. But that whistling theme is hugely memorable, of course.<br/><br/>I could probably write a book about all the great scenes, lines and points the film makes but I'd rather you discover (or re-discover) everything for yourself. There's so much depth here that you'll get something new with each viewing. It goes without saying that ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is one of the best pictures ever made and one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","This film is nothing short of one of the greatest pieces of cinematic genius I have ever seen. It shows two sides of many things. Take for example Colonel Nicholson. Colonel Nicholson is a savior to his fellow British soldiers, yet he can also be viewed as a traitor. Commander Shears who was a former prisoner at the camp, and later leads the attack on the bridge, was impersonating an officer. A court martial offense. But he also led the United States and the United Kingdom to victory by blowing up the bridge. Colonel Saito, who was the commandant of the prison camp, was a sadist and was a monster. But he was willing to make necessary compromises with Colonel Nicholson on the construction of the bridge. Anyway let's look at the plot. A new group of Royal Army soldiers have been captured by the Imperial Japanese Army and have been placed in a Japanese prison camp. In other words hell. Anyway the commandant Colonel Saito, and the commanding officer of the prisoners Colonel Nicholson, don't agree with each other. Saito wants all prisoners, including officers to work on a bridge that will connect from the island the camp is on to another island I think. But as this is against the Geneva Convention, Colonel Nicholson won't allow it. Saito retaliates by putting the British officers in confinement. And putting Colonel Nicholson in the oven. Meanwhile US sailor Commander Shears, who was already a prisoner at the camp escapes. When he makes it back to an allied base they give him a mission to blow up the bridge that the prisoners are working on. Colonel Nicholson eventually agrees to Saito's commands and officers work on the bridge as well. It end in a spectacular battle against the allied special forces, and the allied prisoners who seem to have forgotten their allegiance. I highly recommend this movie."

","What could one possibly add to the accolades this film has had heaped upon it. The fact that it may not be historically accurate is of no consequence, as it was made for the theater, not the History Channel.<br/><br/>David Lean's master piece showing the madness of war stands the test of time. It swept the Oscars in 1958, winning Best Picture, Best Director for Lean, Best Actor for Alec Guinness in the role that defines him, and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Sessue Hayakawa. It also took the awards for Writing. Music, Editing and Cinematography.<br/><br/>Guinness was a perfect example of British pride. If you are going to do a job, then do it right. In that, he managed to take care of his men at the same time. William Holden was a perfect example of a soldier who just wanted to go home, as I am sure was the feeling of most. He recognized the madness of war long before the good doctor. This is a film that you can watch year after year and never get tired of it."

","I enjoyed the Bridge on the River Kwai a lot more than I initially remembered doing. Not having seen it for a considerable time a lot of the plot points and story where lost to me. In a lot of ways it is very similar to most other war films. A lot of the characters are certainly the same and are almost interchangeable.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the film is probably the first hour. I really enjoy the coming to terms scenes of the two Conoels. It is well acted and portrayed in a believable and enjoyable way. The interplay between the two characters is well done. Alec Guiness portrays the stuffy Conoel Nicholson perfectly, he is once again superb. I especially enjoy the scene where he and the other officers stare down a machine gun, reflecting the courage and tenacity which was common place in the military of that time.<br/><br/>The two story threads, one attempting to complete the bridge, one to destroy it, are an obvious contrast to each other, yet they work well and it gives the viewer a sense of knowing dread for both sides as the climax approaches. The bridge building part of the story is the superior to the two, I simply prefer the characters and enjoy watching Alec Guinness slowly descend into obsession with completing the bridge.<br/><br/>The character I really dislike is the American. He embodies all the irritating and stereotypical characteristics which are so common amongst cinematic versions of American characters. It is perhaps a redeeming feature of his character that he is killed rather than saving the day, which is what many would expect such a self righteous character to do.<br/><br/>The ending is fun. The obvious question it leaves is, did Nicholson mean to destroy the bridge or not?"

"ElMaruecan82","10","0","2","13 May 2011"," ""Greatness!"" ""Greatness!"" ...
","I believe the purpose of a good war movie is less to preach or invite to take sides, than to depict war through the devastating effects it operates on sane conscious minds, by making or avoiding it. It's not a hazard that the best movies depicted war as a complex state of mind, exhilarating then alienating.<br/><br/>David Lean's extraordinary merit is to make a film of a war won by the Allies, with no victory at the end, except of cinematic intelligence. Like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""All Quite on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot"", the best war movies deal more generally with defeats, ""Saving Private Ryan"" being a relevant counter-example. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" depicts another vision of victory through Colonel Nicholson, the perfect embodiment of the manic attachment to principles.<br/><br/>Colonel Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) leads the troop of British prisoners to the camp of Colonel Saito, (Sessue Hawakaya). The soldiers' entrance, whistling the ""Colonel Bogey March"" tune is one of the film's most defining moments but interestingly misleading since this is their only 'shining' moment. The rest of the film, we see them idly building the bridge, then more seriously under Nicholson's commandment. We also see them having fun the last night before they leave. This is not supposed to portray the real conditions of Japanese PoW camps, but cinematically, the soldiers are Colonel Nicholson's foil. He's the story's heart, through his psychological conflict with Colonel Saito.<br/><br/>War always reveals dualities, not dual disorders like in psychological thrillers but two visions incarnated by antagonistic characters: Willard vs. Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"", Barnes vs. Elias in ""Platoon"" and here, Nicholson vs. Saito. Quite a practical conflict, it concerns Saito's decision to make the officers build the bridge for the railway that would link between Bangkok and Saigon. This bridge is Saito's mission, his honor and his life depend on it. As an adept of Bushido, Saito wouldn't let failure humiliate him. The officers shall build the bridge because it's their dishonor, which brought the soldiers to the POW camp. But while Nicholson accepts the defeat and the soldiers' obligation to build the bridge, he refuses to participate to the effort invoking Geneva's conventions. Saito whips Nicholson with the book, starting the psychological battle that would lead to one of the most iconic cinematic climaxes.<br/><br/>Nicholson is so attached to his principles he would rather die in the 'Oven', the 'punishment' box standing to the sun not to obey to Saito's personal vision. This is the point, Nicholson, a man of principles, surrendered because it was a military order. But his respectable posture progressively flirts with insanity when it puts his men's lives at stakes. In a particularly memorable scene after Major Clipton, the doctor, meets Nicholson in the oven, the colonel's stubbornness makes him wonder, under a hellish sun, which of Saito or Nicholson is madder  and unconsciously, where this madness will lead to.<br/><br/>To a personal victory for Nicholson, first. Saito, realizing the incompetence of his engineers, accepts Nicholson's conditions and handles this defeat by crying, privately. This is a personal defeat and his childish reaction illustrates how some military decisions, right or wrong, can be driven by personal issues. Saito's defeat is personal; Nicholson's victory is of the British Army, of 'civilization'. And the way Nicholson handles the construction of the bridge illustrates an integrity almost too zealous for his men and for Major Clipton. For Nicholson, it's a matter of keeping his men in shape, and proving the value of his Army for the posterity. Nicholson's project became personal, and his inflexibility automatically pointless.<br/><br/>This rigidity is mocked by another major character of the film, no pun intended, Shears (William Holden) though I must admit, I wasn't too confident with his wisecracking cynicism in the first act, I preferred the wiser 'Shears' during the mission with the Major Warden, blowing up the titular bridge. Shears who pretended to be an officer, is blackmailed in order to accomplish this mission, he's technically a hero for having escaped Saito's PoW but his status of a fraud isn't the best ticket for the Navy Cross. He must come back to the camp; we understand that his odds to survive again will be pretty low.<br/><br/>But I didn't see that ending coming. I said iconic climax, I should have said ironic. More than a war movie, it's all about personal views, and how two opposite sides can co-work to create something. Saito and Nicholson built the bridge with an involvement so personal their complicity is almost romantic in the setting sun scene, where each one contemplates his accomplishment, Saito, who renounced to his dreams for the Army, Nicholson who dedicated his life for it. Ironically, their last collaboration would be to prevent the bridge from exploding.<br/><br/>And in one of the most suspenseful climactic sequences ever, Nicholson, moved by a paternal instinct, tries to save the bridge, causing the death of the allied soldiers. And while the train of Japanese VIP is coming, Nicholson realizes how blinded by his own pride he was in a last flash of realization incarnated by the unforgettable line ""What have I done!"" His last heroic deed would be to die and fall on the detonator, destroying the bridge, the train, and the last ounces of remaining sanity, provoking the immediate reaction of Clipton : ""Madness! Madness!"" <br/><br/>These last lines perfectly summarize the absurdity of war driven by alienation. The chaotic ending is like an implacable victory of fate which decided that each side is equally alienated in this waste. The whole film from the script to its superb climax that made the film for me, is quite cynical in its approach, and that's why I can forgive the music for the ending credits, where I had expected a big silence, like a 'No comment' reaction to an unbelievable madness But as Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) said: ""There's always the unexpected, isn't there?"""
"Eternality","9","0","1","4 April 2011"," The Bridge on the River Kwai is a rousing action-adventure spectacle that is not to be missed.
","There are three kinds of David Lean fans. First, there are people who think that Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is his greatest work. Second, there are people who think that The Bridge on the River Kwai is his greatest work. And of course, there is the third group of people who believe that Lean's best works are made before Kwai, such as Brief Encounter (1945), Great Expectations (1946), and Oliver Twist (1948).<br/><br/>Even though I am a firm admirer of the legendary British filmmaker, I find myself belonging to neither category. But that's because I have not seen enough of his works to make a reasonable claim. However, in the context of the claims by the first two aforementioned groups, I find myself aligning with the stars of the latter.<br/><br/>Could The Bridge on the River Kwai possibly be a more accomplished work than Lawrence of Arabia? In my opinion, I would think so, and from my experience having viewed both films twice, I suggest a strong case for it. In this review, I will stick to the discussion on Kwai, but when necessary, I would use Lawrence as a comparison.<br/><br/>The film that marked the first of five epics that Lean shot in the last three decades of his life, Kwai tells the fictional story of a company of British POWs led by Col. Nicholson (Alex Guinness) who is forced to succumb his power to Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who orders the completion of a bridge across the Kwai river so that trains carrying war supplies could cross it.<br/><br/>What makes Kwai such a fascinating war film is this: Nicholson, in a bid to boost the morale of his men and ease their suffering, decides to build a top-quality bridge for Saito that would become a symbol of British pride after the war. However, in a parallel story, the Allies' counteract by sending a few trained soldiers in explosives to blow up the bridge in a covert operation no one knows.<br/><br/>Set in WWII Burma, but filmed in picturesque Sri Lanka, Kwai's stunning cinematography captures the tropical landscape in both sweltering heat and pouring rain, highlighting the harsh conditions that plague the camp. Lean's wide, sweeping shots and steady close-ups allow the drama and action to unfold in its ""totality"", never disorientating the viewer.<br/><br/>Lawrence of Arabia admittedly features more stunning shots (set in a desert no less), but Kwai is the much tighter film. The latter is paced with more urgency and though both films have moments of ""going through the motions"", it is Kwai that remains to be the more watchable film, and with a more appealing screenplay to boot.<br/><br/>Much of Kwai's watchability also hinges on the Nicholson-Saito relationship. It is an awkward one, but it is interesting to see how it develops. In the film's most understated scene, both characters stroll along the completed bridge. Saito remarks, ""Beautiful, isn't it?"", referring to the sunset (and maybe, symbolistically, Japan's impending decline). Nicholson replies thinking that Saito is referring to the bridge, and starts expressing how it represents his life's greatest achievement as a soldier. Saito does not correct Nicholson and allows him his quiet moment of triumph.<br/><br/>In a way, this scene is the finest indicator of the growing ""comradeship"" between the two enemies in the film. Lean's depiction of WWII boils down to these two characters, as human as anyone else in terms of their fallibility, but are made to look invulnerable to that very perceived fallibility.<br/><br/>The final forty-five minutes is an exercise in suspense-building. And its ending is as climactic as it can get. The last line as uttered by one of Nicholson's men, ""Madness! Madness! Madness!"" chillingly echoes Col. Kurtz's ""The horror! The horror! The horror!"" in Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).<br/><br/>The Bridge on the River Kwai is a rousing action-adventure spectacle that is not to be missed. It is also a towering achievement in Lean's career, proving his versatility in film directing. For better or worse, he would never return to directing small, intimate dramas again after catching the ""epic film bug"". <br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","I enjoyed this film and intend on giving it a 9 out of 10 on IMDb. I considered an 8, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. I was not sure whether or not the bridge was destroyed or how it was going to go down. It was much more dramatic than I could have anticipated. It was a little campy, but Guiness held the ending by watching him realize how far his own ambitions had taken him. Guiness really held the movie together and I felt myself wanting to see him on screen. He really was fantastic and watching him at the end was perfect. I particularly liked seeing compose himself and remind himself that he is a gentleman in each meeting.<br/><br/>I now have a slight man crush on William Holden and not because he was particularly good, but he was really charismatic in a few moments. The guy that played Saito was fantastic though. He had some really solid moments on screen and one can see how Ken Watanabe used this performance for his General in Letters from Iwo Jima. The scenes between Saito and Guiness were all great.<br/><br/>So about the movie as a whole. I can see why it is so highly regarded and it really did feel epic, even on my small laptop, and I cannot even imagine watching this on the big screen. The jungle really did feel formidable and Lean did an excellent job of making it a character all of its own. The open shot did an excellent job of setting that up by combining the graves with thick jungle shots. It was an extremely memorable opening sequence for me. The movie even though it is terribly long never felt long to me and felt really well paced. When the Canadien and Holden start floating down the river the movie felt like an eternity, but in a good way because I really was not sure if that bridge was going to blow and how it would blow. To me it is really interesting that they made this war film without almost no one getting shot and very few on screens deaths. But we really have a great insight what war could do to these individuals and sense of duty that these individuals had. The loyalty of ever type is displayed here and it really is well done.<br/><br/>I have to say one more thing about the ending. I love how they actually blew that stuff up and ran a actual train off the tracks. That is so great. You just cannot see stuff like that anymore. Someone would just do some special effects in the studio and it might look real, but for some reason I loved watching that<br/><br/>So the reasons why it does not get a 10 is because of stupid reasons, but have to be taken into account. First of all I hated that stupid little love thing that they had going on with the local girls carrying their stuff through the woods. Completely unnecessary and just seemed silly. The Canadian was introduced later so they did have that much time to build him up but I felt as if by the end of the movie he was a weaker character. The last thing is probably the silliest, but I do not think the transfer I had was of the best quality so it seemed like some of the colors were blown out. Maybe it was just the quality of the film and the technology they had to colorize it back then, but it did not look the as good as I feel as it could have. It still felt huge and epic, but grainy at times.<br/><br/>I guess that is it. There are probably a few other things, but this is way too long."

","""This is war! This is not a game of cricket!"" yells Japanese POW camp administrator Col. Saito to his British counterpart, Col. Nicholson, during an early scene in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. In actual fact, noted British epic movie director David Lean (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, DR. ZHIVAGO, RYAN'S DAUGHTER) turned one of the darker episodes of World War II, in which 12,000 Allied prisoners of war died while performing slave labor to build a bridge to aid the Japanese war effort, into something almost as buffoonish as the 1960s American TV show about a German POW camp, HOGAN'S HEROES. Normally I give winners of the Best Picture Oscar (which KWAI copped in 1957) a semi-automatic rating of ""10,"" which I had done here from memory of a first viewing years ago. However, upon seeing it again tonight, I realized the ending is so muddled (as in, who killed who?) that I had to revise my vote to a ""9."" That, of course, is as a FICTIONAL story featuring psychology, action, suspense, and a killer soundtrack dominated by Kenneth Alford's ""Colonel Bogey March"" from 1914.

","It doesn't take too long for the soldiers in The Bridge on the River Kwai to start whistling their famous tune. This is essentially a story about the battle of wills. There is actually four wills that come into play, the will of the demanding Japanese prison commander, the law-and-order British colonel, the rebellious American and the other law-and-order British officer/commando. The setup is that the British colonel embraces the task to build the titular bridge as a moral building task for his imprisoned troops and a way to break the will of their Japanese captors. On the other hand, the American and some British commandos vow to destroy said bridge.<br/><br/>This film is very highly regarded by the American Film Institute, critics love it and even the masses of internet users on IMDb.com give it high regard. So I think I went into this film with higher expectations than I should have. It didn't help that director David Lean is also well known and regarded for his historical epics. I liked Lawrence of Arabia, which followed this film, so I figured I'd like this one as much.<br/><br/>Well, I still like it. Upon reflecting on it, I like how the story takes a war situation and creates a battle of wills, rather than weapons. I also like that main conflict is not between Axis and Allies, but between two different philosophies (or, you might even say the same philosophy) between the Allies. I like the epic direction and the acting is very good. The colors and the sets, etc. are all superb as well. But, beyond being a story very well told, I can't really say that I found the piece particularly moving, intellectually, emotionally or viscerally.<br/><br/>The story, as well plotted as it is, seems to lack the human element that gets further mined in Lawrence of Arabia. It's not very personal and although we learn bits about the characters, they are rather simple and static, which could be fatal flaws, but it doesn't convince me of anything or make me feel like I'm watching real human beings. And I suppose that's my main criticism, there is some noticeable feeling of artifice in the whole matter.<br/><br/>But otherwise, it's a very well done work and entertaining as well. I can't love it, but I can say that it's a decent show, if you have over two and a half hours to watch it. 7/10."

","If this story were to be remade today, undoubtedly the characters would possess more diverse sides, and display more dimensions to their personas than this picture reveals. This is a ""1950's film,"" and was made only a decade and a half after the events portrayed occurred, and only 10 years after Japan was just getting back to some semblance of normality after the consequences of World War II.<br/><br/>However, this IS one story which should never be remade, and which is all the better for ""when"" it was produced - in addition to the perfect casting, which could never be replicated.<br/><br/>The four leads were as perfect in their roles, individually and in combination, as one could wish. In addition to their acting talents, per se, their abilities to portray characters of proper relative age are equally notable. At true age of 47, Jack Hawkins' character is about the equivalent in the film. Holden, younger in the film, and Guinness older, were believable, although only two years apart (41 and 43 respectively) in actuality. Most amazing is Sessue Hayakawa - he was 68 - ""pushing 70"" - in 1957, yet one could imagine his character's being a contemporary of Guinness's - even maybe a year or two younger.<br/><br/>Guinness and Holden are among the all-time icons in cinema, and Hawkins almost the equivalent, especially to those familiar with his work in British cinema - but Hayakawa is certainly not remembered as vividly as he ought to be. This can be mostly attributed to the racial stereotyping during his period of work, from early in the 20th century through the period of this picture. But this was a truly gigantic figure for much of this period - and a star who received $200,000 for a film - IN 1919 - as he was turning 30, and several years before the first talking pictures.<br/><br/>""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" has many dimensions - all powerful. It is one work for which the term ""spectacular"" is wholly-applicable, and not some press agent's creation. The juxtaposition of the Hayakawa and Guinness characters, and the interaction between these two is as compelling as anything ever presented on stage or screen.<br/><br/>The characters also ring true - not only in composite in portraying a depiction of World War II in general, and the Pacific Theater in particular - but also in characterizations of human beings in their roles which chance and destiny have placed them. It shows them not only in terms of the wartime circumstances which the world's events have brought upon them, but is also a metaphor of people functioning, persevering, adapting and bearing the consequences of their circumstances and the relationships these have spawned."

","There are so many compelling points of interest in the film that it would be impossible to mention them all here, and that's after only a single viewing. One could debate endlessly about the film's pro-war or anti-war stance, though in my mind it serves admirably to present both points of view. The main characters are magnificently fleshed out and serve their particular viewpoints exceptionally well, even Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne), who comes on the scene rather late in the film.<br/><br/>The war of wills between Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness) and Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) is a virtually one sided battle until Saito comes to realize that his bridge building venture will fail. Nicholson's refusal to have his officers perform manual labor is later turned on it's ear when he allows them to volunteer to do so in order to complete the project on time. In between, Saito unsuccessfully attempts to negotiate terms under which the officers will work. At each step, Saito is outfoxed and outmaneuvered by the wily British officer, who earns the undying loyalty of the men under him. By the time Nicholson commissions volunteers from the sick tent, Saito is seriously contemplating harakiri.<br/><br/>The presence of medical officer Major Clipton (James Donald) serves as a valuable counterpoint to Nicholson's rigidly held beliefs of military responsibility. Clipton presents an argument that is compelling at face value, and without Nicholson's valor, would seem to be the view held by the majority of his soldiers (and viewers of the film). If Nicholson had been unwilling to undergo the rigors of the 'oven' to prove a point, it would not have been held against him. As Clipton pointed out, what military authority would have been the wiser in the grand scheme of things if Nicholson had played along, allowing Saito his concession?<br/><br/>If one needs convincing of the film's potent anti-war message, consider the scene when Lt. Joyce encounters the Japanese soldier in the jungle. Earlier in the film, Joyce is questioned by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) about his willingness and ability to kill in a one on one situation. Joyce and his Japanese counterpart appear to be about the same age, and each appears to be conflicted about killing his opposite. When Warden erupts on screen to stab the Japanese soldier, he's shown afterwards stepping on a picture of the man's wife, surrounded by a rosary. For me, the scene conveys more than anything the futility of war and it's attendant senseless loss of life on the part of otherwise good men whose misfortune happened to be loyalty to their respective countries.<br/><br/>William Holden's character in the film was nothing less than a stroke of genius. Caught as he is in an untenable position by mid film, it's quite the paradox that his stature is mitigated by the fact that he impersonated an officer to get 'light' duty in the prison camp. It's a classic no win situation that sends him back into the jungle where he grows into the story's hero; was there ever any doubt? <br/><br/>On a much lighter note, I wonder how the owner of 'Joey's Garage' in Elk City, Ohio felt to see his calendar in the movie? <br/><br/>It comes as no surprise that ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" was that year's big winner at the Academy Awards with seven Oscars and an additional nomination for Hayakawa. It's a timeless and classic piece of work from Director David Lean, that loses none of it's poignancy and drama after nearly fifty years. It's a great war film, even for non war film fans."

","Few film directors enjoyed such acclaim as the great David Lean. Somewhere between Hobson's Choice and Lawrence Of Arabia, he made this rousing war film set in the steaming jungles of the Far East and featuring many fine performances from a stellar cast.<br/><br/>In a Japanese prison camp in the Far East, American POW Shears (William Holden) witnesses the arrival of a team of captured British soldiers, led by the rigid Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). Nicholson is a man of enormous national pride who refuses to give his captors the satisfaction of seeing him demoralised, and whose stubborn attitude immediately sets him at odds with the Japanese head officer Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Saito is determined to build a railway bridge spanning the adjacent River Kwai and knows that the British soldiers imprisoned in his camp have the engineering skills required to complete such a project. However, since the building of such a bridge would aid the Japanese war effort by providing them with a supply line for their munitions trains, Saito also realises that it will be hard to get them to build it willingly. He plays a psychological game with Nicholson, first subjecting him to prolonged isolation and degradation, then later challenging him to construct a bridge fitting of the British name. Half-mad by now, Nicholson accepts the challenge to build the bridge. but decides to prove that the British can do such things better than anyone else by making it the finest, sturdiest construction imaginable in spite of the punishing conditions and the limited resources. In the meantime, Shears escapes from the POW camp and eventually finds his way to an Allied hospital many miles away. When the British officers learn of the construction of the bridge, they send Shears back to its site so that he can guide a team of saboteurs  among them Major Warden (Jack Hawkins)  whose job it is to destroy the bridge at all costs.<br/><br/>The film is heavily ironic throughout, showing Nicholson to be a man so determined to prove the superiority of the British that he blindly leads his men into constructing a near-perfect bridge for the enemy. Guinness is incredible in the role, going through a full gamut of complex emotions. Hayakawa is almost equally as good as the Japanese colonel who cynically and masterfully manipulates his prisoners. The film is brilliantly shot on location in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), with Lean once more proving that he is the master of the widescreen epic as he and his camera man Jack Hildyard capture the awesome vistas splendidly. At almost three hours, the film is slightly overlong. Also the final sequence, in which the sabotage party face a near-disastrous hiccup in their efforts to destroy the bridge, come across as rather cluttered. Apart from this, however, The Bridge On The River Kwai is an excellent film. It scooped seven Oscars, was a huge box office hit, and cemented Lean's reputation as one of the leading movie makers of all-time. It's a shame they don't make 'em like this any more."

","With ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" David Lean launched the string of ""epics-with-a-soul"" that would dominate the remainder of his career.<br/><br/>In ""Kwai,"" Lean deftly juggles what seem like two entirely different movies to create one strong indictment of war's ability to strip men of their humanity. In one plot line, Alec Guinness, a British officer being held in a Japanese prison camp, locks horns with the commander of the camp (Sessue Hayakawa), who puts Guinness and the other British soldiers in charge of constructing a bridge that will help the Japanese in their struggle to win the war. In the other dominant plot line, William Holden plays the leader of a platoon of men charged with blowing up said bridge. This plot line plays out like an exciting but fairly standard action film. It's the fascinating story of Guinness's transformation, not to mention his spectacular performance, that gives the film its status as a classic. The same quality of British perseverance that made Guinness such a loyal officer for the Allies works in Japanese favor as he becomes committed to building as fine a bridge as possible, forgetting its ultimate purpose. The film very eloquently communicates how noble attributes like loyalty and honor can be manipulated to satisfy what in certain circumstances can be perceived to be dubious ends, which, when you think about it (though few people want to) characterizes the basis of military recruitment everywhere.<br/><br/>""Kwai"" joined a batch of other 1957 releases -- like ""12 Angry Men,"" ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Sweet Smell of Success"" -- in introducing a grittier and at the same time more poetic style of film-making that looked forward to the art-house style that would come into its own throughout the 1960s.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

William holden is very entertaining as a selfish, lying POW who goes through great changes from the beginning to the end of the film, definitely some of his greatest acting.

"krorie","10","0","1","29 May 2006"," Madness! Madness!
","This is one of those rare pieces of cinema that actually deserved all the rewards and accolades it received from the Hollywood establishment. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is outstanding in all departments. Based on a French novel by Pierre Boulle which in turn was a literary adaptation of a true story, director David Lean, with the able assistance of blacklisted screenwriters Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, has fashioned a remarkable motion picture that shows, more than most at first realize, the senselessness and madness of war. Lean was also helped tremendously by Jack Hildyard's cinematography, making the jungles of Ceylon come alive for the camera. One telling scene that pinpoints the majesty of Lean and Hildyard's collaboration is when Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) is lost in the wilds while attempting to escape from the POW camp. A strange looking bird flopping overhead turns out to be a kite. The viewer's mind's eye is engulfed in Shear's plight when suddenly the camera pans to the kite, then shows an entire village with all indications of friendliness toward the lost soul. Only a great director could make the movie goer feel so much a part of what was happening on the wide screen.<br/><br/>Some of the best acting ever put on celluloid takes place in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai."" Alec Guinness becomes Col. Nicholson, a British officer so keyed to the rule book that there is no room for deviation. Yet he has the admirable quality of also being a gentleman and a role model for the men under his command. His fortitude and perseverance in a near death encounter with the Japanese POW commander, Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), make him a martyr for his men and his country. That he becomes so enmeshed in the only material success of his twenty eight years in the British army, building a bridge for the Japanese enemy, only endures him more to his men, with the exception of army physician, Maj. Clipton (James Donald), who sees it as treason or at best an unnecessary collaboration with the enemy. Col. Nicholson becomes so obsessed with the bridge project that it muddles his mind to the extend that for the first time he begins to bend the rules, justifying it through rationalization of keeping morale high among his charges.<br/><br/>Col. Saito is Col. Nicholson's nemesis and foil. Saito bends all the rules for his on egomania; yet he is intelligent enough to know when to falter. It becomes easy for Maj. Clipton to convince Saito not to shoot Nicholson in front of witnesses. Saito sees the bridge project as a means for his own salvation and advancement, also knowing that if he fails he will likely be executed, at best demoted and shamed. Saito not being a by-the-book officer finds it easy after a self-saving catharsis to be pragmatic.<br/><br/>A wild card in the game is the cynic with a conscience, Cmdr. Shears. He has learned to be a con man from his experiences in the US navy at war. Much of the humor in the film is provided by Shears, having some truly laughable comebacks for the ever so serious British officers. Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkins) explains to Shears that there's no time for training for sky diving. ""The consensus of opinion is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump, and hope for the best."" To which Shears retorts dryly, ""With or without a parachute?"" Shears is a foil for both Saito and Nicholson. Thus, the viewer is given three lead characters with diametrically opposed personalities who must interact under desperate circumstances that create metamorphoses in each.<br/><br/>The theme for ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" ""Colonel Bogey March,"" proved so catchy that it became a best selling record. As used by Lean in the picture, ""Colonel Bogey March"" intensifies the defiant attitude of Nicholson and his men, beginning as a group whistle, gradually instrumental accompaniment is added until there is a cacophony, which should have told Saito that this British regiment would be hell to deal with.<br/><br/>Postscript: I saw ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" at a drive-in theater in Sacramento, California, where my brother lived, when I was fourteen years old. The film was released in 1957 and was on the drive-in circuit in the summer of 1958 when I watched it. The passion pit showed more than just grade B zombie flicks. I was impressed with the movie. I have seen it several times since. It is always a treat. Be sure and view the wide-screen version."

","In early 1943, a battalion of British POWs from Singapore, led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), arrive at a Japanese camp along the Kwai River in Thailand, which is commanded by Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), a brutal martinet who is determined to build a bridge across the river by May. Trouble is, Nicholson refuses to cooperate due to Saito's demand that his officers do manual labor (contrary to the Geneva Convention, of which Nicholson just happens to have a copy), and while he and his officers languish in confinement, the bridge construction goes poorly, and eventually Saito reluctantly gives into Nicholson's demands. Despite his victory, Nicholson orders his troops to build the best bridge possible - to the total bafflement of Major Clipton (James Donald), the surgeon who wonders whether Nicholson is being a good soldier or collaborating with the enemy. Meanwhile, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), a prison at Saito's camp, escapes and is rescued by British soldiers. Recuperating in Ceylon, he is recruited by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) to join him and a wimpy Canadian commando (Geoffrey Horne) to go on a raid to destroy same bridge, forcing Shears to join them by threatening to reveal the truth about his rank. It all builds to a climax involving all of the above-mentioned characters, the bridge, a crap-load of plastic explosive, and a Japanese troop train.<br/><br/>Ignore the fact that this movie is historically inaccurate; the film makers never claimed it to be a true depiction of what happened on the Kwai River. This is simply an amazing movie all around, a potent anti-war film and intriguing character study by David Lean, making the first of his epic films and showing no signs of ""growing pains"" at making the transition from romantic comedies (""Brief Encounter"") and Dickens adaptations (""Oliver Twist"") to an epic scale.<br/><br/>Sir Alec Guinness gives what has to be the best performance of his career as Nicholson. His character is a martinet who believes that all rules must be followed to the T; his refusal to cooperate with Saito is based on that point alone. He forbids escape attempts because his men were ordered to surrender, and he fears it may get him into trouble with his superiors (if I were a prisoner, that would be the least of my worries). When he wins his battle with Saito, he proceeds to actually make his men work harder towards their goal. When Clipton calls him on this, Nicholson justifies his activities by saying it is his code of professionalism. Nicholson is not a likable or sympathetic character (except towards the very end, as he reflects on his life as a soldier), but he is an undoubtedly fascinating one. Rarely was an Oscar more justly won than Guinness's for this film.<br/><br/>On the other end, Sessue Hayakawa is excellent as Saito. Though initially depicted as bombastic and cruel, Saito actually comes across as much more sympathetic than Nicholson. He treats his prisoners reasonably well, and it's hard not to feel sorry for him - after all, if the bridge is not ready in time, he will have to commit sepuku. It is to Hayakawa's credit that he takes what was a caricature in the novel, and makes him into a sympathetic human being. How he didn't win an Oscar for this is beyond me.<br/><br/>William Holden is an old hand at the POW genre, having recently been involved in ""Stalag 17"", and he is full of his usual swagger and cynicism as Shears, the American who initially tries to get out of fighting but is a hero when the chips are down. Some have complained that Shears (who was British in the novel) was American, but to them I say: what's your point? Shears' characterization in the movie works a lot better than in the book, because it allows for his independent Yankee spirit to clash with Major Warden's all-too-familiar (in this film) British martinetism (not that that's a word or anything). Jack Hawkins is wonderful as Warden, and he and Holden have great chemistry together. James Donald is also solid as Clipton, and Andre Morrel and Geoffrey Horne do good work in their smaller parts.<br/><br/>Lean's direction is solid. Though not quite on a par with his later achievements of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"" (we suspect because of the lack of Freddie Young behind the camera), we still get some amazing sights: the endless jungles of Siam; the bat stampede during a skirmish with Japanese patrols; and the climax, which is drawn out over thirty minutes but never lets up with the tension. Malcolm Arnold's score (other than the ubiquitous ""Colonel Bogey March""), on the other hand, is unmemorable for the most part.<br/><br/>That minor complaint aside, ""Kwai"" deserves all of the recognition it gets, and then some. The only WWII movies that even come close to this are ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"". And the amazing thing is: this film was in essence just a warm up for Lean's greatest achievement: ""Lawrence of Arabia"". 10/10"

","To criticize movies for historical inaccuracy is to damn almost every work of historical fiction. First of all, the people who were there were not involved in the production. Secondly, if movies were truly historically accurate, they would be so dull, you couldn't watch them. To start with, this is based on a work of fiction. It is an idealized version of an event that took place some time in the past. It's characters are fictionalized. We don't know what they said or really did. Some were probably combinations of two or three different characters. Also, the criticism that people wouldn't make deals with the enemy is pretty naive. Sometime the deal making is what keeps you alive and gives you a chance to fight another day. It's easy to say that one would do or not do something, sitting on a couch in a living room. It doesn't reflect badly on soldiers in war time to be afraid, and, yes, seemingly traitorous. <br/><br/>The story is a wonderful one about courage and drive and sacrifice and pain. This is how we as human beings keep going. A man once told me that the one consistent trait that Holocaust survivors had was that they had determined a goal in their lives. The building of the bridge becomes something to live for, even if it is for the gratification of the enemy. Of course, the leader cracked and almost destroyed the mission. This does happen.

","In more than one way, I can say The Bridge on the River Kwai is easily one os the greatest films ever made.  The first thing that signals the fact that it's a great movie is Malcolm Arnold's adaptation of the WWI whistling tune ""Colonel Bogey March"".<br/><br/>The movie soon reveals a Japanese camp has taken the British soldiers as workers for a bridge that must be built so a Japanese cargo train may pass as scheduled.  The work begins as though it were slave labour but after a Ghandi move of protest by Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) turns it to a morale exercise for his troopers.  Maj. Shears (William Holden), on another note, knows about the bridge after escaping the place and is talked into helping a different British army by going on a mission to destroy the bridge.  The story from there never lets down.<br/><br/>Once the movie was over, it was unclear to me who/what the antagonist was. I had to think about it for a long time.  Many people settle for less by saying that it was the Japanese that were the antagonists, but I will have to disagree with that.  My personal opinion is that it was the pride in the imprisoned British soldiers.  This seems obvious to me when Col. Nicholson says ""What have I done?""  But truly the ending is one that can leave people thinking ""Madness...""<br/><br/>David Lean did absolutely unbelievable direction, second only to maybe another epic of his, Lawrence of Arabia, however still unforgettable.

A soldier is giving a report of the construction and keeps winking at the Colonel in order to indicate they've been secretly sabotaging the project. The Colonel tells him to have the man report to the medical station and have his eye checked. It is a great comic relief moment in a very serious film. One of the other breathtaking scenes is when Colonel Nicholson goes to the hospital and gives a talk to persuade the wounded to work on the site. It is one of the most powerful dramatic scenes I've seen in a movie.

","In 1957, a movie was premiered that was the most awe-inspiring of its time. It was a massive project, involving a collaboration of several countries and the building of a bridge. It was the film that put director David Lean on the map and brought home Best Picture and six other Oscars at the Academy Awards. Although Lean and producer Sam Spiegel later topped themselves with `Lawrence of Arabia' and their first film's flaws have since become apparent, `The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a landmark of motion pictures and still awes (Major spoilers up ahead).   <br/><br/>`Madness! Madness!' The last words said in the film by Colonel Clipton can be used to sum up the film. Most of the major characters were mad in a way, but some more so than the others. Let's take Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson, one of his most renowned performances. Nicholson is a stiff upper lip officer, who believes that by building a proper' bridge, he is helping the future and providing the prisoners with better work and self-esteem. He doesn't seem to take into account that this bridge will be used by the Japanese in Burma against the allies and that men are dying on the River Kwai. There are three other main characters in the story. Shears, played by William Holden, Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakawa and Major Warden, played by Jack Hawkins. Shears, from what we can tell, doesn't want anything to do with the war or the P.O.W camp. He bribes officers and, when he escapes, tries to weasel his way out of going back. As an actor, Holden has always been, yet this movie will have us asking why. Hayakawa was 68 years old when he was cast as Saito, yet he doesn't look or act like it. Unlike Nicholson, he only builds the bridge because he has to. Like Shears, he does his duty because of what would happen if he did otherwise. The third character, Warden, is different on the other hand. He sees the war as a game, playing with his plastic explosives as if he's a kid with firecrackers. He also believes only in the mission, carrying around suicide pills should anyone have to be killed. <br/><br/>Speaking of the River Kwai, the actual story was worse than it is here and this is one of only two problems I have with the story.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoners of war died along this railway from causes such as malnutrition, dysentery, malaria, gangrene, beatings, exhaustion and torture. And some just wanted to die. This sugarcoating of the actual story is one of the most controversial parts of the movie, but what did you expect? This is a Hollywood Epic. This is where the film's only other problem comes in: It seems to have no major focus. We leave the Nicholson-Saito story just when we are to decide whether to cheer or boo Guinness so other events can be fitted in.  <br/><br/>The Colonel Bogey March has become one of the most renowned scenes in film history. Originally, however, the song was almost not excepted because it had some rude lyrics. However, the scenes were the march is first used foreshadow other events to follow. The P.O.Ws march past `the graveyard' and the hospital were the sick are kept. They are like new recruits marching past battle hardened veterans as they go to war. Shears remarks to Corporal Weaver, `We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers'. The second time the march is used is near the end, as the gang marches across the bridge just before the commandos strike. The march, as happy as it may seem, is an omen of what is to happen next. <br/><br/>`There's always the unexpected'. John Milius once said that the commando mission in this movie is the best he has ever seen on film. Why? Because everything that could go wrong does. The team parachutes off course, one member is killed, they have to take an alternate route and Warden gets injured in the foot. However, they continue on and on. They finally reach the bridge, marveling at the quality of the structure and the apparent comradeship of the prisoners with the Japanese. They think that, from there, it's easy sailing. However, nature has a way of toying with them and are they really prepared to fight and kill others if the need arises?<br/><br/>
Ironically, the person who destroys the bridge is the same man who advocated its construction. Nicholson's actions, however, still spark debate to this day. Many believe that he would never do such a thing and that he must have been knocked unconscious we he did what he did. However, what about his last line `What have I done?' In my view, though he loved the bridge like it was his own child, he realizes the enormity of what he has been doing and that he must kill his child.  <br/><br/>In the end, the bridge is destroyed, but for what cost? Everyone involved is either dead or doomed to die. Their fates have been sealed. On the other hand, life has survived. The first shot we see in the movie is of a bird floating around in the sky. This represents nature's tranquillity, before it is disrupted by the machines of war. The last shot we see is of the same bird and once again is tranquillity. Only this time, it is a return to peace. Men may have kicked aside life in their quest to build and destroy a bridge, but they are only temporary visitors. Nature is a permanent resident."

","Some films have the ability to transport you to another place and time so completely that you forget you are watching a movie.<br/><br/>""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957) is such a film. Director David Lean takes an inspired script, superb casting, and a lush jungle setting and spins  the tale of the of the strong-willed but ultimately doomed Col Nicholson and his struggle to find some dignity in the face of brutal captivity.  That the film is also a rip-roaring adventure, complete with daring escapes, leech-infested swamps, and unrelenting suspense climaxing in the famous bridge scene, is a tribute to Lean's directing skill and keen sense of Film as Entertainment, first and foremost.  There is also a truly funny side to this film, provided mainly through the ""token"" American character Shears, played with a perfect fatalistic resignation by William Holden. This is not just another ""war movie with a message."" Pure entertainment or morality tale, ""Bridge"" continues to fascinate with each successive viewing, revealing the genius that makes this film work on so many levels- the rapid -fire dialogue, incredible cinematography, sound engineering that completes the jungle ""illusion"", and seemless editing that merges the two parallel storylines to their eventual conclusion.  It is hard to believe that this film was made 45 years ago, especially when compared with the dated look of feel films of the same era and genre. This film is truly a different animal. An overused cliche to be sure, but ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" really does get better withn each viewing. If you haven't seen it in a while, you are in for a treat, especially if you can get the newly restored special edition on DVD. It belongs in any serious movie collection as an example of the quality which movies were onve able to attain."
"JawsOfJosh","Null","0","1","22 February 2002"," A great ensemble-character study amidst World War II
","Grand director David Lean delivered himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation in 1957 with the WWII epic ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"". Addressing the effects of racism, insanity and pride upon humans in war, Lean easily transcends the typical ""anti-war"" story and creates a great character study that defines one of the most subtle examples of 'battle of wills' ever seen on film. Decades later, this film still looks and plays wonderfully. The film progresses at a measured, decaffeinated pace, and may put-off those used to state-of-the-art explosions that are (nowadays) supposed to occur every 15 minutes in a war film.<br/><br/>Set in a Japanese prison camp - simply named Camp 16 - in southeast Asia in 1943, a group of British military prisoners, led by Alec Guinness' dry Colonel Nicholson, are forced to build a bridge on the River Kwai.  The bridge will link the cities of Bangkok and Rangoon, thus enhancing the Japanese's war efforts against Britain and their allies. Colonel Nicholson, a reserved but willful officer, rejects Commander Saito's instructions under the Geneva convention policies, but soon gives way to Saito's orders when he realizes the construction of the bridge will serve as an example of British supremacy over the Japanese. Meanwhile, Major Shears, portrayed by William Holden, is an American soldier who has escaped from Camp 16 and poses as an officer to gain sick leave from a British military hospital. The British army soon discovers Shears' true identity and blackmails him into joining a secret raid to demolish the bridge.<br/><br/>Here in the new millennium, where less-than-stellar locations and tepid cinematography can be compensated for with digitally created sunsets and skylines, this film is a cinematic marvel. Shot in Sri Lanka, the forests, deserts, streams and waterfalls that Lean captures are simply breathtaking - and completely genuine! Given the primitive state of filmmaking in the late 1950's, the attention this film and Lean initially received is totally warranted, and it remains beautiful today. Most impressive is a sequence where we see an extended group of bats fleeing a tree when a gun shot is fired. Lean navigates back and forth between the British prisoners forced to build the bridge and the covert crew assigned to demolish it, unaware that the first train to cross the bridge contains said prisoners. Also impressive is the lack of music, even the assured climax transpires without score.<br/><br/>As for the performances, it's understandable that an American film star like William Holden receive first billing, but the film clearly belongs to Alec Guinness (who won the Best Actor Oscar that year). Guinness' interpretation of Colonel Nicholson is brilliant. We witness Nicholson gradually descend into obsession with the completion of the bridge, while all the while retaining his mannered, stiff-necked British demeanor. His battle of wills with Commander Saito - ashamed and suicidal that the British are building a bridge his army could not do properly - is much more engaging than the journey through the jungle that Shears and his crew experience, which may be why we spend more time watching Nicholson. A great triumph for David Lean and Alec Guinness, and one of the best war films ever made."
"andrew7","10","0","2","19 February 2002"," One of the best ever
","I'm pleased to add my name to the chorus of praise this film has garnered here.  It is truly one of the best films of all time, and I never tire of seeing it.  <br/><br/>I'm actually a little surprised, though.  I was expecting to see far more negative comments about this film.  Of the comments I read, the only negative ones were from due to historical inaccuracies.  I've said before, the historical accuracy of an historical film has no bearing whatsoever on my judgment of the film, but I understand where these people are coming from.  <br/><br/>But anyway, I kinda thought there would be a minority of people chiming in claiming the film to be boring.  Don't get me wrong, I personally find it riveting.  But, as I watched it the other day, it occurred to me that a lot of modern viewers might indeed find it boring, especially if they've been told things like ""It's the best war film ever!"" and are walking into it with visions of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in their head.  <br/><br/>Because, regardless of what the people here say, this is NOT a war film.  It takes place during a war, and includes characters who are fighting a war, yes.  But that's all.  War is a setting for the dramatic conflicts of the film (and there are many).  But the conflict of the war is not one of the conflicts of this film.  <br/><br/>We've got Saito vs. Nicholson, Shears vs. Nicholson, Clipton vs. Nicholson, Shears vs. Warden, Warden vs. Nicholson.  These are the conflicts. Conflicts between men, not armies or nations.  Sure, the war is an everpresent element in the background of this film, but that's all it is. The fate of the bridge is not the meat of this movie.  The important thing here is the conflicts between the characters.  Nicholson's dignity vs. Saito's authority.  Shears's pragmatism vs. Nicholson's duty, or Warden's grim heroism.  And each of them, in their own way, vs. Clipton's simple human compassion.  That's what the film is about.  The bridge provides a focal point.  It is a motivating factor to all of the characters, in one way or another (except Clipton).  It is a metaphor, a visible, tangible representation for the various struggles at work between the main characters.<br/><br/>The film's only major weakness is in the performance of William Holden, which is simply not up to the standard of the others.  I honestly am not familiar with his work (this is the only film of his I have seen), but in this movie he is poor.  He sticks out like a sore thumb... the Hollywood star amid a company of actors.  Unfortunately, much of the film rests on his shoulders, especially in the second half, and he just can't carry it.  In a lesser movie, you'd never notice, but in one as excellent as this, it's a crippling weakness.  And it's such a shame.  <br/><br/>Nevermind.  This is still an excellent movie, a timeless classic that deserves to live forever.  9.5/10"

","I'm normally a very picky movie fan, especially when it comes to historical accuracies. And though ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" has two or three (not near as many as the flawed ""Gladiator""), those little tidbits are completely overshadowed by some of the best performances  I've ever seen--by anybody. Sir Alec Guinness especially inspires awe with a relentless performance, right down the core. In my opinion, this film ranks in the Top 10 War Movies ever (though the film takes place in a P.O.W. camp). A must for any war movie fan! --Bud Sturguess, Texas"
"Primtime","9","0","1","10 January 1999"," A piece of cinematic brilliance
","This film is easily one of the ten best I have ever seen. It seems to have every aspect of what a film needs to be great. 1) Great story 2) Great actors 3) Great direction 4) Great cinematography 5) Great suspense 6) Great story speed. Director David Lean captured each of these elements to almost a perfect level in this anti-war film.<br/><br/>Alec Guiness gives a great performance as Col. Nicholson and was indeed Oscar-worthy. The passion with which he had for the role is best shown at the conclusion of the film in which he finally realizes that all he had done was wrong. Performances from Holden, Hayakawa and Hawkins all match the level of Guiness' intensity. The whole conflict between the British and Japanese is never really described but one gets a better sense of it through the great performances.<br/><br/>The one thing that really got me about this film was the manner in which it was shot. The picture quality is very much up to modern standards and seems all that more incredible when compared to other colour films of the day. Jack Hildyard's cinematography full captures the feeling of struggle and conquer throughout the film, especially in later scenes including the destruction of the bridge. Full credit to Boulle's book for coming up with such an interesting way to destroy the bridge.<br/><br/>The visual and psychological complexities of this film make it truly great among all films, not just war films. After all, who could forget that famous whistling tune?<br/><br/>9/10 stars."
"Bill-247","Null","0","1","13 December 1998"," THE BEST anti-war film in the 20th century!!!
","There are about only three films from the 1950's that cling to me like a fly to sugar - ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959) and this film. It is by far THE BEST anti-war film ever made...other people will say ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) or ""Platoon"" (1986).  They are GREAT films about the horrors of Vietnam, and war in general.  But, no film in the 20th century has described the horrors of war (in terms of the torture, brutality, or the insanity of war) better than this film.  You feel the ""heat"" of that oven when they place Nicholson (Alec Guinness) in it.  You feel his pain.  You cheer his release along with his comrades.  When I first saw this movie, I thought William Holden was the hero.  Now, that I have seen this movie several times, it is hard to single out any hero of the film because all of them were heroes in their own right...and it was the total idea of ""war"" in general that made their lives a living hell."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","0","1","4 December 2000"," A timeless classic
","This film is a giant in a very crowded genre of WWII movies released in the 1940's and 50's.  It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director (David Lean).  The story is atypical of the WWII genre.  Instead of showing the glory of battle, it presents the psychological and physical torment of life in a POW camp.  It focuses on the human story, a story of principles, will and courage in the face of adversity.<br/><br/>Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the commander of a group of prisoners of war interned in a Japanese camp in Southeast Asia during WWII.  He is told by the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) that the prisoners will build a bridge across the river Kwai to complete the Japanese railroad that will supply their troops.  Saito orders that officers will work beside enlisted men, to which Nicholson objects because it is a violation of the rules of war agreed to at the Geneva Convention.  This leads to a standoff, a test of wills that is ultimately won by the irrationally stubborn Brit after many days in solitary confinement.<br/><br/>The result is that Nicholson agrees to build the bridge on his own terms, using his own engineers.  This seems to be insane, since building the bridge would aid the enemy.  However, Nicholson's has a high-minded goal that transcends the war.  He wants to build a bridge that will endure as a testament to the superiority of the British civilization, especially since it will be built under such extreme circumstances.  He also feels that building a bridge of which they can be proud will boost the moral of the men while living under such oppressive conditions.<br/><br/>The psychological aspect of the film is fascinating.  Saito's personal sense of honor does not allow him to use the brutality necessary to coerce the prisoners into building the bridge properly.  Ironically, once he succumbs to defeat in the battle of wills against Nicholson, he gets everything he wants.  By losing, he actually wins.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb.  Alec Guinness is magnificent as the idealistic and staunchly principled Colonel.  This was probably his best role in a stellar career.  William Holden is also terrific as the sardonic and cowardly sailor that fate continued to throw into situations that required him to become a reluctant hero.  Sessue Hayakawa delivers a masterful performance, as the hapless commander who succumbs to Nicholson's iron will.<br/><br/>The ending evokes conflicting emotions, as it is simultaneously ironic, triumphant and devastating.  At the end, the viewer is not sure whom to pull for since there is no neat way to resolve the collision of converging forces.  This makes the film even more interesting.<br/><br/>This film is a timeless classic.  I rated it a 10/10.  I'm looking forward to seeing it on the newly released DVD."
"migrod1","9","0","1","25 October 2000"," The First Modern Film
","Having been born in the 70s and watching films from that decade, I immediately think of that decade as the most original and daring for American films and filmmakers.  But as I watched more films from the 60s and even late 50s I began to realize there were roots established by great directors like Kurosawa, Kubrick, and David Lean before Spielberg, Coppola, Lucas, and Scorsese.  In this case, David Lean.<br/><br/>While Lawrence of Arabia may be considered his masterpiece, Bridge on the River Kwai stands alone as a great work of commentary on war, honor, and individualism.  Except for Saving Private Ryan, no movie captures the psychological torture and futility of warfare like this film.<br/><br/>When I watched it, I got a sense that this was the first film in color. The look and sound of the movie is different from any other movie of its time and would later be more evident in films like North by Northwest and the James Bond series.  But what really makes this film what it is, is the acting.  Guinness, Hawkins, and the Japanese General Saito (I apologize for not remembering the actor's name right now) capture the uncompromising pride that honor and duty create in great soldiers and officers.  From a military standpoint, Holden's character is really an undisciplined coward who'd rather go swimming with a beautiful nurse than plan out the destruction of the Kwai bridge with Hawkins.  But isn't that kind of leisure and way of life that we go to war for to protect?  Well, at least most wars.<br/><br/>That's what must've been so different and modern to audiences when this film first came on the scene.  We root for Holden when he's really a liar and wants to avoid the war at all costs.  Of course, that's best captured in his dialogue with Hawkins, suffering from a gunshot wound to his ankle, as they trek towards the bridge...""You and that Col. Nicholson, this war is just a game to you.  How to die like soldier, how to die like a gentleman.  When the only important thing is how to live like a human being!""  That line there somes up Holden's character.  But Bridge on the River Kwai isn't just ant-war film.  It's much more than that.  It's a great paradox of war and anti-war.  We see it in Guinness's defiance of Saito and then his defense of his bridge before he realize what he's done.  War films present an interesting genre of film in that it captures two contrasting ideologies simultaneously.  This film is not only an entertaining one, but it should be an instructional film for the military before they decide to go to war."

","This is a really cool movie! (If you've never seen it, read this at your own risk of spoilers) As I was saying, this is a really cool movie!<br/><br/>The storyline is great, it's amazing the way it's set up. These two people, each one with their own mission involving the bridge, each heading towards each other and the bridge, and when they meet it provides nothing short of edge-of-your seat tension as you wait to see what happens. Watching Nicholson, particularly, is enthralling. Usually you think of Hitchcock when it comes to stories featuring characters with an obsession (such as ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo""), but director David Lean, with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", also shows how he can tell an ""obsession"" story. Nicholson becomes so determined to build the perfect bridge that his obsession blocks out any ""ethical questions"" he should have about building it. Throughout the film, though, you are unsure of this Nicholson character. At the beginning, he quickly becomes a character you admire when he demonstrates his will power by sweating it out all those days in that box. The Japanese commander finds that Nicholson's will cannot be broken, and so we admire Nicholson. But he's building this bridge which will ultimatley help his enemies in the war.....but then again, he's being forced to do it....but does he have to do it so *well*? Those are the questions you ask yourself (at least, the questions I asked myself.), all the way up and until the end, when the bridge is about to be blown up. Like I said, this part is real edge-of-your-seat stuff, because you're waiting to find out where Nicholson's loyalties are. Will he help the soldiers who are on his side, or will his obsession with the bridge overcome what he should do? The answer may surprise you.......this movie, I think, is excellent. I believe I like it even more than Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Excellent direction, excellent shots of the jungle, and excellent acting, especially by the great Sir Alec Guinness as Col. Nicholson. I fear that some younger viewers (members of the high-speed, thrill-a-minute MTV generation) might find some scenes long and boring, particularly the jungle scenes, but I find them very cool, and are excellent shots.<br/><br/>As with all David Lean's films, the screen is like a huge canvas, showing all sorts of wondrous and incredible images. Oh, and by the way, the destruction of the bridge and subsequent train wreck are SPECTACULAR."

","This is a great movie.  Many of the comments that people have submitted reflect my opinion too.  Alec Guinness is amazing.  Jack Hawkins is as strong as ever.  William Holden is as good as he needs to be.  People have commented that Holden's character is what stops this film from being as good as it could be.  I'll argue that Commander Shears is necessary to help draw attention to the attitudes of Colonel Nicholson and Major Warden... he has to be there to provide an alternative to the single mindedness of the ""Gallant Brits.""  Sure, Holden probably didn't deserve top billing, but it probably helped to sell the film at the time and, in any case, Guinness won the Oscar he deserved so who cares about billing.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to know a great deal about film making, but I think I can safely say that The Bridge on the River Kwai deserved all the Academy Awards it received.<br/><br/>I'll say one more thing about this film.  As a British Citizen living in the US, watching The Bridge on the River Kwai made me proud to be a Brit. Whether you think that Nicholson's actions were gallant or foolish doesn't really matter.  The fact is, he won his arena of the war... he defeated his immediate enemy.  Throughout history (especially military history), it is the kind of discipline shown by Nicholson - and his officers and troops - that has made Britain great.

The musical score by Malcolm Arnold is great (Malcolm Arnold received an Oscar for his score).  The Screenplay is wonderful, and an amazing achievement considering two blacklisted writers were responsible for it.  Both Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson won an Academy Award for their screenplay.<br/><br/>OK, so much for awards, but the little things make this movie great.  There are so many great lines and scenes throughout the movie.  The movie never tries to show the Japanese as the bad guys (just the enemy in war), but shows their constant fight to maintain their code of honor.  This is the ultimate struggle of the movie, can honor exist in war?  The British fight to maintain their honor, and the Japanese try to force their code of honor onto the British prisoners.  The movie has a message that should last through the ages.<br/><br/>The final scene of the movie must be one of the greatest of all time.
