"Dark Eye","10","217","243","24 July 2000"," You need a 20 out of 10 ratings to rate Miyazaki's films
","Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here."
"CsikosPost","10","53","58","5 October 2006"," A delightful fantasy that will bring out the child in anyone
","Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours? <br/><br/>This is exactly what Miyazaki's ""Castle in the Sky"" is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.<br/><br/>As it is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. Still, I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers.<br/><br/>""Castle in the Sky"", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind I've ever seen. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the ""camera"" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can't help but FEEL like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.<br/><br/>Even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka/San or Chihiro/Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. As the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. For that reason, I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.<br/><br/>At the same time, ""Castle in the Sky"" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.<br/><br/>Even the ending song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. ""The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...The earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet."" Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one I've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. I have found myself near tears just listening to it.<br/><br/>""Castle in the Sky"" may not be Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. Sit back, relax, and love it for what it is."
"ryzinhy","9","65","76","29 December 2005"," Haunting and brilliant!
","I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br/><br/>This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation."
"oshram-3","10","29","32","2 March 2005"," The greatest animated film of all time
","It's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made. It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes. The version I'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub (I know, sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language); there is at least one other English language dub out there, I have it on VHS (I have no idea from what source), and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film. But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.<br/><br/>Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek here), who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta (Anna Paquin) literally drops from the sky. It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, Colonel Muska (Mark Hamill), who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck. To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola (Cloris Leachman). The plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. It's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting, but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.<br/><br/>The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. Flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking. The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines. But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger.<br/><br/>Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography. From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about. Though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it. The film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect Sheeta (who was the one who woke it up). Meanwhile, Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction. From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.<br/><br/>It helps that Laputa has an amazing score. Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians. Though he re-recorded it for this DVD release (which IMO is not an improvement over his original score), adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad dub. I'm inordinately fond of the older English dub, and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots, but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those (and those matched the Japanese pretty well). Dola in particular is hard to get right, but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite as good as the original). Paquin does a good job as Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, while I knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do Muska (I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more, but Hamill's good). Much of the film rests on Pazu's shoulders, and Van Der Beek is wonderful. Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub, because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu. Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as I love this film, I don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version. John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.<br/><br/>Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke (one of his few films I didn't care for), but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement. Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder. I'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD."
"princesszandra","10","105","127","6 September 2004"," Best animated film I've ever seen
","I have seen just about all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me!<br/><br/>I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.<br/><br/>Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was."
"hugh_fester","10","23","25","4 November 2005"," The one of greatest animated films of all time
","I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one."
"lilliquist","10","98","122","2 December 2004"," A great animated family adventure
","This is one of the best animated family films of all time. Moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great films include ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kikki's Delivery Service."" Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult. The one thing that sets ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride.<br/><br/>Why is this film so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling.<br/><br/>Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile. None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trench-coat wearing posers) There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore. The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful.<br/><br/>The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two leads, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). The sound engineering is great, too. Use your studio sound, if you've got it.<br/><br/>One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters (e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!"
"fan999","10","67","85","2 December 2004"," One of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD.
","This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does. This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent ""peck"" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to ""get it"" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking). This is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only sour note is the American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won't regret it."
"mavmaramis","10","13","14","10 February 2007"," Super animation
","Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way).<br/><br/>Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is. I can only assume some influence here.<br/><br/>When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa.<br/><br/>This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground.<br/><br/>Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same.<br/><br/>It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything.<br/><br/>Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it."
"Mike-309","Null","13","14","15 June 2003"," Jonathan Swift could have been proud
","Hayao Miyazaki is without a doubt, the best story teller of Japan.  His version of the Laputa Island episode in ""Gulliver's Travels"" by Jonathan Swift, transports us into this magical and technologically innovative world. All the characters fit into their roles.  The English version, is masterfully personified by Anna Paquin, James Van Der Beek, Cloris Leachman, and Mark Hamill among others.<br/><br/>Great entertainment, mystery, drama and adventure are the trademarks of this masterpiece of anime by Miyazaki.  Worth to be watched by the whole family."
"bob the moo","Null","7","7","3 September 2006"," A visually impressive and engaging adventure with a solid narrative, characters and voice-work  great fun
","When the airship she is on is attacked, Sheeta tries to escape from her would-be captors but falls to her death through the clouds. Fortunately the enchanted and mysterious crystal she is wearing round her neck saves her and floats her to the ground where she is found by young Pazu, who is rushing to get back to his boss in the mine with food. Pazu takes her in and they become friends but quickly learn that the pirates after Sheeta have not given up their chase. Not only do the pair have to deal with the pirates but also the government, led by sinister agent Muska, have their own dark reasons for getting hold of Sheeta. Escaping Pazu's town together is only the start of their adventure together.<br/><br/>Hard to believe that this film is twenty years old and yet looks as fresh and is as engaging as anything else you will see today. The sheer visual style and imagination is quite breath-taking and I could not quite believe that this was made by Miyazaki only 7 years after the vastly inferior (but still OK) Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (or The Castle of Cagliostro as it was in the UK). As writer he has also done well to craft a story that is engaging and enjoyable. It struggles at times with the weight of coincidence needed to make the film move forward but the manner of delivery covers up these little problems by producing regular action and fun characters. The pace of the film is perfectly pitched and things move forward really well and I can't imagine an audience of children or adults will be bothered by the running time. The characters bring out nice relationships as well which adds value to the story but unfortunately points made late in the film about the environment and such are heavily made and clunky.<br/><br/>The voice cast in the English dub are mostly very good. Sadly the weakest link is Paquin, she sounds unnatural and a little wooden too often. She probably isn't that weak but she is shown up by an engagingly fresh and natural delivery from Van Der Beek  not something I expected to be saying when I learnt he was doing the voice of Pazu. Just as good is Leachman's Dola  blessed with a good character in the first place, her voice is spot on despite sounding a little like Mrs Skinner on the Simpsons. Hamill takes the bad guy role well and shows his experience at animation even if he is a little hammy at the odd point. Everyone works well together and they deliver their characters well to support the narrative and they match the impressive visuals well.<br/><br/>Overall this may not have the emotional depth of Spirited Away but it has strong characters and good relationships. These are grown within a engaging story told with pace and a good rate of action. Of course if none of this interests you then it is still worth seeing for Miyazaki's imagination and style, which is impressive and hard to believe that it is 20 years old this year."

"ZachDVD","10","46","62","29 April 2000"," Release it Disney! The dub is very good...
","By now you've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle In The Sky. During late summer of 1998, Disney released ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in ""1999"". It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. And it's not ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"", just ""Castle In The Sky"" for the dub, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish (even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub). You've also probably heard that world renowned composer, Joe Hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements. Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which began Studio Ghibli and it's long string of hits. And in my opinion, I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it.<br/><br/>
For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours. The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision. And believe me, it's one fantastic one. The film begins with Sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship. Sheeta holds the key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the Dola gang (who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend). Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. She falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant. As she floats down from the sky, Pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees Sheeta and catches her. The two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta. One action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue. Plus somewhat twisty surprise. I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time. The story is wonderful, as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki's animation which has no limits. The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods. It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons. Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film. The film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds. I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out. It's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about how the dub rates. An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life. Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike. Either way, I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu. Anna Paquin, the young Oscar winner from ""The Piano"", plays Sheeta. This is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent. At times she sounds as American as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand. The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman, who played Mama Dola. Not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life. If there was ever a live action Laputa movie (G-d forbid), she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role (well, somewhat). Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill is Muska, and this is another top rate Hamill performance. You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies, but he renders Muska to full evil. His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series. Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang.<br/><br/>
Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, Joe Hisaishi's newly arranged music! For those who have never heard of him, Mr. Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable. Each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly. Now, these new arrangements he has done are more ""American like"", which I think was the goal of the new recordings. Don't worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form. The score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster. It has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper. The film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music (I am not sure, but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all). But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy. Things seem very enhanced. In a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions. In a calm scene, it's more calmer. Overall, I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, I highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film. I prefer the new score over the old one, and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.<br/><br/>Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original Japanese lines are intact. In Kiki, I'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed. But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written. I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact. Some new lines have been added as well which help out. But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, Disney DID NOT translate the ending song, it was in Japanese. I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in Japanese. So I guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.<br/><br/>There is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips. Of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed (and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...). Some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all (there's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit).<br/><br/>
As far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts. I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation. From the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe. You see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action. You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film. Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art. And to think, this was done in the mid 1980's. The animation is quite different from Disney, Ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good. And after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever. Laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground. These sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. And the finale is just something you MUST see. The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well. And like all Miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme (i.g. Kiki: Confidence). This one has a great a lesson on greed and power. People don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good. People are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, Muska, greatly shows this.<br/><br/>
All in all, Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part. I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory. With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi, Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy. Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs, Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film."

","Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won't give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of Miyazaki's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A"
"Boris-57","10","14","17","21 September 2005"," Probably Miyazaki's best, as it displays all his strengths
","Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice.<br/><br/>I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke). At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one.<br/><br/>In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it.<br/><br/>It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same."

"ericstevenson","10","4","4","30 September 2016"," My 300th movie!
","As someone who loves great films, I felt bad about not having seen most of Miyazaki's masterpieces. I have yet to see any of them that I would give a score lower than three and a half stars and this is no exception as it's easily a four star movie. I really do think it's great that this film uses both celebrity voices and voice actors, as well as Mark Hamill who's actually both! The animation may not be as good as ""Spirited Away"", but it's still gorgeous to look at. I have been watching one movie a day since last December and decided to view this as my 300th movie overall.<br/><br/>It's because I bought a fairly expensive copy of it. I had heard this set a record for most Tweets about a single subject or something like that. Whatever the record, this was great to watch. It was actually pretty rare that Miyazaki movies had a story with an actual villain in it. They rarely have black and white morality. This film, however, was a great exception and I admit to liking the idea of a more traditional story from him. I've also never seen anything from him that was an outright action movie. Yes, this had great drama, but it certainly had tons of action and explosions! <br/><br/>I guess it's kind of weird being a fan of traditional anime like ""Dragonball Z"", but this appears to obviously be something more cultured. I just think they're both great in their own way and their genres well. I guess this is the closest Miyazaki ever came to a typical action movie. Needless to say, it still has the great emotion that makes his film a masterpiece. The characters are still pretty morally ambiguous. The air pirates seem evil at first, but you definitely lighten up to them as time goes on. It was great to recognize Jim Cummings' voice, especially since I actually met the guy at a con! <br/><br/>I love the designs of the robots. I was really impressed at how bad I felt for the original one. Robots are common in anime, but this was a truly emotional take on them. I really did feel sorry for this poor guy as he kept getting injured trying to help Sheeta. You briefly see some magic creatures that almost look like pokemon. It's great to see how such a great artist influenced all kinds of different anime. It takes a little while to get really good, but it's still flawless. This is for kids, adults, and anyone. ****"

","""Castle in the Sky"" is an animation movie in which we watch a young boy and a young girl with a magic crystal who are trying to protect themselves but also the crystal from pirates and foreign agents. They are also trying very hard to find a legendary floating castle something that is really difficult to succeed but they are not giving up their tries.<br/><br/>In general I like animation movies and when I watch an animation movie which made by the master Hayao Miyazaki then I have to say that I loved it. The direction which made from Hayao Miyazaki of course was as I expected perfect and I also liked it very much. This movie I can compare it only with another movies that made by Hayao Miyazaki and these are: ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and of course ""Howl's Moving Castle"" in which I found some things in common.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to say that ""Castle in the Sky"" is not a simple animation movie which you would think when you first see it, it's something extremely different than this. It's a lesson for life in general and at the same time especially for each person separately, this is something that makes this movie special. In this the most important reason was that this movie made by Hayao Miyazaki who has the gift to give us many things that we could not think before watching this movie."

","Hayao Miyazaki's screenplay here is just excellent. The story is imaginative and at times quite moving, plus there are many funny moments to be had along the way. The characters are however overly silly and only ever lightly developed, but everything else about the script works so well that it easy to forgive its shortcomings. The music is rather charming and the animation itself is great too. Some of the violence does not quite work, but there are so many other scenes that simply radiate with beauty. The running time of over two hours is a bit lengthy, but watching it is by all means time well spent. If not quite the masterpiece that 'Spirited Away' is, this one comes pretty close."

Through the journey, they encounter the crooked government, good hearted pirates...and oh yeah...a floating mystical world in the sky! There's not much more to say; the animation is beautiful for the time, and the story is absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>However, contrary to its appearance, the film truly appeals to both adults as well as children. I strongly recommend this film to anyone aging from 6 to 100. It will warm your heart and make you want to rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again. Long live Miyazaki!"

","I know Anime. I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration - I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing. In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken."
"Blueghost","Null","3","3","11 June 2017"," Good adventure film for all ages.
","I saw this when it first hit the home video market, and was enamored with the scope and scale of Miyazaki's imagination. Like a lot of good Japanese animation (anime) this one doesn't stick with giant robots or sadistic antagonists, or other familiar tropes that pervade anime and science fiction in general. <br/><br/>Having said that there is a military bent or element placed in the film. As with some other Miyazaki offerings the military is seen as a tool that is often misguided or misused for other people's schemes. So it is that Paizu, the main character, and Sheeta, the damsel in distress with a family secret, are challenged by the local authorities as they seek to discover her origins and the source of intrigue regarding her past. <br/><br/>The film is an anime epic, long in scope and vast in imagination, and filled with both action and adventure as well as more reflective moments. And when I said this was a good adventure film for all ages, I meant it. Where there is some military violence, there's no blood shed, and the sexual intrigue is kept G-rated, PG at worst (and in a very Japanese cultural vein), unlike a lot of science fiction offerings from Japanese animation usually aimed at teenage boys and older. Families can watch this, though very young viewers may get apprehensive or questioning at some of the action.<br/><br/>""Castle in the Sky"" is a riff on a story element from Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" regarding a flying city, hence the title of the film. Though unlike Swift's tale this story doesn't take place in the 18th century, but in the Victorian era with what is often referred to as a ""steampunk"" setting.<br/><br/>As with a lot of Japanese ""anime"" offerings, the animation, though vast in scope and impressive in the tale it brings, it's not Disney. That is to say the animation is somewhat stilted, though a bit smoother than a lot of anime of the time. Even so it is still a pleasure to watch, though older children might get a little impatient with it.<br/><br/>A great Myazaki offering. Watch it on a lazy weekend afternoon, or perhaps when there's nothing else on during the week. Either way, enjoy."
"RossRivero99","10","3","3","26 November 2014"," A milestone for Japanese cinema
","Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is a true fantasy masterpiece as well as very well done, and very entertaining. The movie tells the story about a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek) who finds a girl named Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin)floating down from the sky with some mysterious crystal on her necklace, and then it comes on to a race against time to find the legendary Laputa (aka the castle in the sky) against pirates and foreign agents in order to get to it to prove that it is real before any one else does. The animation for this film is just excellent, as well as the writing, acting, and the story-line to the film. Miyazki directs this film with adventurous passion, and excellence that he fulfills his effort to direct the best animated Japanese film since Grave of the Fireflies (1988). There is also a great supporting voice cast which includes Oscar winner Cloris Leachman as the leader of the pirates Dola, and the original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill as Muska one of the foreign agents who wants to use the power of the floating castle for evil purposes. But in the end it is one of the best movies ever made and as well as being s film that I consider to be a Miyazaki classic."
"Quinoa1984","10","3","3","23 April 2008"," Miyazaki turns fantasy on its wonderful, conventional head once again
","Castle in the Sky (full title Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is another in the extraordinary works in the cannon of Hayao Miyazaki, who is arguably the master of fantasy in animation, worldwide. It's plot should be able to read through easily, at least for anyone who's seen the main conventional point of either the Dark Crystal or Lord of the Rings (probably the former is a little more accurate). <br/><br/>A princess has to get to a location with a sacred object- in this case an rock-amulet- and take it to the main power source on Laputa, a secret castle that can barely be said to exist except in rumor. She goes on an adventure with another curious party, a boy, and the two of them have to contend with pirates and a nefarious man in a suit along the way. The twists are turned on a familiar premise at every step, however, because Miyazaki lets his imagination and influences spring out all over the place. <br/><br/>We get vines and clouds and Superman-inspired robots! What Castle in the Sky promises is what it delivers full-throttle; it's action and excitement for a family audience (and it's not to sound patronizing; dudes in their 20s and gals in their 30s will love this as much as the little ones who sought out Spirited Away and Totoro so), and humor in bits and pieces as well (maybe not as much as Totoro, or skewed in a surreal way like Mononoke, but it's still there in a light tone with the pirates). And the design overall should capture everyone's fancy; from the Goliath ship to the little details of the robots to the expanse and crevices of Laputa, to what looks like it MUST have been special visual FX animation, it's all mind-boggling and mind-blowing at the same measure. <br/><br/>It might not be Miyazaki's ultimate triumph, but it's still great film-making, a triumph of imagination to deliver on a tale of good vs. evil."
"benjamin_lappin","9","5","6","30 April 2006"," Simply Magic!
","First time I viewed this Miyazakian work, I viewed it in the long lost 1986 English dub as I managed to dreg up a VHS from the nether regions of forgotten items. I'm not normally an admirer of dubbings, rather preferring to listen to the film in its truest context, and multi-tasking in the duality required to watch the film. The new dub is not particularly successful however. Optimistic and buoyed by the 86 version, Disney lost the plot. Replacing quintessential humanism and character traits, with big names, for the big return. However, in which ever context you view this film, it is (in a time when the word is so flippantly used) an epic. The humanism and raw emotion coupled with 1930s-esque styled adventure movies provides a sheer hotpot of entertainment ripe for any occasion. The film more than entertains, yet doesn't bare the hallmarks of overrated, nonsensical, unnecessary fight scenes, opting for calmer, yet still thrilling, ""chase"" and ""action"" sequences. The plot is encapsulating, checking all the quotas for the Miyazakian masterpiece checklist. Miyazaki is a master of charting adolescent journeying. The emotional growth his characters go through is superbly done, as not to seem condescending or patronising, all the while being simple believable and simply magical.<br/><br/>Reviews often delve into the content of the film, revealing spoilers, but merely look at the support for Miyazaki's films on this website alone!!! This doesn't arise from techno-nerds, neo-skaters and all the social sects of pubescent society wishing to carry the cool card by the knowledge of foreign anime. This film is simply stunning. An encapsulating roller-coaster of a journey, with genuine feelings and genuine people (for cartoons). Miyazaki's ratings come from his attention to plot, first and foremost. This is why he's successful, because his movies carry a message but are engrossing and entertaining.<br/><br/>This may not be the most helpful review as to the films plot line, but let it be known, once watched you will be addicted. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, this is a prime tester, with Nausicaa and Mononoke somewhat on the ""heavy"" side, and whilst Spirited Away is as close to perfection as cinema can be, it is a dish best served til later, to fully appreciate. Laputa is a film for any mood.<br/><br/>Yet, the thing that always stands out for me, is the score. The final moments at the end of the film, when the theme Kimi o Nosete begins, is truly exquisite. Yes, it is 80s in its composition, yet coupled with the emotive nature of the film, never fails to jerk a nerve. <br/><br/>Superb story-telling. Superb film."
"thundergod001","10","6","8","30 August 2003"," Whoa!!!
","Castle in the sky is probably Miyazaki's second best film (after Spirited Away). It is the film that was my introduction to Anime after I saw a earlier English language dub in the 80's. I had the common sense to tape it back then and still have it (although it is somewhat over-watched).<br/><br/>
The Disney dub is at least as good as the 80's one (the music sounds richer and some of the voices are better, although Padsu's voice is a little jarring after the voice from the 80's version).<br/><br/>As for the plot, Laputa has everything. Robots, airships, levitation stones, flying islands, pirates and Mark Hamill as a bad-guy. Who could ask for more.<br/><br/>All in all, I give it a 10."
"qazzaq2006","Null","8","12","9 December 2004"," One of the most amazing movie!
","As you probably know Miyazaki created many animes. This is one of his works, and like all of his works, it is simply amazing. Many people do not realize this but Most of Miyazaki's movies are intended for older/adult audiences, despite the fact that it seems like for children. Therefore even adults will appreciate his movies. The story is kind of slow in the beginning because it seems that the rising action part has to be long for the audiences to understand. It is after about 1/3 of the movie when it gets exciting. The story is just amazing and watching this will brings all the fantasies that you had when you were kid. The animation is beautiful, although if you saw all of his movies the character shapes and landscapes do start to change. I was little disappointed with animation because it wasn't as sharp and beautiful as his later works but it still surpasses most animations out there. Even if you are not a fan of anime this is a must see for everyone. I would give this movie 9.2/10.<br/><br/>BTW: Why is it spelled Rapyuta in Japanese version? Because Japanese language lack certain pronounciation that exist in English/latin, therefore it is easier for them to say ""ra"" than ""la"" and ""pyu"" than ""pu""."
"diac228","10","4","5","16 May 2010"," An epic animated adventure worth visiting over and over again
","Animated films can become a lot of things (especially nowadays with updated technology and a newfound respect for the medium), including romantic, life changing, groundbreaking, political, or sometimes just flatout surreal in scale. No longer are animated films just cartoons for kids to watch and enjoy, that stereotype is long gone. However, epic is not a word you can use to describe animated films, because they just don't happen often. Animated movies with the ability to become compared to the likes of Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur, Seven Samurai and other epic films past and present are extremely rare to find. However if there is a man that can weave a blockbuster animated tale, it would be the Japanese answer to America's Walt Disney. Castle in the Sky is epic in scale, with a massive adventure full of lush scenery, incredible action, memorable characters, and a nice dosage of humor. If there is an epic cartoon, it would be this underrated masterpiece.<br/><br/>Castle in the Sky follows two kids that met under curious circumstances (Sheeta and Pazu) racing against pirates, the army, and mysterious agents in pursuit of a mythical castle located somewhere in the skies above the clouds. Sheeta is aided by a mysterious necklace given to her by her parents when she was younger. All the competition has their differing reasons on why they want to find the castle, ranging from gold to unleashing God-like powers. The film works mainly because the story is very unique, very original, and quite unpredictable. Written by Hayao Miyazaki, this film is the best evidence that his mind is among the most creative in film-making within the past century.<br/><br/>The world displayed here is among the most gorgeous in the history of animation. There are massive airships the size of cities, caves that can look like the bowels of outer space, entire worlds that just float high midair and just entire towns built on the mountainside, leading to some unique and detailed architecture. No computer-work here, as this movie proves that hand-drawn animation's personal touch can be as magical as the best visual effects coming from any computer. The variety in colors and images here trounces those of Miyazaki's more popular works, like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.<br/><br/>The epicness can be mainly traced to the consistent amount of peril and action throughout the two hours of pure movie magic. The opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, while a humorous yet impressive train chase half an hour later provides some of the best thrills ever seen in an animated movie. Every so often humor breaks off the epic taint in the production, but it never dwells or outstays its welcome. Steampunk is a tough sell, since it's a historical and contextual contradiction. But in Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki gives the viewers time to adapt and witness the technological advancements and mannerisms of the characters in the film so you don't become too distracted by the unrealistic nature of it all.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is the current Walt Disney, because not only does he avoid sequels (Pixar is unfortunately dwelling in this path) but he does his best to deliver a different animated experience every time he releases something new. Like Walt Disney himself, he can seamlessly blend humor, heart, and suspense all in one. He has the pacing, patience, and abilities of any decent Hollywood director, but with film you can do so much more. You can create shots that real-life cameras could never accomplish; and with animation you can create visuals that not a single CGI machine could ever duplicate. This is perhaps the main reason why Miyazaki avoids too much computer animation and avoids filming real-life altogether. When mentioning great directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, Peter Jackson, and David Fincher, Miyazaki is more than worthy to be mentioned in the sentence.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Castle in the Sky is a flawless work of art that spins audiences into a beautiful world full of steampunk goodness and lush scenery that's obviously influenced by the underrated landscape of Japan. Within the confides of this beautiful world (that travels by sea, land, and air) lies a wonderful story full of humor, heart, action, suspense, and an underlying message that's present in almost all Miyazaki movies. Pixar obviously has taken notes from the works on Japanese Walt Disney, as this movie has scenes and moments that can be compared to those of Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and even Up. If you enjoy excellent animated movies, you cannot miss this gem, as it's entertaining, thrilling, and mystical from the first second to the last."

","I had the opportunity to view this film in my watchlist when GKIDS was distributing this film to select cinemas across the US, including one approximate to my home. I took my parents to see it, and we had anything but regrets. To start with, the story sent a very powerful message against abuse of power, which in our world seems highly relevant. It presents, again, highly successful sci-fi elements that are intriguing on paper, but are especially wondrous in animated depiction. Speaking of which, the animation is of that kind of quality that seems not to age, which I'm sure had left many in 1986 speechless. The chaotic action scenes, the epic drama, and the comedy are all simultaneously explored highly successfully by what represents S tier Japanese animation. Some of the cast isn't too complex, but those that aren't are still very fun to watch that it didn't take away from the ones who were, namely Muska and Dola (who I couldn't tell until about an hour in who was the villain). The music is pretty brilliant as well, fitting in with every environment and enhancing my personal immersion. What it comes down to is that this film is only now receiving the admiration it deserves, as well as Miyazaki's other movies prior to My Neighbor Totoro. If you are an anime otaku, you WILL enjoy this film. If you're curious, don't at all give it a second thought. Once again, Hayao Miyazaki, I must bow before you to show that I view you as a gift to animation."

","This movie is probably the the second best Mayazaki film, the first is Nausicaa, the only reason why is probably because of the two leads voice actors, not that there's anything too wrong with them, their not annoying, its just i couldn't match the voices with the characters, in nausiccaa the voices are perfect. but other than that this movie is probably better than some Disney films, i actually thought it was Disney when i saw it as a little kid. The soundtrack is amazing, the art used for this film is something out of a dream, in fact the plot seems like something out of dream as well, that is what a cartoon movie is supposed to do. Despite not liking the 2 leads voices i like their characters, i like the pirates, and all the townspeople, but i love the villain played by Mark Hamill, who I'm not kidding actually uses his iconic joker laugh in this movie, every time he showed up on screen i felt the tension increase, probably one of the best cartoon villains ever. The movie can be slow a few times, but it not that big of a deal, but when the action starts, your heart starts pumping faster. i prefer this film and nausiccaa to all of mayazakis other work only because here he had bloodless carnage and didn't use too much gratuitous violence or creepy images yet, i know those are his trademarks but i find them sometimes unnecessary, and i think this movie can prove that"
"joshuafagan-64214","10","2","2","26 August 2015"," Another Sterling Work from One of the Greatest Directors
","I am so glad John Lasseter is friends with Miyazaki. If he wasn't, we may not have gotten these movies dubbed and formally released stateside. Say what you want about dubs vs subs and blah blah blah, but I often enjoy closing my eyes and immersing myself in movies. And it also allows so many more people to see these movies. And they are movies that deserve to be seen.<br/><br/>Lasseter's efforts here combined the fact that he more or less brought CGI animation to the masses have elevated him in my mind to the position of second most important person and third greatest person in animation to me. If you're wondering, the first list is Disney, Lasseter, Miyazaki and the second is Disney, Miyazaki, Lasseter.<br/><br/>The crazy thing is that I come into these movies expecting to be blown away. Most movies where this is the case, even the ones I adore, like Shawshank and LOTR, are diminished just a bit by this. Not these movies. Every time I see them, they grab my soul and run with it. Part of it is that the movies are such a stark change from American animation in every regard. The tone, the style; it's all different. The closest American animations I've seen to these masterpieces are the old Disney movies, from which Miyazaki took inspiration. But even those are only half as long as these movies and not nearly as epic. The other part of it is that they are just so good.<br/><br/>The images stick in my mind. For example, in the first third of this movie, the main characters go into an underground cave and the crystals react with a medallion that Sheena, one of the leads, is wearing. When they see why, they cut the rocks and it is revealed that there is what is dubbed as aetherium in them. In many other films, it would be a simple, expository scene. In this, it is a stylistic, atmospheric triumph. Scenes like that are littered throughout the movie. And they stick in my mind, as good animation and only good animation can do.<br/><br/>Another, more personal reason why I love Miyazaki films is that I share with him a deep love of aviation. The word Ghibli, the name of the studio, even means 'hot wind blowing in from the Sahara.' It is one of his three trademarks, if you will, the other two being environmental messages and strong female protagonists, two things that are done well and subtly here, to the film's credit. The inclusion of aviation, on the other hand, is not subtle, and I love that about it. In fact, the sky and flight are probably featured more here than in any of his other movies, and that is saying something. For a major part of the movie, they don't even touch the earth.<br/><br/>The flying scenes are all excellent. But I think my favorite is one near the middle of the film at sunset. It is in full color in my mind even as I write this review. Despite being a short scene, it makes you feel like you're in the sky like no other moment in any movie.<br/><br/>It perfectly encapsulates the emotions which come with sunset, flight, and the air itself and mix it together into one bit of atmosphere that is invocative enough to pull your soul from your body, at least for a minute.<br/><br/>The plot and pacing remind me, strangely, of Titanic. Not in any obvious way, but in that they both take a conventional tale and make it feel fresh and new, like you are a little kid hearing it for the first time. The characters are fleshed out well and the writing achieves a balance of making you know who they are without bogging the film down. The score is one of Hisaishi's best, and once again, that is saying something. I would compare the partnership between him and Miyazaki to the one between Williams and Spileberg, but, and I mean no offense to the latter pair, these two are above them. While Williams is a fine composer, I would argue that Hisaishi is one of the best composers of any kind over the last century.<br/><br/>And the artwork? I've already said enough about how pretty this film is. In fact, the sequence of this movie that won me over is an artistic one. The opening credits sequence ( didn't take the film that long) is done in a different style, one that fits the movie like nothing else could and lays the groundwork for the movie ahead. Wow.<br/><br/>This film is centered around the pursuit of a castle in the sky. And while it is stunning, as you know if you have watched this film, it cannot top another castle in the sky: the film itself. It is truly thus; as mystic and potent and artistic as Lapita itself. And unlike the main characters in the film, you don't have to go against a Mark Hamill-led military in order to get to it."
"Angels_Review","10","2","2","25 September 2014"," Simply magical
","I feel like the studio and Director would be a give away that this would be good. I don't know what to fully talk about as everything about this show is amazing from the story to the animation to the dub. Even the comedy doesn't get in the way of the great story that lies within this show. Only one or two things bother me but they aren't that big, like when Pazu jumps off his house and ends up breaking through bricks into his basement with no broken bones or nothing. Of course, these problems are minor and don't happen all that much.<br/><br/>Miyazaki seems to always have a moral to his stories, this is no different. I think the moral is that any civilization can fall if they think they are to powerful. Laputa, a place that seemed like it was a perfect place had power, wealth, and even a sense of magic. They had something special but even they ended up falling. The story line is full of spoilers if I try to explain even more but there is a beautiful story that is as mysterious as it is sad and thoughtful.<br/><br/>The animation is so beautiful and stands up even to this day. All hand done with so much detail and the painting of the backgrounds I could just go on. If you seen others by Miyazaki, you know his style and he never falters. This is one of those times where I just feel speechless to how wonderful his style of art is, the colors just pop even though at times they do end up taking very small short cuts. I also didn't really notice any times where the characters would just stop moving for a very long time with only their mouths moving. He would have them moving even slightly and it would feel realistic. There are even small things like how a character would eat from the dainty way Sheeta eats to the mess that Dola's sons make. One thing I did notice (And it's a slight spoiler I guess) is that his characters sometimes look better with short hair then with long hair. Not telling you what that means but you will find out. The opening is much different then the actual show, feeling more like it was done in a rather old style, highly detailed, even more so then the animation and like they were from detailed renders.<br/><br/>The music is so beautiful, with amazing orchestral sounds that you could just fall asleep to. I love everything about Studio Ghibi's work and the music is one of those that I wish I had all the soundtracks. They do not let much go past them that isn't quality controlled. I could listen to it for days without it getting boring. The English dub is spot on, I'm extremely happy it didn't turn into a flop like one of their first tries for English translation.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this yet, you have to see it soon. It's a must watch."

","Laputa: Castle in the Sky is my favourite animated film and it happens to be my 3rd favourite film of all time. I have seen all 11 of Miyazaki's films and I got to say, this is my favourite by far. I love practically everything about this Anime. The music score, animation, characters, story, humour, creativity and just the sense of adventure and fun are all amazing and create one of the best, if not the best animated film to have ever been made in my opinion. What's also wonderful is the atmosphere. There are some scenes with no dialogue, but the music, animation and the scenery allows you to take in the mystery and wonder that the film and the world it's created has to offer. Castle in the Sky has everything you could want in a film. Even if you don't like Anime, you have to see this film!"
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","18 May 2014"," Studio Ghibli's Feature Film Debut
","The first anime produced & released under the banner of Studio Ghibli, Castle in the Sky (also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky) is an elegantly crafted, smart narrated & nicely composed adventure which brings us the tale of a young girl in possession of a mysterious crystal who, after ending up in the care of a young boy, embark on a journey with him to find the mythic floating castle of Laputa while they're being pursued by pirates, army & secret agents working for the government who desire the very same thing.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is infused with this renowned filmmaker's trademarks & thematic elements plus is effectively paced from start to finish. The animation is wonderful to look at, the characters are worthy of our attention, the voice actors have done a fine job in bringing their given roles to life, the camera-work is pretty fluid & the minimalistic use of score works like an enchantment. Also, the floating castle of Laputa is a sight to behold & its meticulous detailing only evokes more admiration for the effort that went into its creation.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Castle in the Sky is the feature film which commenced the legacy of now- legendary Studio Ghibli on a considerably high note and although it isn't one of Miyazaki's finest films in my opinion but its uplifting story & quality narration is impressive enough to make sure that its viewers are entertained & intrigued throughout its runtime. A powerhouse of creativity & imagination, Castle in the Sky is an awe-inspiring work from a master storyteller that promises an enriching cinematic experience & delivers it effortlessly. Positively recommended."

"Desertman84","10","2","2","24 October 2012"," Miyazaki's Greatest Film
","Inspired by ""Gulliver's Travels,"" the fantasy-adventure Castle in the Sky was Hayao Miyazaki's third feature, and helped to establish his reputation as a visionary in both Japan and the United States.The film is about a young boy and a girl with a magic crystal must race against pirates and foreign agents in a search for a legendary floating castle.As for the elements of the film,it echoes in Myazaki's earlier Nausicaä, and anticipates imagery in his later films, from My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away. The English dub, which features Anna Paquin, James Van Der Beek and Cloris Leachman,is lively and close in tone to the original Japanese, if a bit talkier.Aside from that,the exciting flying sequences, appealing characters, and fantastic vision of a steam- powered future Jules Verne might have imagined make Castle in the Sky a must-have for fans of Japanese and Western animation.The viewer will obviously have an uplifting experience as it's the perfect place to view where Miyazaki has been and where he intends to go.Overall,it is the greatest film he has ever made."

","This is it people: the best adventure film ever made. The film combines all the good qualities of the Indiana Jones films with greater dramatic deepness, a vastly superior soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi, for me the best film composer ever and a more complex story than the simplistic stories of the Indy films (though, by no means, it is a very complex film). <br/><br/>While the main characters are 12-year old kids, one could argued that this film is indeed more adult than the Indy films, as it is handled on a more serious tone and has also a serious underlying message, though not as remotely as serious as Nausicaa.<br/><br/>The film also has a massive amount of ""cool stuff"", such as the technological marvels shown and the incredible quality of the action sequences."

","I cannot begin to describe how much I love this film. I love Studio Ghibli, and Castle in the Sky is one of my absolute favourites from them. It has a highly imaginative story for starters, every bit as imaginative as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind's. Once again, the animation is magnificent, as is the haunting and poignant music score. The dialogue and pacing are fine too, and the characters are never devoid of their likability and are wonderfully voiced by a top notch voice cast. Castle in the Sky is an absolutely beautiful film, but it is also quite haunting helped enormously by the music and visuals. It is an amazing and I think unforgettable film, one of the best animes, perhaps even animated movies I have seen. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"blackmamba99971","10","2","2","13 April 2010"," I loved this
","An excellent display of animation that is hand drawn. A story of a little girl which harnesses a powerful gem for which some very bad guys want for themselves. This includes pirates who in their own way, are the good guys, yet wanted the gem as well. Yet for a boy who works as a metal miners apprentice he finds this girl floating from the sky as if by magic. Taking her in, only to be chased by the relentless bad guys and pirates. All trekking to a place called Laputa, a mythical city that floats in the sky. The lineage to the girl is that she is the princess and heir to the throne of this legendary city. Yet her parents moved themselves down to the earth where they can live out their days in harmony. Abandoning the city altogether because of the constant hardships and hierarchy battles within the royal family. But as all circles go, she is thrust to her past home along with her friend only to be caught and nearly killed by a power hungry ex royal of the ancient kingdom. I loved the landscapes and beautiful hand drawn complexities for the final destruction to the old floating city. A wonderful story of pirates, the army, the psycho, and the devastating robots which harnessed the most destructive power ever created. To see two people bind closely together along with the help of their friends and overcome the shadow of Laputa."
"Tweekums","9","2","2","3 May 2008"," Another great film from Miyazaki
","This is the first film to be made by Japan's Studio Ghibli and as one would expect from that studio it is an excellent film. The animation is of a very high standard and Joe Hisaishi's music fits the movie very well.<br/><br/>The film follows the adventures of Sheeta and Pazu as they search for the titular Laputa. In the opening scenes airborne pirates attack an airship that a young girl (Sheeta) is travelling on as a prisoner of Muska, who appears to be an agent of the government. During the confusion Sheeta manages to escape but while fleeing slips and falls from the airship. As she falls the crystal on her pendant starts to glow and instead of plummeting to her death she slowly drifts to earth where she is caught be a Pazu, a boy about her age.<br/><br/>The two of them soon end up on the run from both the pirates and the military. When captured by Muska Pazu is let go and told to forget about Sheeta but can't. When he gets home and finds the pirates already there he joins forces with them as they want Sheeta as she can help them find Laputa, which they believe to be full of treasure. Meanwhile Sheeta says a spell which she was taught as a child and her pendent glows and points a beam of light towards Laputa. It also awakens a giant robot, which had fallen from the sky some time before, it proceeds to escape from the castle basement in which it is stored and help free Sheeta. She is then reunited with Pazu and the pirates and they race against Muska to get to Laputa.<br/><br/>That is just a brief summary, I don't wish to say how it ends. The film is exciting though out and should be ideal both for children and who want an exciting story that is well told without excessive violence. Some scenes may be a little frightening for younger children but for the most part it is just exciting. As with most of Hayao Miyazaki's films there are plenty of thrilling flying sequences as well as a chase involving a train and a car on an elevated railway line.<br/><br/>The only parts I wasn't so keen on were a couple of scenes that seemed somewhat cartoony such as when two characters flexed their muscles and burst of of their shirts in a way that reminded me of ""The Incredible Hulk"", that said I'm sure it would amuse younger viewers so I can't really hold it against the film. I think it says something about the quality of the animation and the story that such a detail would stand out, after all it is an animated film.<br/><br/>I watched the film in Japanese with English subtitles so can't comment on the quality of the English dub."

It was like a real time-travel in terms of miyazaki development: you can see where he gets lots of character designs for the future from, especially when it comes to 'grannies' and the soundtrack. The story was very cool, the start was very dramatic and left you asking a lot of questions (like a real appetizer) about what happens. I was very impressed with pazu, especially as a role-model kind of character, and I think the relationship between him and sheeta is the most romantic miyazaki to date. those of you who are well acquainted with miyazaki's other works will recognise certain things as if they were directly taken from here, some of it really is quite uncanny, but you've got to love it all the same."

This film has everything you could want, the story is one that makes you remember what it was like to be a child; you don't see the technicality of the film, you see true people on a great adventure.

"andynortonuk","10","2","2","10 October 2005"," Miyazaki Takes to the Sky: A Review of Castle in the Sky
","Hayao Miyazaki has become the toast of the animation world with his effortless successfully epics, like Princess Monoke and Spirited Away, establishing a reputation of international acclaim. But, long before he made epics with environmental messages and films with more magic than you can shake a magic wand with, he made this; Tenk청 no shiro Rapyuta, better known as Castle in the Sky, which pre-dates all of his box-office grossing fantasies he has become renowned for the world over. In addition, in my humble opinion, Castle in the Sky remains his best film by far.<br/><br/>For those of you who have not viewed this epic yet, the storyline is a boy becomes friend with this girl, who has fallen from the sky but landed safe fully with a magic medallion she wears. They soon end up being chased by pirates and agents trying to hunt down her medallion, as this is the only artefact to a floating castle known as Laputa; you need to bear in mind that the boy always wanted to explore this legendary castle. So, with his passion in mind, the boy and girl eventually team up with the pirates, and set off to find this castle, although they have been followed by the agents to steal its treasures. I will leave the story there, but will note that the ending is climatic and exciting, as they work out who the girl really is.<br/><br/>With such a story that is never that straightforward at times, there is more that such a fantastic story that makes this my all-time favourite animated film. Why, you ask? For starters, there are action-packed sequences, like the chase sequence through the mines, executed with great suspense as well as being entertaining to the audience. There are also some great comic moments, such as the men showing off their muscles before they start a fight in the street. Trust me, with the character designs for these guys, and the character animation done well to exploit their expressions; it is only just the tip of the iceberg of some great comic moments present in Miyazaki's masterpiece. Also, as a member of the audience, the development of the main characters is done brilliantly, as we view a relationship between the boy and the girl throughout this film. This is something you do not see that much in animated cinema, as such schmaltz in over polished western animated films spoil this progression tragically.<br/><br/>So, for those who think Hayao Miyazaki is just another celebrated animation director for this current climate of animated cinema in recent years, they better think again. This is because he has been successfully establishing his trademarks, such as the focus on children and his indulgent passion for flight, brilliantly for a long time before he made his truly deserved impact on the international scene. Castle in the Sky shows Miyazaki at his best, which is a standard he has been developing ever since, entertaining and fascinating millions worldwide along the way."
"tikki_tack","10","2","2","11 September 2005"," Totally beautiful.
","This is a really good movie. It has everything. I've seen princess Mononoke and Spirited away by Hayao, but this is something completely different, even though you can sense the ""Miayazaki-tone"" of it. The drawings... wonderful. The story: even better. The characters... amazing. I thought Princess Mononoke was one of the best movies I've ever seen. Now it get's competition. If you haven't seen it, see it. Ifyou have seen it... then pray to the lord that you will see anything as good as that again. Because you wont. (That i, if you have seen princess Mononoke already...)

Which, by the way is a wonderful song."
"roycaldwell","10","2","2","4 September 2003"," A Masterpiece
","This film is a masterpiece: visually stunning and full of poetry.  Again, Miyazaki shows his ability to rediscover a child's sense of wonder.  The plot here, like that of Princess Mononoke, demonstrates his mythopoetic genius: he has taken elements from existing stories and woven them into a compelling, visionary narrative: here we have the world of Dickens married to Swift's floating island Laputa, with dashes of swashbuckling pirate tales.  Miyazaki is always fascinated by flight (Kiki, Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Totoro), but nowhere does he do anything as magical with that theme as here.  He has transposed sea-going vessels, and all the imagery associated with it (pirates, ocean liners, great gunships), into the air. This film seems to cancel the real history of flight, and to substitute another, imaginary version.  A double anachronism: this is the way the nineteenth century would have imagined flight.  It cannot be denied either that the film has a strong emotional dimension: the boy who dreams of flying goes back to the mine and watches as a girl floats down from the sky into his arms!  The film is filled with moments of stunning beauty, poetically and visually: Pazu and Sheeta in the gondola over the pirate ship watch the huge gunship emerge below them; the destruction of Laputa - the walls come crumbling down and rain into the sea - Apocalypse; the great tree of Laputa floats away at the end.<br/><br/>
The more I reflect on Miyazaki's films, the more I am convinced that he is one of the greatest filmmakers, one of the great artists of our time."

Luckily, I recently saw a subtitled version at a museum and let me say, it's a great movie. Like all of Miyazaki's films, you expect one thing you get another, but you are never disappointed. The film focuses on Pazu, who into his arms falls Sheeta, who holds the power to Laputa, the castle in the sky. They are chased by government agents and pirates (who they later befriend). It's a thrill ride the whole way through, and it's a wonderful movie. The visuals are amazing, and you have to give a ton of credit to the animators.

"itamarscomix","7","7","12","24 May 2005"," Early masterpiece from Miyazaki
","Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime.<br/><br/>As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...)

","This film is a great deal of fun, though the depth of thought behind it does not match that of others by the same director. My primary comment, though, is how very poor Anna Paquin was as the voice of Sheeta. Her accent varied from American to British to New Zealandic and back again with no apparent rhyme or reason. A very bizarre experience. She also seemed to play her character with little of the backbone that the lovely girl the movie portrays actually displayed. Otherwise, a must-see for Japanese animation fans! (And I hope everyone has already seen ""My Neighbor Totoro""! A truly great movie in every respect!)"

","Miazaki, only great ideas have come out of your head ever since you started some of the best anime films of all time especially this one. This was the first work of yours i have ever seen which may hold the answer to why I like it the best. The characters Pazu, Sheetah, dola were all developed I especially liked the view on colonel Muska in how he was your friend and your enemy at the same time.<br/><br/>The idea of a castle floating in the sky is just amazing, Miazaki I'm sure has one of the most creative minds in the world. I especially liked the background of laputa in which Pazu's father saw it which inspired young Pazu and sheetah to find it although Sheetah was already the Queen or Princess of Laputa. This was definitely my favorite Anime of all time."

","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: A young miner boy named Pazu, who dreams of proving the existence of the Castle in the Sky known as Laputa, a small part of which his father photographed many years ago, finds his life turned upside down when a mysterious girl named Sheeta (Shita in the original Japanese version) literally falls into his arms with an even more mysterious crystal hanging around her neck. Two factions are after her - a family of goofy pirates led by the elderly yet energetic Dola and government agents led by the sinister Muska allegedly on behalf of the military. But what is Muska truly after? <br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki's second full length animated feature has all the abundant energy and miraculous flying machinery one has come to expect from his colorful and seemingly boundless imagination. Lush, beautiful animation brings a miraculous story of good vs. evil to life in a way that few films can.<br/><br/>I have never heard the original English language dub, but from what I've read it was assembled very quickly and was quite poor as a result, with its cast (which included Barbara Goodson and Lara Cody as the child leads) settling for just reading the dialogue without actually performing it. The Disney re-dub, recorded in 1998 but not released until 2003, is very good and will make the adventure enjoyable even for most subtitle purists. The only voice in the English version that doesn't quite work is Anna Pacquin as Sheeta. Anna is not exactly a great actress to begin with, but it doesn't take someone with Katherine Hepburn level talent to maintain a consistent voice, but this is something Anna herself is not able to do in this feature. Her voice is ultimately all over the place, sounding American one moment and then sounding like a British teenager in other parts and sadly not fitting the appearance of Sheeta at all. As Pazu, James Van Der Beek sounds more like a teenager than a little boy, but at least his voice is consistent and even his detractors would have a hard time denying that he brings a lot of energy to the role. However, the real stars of the English dub are Cloris Leachman as Dola and Mark Hamill as Muska. Leachman has plenty of fun with the wily pirate mother, while Hamill delivers a brilliantly sinister and cold blooded performance as Muska, arguably the only real villain Miyazaki has ever featured in any of his films. While Miyazaki's other films feature antagonists who have some redeeming qualities, whether it's showing kindness to the less fortunate (such as Lady Eboshi in ""Princess Mononoke"") or turn around and become somewhat better people (Witch of the Waste in Miyazaki's adaptation of ""Howl's Moving Castle""), Muska has none of these sympathetic qualities. He's not fallen, he's not misguided, he's just bad, I mean he is just plain BAD, a power hungry tyrant who'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, including shooting a little girl's hair off one pigtail at a time (that image is burned into my memory, for better or worse, as one of the most disturbing acts of violence I've ever seen in a film), and Hamill plays him with just the right amount of flamboyant relish. At times the former Star Wars hero's Joker voice (from the various DCAU projects he was a part of) creeps in, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>But no matter which language you watch it in, ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" is easily in the top 5 of must see Miyazaki films."

","I find it incredibly annoying when I'm watching a supposedly ""exciting"" film and I can see what's going to happen. A particularly bad example was the supposed SF horror-thriller ""Pitch Black"" when it was possible to work out who was going to be eaten next just by reading the names from the cast list in reverse order: those who had the biggest parts survived longest. ""Laputa: Castle In The Sky"" manages to be far more exciting and far less predictable, and does it all without foul language, explicit violence, or the kind of criminal superman Hollywood has loved ever since ""The Silence of the Lambs"". It would be too complicated for small children, but it's eminently suitable for adults as well as teenagers. As usual with Miyazaki's work the characters were well-rounded and believable, and that helped to keep me guessing as to what was going to happen next. I was on the edge of my seat right until the end. It need hardly be said that the film is visually striking too: perhaps the most astonishing of the Ghibli films I have seen, with the vast perspectives of Slagg's Ravine, houses clinging to the edge, the huge and strangely beautiful city of Laputa, the sullen fort which reaches up into the clouds, and the weird flying machines that are the ""Goliath"" and the ""Tiger Moth"". From an SF point of view it might be loosely categorised as steampunk혰it's set in an alternative past with high technology혰but it is a thrilling, well-written, beautiful film well-leavened with humour which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys imagination."
"davehbrown","10","3","4","6 March 2006"," Movies don't get better than this.
","Castle in the Sky is my favorite Miyazaki film, and is as good as movies can get. The story is very accessible and straightforward. A young boy sees a young girl floating down from the sky. From that point on, the two of them share the coolest, wildest adventure that you can imagine. Actually, it exceeds anything you can imagine. They get chased by bad guys, hook up with air pirates, and eventually arrive at the legendary castle that floats in the sky.<br/><br/>What I really love about this movie is that most of it takes place in the air. The flying machines, and fortresses, and warships were wonderfully inventive.<br/><br/>The animation is not at the same level of brilliance of Miyazaki's later releases, but it will still take your breath away in places.<br/><br/>If you love good old fashioned action adventure films, this is one that you have to see."

'why not watch a Miyazaki movie and pretend ""Agent Cody Banks Goes To Hades"" isn't about to be green lit for $80 million'<br/><br/>Laputa is a feast in every way. Very rarely are children's characters so subtly and satisfyingly created on film. The relationship between the two leads, Pazu and Sheeta, is at the heart of this stunning fantasy-adventure, but also seeking the lost floating city (for different reasons) are colourful pirates and government agents who complete an excellent and ambiguous character dynamic.<br/><br/>The film sits somewhere between Nausicaa and Totoro in terms of Miyazakis themes. It has the epic (and environmental) feel of the former with the latter's more personal focus on children's relationships and how honest friendship can ease the difficulties inherent in growing up. Sound sickly? Well it isn't. Miyazaki has almost supernatural judgment in these matters.<br/><br/>For anyone looking for a film they can watch with the kids, you'll find this hard to beat.

What separates this (along with the hilarious ""Porco Rosso"") is its playful brand of movie-serial cliffhanger action.

","This is the 4th Miyazaki film I have seen so far (the others were ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Spirited Away"", and ""Princess Mononoke""). All I can say is that the man is a genius. This one is slightly different from his other films in that it leans more towards sci-fi than fantasy ... also, for the most part the focus of the animation is on architecture and structures, whereas most of his films are more about nature (though there are some beautiful natural scenes, especially later in the film). The animation is superb as usual, and the soundtrack is arguably the best of any of the aforementioned films. But the best thing about this movie is the strength of the character relationships; the true love and friendship between Pazu and Sheeta is one the most beautiful and heart-warming things I have EVER seen on film ... (also, the character 'Uncle' provides a rough prelude to one of the best characters in ""Spirited Away"", Kamagi the boiler-man); the character depth in this film also provides stark contrast to the dark, story-and-message focus of ""Princess Mononoke"" (probably my favourite Miyazaki film). Overall, this is another simply superb Miyazaki film - another true animated classic."

There wasn't a single moment that I was moved or gripped by the storyline. I didn't find it humorous either.<br/><br/>The most entertaining part was when Pazu was watching Sheeta floating down to earth and it went downhill from that point.<br/><br/>I think kids between 6 to 11 might enjoy it but as a 22 year old I was very, very bored throughout.<br/><br/>Maybe I find it dull because it was made in 1986 and I've seen Nausica채 of the and Princess Mononoke first. Maybe if I watched them in reverse order I would have enjoyed this because I just felt I was watching a very poor version of what I'd already seen before (well the main themes of the story). And it also felt predictable.<br/><br/>Big, big disappointment."
"Lupercali","8","6","11","20 September 2004"," Impressive, but not a masterpiece
","The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.<br/><br/>For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.<br/><br/>I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.<br/><br/>The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.<br/><br/>There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.<br/><br/>The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.<br/><br/>Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.<br/><br/>BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa."

It's one of Miyazaki's earlier works, and that may explain it, but I just couldn't enjoy this film even though I really wanted to. I know it sounds funny to say, but it was simply just too ""cartoony"". The beginning of the film is pure magic and for the first 15 minutes or so, I was engrossed in the story and looking forward to the rest of the film. But soon after that, it degraded to almost Saturday-morning cartoon levels of predictability, relying on exaggerated and typical villains and supporting characters.

"swanmj","10","2","3","17 April 2015"," One of the Best Movies of Any Kind - EVER!
","A perfect 10 out of 10! Laputa is such a magical movie that I would have to rank it alongside the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 version), Beauty and the Beast, and Jurassic Park in terms of the best movies ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is an artistic genius. Laputa has an engaging plot, likable characters, aesthetically pleasing art, and a good balance of adventure and comic relief. Colonel Mushka makes for a great villain to watch on screen. Most importantly, there are also philosophical, ethical, and social messages behind the art, action, and adventure. It shows how militarism can ruin the beauty of the world. It shows how a madman seeking power places everybody in danger. To quote Sheeta in the movie, ""No matter how advanced your technology is, no matter how powerful your weapons are, the world cannot live without love."""

"toqtaqiya2","8","2","3","20 August 2010"," One of the best and most successful early anime films.
","Castle In The Sky produces more wonder and perhaps more excitement than any other film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's not his best film, but it's a wonderful early Studio Ghibli effort. Industrial Age Europe was obviously an inspiration on the world of the film. There are elements of the fantastic, like the sky castle itself. The castle was part of a utopia created by an advanced civilization through technology. Miyazaki's animation style presents this world vividly and wonderfully. There is some truly breathtaking scenery. Compared to today's anime, especially by Ghibli, the animation of Castle In The Sky looks crude. This is hardly a distraction though. Until Akira (1988) there were very few big budget anime films. There was also a lack of good talent. What raises Castle In The Sky above average is its design and creativity. It helped that Joe Hisaishi composed an effective score that sounds enchanting in the film. Sheeta, a girl, is the heroine of the story. She meets Pazu, a boy who quickly becomes her best friend. They're good, courageous children. For a Miyazaki film there is a surprisingly large amount of action, producing much excitement. The children are almost always on the move. Sheeta's levistone pendant represents advanced technology, something that saves her again and again. The story isn't very original, but there's still a lot to like here. I highly recommend seeing Castle In The Sky. It's a film that one can treasure."
"honorhorror","10","2","3","1 August 2009"," As you wish, I would explain about the pirates' affection with Sheeta.
","Casting Sheeta as the main character is definitely what made this movie unique after so many years, since Sheeta is a natural charmer. But since many of the users here are asking about the relationship of Sheeta and the pirates, I'd have to explain my understanding.<br/><br/>Firstly, a little girl at age 13 is both a sign of purity/innocence and liveliness, so all the characters, despite gender, age or any other demographic characters, would treat her with courtesy. The only exception is the self-imposed king of castle of sky Muska. He is the materialized human mental as greed and ambition, with the pursuit in civilization and unlimited destruction of nature and human/naturally/manufactured lives. He is, naturally, despised by all the good guys in the movie.<br/><br/>Compared to him are the goofy/foul/lovely pirates who had a strong mom who always control them and maintained their simple mental and lives. Even though they are death-wish burglars who defy the law, they didn't commit much of the crimes of species-annihilation and mass-murdering own comrades, which were committed by Muska. So, in some certain senses, pirates were only materialized naughty boys who's physically pushing 40 but mentally only 13-15 years old. The appearance and companion of Sheeta, was not only their enlightenment of puppy love, but also a strong reflection to their mom's undefeated personality. The funny thing is they never even dare challenging Pazu and Sheeta's friendship(lovers' relationship?) and close contacts, they salivate for such a relationship but also realized that Pazu's mentally mature and taking heavy responsibilities, which they can't have....So in some senses, they are mummy's good boys.<br/><br/>In Japanese culture, men are too much burdened, with responsibility, honor and all kinds of stuff which finally killed him before his old age(like karachi) or destroyed his personality(making him a alcoholic). Hayao Miyazaki created these fearless and trouble-less pirates to reflect on such social status and promote his own value system for men, which was even developed in later projects, all portraying strong women's influences on men.<br/><br/>Castle in the sky is a fairy tale about two kids' fellowship which lasted even longer than their civilization. It's also a subtle fable about the direction of all civilizations. The first 5 minutes of the movie were absolutely tear-jerking, with all sorts of sci-fi sky-ships floating and landing and escorting in an ancient wall-paint style. It's marked with 1980's animation technical limit, but it's still so moving and touching after the 1st viewing. Every time the flying stone shines and Sheeta flies, the whole animation were saturated with a kind of beauty and poetry that is not easily described by words. Not to mention the breathtaking final scenes where the structure of the entire castle in the sky fell apart. If you ever look closely, the bricks fell one by one, no kidding.<br/><br/>Sheeta and Pazu were, in my and my parents' opinion, too young to have such a relationship. But on earth, what's the wrong with this relationship? They were only kids, more specifically, orphans. But they were both brave, dedicated and much more responsible than most adults in the story. Their love for each other fixed their immaturity by giving them the absolute basis for fighting for each other. So in this way, Castle in the sky is also one of the best love story ever written.<br/><br/>Had to mention the robots in the movie. These robots are not emphasized by their robotic movements, rather, they are portrayed as lives with robot mechanics. So their fates were also cared about by all the kids and adults audiences alike.<br/><br/>Castle in the Sky is still underachieved on this site and it will receive more attention and higher rating as time goes by. If you haven't seen it, go purchase it on DVD because it's definitely worth buying."
"echai","10","2","3","18 June 2009"," The greatest children's fantasy adventure film ever made - not opinion, fact.
","I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film. By favourite I don't mean something I like for now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. This is obvious because I am never going to be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, I'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are female). Consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) for producing the English dub of this film which is far superior to the Di$ney production which is not even funny - I've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the Macek version is SO good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It's not available on any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure.<br/><br/>There are hundreds of competent reviews so I'm going to put some trivia here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this film.<br/><br/>First up I'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on IMDb combined pale into insignificance.<br/><br/>The fascinating story with this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where I grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest British Isles.<br/><br/>The island is of course from Swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves together myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the architecture in addition is based on Peruvian ruins though I'm not sure, someone told me that.<br/><br/>Anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film REALLY will want to check out Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for Masterpiece Theatre - some of his key frame animation. He also did key frame for Sherlock Hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds I've ever seen too. Also check out Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. What else... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they're pretty rare.<br/><br/>This film is such a gift, I don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!"

I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if mankind really can't live with too much power. The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.<br/><br/>This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days (It's a Wonderful Life etc etc). Well, things change...."

","This anime is a pure chef-d'oeuvre. And you can believe a french man saying it. As usual, Miyazaki Hayao brings wonderful drawings, smooth character animation and background pictures have obviously been done with great art and hard work. What makes the difference with any Disney-like anime is the movie-making talent of the Ghibli Studio team. The scenario exists, it has depth and induces reflection. About the hopes of people, their fate, the greed of adults, their lack of imagination and permanent war-making attitude... In the center of the story, 2 children, who fight to find and to preserve Laputa, the flying castle/tree, magnificent and deadly. This movie makes you laugh, think, and it even made me cry (and that's not so frequent). My advice : watch it and go directly to sleep. The movie still runs in your dreams."
"Weasel75","3","8","21","6 July 2006"," Absolutely *not* my favorite anime
","This movie is absolutely far from being my favorite. Actually, it reaches the opposite end of the scale.<br/><br/>Why? (personal opinion) Lacking the depth of Mononoke-Hime and the beauty and fantasy of Chihiro (Spirited Away), if falls short in most regards. Maybe I am spoiled by the later movies, but the story was flat, predictable and straight forward. The graphics were sometimes really nice, but neither overwhelming nor stunning. For me the story failed to unfold, and I never felt connected to any of the protagonists. Sitting in the cinema I was (strangely) reminded of Star Wars 1. A lot of nice scenes and random events, but badly connected and hardly surprising at any given time. Also, the movie contains various elements of slapstick, fighting (with some force/brutality - plenty people get killed (though not directly visible)) and Jules-Verne-style tech-fantasy. But it never excels in any of those elements, they come rather ""cheap"" and mixing them wildly does not make any movie any better.<br/><br/>For kids it might be an okay movie, but it lacks the ""cuteness""-factor (except for some seconds with (fantasy) animals). For parents (or adults in general) it might become boring.<br/><br/>This is my heavily biased subjective opinion - maybe without a 7.9 here on IMDb I would have watched it with lower expectations, but I guess I still would have been disappointed big time....."

","Synopsis
This film is set in a Victorian era that might have been, influenced by the visions of writers such as Jules Verne. As Pazu, the apprentice of the engineer who maintains a mine's elevator machinery, carries his boss's dinner back to the mine, an unconscious pigtailed girl floats down from the sky into his arms. This girl, Sheeta, and her magical levitation-stone pendant hold the key to a mysterious, mythical sky-castle known as Laputa. Sheeta and Pazu must flee from both air-pirates, who seek the sky kingdom for its legendary treasure, and the army, led by a government agent with his own mysterious agenda for Laputa.<br/><br/>The film has really good visual with a plot which would make you go ""wow"". You don't even have to be an anime fan to enjoy this but can still respect the art of this movie.<br/><br/>The cast was also pretty good, I watched the Disney dub, please don't listen to anyone who says that the dub is bad or the old dub is better because they are wrong. While James Van Der Beek sounded a bit old as Pazu i still enjoyed his performance, Anna Paquin also did well as Sheeta. Other voice actors including Cloris Leachman, Mark Hamil, Richard Dysart, Jim Cummings, John Hostetter, Mandy Patinkin, Michael McShane and Andy Dick were all phenomenal in this movie.<br/><br/>Recommended to all ages."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","8","1","1","10 February 2020"," One of Miyazaki's best
","I've always found myself more of a mild fan of Miyazaki's films than most seem to be. I haven't come close to disliking any of them, and as far as numerical ratings go, I've given all of them 7s or 8s out of 10. I know this could be a somewhat controversial opinion, and I respect that it might be a cultural thing, being less well-versed in Japanese traditions and mythology, which I'm sure Miyazaki implements into all his movies. They're often uniquely Japanese affairs, and perhaps a greater knowledge of that country and its favourite storytelling themes and styles would help me love his films rather than merely like them a lot.<br/><br/>All that being said, there are absolutely aspects of his movies that can be appreciated by everyone, regardless of their culture or knowledge of Japan. I'm sure this is what has ensured Miyazaki and numerous other Studio Ghibli films to get the sort of international attention and acclaim they've gotten over the past few decades. Most obviously, all are absolutely beautiful to look at, with spectacular use of colour and traditional, hand-drawn animation. The music is always excellent too, and the worlds created are fascinating, engaging, visceral, and occasionally quite haunting.<br/><br/>All these positive qualities can be attributed and then some to 1986's Castle in the Sky. This movie is staggering to look at and listen to, and it's beyond impressive that this movie is over thirty years old yet still looks as great as it does. I believe if this movie were released in cinemas today, people would still rave about the animation and visuals, even if they were under the impression that it was a brand new movie. The music is as good as you'd expect from a Miyazaki film, and the world is absolutely gorgeous. It's worth watching the film just for that experience of seeing this place that Miyazaki and his animation team have painstakingly created.<br/><br/>Thankfully, many of my extremely subjective/ perceived shortcomings with some of Miyazaki's other films aren't issues here. Sometimes I feel like his films aren't terribly engaging when it comes to story or characters, which Castle in the Sky gets around by having what I thought to be a faster pace, and more general excitement and tension than some of his other films. Emotionally I wasn't as moved as I may have wanted to be, which is something that I have found with all his films I've seen so far. The visuals and score are often emotional in a way, on their own, but not so much the struggles of the characters, and here, I was somewhat invested, but not enough to make me unconditionally love the movie. I don't know why this is, but it's something I find with Miyazaki a lot of the time. Maybe it's a cultural thing, or maybe it's just emotions being subjective, but either way, when the film is still mostly well-paced and consistently beautiful, it isn't a huge problem. There are very few parts where the film truly drags, and it has a satisfying conclusion that makes all 125 minutes more than worth sitting through.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, Castle in the Sky isn't always regarded as classic Miyazaki, but in my opinion it should be. I thought this was on the same level quality-wise as the more widely celebrated Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and as such, would highly recommend this to anybody who may have watched and enjoyed those while overlooking this one. It's a fantastic technical achievement from an animation perspective, and another good reason why Miyazaki has become such an adored figure within the filmmaking world."

","This Is the one ghibli I didn't watch when I was young. And my thoughts are diffuse. I can't understand the praise or the high scores really. Maybe because I didn't watch it as a child.
Thing Is, the typical ghibli storytelling here lacks the magic atmosphere And places foremost. Laputa castle Is just a gigantic doomsday machine, in the wrong hands it spits out a nuclear beam. The robots are like terminators so in that sense the laputa is not a place for children. Then we have the mining colony. Where pirates and military shoot bazookas at the Children. Its not a very nice place at all. So ok we have the deathstar and the crazy robots and a militaryforce that kidnaps children. What I mean the movie would have been great If it went Akira all the way. But It doesn't do that. Its still a childrens movie. Even though it should not be. The cheeta girl also looks exactly like a copy of Kiki. Wich is weird. And the mechanic looks exactly like the bathhouse keeper. I also thinks that the high tech laputa castle Is really badly explained. What The heck is it? Except a weird horror cube deathstar puzzle. When the movie credits rolled i was still confuced of everything."
"nancyldraper","8","1","1","23 October 2019"," Even a lesser work of Studio Ghibli is still a masterpiece
","I'm awaiting my AAC (Age Appropriate Critic, 9 year old Sophie)'s review of this, but I will put in my two cents, while I wait. Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli, changed the world of Anime. It's influences transcended the borders of Japan, and even Disney, a company as American as apple pie, borrows the brilliance of Ghibli. Miyazaki captures both the imagination of a child and the subtle nuances of movement and response unique to childhood. Often the times of greatest brilliance are things happening in the background. Miyazaki waste neither frame nor background character. CASTLE IN THE SKY has all that quality. I watched the version with an American voice cast and the performances were good. The story took awhile to reveal itself, although it began with rapid paced action, which rather set the slower pace for the story amid a plethora of brilliant animation, imagination and characterization. To paraphrase a fellow commentator, although it is not one of my favourite Ghibli story, the lesser in world of Ghibli is still a masterpiece. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Adventure Anime}"

Yes Kurosawa is great but Miyazaki should be included in top 10 directors of all time because he has more than 7 ( at least) amazing movies."
"elicopperman","8","1","1","3 November 2018"," Studio Ghibli's First Venture
","1985 was the year Studio Ghibli was formed by legends Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. A year later, they released their first ever feature length film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (or just Castle in the Sky internationally). The film went on to garnish critical acclaim and a huge cult following amongst fans of Miyazaki's work. Needless to say, based on my love and appreciation for this man's work, I deem it as one of his best.<br/><br/>The general story follows the adventures of a young boy named Pazu and a girl named Sheeta who possesses a mysterious stone with the ability of levitation. In addition to keeping the crystal away from military agents, they embark on a quest to search for a legendary floating castle called Laputa. With that said, Pazu and Sheeta make an adorable couple of friends, as their chemistry with each other is very sweet but also heart wrenching given what circumstances come about to them. Both are determined to find this lost castle to rediscover its lost beauty, and it's really nice how they develop within the pirates they meet.<br/><br/>Speaking of said pirates, Dola's gang may seem antagonistic at first, but they're actually a genuinely entertaining and bittersweet gang, as they mold into one of the funniest family duos ever displayed in film. As for the real antagonist Colonel Muska, he is extremely hellbent on recovering Laputa for his own selfish and diabolical reasons, and therein lies possibly the film's biggest theme of all. You can use whatever weapons and machinery to get your way, but no matter what, love and nature are what matter most and taking them for granted does more harm than good.<br/><br/>In addition, the setting that emulates 19th century Europe really gives the film a strange albeit wonderful contrast between the prosperous town Pazu is from to the much more spectacular castle altogether. Even for their first ever feature, the animation really is astonishing, especially the usage of aircraft and clouds breaking up. The moments where the characters are in the air make one feel the sense of high open space, and the atmosphere around really makes one's jaw drop. It's great when the world building can sometimes steal the show from the actual cast.<br/><br/>If there are criticisms I do have, it's that while Dola's sons are entertaining in their own regard, the whole sub arch with them falling in love with Sheeta is rather pointless. It doesn't show up again after a couple of scenes and it actually gives a somewhat creepy feel to the movie. Also, while the Disney English dub is by no means bad, there is a little too much dialogue sprinkled throughout. It doesn't help that there are points that should be silent that are filled with annoying banter and out of place comedy. I'm yet to see the original dub, but I hope it's much better.<br/><br/>Overall, Castle in the Sky remains as the kickstarter to what would eventually become the most beloved Japanese animation studio of all time. The characters are extremely lovable and worth rooting for, the animation is nothing short of gorgeous, and the themes of prospering through nature over political action and violence are just as relevant today as they were back then. If you are yet to see this film, definitely give it a watch to see where the studio that brought us Totoro, Spirited Away and Princess Kaguya originally blossomed. It's an experience for the whole family, and one that I'm happy to rewatch after so many years."

Fast paced chase scenes follow deeply touching sweet emotional moments of wholesome friendship, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a playfully tense package with the addition of giant robots and sky pirates.

"roboticman","10","1","1","16 April 2018"," Studio Ghibli's best movie
","Most animated movies that come out are pretty good. Not all of them are perfect, but you'd be surprised how many good ones there are. But there's one that in my opinion, is the definitive one. The one that stands out above all. That movie is Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky.<br/><br/>In a different time period or world, there exists a legend of a floating castle named Laputa. Only few people have heard or seen it. One of them is a boy named Patzu, an adventurous thirteen year old kid who's father was obsessed with the castle after he took a picture of it. He is determined to find the castle and prove justice for his father.<br/><br/>At the same time, the princess of the Laputa, a girl named Sheeta, is kidnapped by a goverment agent named Muska who wants her amulet that is the key to a secret room on Laputa. As Muska is taking her away, a group of pirates hijack the ship and try to take the amulet from her. She climbs outside of the blimp and accidentally falls before they can get her. Her amulet saves her from falling and she gently glides down to a mysterious location. Patzu discovers her and takes care of her.<br/><br/>From then on, it turns into a full on adventure movies complete with robots, evil corporations, fighting, and the discovery of Laputa.<br/><br/>Watching this movie is like an experience. Something that takes you away from reality and puts you in this fantasy realm. When I first watched this movie, everything on screen that Studio Ghibli did, they did right. The animation, the music, the voice acting, the plot, and the resolution.<br/><br/>James Van Der Beek and Anna Paquin do fantastic jobs as both Patzu and Sheeta. So does Cloris Leachman as the main pirate. But the person that steals the show is Mark Hamill as Muska. Mark Hamill is a definitive villain. Just hearing his voice when he's threatening Sheeta gives me chills. This is probably his best performance since The Joker from Batman the Animated Series.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki and his team did a really good job creating the world and Laputa. You could probably take any frame from this movie and hang it on your wall. Just the way they put so much detail into Laputa is a real treat.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an adventure movie that is also an anime, has fantastic characters and of course and original story, then what are you doing reading my review. Go watch it."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","1","24 February 2018"," Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a near perfect Ghibli debut from the master of anime himself.
","You know what, they just don't make adventure films like these anymore. I never get that sense of wonderment, awe or anything that stimulates my cerebral cortex that holds my imagination. There's only one person I can rely on, Hayao Miyazaki. A young boy encounters a mysterious girl who has fallen from the sky. He is then entangled in a fantastical adventure to which they must travel to the mythical floating castle of Laputa in order to prevent its true power falling into the wrong hands. Straight off the bat, the animation is stunning. Yet again, every frame just looks like a piece of art. Elegant, ethereal and energetic. The attention to detail never fails to astound me. It evokes pure imagination and creativity that appeals to both mature and younger audiences. Sky pirates, floating islands, sentient ancient guardians and a small dosage of magic. That is the beauty of animation, and Japanese studios know this best. There are no limits to one's creativity and artistic integrity. Miyazaki co-founding Studio Ghibli allowed him to explore his range of concepts and give him freedom to his work. The script contained both heartfelt emotion and sporadic comedic moments that will bring both smiles and character investment. Our main protagonists were adorable, I ship them! Plenty of action and perilous tasks that heightened the tension. Laputa itself was just beautiful, it's clear that many fantasy films and video games took elements from the design of Laputa. The pacing was practically perfect, it's just a shame the ending was incredibly rushed! I literally shouted ""Noooo! You were so close to getting a 10/10!"". But alas, Laputa is Miyazaki's adventure animation that showcases his best talents. Oh, and the musical score...damn, t'was good."
"prundlaps","9","1","1","2 January 2018"," The movie has a touch of magic and science fiction.
","Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa aka Castle in the Sky is tied as my favorite Miyazaki movie. The story of Castle in the Sky is about, you guessed it; a castle in the sky. There's a legend about a floating island castle, called ""Laputa"" that contains all the riches a person can ever dream of having. The main male character, Panzo believes that the castle exists, and dreams of one day following his deceased father's footsteps, and finding the castle for himself. The only problem is, he doesn't know where the castle is. Then there's the main female character, Sheeta whom Panzo finds falling/floating down from the sky with a shining sky blue necklace that has some sort of relationship to Laputa's location. Panzo and Sheeta begin a friendship, perhaps love relationship and they decide to go on a journey to find Laputa together. But they run into trouble with, and clowny pirates, the greedy army along with some mysterious men led by an even more mysterious man named, Muska.
The stupid army was really funny, as were the pirates. Panzo and Sheeta are your average Miyazaki main characters, absolutely tragic and lovable! Honestly there's nothing to dislike about this anime and so much to love. It's truly a heart-pounding adventure story about friendship, loyalty, greed, and people's connection to nature. The anime starts off innocently and happily, but it quickly becomes darker as the evil ambitions of the antagonists make themselves known. The characters, good and evil, are all fully developed and interesting to watch."

Like all the Miyazaki films I've seen, this is well drawn and colorful and given to plenty of action, with the creative premise of an etherium crystal at the heart of the story. Beyond that it was a good guys versus bad guys type of story that didn't fully engage this viewer. That's not meant to be a negative in terms of recommending the film to anyone else, it's just that animated films fail to move me for the most part. This one was not an exception."

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","8 November 2017"," An enchanting exploration through heart and imagination, Hayou Miyazaki's Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey
","There are not many filmmakers like Hayou Miyazaki, especially here in the United States. The Japanese animation director and head of Studio Ghibli films has become a household in both the U.S and Japan for crafting motion pictures bound to push the boundaries of imagination since his directorial debut in the late 70s with 'The Castle of Cagliostro', a film that didn't see the light of day in the U.S until a little over a decade later. Castle in The Sky is a breathtaking adventure that dares to explore the indefinite world of heart and imagination, and what comes about Miyazaki's craftmanship is an journey that is by no means a tear-jerker, but an ultimately moving picture with an appeal for both kids, teens, and adults. Whether you are watching the original Japanese version or the English dub, the magic of Miyazaki's directorial hand shines like gold and transcends the picture into something more than your average family-friendly fairy tale. The film follows young teen Pazu (voiced by James Van Deek), an mechanical engineer who witnesses a young girl Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin) floating from the sky by the power of a glowing crystal she wears around your neck. When the two find themselves in a crash course between league of pirates lead by the dubious Dola (voiced by Cloris Leachman) and an army lead by a shady general (voiced by Jim Cummings) and the equally shady Muska (voiced by Mark Hamill), each of whom are after Sheeta to claim the crystal; the two youngster set out on a race to a secret temple floating thousands of feet in the sky. Together, they must learn the secret hidden within the mysterious castle. <br/><br/>What Hayou Miyazaki proves is that he is not a filmmaker who takes ambition to granted. Every inch of storytelling he carries is poured into the picture with no amount of ambition squander in the slightest. And the magic of his efforts shine through nearly every frame. Blending elements of high-classed fantasy and science-fiction with a potent touch of human drama, this beautifully animated film hits the right notes from beginning to end, and the excitement upheld in every scene following the introduction of our young characters dares to leaves us gripped. When young protagonist Paza and his newly found friend Sheeta unexpectedly find themselves cross paths with a group of shady individuals and corrupt army officials, tension almost immediately takes hold and set the story in a sleek, solidly-paced motion. And as the story strolls along, an absorbing humanity within the two characters grows; and that combined with the voiced performances by James Van Deek and Anna Paquin are the leading aspects of the character's winning over the hearts of audiences. Although the story is nothing necessarily revolutionary, Miyazaki proves capable of crafting a plot with complex layers mixed with biblical symbolism which is more than likely to fly over children's heads; and that is only part of the whimsical magic lying within the director's grandeur.<br/><br/>Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey of spectacular proportions, and definitely what earns the title of an outstanding achievement in Japanese animation. Whether you are a child, teenager, or an adult, there is something truly magical to be experienced in this adventure, something that many animated pictures are less than likely to uphold. For what Miyazaki accomplishes here, this is not far from the heights of a blistering masterpiece."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","12 September 2017"," Maybe too 'typical' of Miyazaki's work to be appreciated on its 'atypical' level...
","""Castle in the Sky"" is the eighth Hayao Miyazaki I discover and discover is the word, because despite the patterns you start noticing from one film to another, each one carries a mark of uniqueness like a sacred crystal amulet of its own.<br/><br/>And the more I see his work, the more routinely (I must confess) my amazement grows. I don't even watch them in chronological order and it doesn't affect my judgments, ""Nausicaa"" looked more accomplished than ""Porco Rosso"" or ""Kiki"" and while not being as sophisticated as ""Mono-noke"", ""Ponyo"" hit a more sensitive chord. Now, what can I say about ""Castle in the Sky"" without being taken in a maze of hackneyed and boring superlatives? Let me think a little<br/><br/>Well, I'll borrow a compliment Roger Ebert made about Wes Anderson, which I think applies perfectly for Myazaki: the Japanese master's mind would be a wonderful place to visit, it seems that even animated frames are too limited, too small a space to carry all the expansive range of ideas that can flourish out of his imagination. ""A Castle in the Sky"" is only his third animated feature and yet it is so close to an unprecedented level of animated perfection even on the field of storytelling, it is so rich your own mind can lose track. <br/><br/>I guess I could have said the same about ""Nausicaa"", you've got to wonder how he managed to outdo himself one film after another, and he hadn't made ""My Neighbor Totoro"" yet. Still, I can see in ""Totoro"" or even ""Kiki Delivery Service"", a desire to get back to a simpler story-line, and not to my displeasure because this is the kind of plot I enjoy more in Miyazaki. ""Castle in the Sky"" is nothing short of a masterpiece but I have a soft spot for his character-driven movies. Miyazaki is never as hypnotic and impressive when his frames are more in states of contemplation, as if they were in an awe of their own material. <br/><br/>Of course, action is outstanding, and Miyazaki had already demonstrated that he mastered the sky as the background to thrilling fights and chases, showcasing a level of dedication that only Disney movies can compete with (barely) but Miyazaki, the spiritual man, the poet, is so capable of transcending the limits of action that some parts from ""Castle in the Sky"" are too unsurprising especially since they came after ""Nausicaa"". To be fair though, there's more to enjoy than a series of chases in the air starting with the heroine. I loved the way the character of Sheeta didn't duplicate the ""Nausicaa"" model, she's not a fighter but a simple girl who hides a secret, symbolized by a mysterious amulet.<br/><br/>And even the revelation about her regal ancestry doesn't turn her into some kick-ass heroine. Miyazaki doesn't insult his audience's intelligence, while Nausicaa had her skills from the start, Sheeta is really caught in a coming-of-age narrative. The second character Pazu, a boy working in a mine factory, is eager to follow her, embodying the adventurous spirit of childhood (he's like Fio in ""Porco Rosso"" and Tombo In ""Kiki"") but his lack of experience makes him commit some blatant mistakes in judgment, he's just a kid after all. As a matter of fact, even the big bad pirates from the start are only kids when confronted to their bossy and experienced mother Dola, who's like a mixture between Ma Baker, Agnes Skinner, Grandma Addams and Captain Hook. <br/><br/>I loved all the peripheral characters... from those who brought up the comedic element the film would have severely lacked to Uncle Pomme who provided the obligatory Miyazaki moment of meditation of the virtues we should all treasure from Earth. Miyazaki has covered the sky, the sea and the earth, he's indeed the most environmentalist director ever and ""Castle in the Sky"" combines the idea of earth with the spiritual elevation through the castle of Laputa, a legendary city whose name was borrowed from Gulliver's Travel and that used to rule over the world and incarnate the boundless ambition of men. The antagonist, Prince Muska wants to take a hold of the amulet to be the Earth new ruler. <br/><br/>He's helped by a whole army and a giant robot who reveals the first inspiration of Miyazaki, French masterpiece ""The King and the Mockingbird"", which could have been called ""Castle in the Sky"".The film belongs to the complex realm of Miyazaki's stories, with so many layers you've got to keep yourself pretty focused to enjoy it. In fact, it's perhaps the one flaw I can concede to this particular film, it requires a certain conscience of the inspiration, understanding before enjoyment, and two hours of such deep and rich writing might be too difficult for younger audiences. I'm not implying that this is a film aimed for children as it provides a sweet and a nice friendship story between a boy and a girl so it would be a shame if children missed that story. <br/><br/>Miyazaki has always been an expert when it came to concoct mixtures of mature and inspiring material. This time, the film flies in many directions before we can identify the main plot line, and there are a few disorienting changes of tone. It's all visually rich and entertaining but I didn't feel as engaged as in the previous movies, if not the best Miyazaki, it was probably the one with the best potential. Which might explain why there's another Miyazaki named ""Howl's Moving Castle""."

However, with this I disagree this isn't just the one of the greatest animation or greatest animation film ever made...It is the greatest FILM ever made. Castle In The Sky completely blew me away to the point of being stunned and left in complete silence by the final scene. Words simply cannot describe how beautiful this masterpiece of a film really is. The soundtrack is possibly the best featured in any film ever, with beautiful orchestral and piano centred compositions capturing the aw and beauty magnificently of the on-screen visuals. The film flows perfectly with each scene progressing the plot and developing the story. Our two protagonists are simply amazing, with the duo having some of the best chemistry ever put to screen and of course while the whole film is simply stunning, the final act is one of the most enchanting, beautiful and magical experiences in film history. I can safely say that this may be one of the only films without a single minor flaw, even nit- picking is near-impossible. The plot follows the story of a young girl who is saved by a mysterious power concealed in her necklace after falling from an airship. She is cared for by a young miner boy who instantly bonds with her and reveals to her his burning passion to find the ancient sky city of Laputa. All while a rowdy group of pirates and a relentless agent ruthlessly hunt the two with the intention of finding and raiding the city. Castle In The Sky also completely surprised me with it's huge, spectacular action scenes and fat-paced adventure theme especially towards the end of the first act. Miyazaki and the Ghibli team completely blew my mind in what they achieved with this anime classic. Castle In The Sky will have you in near tears on how beautifully animated and powerful it is, without a doubt Studio Ghibli's first and best and Miyazaki's magnum opus. Castle In The Sky 100% deserves a 10/10!"
"Mintroll","9","1","1","27 July 2016"," unforgettable fantasy
","This is one of my favorite film by Studio Ghibli. The unique world can only be created by Hayao Miyazaki. The first moment that a girl slowly falls from the sky, in the fantastic sound, audience will be glued to the story. Especially I like the picture of the castle in the sky which spreads after diving into the eye of a storm. I've never seen such an attractive world. The beauty of the picture is one point worthy of note.<br/><br/>The story line is quite simple, but suggestively tells something important to us. Varieties of interpretation can be considered. So this animation film is able to entertain not only children but also adults, all generations. I cannot find the worlds but excellent."
"Irishchatter","8","1","1","18 July 2015"," A really enjoyable adventure movie!
","I quite enjoyed watching the film, the graphics were beautiful and the music score was really uplifting for an 80's film!<br/><br/>I found the movie had great action like the train scene where Sheeta and Pazu were being chased by their formal enemies which were the pirates. The film even had good humour with the pirate boys admiring Sheeta. I honestly thought she wasn't attractive but if they thought she was, I'll leave them to it haha. Although I have to admit, herself and Pazu were such a cute couple! I wish they both actually kissed instead of leaving the scene already in the end!<br/><br/>I was surprised that Mark Hamil aka Luke Skywalker and Jim Cummings aka Dr Eggman from SatAm (Sonic the hedgehog series) were involved in this anime movie. I thought Jim Cummings sounded like John Goodman seriously?! He is so talented with his voice!<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw the film so I'm giving it 8/10"
"evaherinkova","9","1","1","22 May 2015"," One of Studio Ghibli's best
","While originally released in 1986 in Japan, an English version of this film was not widely available until 2003, which caused Castle in the Sky to become somewhat of a black sheep in the Studio Ghibli collection. Don't let this discourage you, however - Castle in the Sky is a fantastic, classic movie that manages to elaborately intertwine the themes of nature, technology, loyalty, and friendship into an epic adventure that still holds strong today.<br/><br/>With fast-paced action and beautiful animation, Castle in the Sky is an incredible film-watching experience for any Studio Ghibli lover or fantasy/fiction enthusiast."
"MissSimonetta","10","1","1","27 July 2014"," A great kickoff for Studio Ghibli
","The story and characters of Castle in the Sky (1986) are not wholly original: Miyazaki had already told a story of a plucky boy and a girl with mysterious power against a corrupt villain out to resurrect ancient, apocalyptic technology in his TV series, Future Boy Conan (1978). However, both the world and the characters of CitS are more fleshed out than their TV counterparts.<br/><br/>The world-building is phenomenal, a fantastical 19th century world of giant airships and floating islands. It would not surprise me if this film has inspired many a steampunk novel or movie.<br/><br/>The animation and backgrounds are superb. The music is equally haunting and whimsical. The characters are so likable, the themes of technology and corruption still relevant. The film is fun and full of action, but there are also meditative moments and poignancy.<br/><br/>Overall, Studio Ghibli could not have gotten a better start than with this charming fantasy-adventure."

","I have had this movie for plenty of years, and over the years I have collected almost every Hayao Miyazaki film there is, and this movie never gets old to watch! I seriously am amazed by Hayao Miyazaki's works, and this movie is beyond no means any exception! The story between the two main characters and their journey is so compelling as the action in Castle in the Sky is nothing like I've ever seen! Between the artwork, and the story line, I can't see why people wouldn't love this movie! I truly recommend this movie to any person seeking a good movie of action, adventure, and traditional Japanese animation from what I believe is the greatest animation director on Earth!"
"MattBriselli","9","1","1","21 April 2014"," A Masterpiece of Animation
","Castle in the Sky (1986) is one of director and writer, Hayao Miyazaki's first films, however it is still set in his fantasy world. In a land containing fantastical air ships and magical pendants, Sheeta (Anna Paquin) and Pazu (James Van Der Beek) find themselves on the run from highly incompetent and whimsical pirates, being led by their mother (Cloris Leachman), and the government, led by the mysterious Muska (Mark Hamill). <br/><br/>Once again Miyazaki proves why he is one of my favorite directors. His use of animation to create an entirely new fantastic world takes the audience out of their seats and leaves them elated and yearning for more. Adding this to an adorable love story, the film was a true classic and a masterpiece of animation."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","7 January 2014"," First true Ghibli film and a testament to its talent
","With the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were able to found Studio Ghibli, and this was their first official feature film. And what a great film it was and still is, having withstood the test of time remarkable well. Inspired by Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, it's a tale about a world that has fallen into ruin after a golden age - a common theme with Miyazaki - and the miracles of yesterday have become legends and myths. Including Laputa, the eponymous castle in the sky. Yet there are still those that search for it.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, this is a very good introduction into films directed by Miyazaki. It's a relatively simple story, yet it keeps you hooked from the very first scene. It's very kid-friendly, but has deeper themes and even a few dark scenes. The characters are both memorable and identifiable. Pretty much all of them are the kind of people you would like to know and have along on an adventure - with the exception of one or two, but we'll get to them in a moment. And it has flying machines, industrial revolution -inspired populations, gorgeous animation, hauntingly beautiful music, great action scenes, all that good stuff.<br/><br/>Yet I would still rank this amongst my least favourite Miyazaki films. (And yeah, I'm still giving this a nine out of ten. The man's that good.) The reason for that is the fact I think the villain's a bit weak. The character design isn't all that interesting, he comes off more pathetic than menacing and he's quite honestly a bit creepy in a way that doesn't match the tone the film is going for. Bad vibes, is all I'm saying. Still, his voice actor does a good job and he has a few good scenes, so I can deal with him. The side villains are a bit on the same boat, but they have less screen time, so they end up on the positive side.<br/><br/>But as my rating should indicate, I think this is a very good film. Fun, engaging, beautiful - the perfect kid's film that adults can enjoy as well. Studio Ghibli couldn't have started its career with a better film."
"johnnyboyz","8","1","1","10 July 2013"," This Japanese animated tale of adventure, danger and magic actually happens to be a bit better than average; a rousing and exciting film.
","Are there many films that are as flat out exciting, enjoyable, well designed and well-structured as Laputa: Castle in the Sky? In essence, the piece is a B-movie but it's one of those B-movies which happens to throw a dart in generally the right direction only to end up nailing the shot with aplomb. When these sorts of ideas and approaches come off, there is little which doesn't work and Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 animation is one of these: an absolute joy of comedy; fantasy and adventure toying with switching allegiances and imagination in design. I'm a firm believer that animation often works best when it's working with things insurmountable to being ordinarily filmed; a medium which, when applied to cinema, brings to life worlds and people and objects otherwise impossible to create without the need for computer generated imagery to intersperse with the live action. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is one of those films, a project which allows for its creators to just go nuts, although within reason - to do so knowing that they will not be hampered by the potential for effects to overrun creativity and immersion into a fictitious world. <br/><br/>There are, of course, instances whereby animated films have tackled ""adult"" issues (ranging from true to life warfare to the toppling of self-possessed alcoholism and grief) in the form of ""Waltz with Bashir""; Franco-Iranian effort ""Persepolis"" through to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and have done so rather well, but they were always preoccupied with bringing a visual flourish to worlds that already existed and the period detail (1980's Vienna, Lebanon and 1940's Los Angeles) additionally helped in elevating them above self-indulgent, vacant of substance, spectacle driven pieces. But these are few and far between, and it's not like the Japanese are immune to droll, often unwatchable, animations which blind you with faux-nostalgia and that terrible quasi-sense of magic and merriment abound in pieces such as ""Only Yesterday"" and ""My Neighbour Totoro"", where not an awful lot is happening bar the repetition of steps which had already been taken more rigidly and more enjoyably. <br/><br/>Laputa: Castle in the Sky is about a chase and an adventure involving a young, 'farm'-like locale dwelling boy who's propelled into the stratospheres of action, romance and danger. It is, of course, pure escapism but it is charming and it remembers to get the little things right. Opening in an airship flying high in the air above what is later revealed to be the ground below of an alternate Japan on an alternate planet Earth set some time ago, insect-like looking sky bandits invade the affluent surroundings of the vessel in pursuit for a necklace that a young girl surrounded in suited bodyguards is in close contact to. She is Sheeta, a depressed young girl who doesn't feel like eating but is, for some, reason in the company of this small army of men of whom each possess firearms. Amidst the chaos, Sheeta knocks out one of the men guarding her and it's revealed she was, in fact, so fond of their protection that she drops out of the window to fall to what appears to be certain death. Nay, for the item attacked to her necklace has steadied her fall and allowed her to land softly on the grounds below.<br/><br/>What she falls into is a rural stretch of land where the young Pazu works, a minor who does the hours and lives simply only to have this Sheeta and her amazing possession come upon his world. Cocksure and boisterous, he is not deterred from maintaining his whipper-snapper attitude in spite of a peer chastising him for something. With Sheeta, Pazu, who's a sort of epitome of the working class man in boy form, embark on this adventure with the elements from before chasing them as they strive to uncover the secrets of the necklace whose purpose is to lead them to the eponymous kingdom in the sky: Laputa. The film's setting, stuck somewhere between the industrial age and a futuristic Utopia wherein rocket propelled jet skis are designed within an inch of their lives, but when a motorcar shows up can only induce reactions of ""You don't see those very often(!)"", allows perfectly for a rounded; neo-fantastical locale wherein grounded and recognisable characters and attitudes may exist hand in hand with escapist content.<br/><br/>One looks past the film's tendency to depict its lead as an all-conquering, all saving epitome of leftist industrial liberalism – a character whose decision to aid an outsider arriving unexpectedly in a locale alien to them (although familiar and functioning to the lead) very much leads them to a higher and more spiritual plateau of adventure and discovery. Moreover, and where the idea that factory floor/steel mill/coal mine (delete as appropriate) dwelling leftists can vanquish enemies and embrace this new found intruder is inherent, one should look past apparent 'pro' annotations to what waves of Left-induced immigration spins on those already occupying the land, and instead focus on the fact Laputa: Caslte in the Sky is more of a cracking, gratifying action film with a lot of amusing second unit material that works a whole lot more than it should."
"ajs-10","9","1","1","24 December 2011"," One of my favourite Studio Ghibli films!...
","Another in my mini-series of Studio Ghibli films and one I have loved for many years, since I first saw it in fact. I think it is because there is an element of science fiction in this one that doesn't seem to feature a lot in many of the other films I've seen from this studio. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too long, but then again it's always interesting and the story does move along at a reasonable pace, so it's not all bad. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>A girl, Sheeta, has been taken from her home and is being transported by the army and some mysterious men in dark glasses. When their airship is attacked by pirates she retrieves a mysterious stone from one of the men and jumps from the craft. As she approaches land a light comes from the stone and her fall is slowed. She is seen by a boy, Pazu, who catches her and takes her home with him. Pazu's father had snapped a photo of a mysterious castle in the sky, Laputa, and the following day Sheeta tells him her story and how she has a link to this place. The pirates have tracked her, they are looking for her in the village and a chase ensues. Eventually she is captured, not by the pirates, but by the army! A giant robot, help from the pirates, all kinds of flying machines later and Pazu has her free, but can they find Laputa before the army can, and will it be what they expect when they get there? Well, I guess I can't tell you that here or the Spoiler Police will be sending me aloft in an airship (& no parachute) again.<br/><br/>I watched this film in the original Japanese (with subtitles) although I believe there is a dubbed version available for those that fear the written word on the screen. It's beautifully animated and stands up well 25 years later. The performances are all good and so honourable mentions must go to the voice talents of; Mayumi Tanaka as Pazu and Keiko Yokozawa as Sheeta. They both gave their characters a lot of life and urgency that was well reflected in the visuals.<br/><br/>I love the plot of this film; it starts quite big and just gets bigger! You think you have an idea where it's going, but then it takes a turn and what they come up with is even better than anything I could have thought of! I must admit I would maybe have changed a couple of things, but over all it's quite an excellent piece of work. It's all excellently done, if a little long, and I think the filmmakers stuck to what they do best; telling a good story. You may be able to guess by now, but this one comes pretty highly RECOMMENDED from me.<br/><br/>My score: 8.6/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.1/10 (based on 30,528 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 17 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 72,627 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

","Castle in the sky is undeniably one of the best animated films of all time. The director once again created a story and world of epic proportions just like he did in Nausicaa.<br/><br/>Pros: The story is an epic tale nothing short of masterful. The character adaption is very good, each character has a distinct personality that make it even more enjoyable. The director has designed a fantasy world that best suits the movie.<br/><br/>Cons: The movie was made in 1986 so the special effects are a bit dated.

"neil-476","9","1","1","20 June 2010"," Splendid but weird
","Disney leaped to animation superiority in 1939 and then stayed there for decades. Warner Bros made a spirited showing but they, and everyone else, were demonstrably lower down the scale. But in the later years of the 20th century Studio Ghibli made a definite play to be an alternate line of animation features - not a competitor, for the Japanese movies were - and continue to be - resolutely un-Disneylike in every possible way.<br/><br/>Castle In The Sky from 1986, one of the early Studio Ghibli films, is a case in point. It tells the story of two waifs who are looking for the legendary floating city of Laputa while being pursued by two opposing groups.<br/><br/>I can't praise this film highly enough. It is always exciting, and visually stunning with an astonishing level of visual imagination. This is impossible to describe, but the two things it called to mind are the general feel of Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud's unfamiliar worlds (there is a sequence with a railway chase where the railway tracks run on trestles halfway down a cavernous ravine where dwellings are cantilevered out of the canyon walls), crossed with organic/non-organic hybridisation: the nearest thing I can suggest is the impact of HR Giger's Alien and Species design, although the visual aspect is nothing like that.<br/><br/>This film is exciting, involving, and a feast for the eyes. I enjoyed it greatly."
"dobrien4587","9","1","1","7 April 2010"," Funny, light hearted, and enjoyable for the entire family
","Laputa is another fun Miyazaki film. It has great animation, a plot that kept me watching, and interesting characters, as well as a good soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film stars a little girl named Sheeta, she is in pursuit by the Military and a gang of pirates who are after her powerful crystal. After she escapes the two groups, she comes across a young boy named Patsu. The two quickly become friends, as Sheeta notices a picture of a castle called ""Laputa"". Patsu explains that he wants to prove it exists, because it will prove that his father wasn't lying about it.<br/><br/>The pirates and the Military catch up to them and the young duo escapes into some mines nearby and discover that Sheeta's crystal is made of a mineral that the people of Laputa use, this excites Patsu and the two decide to go looking for Laputa, and they decide to return the crystal there.<br/><br/>The military, along with our main Villain Mooscow, catch the two and blackmail Sheeta saying if she doesn't help them find Laputa, they may kill Patsu. She agrees and a confused, angry and sad Patsu leaves to return home as he comes across the pirates, the leader of the Pirates is convinced that Patsu sold Sheeta to the military but he claims thats not the case, he decides to team up with the pirates to save Sheeta.<br/><br/>Thats all of the story I will sum up, but I have more to say about the movie itself. The characters are likable and well rounded, and some of the characters do a good job in making me mad. The film's plot is easy to follow and has plenty of twists that make it another brilliant Miyazaki film"
"anuragr","9","1","1","7 April 2010"," If east be English
","The way I discovered Miyazaki's movies was with a bit of surprise and curiosity, something that itself is best depicted in his movies. It was ""Howl's Castle"" that caught my attention while switching channels one Sunday. You can almost always see a sublime English influence in his work- characters with an innocent curiosity exploring a world of immense power and intractable magic. It is intriguing and immersing - a world that I hadn't seen since having read ""Alice in the Wonderland"" in my childhood for the first time. Music and art-direction is crafted very carefully to give an effect rarely achieved by cinema.<br/><br/>Castle-in-the-sky is probably one of the best of his works. We revisit Swift's ""Laputa"" from the Gulliver's Travels in the movie – a place far into the unknown that has had a history of the sort of power and intelligence that is unmatched by the modern civilization. The characters of the movie Sheeta and Pazu both find themselves onto an inevitable voyage to Laputa. Their rather exploratory journey to Laputa is full of hurdles and discoveries. As they run into air-pirates, plane-crashes and magical revelations we become a part of their joy, worries, inquisitiveness and amazement.<br/><br/>If you're thinking Harry Potter, then you're absolutely mistaken. This might just be the opposite end of the spectrum. The visual effects of the movie are not meant to transcend the limits of the real world by letting you be in a fantasy world of magic and wizardry but instead in a rather unique way to meditate on our being and might in this world, in a way the Gulliver's travel did. That all of it can be achieved through animation is something only Miyazaki can be credited to.<br/><br/>One thing that Miyazaki does very well is to not let somewhat sentimental moments in the movie become too sappy or theatrical. The story might have had a tendency to become that way but script kept it entertaining with jokes and ""quirkiness"" of its characters at times. The dubbing artists did a wonderful job in making this movie appear seamlessly ""English"". It would remain rather incomprehensible to me how movies from Far East can be enjoyed without any conscious attempt to overcome cultural boundaries."

","This is the second Miyazaki film I have ever seen and it was a experience I will never forget. I am so grateful that my friend forced me to watch my first anime film (which was Spirited Away) because it got me so addicted that I had to see as many of Miyazaki's films as I possibly could. After Spirited Away I came across Castle in the sky and as I said, it will probably be one of the most memorable experiences of my life. This film captivates you in a way you could never imagine. The way Miyazaki makes his films is like he knows what fascinates everyone. The voice acting in this film is amazing and it makes you feel very connected to the characters and their emotions. Miyazaki's films taught me to do things I wouldn't normally want to do because if you don't, you could be missing out on something amazing. I was taught this because I had absolute no interest in anything anime except for Pokemon, but as I said my friend got me to finally sit down and watch some of Miyazaki's films and to this day I am in their debt as they showed me what real magic is. I recommend EVERYONE to see Castle in the sky, even if you are not a animation fan. I promise that you will be happy that you did. Not only will you witness beautiful drawings and an amazing story, but you will feel like anything in life is possible more then ever. This is only ONE of Miyazaki's MANY beautiful films, so please check them all out as you will be making your heart and soul more happy then you could possibly imagine!!<br/><br/>10 STARS OUT OF 10!!!"

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","1 October 2008"," A few rough edges but still a magical film from Miyazaki
","I should perhaps begin by saying that this film was my introduction to Miyazaki, although his reputation preceded him. Even in this early directorial effort there is a sense of a genuine artist at work.<br/><br/>""Castle in the Sky"" centers on the pursuit of a young girl whose crystal necklace holds the power to guide the way to Laputa, a mystical castle afloat in the clouds. After initially escaping her would-be captors she is befriended by a young boy. Together they join forces to escape the clutches of pirates and the military, each of whom have their own motives for locating Laputa.<br/><br/>The story is refreshingly imaginative and is thankfully devoid of Disney's usual blatant moralizing. I should note that it was the Disney release that I watched, replete with English dubbing. The voice cast didn't seem extremely well-chosen but it wasn't that bad overall. A bigger distraction was the score, which I was unsurprised to learn was greatly expanded at Disney's request. Not only does it insert music where none was needed, it seemed to me to be too prominent in the overall audio mix.<br/><br/>However, these are fairly minor quibbles which will easily be overshadowed as you become wrapped up in the story (and the wonderful visuals). It certainly made me anxious to see more from Studio Ghibli."

But it is so much more three-dimensional and original than that. There are also enchanted rocks, robots, military fortresses, and a devastating weapon that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah! Studio Ghibli again weaves the mundane with the magical and throws in the usual mix of interesting characters for the journey. The main characters are innocent youngsters but that's what makes it heartwarming. The themes of friendship, love and nature are beautifully illustrated here too.<br/><br/>I don't know how much the new Disney version has altered the dialogue, but certainly at times it did seem inappropriately saccharine or blunt. Also I should say I really liked the main theme (used in the end music too)."

The voice talent behind this film also blew me away, everyone from Oscar Winner Anna Paquin, Dawson's Creek Star Josh Van Der Beek, Mark Hamil, and Andy Dick lent their voices to this stunning production. In addition to it being an overall amazing film, it is devoid of cursing and any heavy violence, but the action is still fresh, making this a movie for the entire family.

"motta80-2","10","1","1","1 May 2003"," Miyazaki at his best, a breathtaking adventure of a film
","My conversion to the Miyazaki mind set is now complete. I suspect<br/><br/>this visionary genius, whose talents had rarely been given major<br/><br/>access to the average westerner until his glorious Oscar winning<br/><br/>Spirited Away, is capable of doing no wrong.<br/><br/>Castle In The Sky is a beautifully crafted joyride that reminds you<br/><br/>want its like to be young. The animation is undeniable superb and<br/><br/>the voice cast (of the English dubbed version) well selected.<br/><br/>However it is the sheer sense of wonder that gets you. Like<br/><br/>Spirited Away Miyazaki's scale of imagination is extraordinary. A<br/><br/>rare talent in adults.<br/><br/>For most people as you grow older the mundanities of life run you<br/><br/>down and help to destroy your imagination bit by bit. Some artists<br/><br/>are capable of taping into that childlike imagination and<br/><br/>recapturing some of the wonder and spectacle. I would argue that<br/><br/>in the film world Steven Spielberg, John Lasseter and (representing the slightly more mischievous child) Joe Dante are<br/><br/>among the best at this. Films such as E.T., Toy Story and<br/><br/>Innerspace, Indiana Jones, Monsters, Inc. and Gremlins provide a<br/><br/>landscape of adventure and fun, unbridled childish excitement.<br/><br/>
Anyone who's ever enjoyed The Goonies as a child knows what<br/><br/>I'm talking about and still gets nostalgic at a cry of ""hey, you guys""!<br/><br/>It's not the same if you experience it as an adult usually. That is<br/><br/>part of the problem with the new Star Wars films. So many people<br/><br/>who watched the original trilogy through the wide eyes of<br/><br/>childhood cannot see the same qualities in the new films unless<br/><br/>they access their imagination and childlike sense of awe, forget<br/><br/>what they know about criticism and technical specifications (like<br/><br/>effects etc) that they were blissfully unaware of in childhood and<br/><br/>look at these films as if they were a kid again. <br/><br/>The wonder of Miyazaki is that he seems not to be accessing<br/><br/>childlike qualities, but genuinely seems to still possess the<br/><br/>imagination of a pre-teen. Even more incredible is the way he can<br/><br/>channel this to his audience through his stories and imagery.<br/><br/>Castle In The Sky, like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and his<br/><br/>other films, contains characters and situations few could conceive<br/><br/>of. I do not want to give anything away of the story as it should be<br/><br/>experienced first hand to truly capture the overwhelming scale and<br/><br/>inventiveness.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is a genius. Castle In The Sky in superior to Princess<br/><br/>Mononoke but falls just short of his masterpiece Spirited Away.<br/><br/>Believe John Lasseter see them all. See My Neighbor Totoro,<br/><br/>Kiki's Delivery Service etc. Experience them all. Awaken the child<br/><br/>within you and count the days until Howl's Moving Castle (released<br/><br/>in 2004) with the desperate impatience of a small child. Enjoy."

This film is full of little details which make the film very achieved. But the best part of it is the love story between the two children. They didn't declare their flame, and it is why this story is beautiful : they feel an innocent love for each other. Moreover,the pictures are magnificent and the music composed by Joe Hisaishi is also wonderful.

","(Review of DVD in Japanese with English Subtitles)<br/><br/>This is probably the most over-the-top Ghibli film in terms of heavy handed symbolism and hard-to-believe (but thrilling) action sequences.<br/><br/>Still, it is an easy 10, since like all of Ghibli's films, if you listen and watch carefully, it stamps an imprint of beauty on your soul which haunts you for days after.<br/><br/>In this case the gorgeous and dizzying architecture of the sky, the clouds, and humans teetering on the brink of the abyss is unforgettable.  There also is an enchanting faux-European world of pirates, dirigables, explorers, and miners set against the backdrop of the ancient Atlantis-like Laputa. Except Laputa is in the sky, not the ocean.<br/><br/>Like most of Ghibli films its hard to imagine anyone who would not like it except the terminally unimaginative.  Ghibli's art is for the ages, not just our narrow little frame of time.  So if you miss Laputa in this lifetime, don't worry, you can catch it in the next."

","It's a testament to the problems of translating and dubbing foreign films that this Myazaki classic isn't far more recognised than it is. Check the ratings: over 50% of those who voted for this gave it a 10 (mean score 8.5), but it's adjusted score is much lower. This can only be accounted for by the mode of it's release in America - the film was dubbed and scenes were cut to make it more appealing to a young audience, inevitably losing something given the perfect voice acting, characterisation and pacing of the original. I can't think of an animated film I would place over this, and that includes the entire Disney back catalogue. The music alone is worth the music of any 4 Disney films you care to name (No musical numbers! No Elton John!).<br/><br/>

Not a film for people that seek a hidden message behind every movie, but rather one you can rent to watch with your girl/man or family on a night in.<br/><br/>Not recommended for children under 7, since they will not appreciate the plot nor should they pick up a rock and jump off the roof trying to float."

What captured my attention was the beautiful music that certainly depicts the quest, action, and heart-felt moments in this adventure from the haunting music of the robot's attack, to the great symphonic and orchestrated melody of the search for Laputa.<br/><br/>The animation may seem a bit subpar in the eyes of recent anime-lovers, but it's still marvelous to watch compared to many other animated series/movies of the 80's.

","I remember the first time I ever saw this movie in it's uncut original VCR release by chance and didn't realise that I had by sheer luck stumbled upon a piece of manga movie masterpiece. The first thing that came into my mind after viewing this movie as a 12 year old child was it's absolutely stunning animation and breath-taking action. The creators and animators were able to place the viewers literally on screen with the main characters by the use of dynamic camera angles which best captured the action as well as very fine detailed animations, which were best illustrated in the chase scene on the railroads where Pazu and Sheeta who narrowly escapes their captors. But as I grew older so did my impressions of this movie change. What makes Laputa so good were not only for it's action and animations but it's strongest point lies in it's storyline and script which were able to elicit emotions in it's viewers, and the soundtrack compliments this movie superbly. I was about to compare this movie with others in its genre but after careful consideration I don't think there's ever been another manga/cartoon movie that comes close to it. After reading this review I bet you'll all think that I'm pretty bias, but then again isn't everybody who has seen this movie? Just a note for those of you who has only seen the VCD version or later release of Laputa....many key scene have been cut out of this later release and I highly recommend trying to get an uncut copy of this movie for you to fully appreciate what the creators intended it to be."

"Terol","6","3","6","3 May 2015"," The less magical Ghibli feature
","Watching this movie as a part of my project to see all the IMDb top 250 movies. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is another widely loved fantasy themed animation feature by the visionary anime creator Hayao Miyazaki. However, compared to the other films of Miyazaki that I have seen (and which are on the IMDb top 250 list) this feels most like a genuine children tale. It's not as subtle and magical as the more successful Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The characters can be easily classified as ""good"" or ""evil"" and the film is stuffed with straightforward action. However, this is not necessary a bad thing - at least for a genuine children movie. Animation and drawing are - as can be expected - as good as usual. Interestingly all Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli animations (that I have seen so far) have several common features: a young girl as the main protagonist, elder female character with authority, castles and air-crafts. Furthermore, some of the animated characters (for example small fox- like animals in the Laputa island) appear again in later or earlier Ghibli features. To summarize, Laputa: Castle in the Sky has its moments but feels generally more like your standard Saturday morning cartoon feature (on the Pokemon- Digimon-axis) than the other Miyazaki movies."

Due to this the movie didn't get that interesting until the last hour.

Was this an influence on Disney's ""Tailspin""? The voice actors are all quite good, though it is curious that somehow Andy Dick was hired.<br/><br/>Composer Joe Hisaishi was commissioned to rework and extend his original synthesizer-composed 39-minute soundtrack into a 90-minute piece for symphony orchestra in an effort to make the film more accessible to US audiences who are accustomed to a more substantial musical accompaniment. Newer sound effects were included as well, presumably to bring the film up to theatrical standards. Mayhaps the original would not be rated quite so high were it not for this improved score?"

","Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw ""Spirited Away."" I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is ""Castle in the Sky."" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away"" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).<br/><br/>A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.<br/><br/>Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.<br/><br/>Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."" I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good."

This is not your typical Miyazaki; it's your typical adventure/sci-fi anime film...almost! And this kind of films is not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/>The story is by no means special. I felt that I've seen it a hundred thousand times before. The same goes even with the ending that's only unsatisfying because how familiar it is. But one of the things that elevates the story is its nuances and details. This film has story that's extremely rich in details that managed to make me engaged with the story after about 40 minutes of disappointment. Needless to say, there are some deeply meditative lessons and precious messages at the heart of the story.<br/><br/>The animation is simply astounding! Actually, I think its even more vibrant and vigorous than in some other later Miyazaki films. Not to mention the creative designs of all the robots and machines that you can only expect to see in this genius's works.<br/><br/>I felt that this isn't for me, because it's quite obvious that I didn't enjoy it as much as most people did. I found this a run-of-the-mill adventure story. Still, I had a fun time with Castle in the Sky.

While not my favorite Miyazaki film, it's probably in my top 3.<br/><br/>Of all the Japanese voice actors, Mayumi Tanaka, (The voice of Monkey D. Luffy from ""One Piece""), does great as the main boy, Pazu. In the English dub, I really enjoy Mark Hamill's role as Muska. He's always been great at doing villainous voices.<br/><br/>I'm also continuously impressed by the animation in Miyazaki's early works. Disney, eat your heart out.

","I rarely watch Japanese animes because they are mostly lack of good stories, awesome animations, etc. Most of Japanese animes I saw were kind of dramas, the animations are very bad and characters are so ugly. Moreover, the stories are not that strong to be my taste. So, I always avoid Japanese animes.<br/><br/>I just said that I don't watch Japanese animes, it doesn't mean I don't see one. Some local TV channels in my country air Japanese animes and so, I sometimes see them and didn't like them because the stories are very bad.<br/><br/>Laputa: The Castle in the Sky is the first Japanese anime I watched and also it's the only one I loved. When I saw this anime on a website, the reason why I decided was two main characters were kind of cute and lovely. So, I watched it and I loved it.<br/><br/>The story is not so simple and not so complicated. But because of the director, it turned out to be a good one. What I love about this anime is how Sheeta and the leader of those pirates became friends.<br/><br/>I don't like the castle though. The castle is kind of ruined. Maybe it's because it is ruined in the story. So, the anime creators did like that. But it still works.<br/><br/>The anime was produced in 1986 (way before I was born) but the quality is unbelievably good. I haven't a clue before I saw it's production year. When I saw it, I can't believe it because the anime is too good.<br/><br/>What I love most is the end credit song. That song is so cool.<br/><br/>All in all, for some people, the anime might be kind of inferior to those ones produced in 20th centuries but as for me, it's the best Japanese anime I've ever seen. It's totally worth spending time."

","Air pirates, army and government agents wants to abduct Sheeta, a girl with mysterious necklace with crystal pendant. She meets boy by the name of Pazu who plans to construct a plane and set off in search for the flying city of Laputa. During the movie we learn that in the past mankind mastered the technology which enabled construction of flying cities, but after an unnamed disaster survivors continued to live on the ground. The story of this anime is very easygoing and tender, but at the same time it opens up very serious issues concerning the relationship of man and civilization towards nature, while rethinking the essence of modern development and what is usually accepted as progress.<br/><br/>It's easy to notice similarity between the shape of the central tree that dominates Laputa, a symbol of prosperity, harmony and security, and the atomic mushroom created by the main weapon of this flying city. On the example of Laputa we can expose fundamental contradictions of imperialism / world system: Laputa is a paradise for those who live in it (in the centre of the world system), while at the same time it's bringing destruction to those who live on the ground (on the periphery of the world system). Equally important contradiction can be also seen in relation of the civilization towards the planet: while we are hypocritically promoting recycling and separating the glass, plastic and paper, at the same time corporations annually cut down between three and six billion trees, without any serious social resistance or critique.<br/><br/>Laputa shows that harmful effects of technology are consequences of the choice of those who control the technology to use it in this way, or to simply ignore warnings and its harmful aspects. They appropriate benefits of technology for themselves, while transferring (externalizing) harm and problems to the rest of society. Miyazaki, the master of animation who grew up in postwar Japan, is careful not to opt for one of the sides in the false dilemma ""technology or nature"" and uses the metaphor of Laputa to construct a positive reference point against which we can critically observe our society.<br/><br/>The name Laputa comes from Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, where exists a flying island of the same name whose residents use their technology for political domination. Political will for domination through technological superiority marked not only the twentieth century, but also of the previous millennia of civilization development. Laputa sends us the message that a sustainable civilization must renounce war as a way of life, and especially imperialism as inherently destructive social form. Laputa creates a longing in us to realise a balance between nature and technology - a society that will achieve symbiotic unity of the ecosphere and the technosphere."

"ccamp89","9","0","0","8 April 2018"," Introducing: Studio Ghibli
","The film that officially introduced the world to what would become the greatest animation studio of all time, and it lives up to that honor. All these years later in what now seems to be the twilight era of Studio Ghibli, classic after classic under their belts, Castle in the Sky still manages to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its best. Hayao Miyazaki's intention with this film was to show off what the studio was capable of, as well as to act as its mission statement - to create animated features of the utmost quality filled with magic, heart, adventure, depth, and purity of artistic intent. It succeeds with flying colors.<br/><br/>It's a notable film in Miyazaki's filmography not only for being his first under the Ghibli banner, but also in that it is perhaps his most traditional work during his time with the studio. It employs many classical storytelling techniques that he would later largely abandon as his voice as an auteur deepened: a solid three-act structure, the MacGuffin plot device, as well as a purely villainous antagonist. This was likely a conscious decision with the intent of laying a sturdy, accessible foundation upon which to build the studio's name, and it's by no means a criticism of the film. Quite the contrary, these tried-and-true techniques are employed in absolutely masterful fashion to create what is a clear contender for the studio's strongest and most narratively satisfying action/adventure film. It also lays the groundwork for what would become many of Ghibli's core themes: coming of age, friendship, awe of the natural world, and rich, morally layered characters who are often not all they may seem at first glance.<br/><br/>Though it may not have quite the same level of experimentation, uniqueness, and artistic virtuosity as some of Miyazaki's later works, it remains one of his seminal films, as well as one of his most tightly-scripted, well-paced, and purely fun. A classic in its own right.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

"clynch1209","9","0","0","2 January 2015"," Tenku No Shiro Rapyuta Laputa Castle in the Sky
","Castle in the Sky was a whole new step for eminent Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki after the successful runs of his erstwhile pictures - The Castle of Cagilostro (1978) to Nausicca Valley of the Wind (1984). Not only was it the first film to be released by Studio Ghibli, Japan's own Disney studio, but it demonstrated how Miyazaki could recapture our childhood as the film swoops and soars through wide open clouds and into a world supposedly made up of dreams.<br/><br/>Prior to the release of Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki was baffled to see children wanting to see Nausicca, an influential animated film intended more for adults and teenagers. If children were to see his films, Miyazaki wanted them to be enthralled by the kind of magic brought up by Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, or Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The titular Laputa is, in fact, a fictional setting originally conceived by Johnathan Swift while writing Gulliver's Travels. A mysterious, floating island, Laputa was home to a once mighty civilization where the advanced technology and untold treasures eventually made the society hubristic. As far as legends go, Laputa and all of its people completely vanished, leaving even the smallest children to grow up believing such a place actually existed. Most recently, however, sinister government agents, as well as cunning air pirates, have learned the link to the lost castle in the sky: a mystical amulet owned by orphaned girl named Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin in the 1998 English-translated adaptation). Captured by the duplicitous Colonel Muska (voiced by Mark Hamill), Sheeta finds a way to break free after Captain Dola, a Ma Barker-like matriarch voiced by Cloris Leachman, and her family of boisterous pirates make way onto the palatial airship to seize the girl themselves. While trying to escape her captors, Sheeta seemingly plummets to her death, only to have her amulet miraculously float her body gently down to earth, where she enters the life of Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek), a loyal miner boy about her age and a fellow orphan as well. Together, Sheeta and Pazu must soon find a way to evade the government and the air pirates before the location of Laputa can be given to them.<br/><br/>Because the term ""Laputa"" was easily misconceived as a reference to the Spanish pejorative ""La Puta,"" the titular Laputa was quietly removed on its release in the United States and other foreign nations. Other changes made to the American renditions have, on the other hand, become irrevocable. Although the primary concern regarding how 16-year old Anna Paquin (future star of True Blood) and 21-year old James Van Der Beek were too old to voice the youngsters who have barely hit puberty, the heroes of Sheeta and Pazu never cross into bratty or cloying territory as they experience a few life lessons during their grand adventure. Pazu is a simple boy growing into a man as he braves the dangers to rescue Sheeta, a Snow White-like girl whose charm and spiritedness wins the hearts of that of the hardened Capt. Dola and her crew. Pazu and Sheeta together represent the film's exhilaration as they go through a series of perils, battles, chases, and enchantment to uncover a mystery before their enemies do. Probably the sole thing wrong with these likable child heroes are how they, along with every other animated person created in Japan, share the common failure of differentiating the characters. Since U.S. rival corporations (Disney, Pixar, or DreamWorks) have yet to best the Japanese anime in terms of writing and visuals, they at least earn the praise for making each character's facial structures distinguishable since anime characters are so often uncannily Even if contemporary audiences criticize how Castle in the Sky isn't on par with some of Miyazaki's best work, this is still sophisticated filmmaking at best. Miyazaki was actually predating Pixar for years because his brilliant storytelling gels with characters you actually care for, a script devoid of any of the common flaws and clichés found in the modern films, and animation so rich that you can gaze upon without the use of 3D glasses. In truth, though, Miyazaki's films were the best thing to come in terms of animation after the quality of Disney feature began to falter during the early 60's. The appreciation and admiration Miyazaki had for ancient legends was used to such a strong advantage that his growing empire of influence was making Miyazaki a legend in his own right."
"NeonGoth","10","0","0","6 August 2014"," Plenty of Fun and Adventure for the Inner Child
","Castle in the Sky is a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. What a fun thrill ride this was. Floating castles. Sky pirates. Gorgeous visuals. Jaw-dropping action. Fun humor. Add all these together and it makes one of my favorite animated films ever.<br/><br/>Where should even I start with this masterpiece? Well, first the story. It's just a basic coming-of-age, adventure story. Two kids, Pazu and Sheeta, find a mysterious object, so together they try to discover the secret behind this object as well as learn more about each other. Throw in some bad guys here and there, and you got yourself an adventure film fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>But of course, that isn't enough from the great Miyazaki. I'm sure any other filmmaker would have done a fine job with this premise. Miyazaki, however, gives his audience an engaging story with such a grand and epic fantasy experience. He puts so much effort into this film, I felt as if I was coming along for the ride. I would have loved to have seen this film on the big screen. Watching the cinematic opening scene and hearing the beautiful theme song. When I first watched it, I felt I was gonna like it. I didn't expect to love it so much!<br/><br/>I saw the English dubbed version, which I always prefer for anime. Though, I think the dub could have been a little better. The main problem were the two main characters. It's fine as it is, but I think Pazu sounded older than he looked. Also Sheeta has what I believe was a British accent throughout the film, but her accent would sometimes sound like it was fading in and out. With all that said, if anyone reading this prefer subtitles with the original audio, that's fine too. It's understandable.<br/><br/>Another thing I should point out is not really a complaint, just an observation. The pacing does slow down towards the end. It's not a problem, but it also wouldn't be a problem if about 5 minutes were shaved off. But, it still helps set the mood and atmosphere. Those who haven't seen the movie should keep in mind that it isn't all fast-paced action.<br/><br/>Overall, I really love this movie. A film like this can only be topped by Miyazaki's own ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (but that's for another review). I highly recommend it for the whole family. And if you get the chance, check out the incredible soundtrack. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite films ever."

","The art direction is this movie is superb, it really brings the Castle in the Sky straight out of Gulliver's Travels and onto the movie screen. The bittersweet robots that inhabit and protect the garden may even end up being some of your favorite anime characters, not because they are amusing, but because of the care and dedication that they exude whenever you see them. Laputa revolves around a boy named Pazu and the girl that floats unceremoniously down from the sky into his life, Sheeta, and how they save Laputa and the world from corruption. An all-around solid anime movie with classic Ghibli humor and spirit, definitely recommended."
"tuomas_gimli","9","0","0","11 November 2012"," Classic fantasy adventure, plain and simple
","Castle in the Sky is the first film by Studio Ghibli, released originally in 1986. It is every bit as good as one would expect from a Ghibli film: beautiful animation and art, colourful and memorable characters, great score and a good story.<br/><br/>The story concerns a boy named Pazu who on one day sees a girl called Sheeta falling from the sky. Together they set out to find the legendary flying castle of Laputa. The story is well paced and truly an adventure: by the end the small village Pazu used to live in feels like the distant past.<br/><br/>The first thing I should say is this is A GREAT FILM. It's well written, beautifully animated and overall masterfully executed. Yet Studio Ghibli has produced so many fantastic films that this one stands out as a more simplistic story. There's not the ecological message of Nausicaä, the overwhelming adorability of Totoro or the grim moral ambiguity of Mononoke. After watching it twice I still haven't detected much of an overarching theme or message overall. Also the female lead, Sheeta, is somewhat disappointing as more of a typical damsel in distress. This is a bit jarring considering Ghibli's history of producing strong female characters one after another (Chihiro, San, Nausicaä, Satsuki, the list goes on).<br/><br/>The animation is good and the visual design is very impressive. Still, some of the technical aspects are hopelessly dated: the animation can be choppy at times, and the characters are fairly devoid of detail. Though considering just how much happens in the film, the simplistic designs are somewhat forgivable, especially when we see entire armies on-screen at times.<br/><br/>But mostly this is just nitpicking. Castle in the Sky is a wonderful, imaginative piece of fantasy adventure, and shows more creativity, personality and imagination in 5 minutes than most mainstream films show in 500 minutes.<br/><br/>Recommendation: A must-see for any fan of fantasy cinema or Studio Ghibli. For everyone else, highly recommended."

"tollyjamesmaggs","10","0","0","20 June 2011"," This inspired my love and passion for films when I was 4.
","When I was a child and first watched this movie on TV, I was blown away. It didn't go for the action of Star Wars, it didn't go for the comedy of Toy Story, and it didn't go for the romance of Titanic. Instead, it went for pure beauty, and (In my opinion) this accomplished that perfectly.<br/><br/>While other people take off marks for the various versions (Both of the English-dubs), I had little problems with them, but I am going to focus on looking at the subtitled-original version with the original music: The way Miyazaki wanted it.<br/><br/>The one factor of this movie which was the factor that blew my mind as a child was the music. Such fantastic composition off sounds and emotions brought through the music in each of the scenes. There were moments where the music picked up on the idea of adventure, feelings of loss and loneliness, and then moments of hope and triumph. Truly sublime: In my opinion, perfection and the BEST soundtrack I have heard. I know it is naive to say such a thing, but this is what hit me as a child: the music was such beautiful artwork crafted solely for this movie.<br/><br/>The artwork, as Studio Ghibli's artwork always has been, was stunning. These hand-drawn images are so perfectly crafted you can actually see the amount of effort and passion the artists put into this. Together the artwork and the music tickles the imagination of both adults and children.<br/><br/>The story is based on the floating island of Laputa: a concept originally presented in the book ""Gulliver's Travels."" It successfully takes that one concept and blooms it into something entirely new. It's beautiful ideas clashing between the original text and Miyazak's own wild and beautiful imagination.<br/><br/>The characters are very well written: Miyzaki often focuses on the innocence of the youth, and this film has various themes revolving around that. Pazu and Sheeta want to find the island for selfless reasons: Pazu wants to follow in his late-father's footsteps and find the island, and Sheeta wants to discover her link to it. It is a journey of self discovery for these two characters, while the adults are greedy for money and power. There is a clear sense between who is good and bad which is ambiguous at first, but through the film as we get closer to Pazu and Sheeta, we all discover who to really trust. The characters are believable and there is a constant sense of development in both the characters and the narrative.<br/><br/>This is my most favourite film ever because of these reasons. I try to be strict when it comes to films but I find it difficult to criticise this film. There is no such thing as a ""Perfect"" film, but I think this comes pretty close."
"reginald-seeker","10","0","0","22 April 2011"," A film to watch when you're young, and watch again when you've grown up
","Like many reviewers here, I also recommend to watch it in the original Japanese. Characters are more vivid, and the music is more atmospheric. Unfortunately, Disney was too true to its policy not to allow a moment without music when nobody is talking. Miyazaki's (or a characteristic to any Japanese artwork) mastery of sound and silence, existence and voidness, were thereby systematically destroyed. It's also noticeable that music was grossly modified. Some may like this way, but I believe the original held the beauty of this film more effectively. Simply, my ears remember it as I heard in the original even though it was more than 10 years ago! <br/><br/>The dubbing was done alright. Mark Hamill ('Muska') and Cloris Leachman ('Dola') were excellent. But James van der Beek ('Pazu') was a wrong choice. Pazu is good-natured, but essentially a tough orphan boy who works in a mine. Van der Beek cannot act on such a role, and instead he made Pazu sound like a middle-class boy who would perform well at school. Pazu in the original was a boy who wouldn't look back a second, but Pazu van der Beek was a rich boy who tried to be wild and that was pathetic.<br/><br/>Is there a lesson in this film, besides entertainment? Many say it's about power and greed. Sure, those are important sidelines. But I think the most important message was the critique on our industrial civilisation. Towards the end of the film, Sheeta says ""I see now why the Laputians left the castle. You cannot live away from the earth and soil!"" I reckon this is the one-line message from Miyazaki. During the opening credit, we see the concise history of the Laputa world: a steam engine -> industrial revolution -> advances to the sky -> flying cities -> arms race -> war -> people leaving from the fallen ships -> back to the simple life on earth. Miyazaki's world view is clear - he's an environmentalist. He also has a social side. In planning this film, Miyazaki travelled to Wales. It was 1980s, when many mining towns were suffering from closure. Miyazaki felt so much compassion to those townspeople, and made those people immortal in this film. Though idealised, we meet them in Pazu's mining valley."

Film's protagonist Pazu is a young boy working in mines, and who dreams of one day finding Laputa, the legendary castle in the sky that his late father claimed to have seen, but whom nobody believed. Pazu's chance to prove his father was right comes unexpectedly when a girl literally falls from the sky to his arms. The girl is Sheeta and she carries with her the key to find Laputa.

Pazu helps Sheeta and together they try to find Laputa before others.<br/><br/>I can imagine how a nowadays Hollywood would probably use a plot like this as an excuse to create a movie with lots of special effects and very little contents. Miyazaki on the other hand over 20 years ago then gave us a film that is both entertaining action film for the whole family and that has interesting and believable characters (interestingly though, this is Miyazaki's only film that has a truly evil villain character, unlike in his later films). As ""Nausicaä"" this film's animation has not suffered much during the last decades and is still far more pleasant to watch, than most of the nowadays western animations. Miyazaki's love for flying and aircrafts shows throughout the whole film and everything is crowned with Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score music.<br/><br/>I can't comment the original English dub since I've never heard it, but I can compare the original Japanese audio to Disney's 2003 English audio. The new dub has divided opinions a lot since it has altered the original score and added much more lines to the film. The extra lines may be more helpful to the youngest of the family, but really unnecessary for others. Since Joe Hisaishi himself conducted the altered score for the new dub, there really isn't anything bad to say about this and since dub has even more music, it just might be better. Fans of the original Japanese audio though may be puzzled by the changes in the original score. Voice actors differ. Both Mayumi Tanaka and Keiko Yokozawa are believable as kids, Pazu and Sheeta, but neither James Van Der Beek nor Anna Paquin convinces in the dub, having too mature voices. Kotoe Hatsui and Cloris Leachman are both on the same level as pirate Dola, both making the character witty, funny and sarcastic. On the other hand, Mark Hamill completely surpasses Minori Terada in the role of villainous Muska, Hamill's voice being more menacing and evil (10 years of voicing Joker probably helped). So, Disney's dub has more music and Mark Hamill, but otherwise I recommend original Japanese audio. But to each their own taste.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's style is not quite there on the top still in this film, but the story telling takes you completely from the very start that you can't but love this film. It is also suitable for all ages, though has moments that mature audience appreciates more. Another classic from Ghibli."

","""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" is a 1986 feature length animation by Japanese master director Hayao Miyazaki. The film opens with an exciting battle on-board a bulbous airship, in which a band of bumbling sky-pirates attempt to apprehend Sheeta, a little girl who possesses a stone with remarkable powers. Assisting Sheeta is Pazu, a resourceful kid who lives in a ramshackled mining community.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's plot's frequently sound silly on paper. On screen, though, they're brimming with neat little details and passages. ""Laputa's"" packed with one cool sequence after the next, some interesting airship designs and several action sequences guaranteed to make live-action directors jealous (James Cameron, Brad Bird and Spielberg are self-professed Miyazaki fan-boys). And as is typical of Miyazaki, the film boasts another enchanting score by composer Joe Hisaishi, alternates between kinetic moments and poetic, Ozu-like postcard images, and is positively in love with aircrafts, flying and wide open skies. The film's eco-sermon is also less heavy-handed than some of Miyazaki's other works; here an ancient civilisation collapses when it symbolically loses all ties and connections with the natural world, a lesson which a new militaristic superpower fails to learn.<br/><br/>Miyazaki directed ""Nausicca of the Valley of the Winds"" in 1984. Like that film, ""Laputa"" takes place in a steam-punk world which mixes high and low technology. This is a contrast to most science fiction animes, which take place in dystopian, cyberpunk futures. Of course Miyazaki is as anti-militaristic and techno-wary as his contemporaries (Satoshi Kon, Isao Takahata, Katsuhiro Otomo, Mamoru Oshii etc), but he's also far less pessimistic and far more romantic. They're about steel and concrete. He's a wood and chlorophyll guy. Miyazaki's steam-punk approach also tends to result in a number of unusual machines, many of which are evocative of Albert Robida, a French artist who was popular in the late 1880s.<br/><br/>""Laputa"" is arguably the only film in Miyzaki's oeuvre with a conventional villain. His other films tend to have no clear distinctions between the ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"". At its best, the film conveys an incredible sense of place, with leafy cloud cities, subterranean mining towns (Laputa's mirror image), and turbulent skies which buffet flimsy airships. Unfortunately, after a strong first three acts, the film degenerates into clichés, with conventional light shows, damsels in distress and a obligatory ""temple collapse"" sequence (ancient temples always collapse RIGHT AFTER they've been rediscovered). Still, it's one of Miyazaki's coolest adventures.<br/><br/>8.9/10 – The similarly themed, though cyberpunk, ""Akira"" would be released 2 years later. See ""Nausicca of the Valley of the Winds"" and ""Only Yesterday""."

","In this film, Castle in the Sky, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).<br/><br/>Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.<br/><br/>However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation."

This brilliant animated fantasy adventure from writer-producer-director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most original creations ever as it made big bucks at the Japanese box-office and excellent reviews. In 1989 it came here to the states in a decent dub called ""Laputa: Castle in The Sky"" and then in 1998 they made a redub version that was suppose to come out in 2000 but was delayed until 2003.

"revere-7","7","1","2","21 August 2009"," Entertaining fantasy film
","I had avoided watching 'Castle in the Sky' for many years. I was aware of Miyazaki's exemplary track record, and have enjoyed several of his films to date. However, I was aware that many of his earlier films were geared toward younger audiences. That, combined with the marketing materials (even before Disney got their hands on it) showed nothing of some of the more exciting elements of the story. All I knew was about young boy who met a young girl who 'fell from the sky', and that the film involved some kind of 'Castle in the Sky'. Sounds like a whole lot of ho-hum ""let's put on a kiddie show"" type stuff.<br/><br/>Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The story deftly blends magic and technology in an early industrial culture. Yes, the orphan boy, Pazu does meet the orphan girl Sheeta when she fell from the sky - but the reason she fell was no mystical fairy tale reason - she was hanging off the side of an airship, being pursued by pirates, secret agents and the military! Thus begins a rousing chase, and a search for the ultimate weapon - Laputa, an island (not just a castle) floating in the sky.<br/><br/>There's action and adventure aplenty. And the film should be of particular interest to the steampunk crowd as it's an early anime influence on the genre. There are a few things you have to overlook, such as attempts at humor both scripted, and ad libbed by the English cast, which fall flat, an annoyingly repetitive musical score, and the inevitable moralizing that gets pretty thick at the end of most anime features. But it's worth putting up with that stuff for the fun ride. Be sure to skip the John Lassiter intro which adds nothing to the proceedings."

","This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time. However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. My main point being, Disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original English version being very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love. I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life!"

Of course, people start looking for it, for various reasons, resulting in a massive conflict of interest. In the end, being human, young and alive is far more important than being powerful and technologically advanced, therefore the child queen of Laputa utters the word of destruction and everything blows away. Everybody good lives, everybody bad dies.<br/><br/>In the end the animation is great, but I expected that, so is the music and the basic storyline, however the moral got lost somehow between the obviously Japanese fear of technological disaster and characters of unreasonable courage and moral strength. I never expected Miyazaki to be realistic, but at least I wanted the movie to be unpredictable. It is full of clichés.<br/><br/>Maybe the overall resemblance to Atlantis: The Lost Empire also made me fear a Disney contamination of Japanese anime, but in the end, both movies have the same audience, so why not be more like each other?"

"janecamacho","7","1","3","29 July 2009"," Castle in the sky has Miyazaki's signature all over it!
","Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what Miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! <br/><br/>Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. And of course, flying machines (lots of it!!). Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was narratively speaking, a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best. <br/><br/>The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward! <br/><br/>A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delightfully yet devilish villain! <br/><br/>Don't miss this one people!"

","Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled ""Laputa: Castle in the sky"". I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality.<br/><br/>Just looked up ""Laputa"" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel ""Gulliver's travels"", which was published in the early to mid 1700s.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice-cast. It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me.<br/><br/>The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them find it.<br/><br/>The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"whatdoes1know","8","1","3","7 December 2001"," I liked this when entertainment value was all that mattered.
","I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa--the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. Overall, I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny."
"The_Void","7","2","10","7 February 2005"," Overrated anime fare
","Hayao Miyazaki has been getting a lot of praise recently as a result of the American release of his excellent 'Mononoke-Hime' and his somewhat less than excellent 'Spirited Away'. Castle in the Sky fits in between the two in terms of quality, but adds to the feeling that I got when the credits of 'Spirited Away' rolled that Hayao Miyazaki doesn't deserve such high praise as he's getting. Don't get me wrong, this certainly isn't a bad film (neither is Spirited Away), but it's hardly the work of a great master either. The substance on offer isn't much more than what you'd find in a Saturday morning cartoon, and the film takes itself way too seriously for an animated feature. Too much of the film is spent on characters delivering reams of heartfelt dialogue and it comes across as contrived and more than a little bit silly. However, this is matched by Miyazaki's inventiveness and attention to detail, which keeps the film away from the low end of the rating scale.<br/><br/>With this film, Miyazaki has created his own world for his character's to inhabit, and that is always going to garner praise for the auteur. The story follows a young girl that has a crystal that has the power to show the owner the way to a mythical and powerful city in the sky. After escaping from various evildoers that want the crystal for their own reasons, she finds herself on the run with a young boy that also wants to find the lost city. This creativity is both a help and a hindrance to the story. On the one hand it allows Miyazaki creative freedom over what goes on, and he makes best use of that on many occasions. However, on the other hand, because the world isn't a complete whole - it leaves many questions unanswered, and after an hour or so of being bombarded with goings on that don't make much sense; the film gets more than a little bit tiresome. The film follows the classic adventure structure, which is nice as it makes for an entertaining ride. Castle in the Sky also has a nice musical score, which fits the tone of the film excellently.<br/><br/>This film certainly isn't bad, but it's not great either and I suspect that more than a little of it's praise has come of a result of the popularity of Miyazaki's later works and the fact that Japanese things are very much in fashion of late. However, if anime is your bag, you'll find lots to like here."

","Miyazaki's films often have similar themes and similarly drawn characters. If I have to reframe from mentioning his other works and look solely at this film I suppose I would give it a 7 out of 10 and say it was good. However having seen Future Boy Conan before this as well as Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind and Howl's Moving Castle I would have to say this this movie in comparison to the aforementioned is skipable as it pales in comparison to those movies in story-telling, overall scenes, and English dubbing. I find that this movie shares similarities with the other movies in that: In Future Boy Conan the aircraft resemble moths/bugs. In this movie the aircraft resemble dragonflies/bugs. In ever movie mentioned here there is a theme of high technology controlled by the government/past that can destroy the world and a young boy and girl try and prevent this technology from destroying the world...There are similar looking characters.....Overall Future Boy Conan has more lovable characters and more humor. There are scenes in that series that are laugh out loud funny and heart warming as well! It's well worth the watch. And Nausica of The Valley is a great summary of Future Boy Conan.. It closely follows the theme of that series and reinterprets it in a new way and puts it in a feature length film VS a series of episodes and it does a great job of expressing high destructive technology vs peace loving nature....Does that make sense? Basically I have seen those movies and love them more than this. I was looking forward to this movie being great but i felt it was just a waste of time. It also bothered me how the boy in this movie never got to fly his aircraft that he built (then why even show it???) and how he didn't seem to posses any special skill 3/4ths of the movie yet somehow could climb like spider-man near the end and do things no human could ever do. He somehow had hands and feet that could cling unrealistically to a metal tube that went upwards- and free-climbed across roots like a monkey and it was just so unrealistic it bothered me....At least in Future Boy Conan the boy was shown from the very beginning as having unusual strength and skill. But this boy in this movie was ordinary until the end when he made a 360...."

"jboothmillard","5","0","2","19 June 2016"," Laputa: Castle in the Sky
","This is one the many films from Japanese cartoon creators Studio Ghibli I had not seen, but remembered the title of and really wanted to see, I'm glad when I got the opportunity, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically young girl Sheeta (Anna Paquin) has been abducted by secret government agent Muska (Mark Hamill), the airship she is on is attacked by Captain Dola (Cloris Leachman) and her air pirate sons, they are in search of Sheeta's crystal amulet, given to her by her father. Sheeta falls from the airship, but the amulet starts glowing and her descent is slowed by its power, she lands in a small mining town and is discovered by boy Pazu (Dawson's Creek's James Van Der Beek). Sheeta is surprised to be alive when she wakes, Pazu explains what he witnessed, he is building a small aeroplane with the intention to go in search of the the lost city of Laputa, a flying castle thought to be a legend or myth, but Pazu's took a photograph of. Dola's pirates show up and pursue them, as well as Muska's soldiers, eventually the two fall into a mine, there they encounter eccentric local Uncle Pom (Richard Dysart), he recognises Sheeta's amulet and informs them it is made of 'Aetherium', a material used to keep flying cities, like Laputa, aloft, after leaving the mines Sheeta tells Pazu that her full name is 'Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa'. Sheeta and Pazu are captured by Muska and imprisoned in the fortress of Tedis, Muska shows Sheeta a dormant Laputan robot, he knows about her secret name and interprets it to be that of the Laputan royal line, Pazu's life is threatened unless Sheeta cooperates, and he is sent away and forget about her. Pazu returns home distraught, there Dola's sons ambush him, Dola is eventually persuaded to help Pazu, to stop Muska, intercept the airship Goliath and capture the crystal. Sheeta recites a magical verse and unexpectedly activates the amulet and the robot, which destroys the fortress, Pazu arrives to rescue Sheeta, but Muska obtains the amulet. The pirates, accompanied by Pazu and Sheeta, return to their airship the Tiger Moth, they pursue the Goliath, it is following directions by Sheeta's amulet to locate Laputa. The lost castle in the sky is found, it is devoid of human life, but overgrown by woodland, with a gigantic ""eternal tree of life"" in the centre, it is maintained by another robot. Dola's pirates are captured while Muska's soldiers explore the ancient city and crumbling, overgrown, yet beautiful ruin of a castle, it is the ultimate evolution of the crystal levitation technology, and also has the powers of holography, magnetic cohesion, pseudo-nuclear weaponry and a veritable army of the semi-sentient robots. While Pazu and the freed pirates escape, Muska captures Sheeta and takes her with him into the centre of Laputa, containing the immense Aetherium crystal keeping the city aloft, there he identifies himself as 'Romuska Palo Ul Laputa', a member of another royal line, and he uses Sheeta's amulet as the key to access the advanced Laputian technology. After Muska massacres his own soldiers and destroys the Goliath, Sheeta escapes with her amulet, she encounters Pazu and passes it to him, in a confrontation with Muska, Sheeta realises that the people of Laputa left because humans were meant to live on earth, not in the sky. Muska refuses her argument and threatens to kill her if she does not give him the amulet, Pazu enters and says he will give him the amulet if he is allowed to talk to Sheeta, Muska grants him one minute, Sheeta and Pazu recite a ""Spell of Destruction"", destroying much of the city, and Muska dies. Sheeta and Pazu survive the collapse, protected by the tree's gigantic roots, they reunite with Dola and her pirates, who have swiped the city's treasure, they part with Sheeta and Pazu who are heading to start a new life together, Laputa is left floating in the sky, with a robot guardian still tending the garden, and maintained by the Aetherium crystal. Also starring Jim Cummings as General, Mandy Patinkin as Louis and Andy Dick as Henri. It is a simple story of a quest to find a magical city that floats high in the sky, with are nods to the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne, and retro-futuristic stuff, the voices for the English dubbing are alright, more than anything you pay attention to the fantastically colourful and imaginative animation, an enjoyable animated fantasy adventure. Worth watching!"
"hayashimegumi","7","0","1","23 July 2014"," There are plenty of things that don't make sense but well, good, creative stuffs usually don't make sense!
","Altogether, Castle in the Sky (1986) is a steampunk, sky fantasy film with rich mythology in it. It has excellent art, great music, beautiful hand-drawn animation with plenty of locations that standout such as the aetherium mine/cave, steam powered town, and certainly, all the locations in the floating island Laputa itself.<br/><br/>Indeed, this film scores high in the story and artistic department but there are not much creative outfits, mostly simple designs for most of the characters. There are also plenty of things that don't make sense. A child building and operating an airship? He must be a prodigy. Gun shots cutting off ponytails and did not leave the child deaf or affected in any way? She must be really strong. I guess these are acceptable for 1980s films but well, good, creative stuffs usually don't make sense!<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film is sweet, interesting and comedic at times, keeps me glued to the screen. It is also super delightful to see those yellow fox-squirrel from Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) again, they are so adorable!"

","I will not get into all the details in the movie or the script and say how great it is. But I can tell you I remember my hair stood up several times during the first time I watched this movie. Not to disrespect the American voice-over but the original Japanese brings a different vibe throughout the movie. The American Castle In The Sky seems like a different movie. Not to mention the music is placed a little differently(Yes I can tell. That's how many times I watched this) I believe I am one of a few that actually read the book that came out with the movie when it first came out. It was fantastic to say the least. It gives us the inner thoughts of the characters and the meanings of some of the little things you see in the background. Also an extra ending after what appears in the movie ends.<br/><br/>The music is unlike anything else, too. I hear people use its theme song as ringtones still.<br/><br/>Until this day, when people ask me what is my favorite movie since I am an indi filmmaker. I tell them ""Laputa""."
"cherold","7","0","2","31 August 2013"," Didn't love it as much as other Miyazaki films, but that might not be the movie
","At his best, Miyazaki makes me indescribably happy with wonder. That's why I love his movies. I consider movies like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away to be, in essence, bottled happiness.<br/><br/>But as with most great artists, different people will appreciate different things. One of Miyazaki's most popular films, Princess Mononoke, is my least favorite, because it's more about violence and drama than mystery and ethereal splendor.<br/><br/>Castle in the Sky falls more in the Mononoke action adventure category, and as that, it's a pretty good move, exciting, well paced and visually imaginative and generally fun. <br/><br/>I was less excited by this movie than others by Miyazaki,and that might be because it is very actiony, with lots of shooting and things blowing up, and that's not what I love by Miyazaki. But it might be something else.<br/><br/>I started watching this movie with my girlfriend late at night, and for the first hour I thought it was terrific. But we got sleepy, and didn't watch the rest of the movie for a few days. Which means the problem might not be anything more than a loss of dramatic momentum owing to my seeing the movie broken up. Or it could be that the second hour really is weaker. I don't know. I did see this movie once before, and it didn't stick with me the way other Miyazaki films have, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it better this time had I seen it in a single sitting.<br/><br/>In other words, you can't put too much stock in this review, except to the extent that I can stand by my belief that this is an enjoyable movie. I just can't say if I would have enjoyed it more in different circumstances."

","A young girl(Sheeta – that sounds like a crass term for the crapper, but OK; and grown men leer at her... ew), a boy that is her peer, pirates(quirky, as are most of the characters in this... also, it's a mother and a dozen sons of hers... someone needs to start saying no), the government and the military are all seeking the legendary city in the sky Laputa(the whore... man, Miyazaki just had no luck with names in this). This takes off right away(you won't know exactly what's going on from the start... and it doesn't answer every question, or maybe it's how little I know about Eastern culture), and keeps to a quite fast pace, making the two hours fly by. It's got an epic scope, and the adventure is exciting, with several chases. Atmosphere is built effectively, and what happens has an impact. The designs are creative and imaginative, there are unforgettable details, and the animation is fantastic. This is very silly and the humor is over the top. The DVD comes with alternative angle storyboards for the whole thing, 11 minutes of Studio Ghibli trailers, 5 minutes of the opening and ending sans text, 4 minutes of trailers and 2 and a half minutes of artwork. I recommend this to fans of animé. 8/10"
"VertigoOne","10","0","2","22 October 2010"," Better than Spirited Away
","In no way am I slamming Spirited Away! It is a great film! But there is something about the purity of Castle in the Sky that blows me away. Has there ever been a more beautiful title sequence than the one in this film or a more beautiful musical theme or a more breathtaking castle? Each scene seems patiently thought through and carefully timed. The character development is plentiful but not overdone. I really love this film. More than anything else, I think it is dear to my heart.<br/><br/>For one thing, I can't get over the action sequences. The mother is hilarious and totally runs the show with her band of hyper-masculinized idiots. It is a real joy to see the cars swerve back and forth as characters speed down the road in a tense car chase. There is real humor and grit in this film, and I believe that it belongs on anyone's list of classics, along with the rest of Ghibli's repertoire.<br/><br/>My introduction to this film was upon reading Leonard Maltin's movie guide book about 7 years ago. I was very surprised to see that he had given a Japanese anime film 4 stars. (If anyone is familiar with Maltin, you would know he doesn't just ""give away"" four stars). He said that it was one of the best action films ever made, animated or otherwise. I was already familiar with Miyazaki's work via Spirited Away and was very excited to get my hands on a copy of Castle in the Sky. At first, I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed melancholy compared to the flat-out dynamism of Spirited Away. But over time this film has warmed up to me and has earned a special place on my shelf. I would recommend to anyone interested in seeing this film, or who has seen it before and didn't really like it, to give it time. Allow Castle in the Sky to enchant you. It is SO worth it."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","3","18 December 2006"," LAPUTA - CASTLE IN THE SKY (Hayao Miyazaki, 1986) ***
","As I was about to write this, I decided to re-read my review of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - which I watched earlier this year - and I realized that what I had said about that film pretty much applies to this one as well, even if there's practically a 20-year gap between them (I guess the inference here is that this celebrated animator's style hasn't developed all that much in the interim, which is not necessarily a bad thing).<br/><br/>To quote myself, then: ""a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual, the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive"". Granted, the plot of LAPUTA isn't nearly as involved as some of Miyazaki's later work, though this is still far from a kiddie film - particularly in its climactic set-piece, where all parties concerned (the children, the sky pirates - whose hard exterior mellows gradually to reveal an essential softness underneath - and the army - whose leader, too, isn't what he seems to be) converge on the titular flying citadel, each having their own goal. It's evident, therefore, that characterization is not at all one-dimensional (though Miyazaki dispenses with anthropomorphism this time around) - while the robotic guardians of the island castle are strikingly designed, as well as suitably imposing; the score (by frequent Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi), too, emerges as a definite asset.<br/><br/>To tie in with how I began this review, then, I believe that it's been my over-exposure to Anime on Italian TV as a kid which has diluted the overall impact that such feature-length efforts (and Miyazaki's films in particular) seem to have - pretty much unanimously - on audiences from other parts of the world..."
"nicolasstrappini","Null","0","8","4 January 2004"," Why not just tune into Nickelodeon?
","I had ordered this film with much anticipation off the Internet, since I had already seen most of Miyazaki's works, and I was surprised that it didn't grab me at all. The animation is very simple, it looks exactly like any Saturday morning cartoon (although admittedly, some of the backgrounds are of a higher caliber). The only things to differentiate it from a programme on Nickelodeon are the magical and beautiful score by Hisaishi, and the storyline. I would've loved to love this movie as much as I did Miyazaki's other efforts, but it just didn't have any resonance, it was too cartoony and childish. Maybe I'll watch it again and gain a different impression, maybe I've been spoiled by Spirited and Mononoke, but I just know this isn't anywhere near as impressive as those.  <br/><br/>4/10"
