","I have never written a review here, but I felt compelled to actually step up and defend this movie.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy was everything I expected it to be. It couldn't be too close to the previous Bourne films, but had to be close enough to let us know a storm is coming.<br/><br/>Bourne's presence throughout the film is what spins this story into action and I felt it was balanced perfectly. We all want Bourne, but this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were great, but I think the scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation. This was someone yearning to be more, not someone who was already better than everyone else, but just couldn't remember.<br/><br/>Let's cross our fingers and hope we all get what we want and pair Bourne and Cross in the next film.<br/><br/>There is so much more going on than just Jason Bourne and if we don't get to explore that then the franchise will be poorer for it!"
"midnighttheater","6","367","477","6 August 2012"," Much better than it had any right to be thanks in part to its two lead actors (Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz), who work acting miracles with a poor script.
","Questionable follow up to the Bourne trilogy that has the right pieces in place but lacks the conviction to justify its existence. Taking place almost at the same time of the climax of the third Bourne film (Ultimatum), this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of ""Operation Blackbriar"" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. ""Outcome"", the program in question is an offshoot of both ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar"" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them. <br/><br/>In order for me to tell you what is good about this movie, I have to explain what is wrong with it and that is the fact that you get the feeling fifteen minutes into the film that there is no reason for it to exist. The last film (Bourne Ultimatum) pretty much closed the book on the series, with little to no wiggle room for an encore. This movie feels like a studio trying to milk dried what was good from the original trilogy in order to make more sequels. The bad part is that they did it in the most unbelievable way, so much so that you really need to forget what you saw in the last three films in order to believe what was going on in this movie. Tony Gilroy (Who wrote the first three movies) directs and writes this one but falls flat on his face with halfhearted explanations that try to justify this movie's existence. Not to mention the fact that the villain of the movie is a lightweight compared to what came before him plus the glaring fact that Edward Norton's performance as the heavy is pretty much phoned in. He does not have the confidant arrogant swagger that Chris Cooper's character had in the first film nor the desperate menace of that Brain Cox's character brought to the second. Norton's character is more in line with the villain of the third, who was played by David Strathaim (who has a cameo in this film). However, Strathaim's character had a sense of justifiable menace that drove him, while Norton's character just seems like a man trying to justify his actions for the greater good, making him more of a government shill than a villain. The science fiction angle that comes up is insulting to what the last three films were, not to mention the fact that the direction here lacks the kinetic energy that Paul Greengrass brought to the last two movies of the series. Say what you may about the shaky camera work but he knew how to stage a thrilling action piece of pop art. Gilroy's motorcycle chase towards the climax is decent but lacks kinetic spark. He is however very good in staging small intimate moments within this movie but that is more a compliment to the A + cast (Mainly his two lead actors) than the terrible script that they are forced to working with.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is a talented actor with serious range and complexity. However, the character he plays is not much of a character and the script that he has to work with is riddled with cliché after cliché. He can do anything a secret agent can do but better but the character is not very compelling or interesting to say the least. Jason Bourne was a compelling character that needed to find himself and through that journey in the original trilogy, we saw complexities that were compelling and thoughtful. He was a conflicted man whose drive was dictated by an inner sense of redemption. The character of Aaron Cross is a cartoon character compared to Jason and that is the main problem of the script for this movie. It is though Renner's efforts as an actor that we care about the character of Aaron Cross and that is one of the few bright spots this film has. Renner injects likability and vulnerability to this character and because of it, we want him to succeed in beating the bad guy and save the girl but Renner is working with a script that goes against itself and we are left with a half fast story that deals with supermen than a human story about survival. It is through Renner's efforts as an actor that we see humanity and conflict in this character while the script itself does not give that sort of detail and Renner is working overtime to accomplish that. Renner would have done wonders with a compelling character like Jason Bourne, unfortunately that is not found with the character of Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is one of the most versatile, gifted and complex actors working today. An actor's actor in every sense of word but like Renner, she does not have much of a character thanks to the cliché script they both have to work with. Her character is on the run with Cross through out the film and acts as his doctor and object of protection. It is through Weisz's amazing strength and range as an actor that we are able to witness levels of complexity and humanity in the character of Dr Marta Shearing that we really do not get from the script. Because of that, we are not only able to care and identify with her but Weisz actually makes her character more complex and interesting than Aaron Cross himself. You can tell that Weisz was working overtime in achieving that and her efforts pay off ten fold, which is a blessing considering that most of the characters outside of her and Renner come across as cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>It is a shame because Renner and Weisz try their best and for the most part succeed despite all odds but they like the fans deserved better."
"gradyharp","10","75","96","12 December 2012"," 'Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.'
","It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY, but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair. This is a 'legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such, for this reviewer, it works very well. The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography, has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.<br/><br/>As someone distilled the plot, 'this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of ""Operation Blackbriar"" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. ""Outcome"", the program in question is an offshoot of both ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar"" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting. Jeremy Renner is excellent, always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations. The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney, Oscar Isaac, David Strathairn, and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.<br/><br/>The speed of the action, the poundingly purposeful musical score and the non-stop fascinating twists and turns make this a top-notch film. It does carry on the 'legacy' of Ludlum's ideas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"jackmatlock15","8","53","67","30 September 2012"," Doesn't Deserve the Hate; a dialogue-driven spy movie that does entertain
","""The Bourne Legacy"" is prequel/sequel/spin-off/reboot of the Bourne Series. Yes, I know; there aren't many pre-se-reboot-spinoffs out there.<br/><br/>In ""Legacy"", Jason Bourne is sidelined for Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), another spy in the Bourne universe. Though, Cross is a product of ""Outcome"", a program that gave the agent pills called ""chems"" that improved their intelligence and physique. Yet, in Langley, Eric Byer (Edward Norton), an operations director, decides to ""cut the program"", which is spy language for ""kill everyone involved"". Cross teams up with scientist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as they head to the Phillipines to get the chems, while every operative with a finger and a gun is on their trail.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Legacy"" has garnered very mixed reviews; some really like it, some really hate it, some are in-betweeners. I am one who really liked it. Comparing ""Legacy"" to the originals, more specifically ""Ultimatum"", is like comparing ""Batman Returns"" to ""The Dark Knight"". A good movie to a fantastic one. <br/><br/>If ""Legacy"" was a regular spy movie with no connection to Bourne, it would definitely be in higher regard. But, as it has the ""Bourne"" name associated with it, certain things were expected: 1. Insane non-stop action. 2. Insane non-stop action. 3. More action.<br/><br/>""Legacy"" is extremely dialogue driven. About 3/4 of this movie is dialogue. And the dialogue is very technical, and very scientific, and it flies way over some people's heads. The previous Bourne films were not filled with this technical jargon. <br/><br/>The performances, though, are very good. Renner and Weisz are absolutely perfect in their roles. Renner perfectly captures the manhunting super agent with ease. He's a natural action hero, and one of my favorite actors. Though Edward Norton is devilishly underused. His character merely sits behind a screen and barks orders. <br/><br/>The Verdict: When you go into ""Legacy"", don't expect insane non-stop action. Yes, when the action happens, it is really awesome. But this is a dialogue-driven spy movie with lots of high-vocabulary dialogue. I really enjoy dialogue-driven films, and this film does entertain. A-"
"andreasschultz","4","214","322","28 August 2012"," Wonderful performance by Renner and Weisz, despite the lack of a coherent storyline and a poorly written script.
","The Bourne Legacy is the fourth installment of the Bourne franchise and evolves around a new main protagonist, Aaron Cross. The story runs parallel with the end of the third Bourne movie, and concerns itself with the result of Jason Bourne's exposure of the Blackbriar program. <br/><br/>""Outcome"", another government program, is trying to cover up themselves by eliminating their agents in order to not get pulled down by the coming scandal set in motion by Jason Bourne's actions. Outcome is an affiliate of Blackbriar and Treadstone, with one significant difference however. Their agents are chemically enhanced to be quicker, stronger and smarter, by ingesting a set of pills. This is where we meet Aaron Cross. Being hunted by his own agency, while trying to get the pills he so desperately need. <br/><br/>What makes this movie watchable is NOTHING but the performance of the lead actors, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz. Both talented actors with great depth and experience. It is obvious that they are struggling to tap into the emotional vein of their characters, and the script taken into consideration, it is not strange. Despite this, Renner and Weisz manage to pull it off beautifully. This is no doubt due to the undeniable chemistry between the two. Weisz's sensitive and innocent character fits together beautifully with Renner's stoic, cold, and very charming character. Weisz in particular brings some much needed sensitivity to the movie, which otherwise would have been pretty boring to watch. She becomes Cross's object of protection, and it is because of her we even care about his attempt to find safety from his assailants. Without her, this would have been a movie about a man trying to find medicine. In short I have nothing but respect for these two people, and they do a wonderful job despite what would have otherwise been an insult to the series and the genre in general. <br/><br/>Regrettably Edward Norton's character as Eric Byer, the ""bad guy"" hunting for Aaron Cross seems spineless and unnecessary compared to the other two. This makes him annoying and superficial when he's on, and you can't help but get the feeling that he shouldn't be there. Compared to Chris Cooper's mysterious and secretive character as Conklin, the head of Treadstone from The Bourne Identity, Norton seems even more spineless and unnecessary.This is once again more of a critique of the script than of Edward Norton as an actor, since we know (from for example American History X and Fight Club) that Edward Norton can really act. <br/><br/>This is the kind of movie, where they show every single action sequence in the trailer. As you start watching the movie, you're wondering when it's ACTUALLY gonna start, and when it does start you're wondering what it's actually about. It's very hard to keep track of, and it seems to want to be two things at the same time. It is impossible to watch it without forgetting what you saw in the last three films, because it is so far from the original ones. It is like you are in a completely different universe, and it lacks the charm, mystique and wit that makes a ""real"" Bourne movie. Paul Greengrass managed to be innovative without compromising the dark, mysterious, kind-of-charming feel of the first movie. For whatever reason, Tony Gilroy has not. The Bourne Legacy is so far from the other three movies that it is hard to believe it's in the same ""universe"". At the same time it is impossible to understand the plot without keeping track of what happened in the original ones. That way it's trying to be two very different things, and ends up worming itself into a strange borderland between ""Knight And Day"" and ""Quantum Of Solace"" which leaves you puzzled to its existence, and unconvinced to its plot. <br/><br/>The movie does have some pretty decent action sequences with great effects, but lacks the storyline, motivation, drive and intimacy to justify them. They're redundant.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the two and a half hour ordeal that this movie really is, you find yourself not really caring anymore and just want it to end decently. And then the air goes out of the balloon with a poof. Out of nowhere the movie ends, with no conclusion, no explanation and no reason whatsoever for it to exist. You're left with a lot more questions than answers, and feel unsatisfied with what you've just seen. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was due to my high expectations that I couldn't enjoy this movie as much as I wanted, but I feel like i've seen enough to know what makes a great movie and distinguish between a good and a bad scripts. It's a real shame, because Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton are three of my favorite actors and I think they could have worked miracles with the right script. <br/><br/>In short, I have nothing but respect for the actors but don't feel like this is worthy of being called a Bourne movie."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","96","139","23 August 2012"," A Solid Continuation That Nevertheless Goes Through the Rhythms
","There is never just one. We've reached our fourth globe-trotting adventure based on the novels of the late Robert Ludlum, and the first without former series lead Matt Damon as the enigmatic superspy Jason Bourne. With its name taken from a 2004 installment not actually penned by Ludlum, The Bourne Legacy explores the ripple effect of the events that played out in The Bourne Ultimatum. While little could be done to cushion the drop in quality that was bound to come with well, anything, that followed that near-masterpiece of action, Jeremy Renner makes an apt substitute and the thrills, wit and set pieces are all top notch, even if it won't quite have audiences asking, ""Jason who?"" <br/><br/>In the mischievous and highly top secret world of clandestine CIA superspy programs, the program previously known as Treadstone has once again morphed – from Treadstone to Blackbriar and now to Outcome (officially known as Alcom), a bio-weapons division in New York State that operates under the ruse of a pharmaceutical research firm. It is through this project that Rachel Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing crosses path with Outcome agent Aaron Cross, as her employer's cloak-and-dagger endeavors supply its agent with viral treatments that boost both physical and mental efficiency. <br/><br/>While on a training procedure in Alaska, Cross is nearly assassinated by his own people after it's been decided by the powers that be that Jason Bourne's actions in ""Ultimatum"" have metastasized beyond repair and all outlying assets must be eliminated (including Dr. Shearing and her peers). Going on the run is one thing for Cross, but now without the pills he has been taking to keep himself stimulated, he faces the threat of crashing like a lifetime heroine addict gone cold turkey – a dire situation which would indefinitely lead to his — and the doctor's — death. <br/><br/>With Tony Gilroy, some will be relieved to be done with the shaky cam approach of Paul Greengrass but what does remain intact is Gilroy's dense, jargon-filled dialogue that even if being dumb, always sounds so incredibly smart. There is certainly no mistaking that this is a film from this universe. <br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is easily the goriest of the bunch and at times really pushes the envelope when it comes to a PG-13 rating. As evidenced in the trailers, there is an early-set shooting involving Weisz's character and it is quite disturbing and effective in its robotic ruthlessness. Forget the controversial scene in Gangster Squad that is being reshot due to the Aurora, Colo. shootings, this sequence is bound to give anyone close to that event vivid flashbacks. And speaking of Weisz, even in her quiet moments (and she has plenty of loud and quiet) she steals her show coming off as both devastated and strong and nimbly sidesteps the oft- seen trope of the shrieking helpless female victim.<br/><br/>Gilroy's foray has a number of inspired instances, and though ""Legacy"" could have used about 15 minutes of trimming, it never bores. There are a number of intense and well-choreographed sequences that aptly showcase Cross' lethality and they're presented with enough frequency amidst the bureaucracy. An electric and immensely entertaining sequence takes place back when Cross is back in Alaska and attempting to avoid a quick death both by a military drone and a pack of wolves. I won't spoil anything, but it puts a whole new spin on the ""slip your GPS tracker so your pursuers think you're somewhere else"" cliché. <br/><br/>At other times, however, it seems like Gilroy is just going down the ""Bourne"" checklist even down to playing Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" at the end credits (I was really glad about that, actually). Bourne beats up some unsuspecting guards — check. Bourne engages in an extended car chase in an exotic location — check. Bourne evades capture by running along rooftops — check. Another agent is sent to eliminate Bourne — check. The only ""check"" missing is the inclusion of the man himself. However, in lieu of giving us an utter deconstruction of the series (or nothing at all), why should we be disappointed that The Bourne Legacy gives us everything we could expect (and at times quite a bit more)?<br/><br/>It also becomes clear pretty early on that Damon's Bourne is not the only one who has been given a redux. David Strathairn's Noah Vosen (who is under investigation following his attempted cover-up) has been given the form of Edward Norton's Eric Byer and Joan Allen's Pamela Landy (who is also having problems with her ""treason"" as it were) effectively with Donna Murphy's Dita Mandy (only changed one letter in the last name there). It's safe to say, despite strong performances, they feel like a downgrade when recalling the fiery antagonism shared with Vosen and Landy in The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>One thing The Bourne Legacy makes utterly clear is that at the distinguished age of 41, Jeremy Renner has proved himself to be a formidable action hero, both bringing a classic look to Cross but also matching Damon in displays of physicality and athleticism. He has now proved his leading man potential and I look forward to Renner headlining further action adventures (be it in this series or others). <br/><br/>But after all the conspiracies have been unmasked and the last bullet drained, I still couldn't help but miss Damon in the lead role. We all knew how great he was as Jason Bourne, but it would seem that I at least took his work for granted, perhaps failing to truly appreciate how magnetic he was in his ass-kickery. Let's hope Damon comes to miss his involvement and teams up with Renner in future missions, because that would be an on-screen duo worthy of all kinds of legacies."
"sammyb","Null","22","28","13 September 2012"," better than i thought it would be
","I wasn't sure about this film when I saw the trailer. I'd only see Renner in MI4 so I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't been a huge Bourne fan but I'd caught them all on DVD. This was the first film in the series I'd seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Its not perfect, but then neither were the Matt Damon ones. It was pretty good though. Things really improved with Rachel's involvement. The scene where Renner and Rachel meet, after Renner kills 4 or 5 assassins in a stunning sequence)is fantastic and its high octane all the way after that. There are some reflective moments which give the talented leads a chance to shine and the two have fantastic screen chemistry together- ironically better presence than Weisz has with her real life husband in the disappointing Dream House. The big action scene in Manila is jaw dropping. The tag scene sets things up for another film that I really want to happen. So what's not perfect?<br/><br/>The problem is that all the flashbacks to Ultimatum are not needed and slow down the opening of the film. Bourne is gone and the film should concentrate 100% on the new characters. <br/><br/>STILL WANT THAT SEQUEL THOUGH"
"godspeeder","3","373","601","11 August 2012"," Weisz and Renner act their assess off but not even their raw talent can save this film from Director Tony Gilroy's ego trip of a script and his lackluster directing.
","This is truly a case of great actors who are left out there in the cold by a director, who essentially does not even try to respect them and the audience's intelligence by giving them something original or interesting. Tony Gilroy had written not only the first three Bourne films but the great Michael Clayton as well but here, it is obvious that he is on a destructive ego trip. Gilroy is more interested in making people see on how smart he is as a scriptwriter and filmmaker than actually try to entertain and stay true to what made the other Bourne films special. With that destructive mind set, Gilroy forgets that you need faith in your actors and the material they are working with in order to drive the movie forward. Gilroy also commits the biggest sin of all, which is to never underestimate the intelligence of your audience.<br/><br/>The script by Gilroy and his brother Dan tries to be cutting edge in scientific jargon and smart dialog but ends up with so many inconsistencies and flimsy characterization that you have to double back twice to see if Gilroy actually had a hand in the original ""Bourne Trilogy"". The characters in this film are only there to get from A to B and none of them with the exception of Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner (Who you can clearly see are both working beyond the call of duty to make something out of their paper-thin roles) has any real purpose at all. Poor Edward Norton is only there to bark orders and you can clearly see how frustrated he is with his role in certain scenes. The direction is not even very good, with pacing problems and a running time that excessively too long for its own good. The action scenes (The few of them in the film) do not jar well and are boring to say the least.<br/><br/>My advice to Universal, if there has to be a sequel, bring back Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner (Who both deserve medals for their efforts in making this lazy, self indulgent script work) and get rid of Tony Gilroy, who clearly does not respect anybody other than himself. You might have a better movie if you do."

The people who ran illegal black ops fear they will be exposed to the government and decide to kill off all these warriors and the scientists who make the meds so they cannot talk. <br/><br/>Basically, this is one big chase movie and it is very exciting. The editing during the foot race, car and motorcycle chases later on are fantastic. I am not sure how much CGI was used as everything looked too real. Great stunts. Kudos. <br/><br/>The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, David Strathaim, Scott Glen, and Albert Finney do a credible job just as a supporting cast (hey, it's not their movie) trying to kill off Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachael Weisz) the doctor who knows how to make the meds Cross needs. The way Cross and Dr. Shearing are tracked by Col Byer (Edward Norton) and crew is really incredible as they have access to cameras and satellites worldwide. Quite smooth the way it was done. <br/><br/>I had my doubts about Rachael Weisz in this but she proved more than capable and quite sexy beautiful. She couldn't have been any better. Okay, yes, I fell in love with her. <br/><br/>Now, why Jeremy Renner as a new action hero? Did you forget his role in Tom Cruise's movie Mission Impossible, Ghost Protocol? He did a bang-up job in that one looking out for Cruise's Ethan Hunt and had some moves that opened important casting eyes. So it made sense. See?<br/><br/>I almost expected a meeting with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Aaron Cross because in this movie Jason Bourne is alive and doing his thing.

","Thanks to the 2 heroes, I give a good mark though the script was a labyrinth of complications between different US National Security Services and their different projects more or less secret, some of them more secret within secrets because untellable, unacceptable. And when one of those has to disappear, lots of dead people it means. Here is the story of another run-for-his-life hero, Jeremy Renner! He surprised me this actor. He blows the screen from his very first appearance until the last.

Wow they are good! They SAVE the movie Let's hope there will be a sequel with these two but with a MUCH IMPROVED script, please. I declare myself a fan for Mr Renner (Please forgive my probably curious use of English, my second language...)"
"nathan-f77","10","68","103","15 September 2012"," One of the best movies I have seen all year.
","I absolutely loved every minute of this movie, but let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of any of the first three Bourne movies. I will also say that because this story is so different to the previous movies, it would have probably been better to give it a different title. There didn't need to be any reference to Bourne at all.<br/><br/>One of the highlights for me was the level of accuracy in the CIA search team. It was surprisingly refreshing to see satellite feeds from across the world portrayed with their accurate limitations. This made me engage with that part of the story on a much deeper level, and I really felt the tension as the search team grew closer and closer to their target.<br/><br/>The chase sequence is one of the best I have seen. Manila was an amazing choice of location. It had it's one cheesy moment, but I was holding onto my seat the entire time. I enjoyed the lull after the first part of the chase, and I especially liked the very sharp and conclusive ending. <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely spot on.<br/><br/>I loved the details that helped to set the tone for certain scenes. For example, the Australian character at the Manila laboratory really helped to create a general overtone of semi-incompetence, which was crucial to the belief that their break-in and escape was actually plausible.<br/><br/>I loved the storyline, and found it very refreshing after seeing too many movies that deal with revenge or uncovering conspiracies. Perhaps it says something about my personality, but I really enjoyed the premise that all they wanted to do was get away, and live in peace. I thought the suspense was really well managed, during the scene where the border guards were checking their passports. The final scene of the movie released all of this built-up tension, and I think it was a perfect, happy ending. The ending reminded me of the movie 'Limitless', how the character's world can collapse at any moment, but they make it to the end, and are well-prepared to deal with any threats in the future. <br/><br/>So there you go. One 10 star review in a sea of disappointed critics."

Bourne Ultimatum was just OK because of the constant stupid camera shaking that just made me mad so I did not enjoy that movie. The camera shaking was just too much. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just smooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked that Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional for Matt do take a stance like that.

","Ouch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like a mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take advantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the Ultimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing homage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention that the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something that ""Legacy"" would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first trilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska, location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the first three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have personality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in your memory.<br/><br/>Even though not directly stated, I think most people would understand by watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne. The only way this film will have any more meaning is if they continue the new trilogy."
"sweetiesy","3","257","457","13 August 2012"," Should be held up as an example of how dedicatedly good actors can almost redeem a pointless, badly written film.
","Pointless entry into the Bourne series finds Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz taking over where Matt Damon left off in a sequel that lacks not only a real purpose to exist but lacks a script that can justify the movie as a continuation of the series. Tony Gilroy (who had a hand in screen writing the original three films) writes and directs this entry but forgets the showmanship and grace that Paul Greengrass and Doug Liman brought to the series, not to mention the solid storytelling that came with their efforts. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz tried their best with the weak material Gilroy provides for them and they almost succeed, giving the audience something to care for but they are fighting an uphill battle against cliché one dimensional characters, dismal screen writing, a running time that needed to be edited down and amateurish direction that does no one any favors. The rest of the cast barely registers at all and the action is not even on the same level of the other films in the series.<br/><br/>If any blame should go around, it should go squarely to Tony Gilroy and his brothers, who seem like they had no idea on what the hell they were doing and in the process, wasted the time of two great actors (Renner and Weisz) who are working beyond what is necessary to give the fans the respect they deserve for staying with the series.

","Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was, who was responsible for his condition, and attempted to bring everything back together again. Even better, he was not a superhero; Jason was just a guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite, but deep down he is still one of us. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on the other hand, has been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental skills. Yes, he is still human too, but perhaps a bit genetically modified. This splash of sci/fi does not help an audience tuned in to the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.<br/><br/>When I first heard there was another Bourne installment, this time without Matt Damon, I figured someone either wrote a good script to carry on a new story line, or the studio wanted to churn out a guaranteed cash cow under the title of a proved and successful action series. Writer/director Tony Gilroy wrote the scripts for the first three Bourne films, but this is his first time behind the camera in the series. He successfully directed Michael Clayton and the under- appreciated Duplicity, but now the magic is gone. The Bourne Legacy is stale. <br/><br/>Enduring a painfully slow beginning, The Bourne Legacy reveals it is set at the same point in time as The Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, if you have forgotten the plot points and supporting characters of the previous film, take the time to either watch it again or read about it online before heading into the new feature. Jason Bourne's escapades have thrown multiple CIA operations out in the open and the shadowy powers are frantically trying to sweep them under the rug before either Congress or the press start asking questions. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) orders the termination of Project Outcome, the new series of super agent represented by Aaron Cross. Instead of telling the agents to pack up and go home, the CIA chooses to assassinate them instead. Oh, and they try to wipe out all of the scientists who made them so super in the first place.<br/><br/>Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is one of those scientists seeking ways to alter chromosomes to make a more perfect human. After surviving annihilation himself, Aaron conveniently scoops the good Dr. out of harms way which sets up an 'us against them' theme quite similar to the one you remember from The Bourne Identity. Unfortunately, The Bourne Legacy noticeably lacks the quality script and thrilling action sequences of that first film. The chase scenes in the new film are edited so atrociously, especially during motorcycle elements, that they are almost impossible to logically follow. You know they are weaving in and out of traffic, there are near misses, and flying bullets; but there are only quick glimpses of that on the screen in the midst of the unsteady camera work and split-second jump cuts.<br/><br/>The Bourne Identity also had a mystery to unravel and wandered around the world trying to find out who was behind the curtain. There is no curtain now, Edward Norton is pulling the strings in plain sight using all of the means in the intelligence community he can lay his hands on. There are armed Predator drones, devious mop-up CIA killing squads, and even a possible super- duper agent; imagine the Schwarzenegger Terminator battling the new T-1000. <br/><br/>Renner and Weisz do their best to remake a film which was already pretty great. Yes, they have new names and faces, but they are running from the same agency, dodging the same bullets, but this time they have a higher chromosomal level on their side. The Bourne Legacy will be known as that film which derailed the very respectable Bourne franchise. Paul Greengrass, the director of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, was correct when he said any further film would feel like The Bourne Redundancy."
"parallel_projection","4","171","306","16 August 2012"," Not even close to a Bourne movie
","In a way I think this film disgraces the Bourne series, and here's why: it simply did not have the feel of a Bourne movie. Between awkwardly chosen locations, some sci-fi drug twist, and and incredibly over-simplified and at times dull plot line, this is hardly an action movie, let alone a Bourne movie. Also, and this part really bothered me, I feel like Tony and Dan Gilroy did things with some of the Bourne characters that were not true to Robert Ludlum's vision, even going so far as to change the initiation program and the amount of information leaked at the end of Ultimatum. <br/><br/>Secondly, the direction was very close up the entire time, and during many of the chase scenes I found myself unable to watch. The entire time it is very shaky, and because of the closeness, it's difficult to get the whole picture of what's going on.<br/><br/>Lastly, some of the acting wasn't very good. I've never liked Jeremy Renner, and this movie didn't change my opinion on him. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that I don't like him as an actor. Edward Norton, though, was incredibly stiff and robotic the whole time, as were some of the other government workers. The best performance was probably from Rachel Weisz, who did well as a woman trying to deal with shock and guilt. <br/><br/>If you happen to like almost all action movie, go ahead and watch this, but if you're a Bourne fan, I wouldn't bother wasting your and tarnishing some aspects of the past movies."

","Great cast. Great acting. However, The entire film feels like the beginning to a movie. You keep telling yourself, 'wow, the intro was long now the movies really starting..oh nevermind'. ::Spoilers:: The entire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented medicine. The goal of his enemies is to kill him. There is no trying to get back at the CIA, no typical Bourne stuff. The Bourne series was unnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off fresher. Scenes were drawn out, there were only about 2 clever plays made, and the main enemy never meets the prot. It's all very separated and remote. No connections are formed and we are not given the hope that he seeks to solve the issues at hand. They also completely write off Bourne.. wouldn't he know Pamela gets framed and that the overhead is still controlling black ops groups? A lot of things were not well thought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing."

","I could candy coat this and tell you I loved this film, but I won't because I didn't. I thought it was rather poorly written. However the saving grace was the actors themselves that pulled this out of the crapper in my opinion. Nothing new was added here except another layer to the Treadstone, Black Briar, and other Government absurdities from the other three movies. This sequel deals with genetics and DNA manipulation and since this is mentioned in the trailer, there is no spoiler alert needed. These genetic mutations were supposed to eliminate the inconsistencies that existed with Jason Borne (also in the trailer) and the operatives in his program. The way they dealt with how they supposedly ""fixed"" the inconsistencies is really what was made this an unbelievable script. However, the action and the acting of the two lead characters Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner make this movie tolerable. There was no reason to cast people like Stacey Keach or Edward Norton to this cast as they added no value other than their name to this film. Really, any no name actor could have provided the same quality to this film without having to pay for these actors. The plot wasn't too hard to follow, but be prepared for a few flashbacks to the other three movies, which to me, upsets the flow to the movie. The only reason I think they put them in in the first place was for people who may not have seen the other three Borne movies. Other than that, I don't think they're needed. <br/><br/>I wouldn't waste admission price or popcorn on this movie. I only saw it because it was only $5 at the drive in and you got to see another movie after it went off so it didn't cost me that much. Don't worry, it will keep until it comes out on Netflix or Redbox, and then you can watch it without worrying that you are throwing away your money."

","While I had previously seen the Matt Damon-Bourne movies and remember enjoying them, I had watched them once when they came out and therefore can't remember specific details. So it was in seeing this new one with Jeremy Renner as the lead but as a different character from Damon's that I approached this one with a fresh perspective in following what was going on and why. So on that note, I enjoyed this one just as much as the others maybe even a little more since this one doesn't have the shaky-cam the others had. And I also liked Rachel Weisz as the doctor who escaped from her lab after an associate of hers was killing the other lab partners. And I loved seeing Renner and her together just running to survive whether through Maryland (which is where I'm currently vacationing right now) or the Philippines which is where my mom and late dad originally came from and my sisters had visited when they were little but I and my brother have yet to go to. It's possible I might have been a little more critical of this movie if I, like many reviewers on this site, had nearly perfect memory of those previous Bourne movies but as it is now, I highly enjoyed The Bourne Legacy."

Without the Bourne name, it would have been yet another action thriller, the same as everything else. The plot is straightforward, get item A, go to point B, fight bad guy C.<br/><br/>But does this make it a bad film then? Not really. It's still enjoyable entertainment for a night out in cinemas. The main actors are great, things are happening, the pace is solid and entertainment wise you have no been short-changed. There is enough action and tension in the film, not the least in how the secret government agency goes forth in its information gathering activities.

","I was dubious, when going to see this film, that it would live up to the amazing standards that the rest of the Bourne series had created. But I couldn't have been more mistaken! From the very beginning, it got the audience captivated, and even though some may have said it was a slow start, I would disagree and argue that it built up the tension fantastically. But, when the action did get started, I along with the rest of the whole cinema, really was on the edge of my seat. This film balances the action sequences and the calmer sequences perfectly, not to mention with fantastic acting and off-the-scale believable characters. It didn't take the audience for granted - didn't assume we were all stupid and explain every detail - which, although made it a little harder to follow, really got you thinking and all of your senses like live wires. I think the best part of this film, although there was many, many brilliant factors - were the action sequences. During all of them, my heart was in my mouth it was so tense! Especially in the epic motorcycle scene. I am astounded at how brilliantly they pulled this one off. Yes, the Legacy of the Bourne films lives on. If I could give this a 11/10 I really would - but at the moment we'll just have to settle for the full 10!"

","I had dragged my feet on seeing this film due to lukewarm reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Bourne Legacy is much better than the previous installment in the series, although die-hard fans might be disappointed over the absence of Matt Damon and the relegation of supporting characters played by David Strathairn and Joan Allen (and others) to mere cameo appearances. However, the principal performers in this film (Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton) infuse the franchise with a welcome rush of new energy and considerable on-screen charisma. The locations look great, and the action sequences are genuinely exciting and impressive. The film begins somewhat slowly, but this results in a degree of characterization that helps us invest in the well-being of the hero and heroine, and the pace definitely picks up in the second half. The open-ended nature of the conclusion seems designed as a brief pause before a sequel; while the lack of narrative closure will be frustrating for some viewers, I can hardly wait to see more of these characters from these filmmakers."

","The first Bourne trilogy transcends the action movie genre. They are fast and clever. Showing us the intense fist fights and exciting car chases in a new way. It's a remarkable thing. It's so remarkable, many action films intends to copy its style. This fourth movie, The Bourne Legacy, may not have Matt Damon in it but we are expecting it to have the legacy of the first three. Unfortunately, we don't get to see a lot of it, but by its slick direction, great performances, and thrilling set pieces, it made the film worth a ride.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is straightforward to its storytelling, but unlike the first three, this is not quite swift. The exposition mostly leans on the dialogue. Disappointingly, it is not as action packed as the usual Bourne films. The action only shows up in some parts, but when it goes there, it becomes a lot more entertaining. They may be few but all of them are thrillingly exciting.<br/><br/>It could have been a little shorter, though. The runtime feels like a stretch. But thanks to the director and the actors for making sure that things won't go dull. Jeremy Renner has the looks of an action hero. Some will say he's just a generic bland actor but they didn't realize that there is a hidden talent in him. He can do more than just physicality. He actually gave more personality to his role. The director seem to slow things down, but he keeps the non-action scenarios gripping.<br/><br/>It's practically reasonable why some did not like The Bourne Legacy. The major reason is the element that made the series remarkable is rare in this film. We didn't see anything fast and ridiculous until the third act. But if you have more desire to know the other story behind The Bourne Ultimatum then this will keep you interested. In general, The Bourne Legacy is as gripping as the others. It's true that the main legacy of the series is little here, but if you are not concern about it then you'll think this as a decent blockbuster."

","I watched this movie cuz i love Jeremy Renner and Ed Norton, i was not disappointed. The acting was great and the action was just perfect not over the top Hollywood style, everything was believable. What i really appreciated was the fact that it was not a remake or an attempt to replace Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, but a combination of both stories, with an additional chapter introducing a new character. This movie can look slow at times, but that's made on purpose I think cuz the writers wanted to focus on Aaron Cross(Jeremy Renner), henceforth the beginning was quite long. They explore more behind the ""Jason Bourne creation"", what he is, how he came about,of which these characters have in common; in a certain way Bourne is present in the movie but not actually there, the two characters are connected by this secret governmental program of genetically modified perfect assassins. The ""bad guys"" who now decided to terminate this program, are after both Bourne and Cross, but never in proximity of each other in the pursuit, because i think this is only the beginning of a long odyssey for these 2 individuals included Joan Allen's character which we see only for few moments. That's what i think the writers had in mind. And i really enjoyed that. I can't wait for the sequel, to know more about everything, the program and the two men, but also about Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), Eric Bayer (Ed Norton) and Cross background and also about the doc (Rachel Weiz). This movie was cleverly done and there is much they can go on, the way they started this new legacy, regardless if Matt Damon will come back or not as Jason Bourne the writers can still continue the story ONLY with Renner as ""the new Bourne"". Perhaps they could do a movie with both Damon and Renner, that's something i would enjoy to see. Overall i really loved this movie. Gosh it's good to see talent and great writing skills. I so love good movies!I just want to add, that I read few reviews and i find unfair the way the movie, the actors and the writers are ""criticized"". Some folks went to the screening expecting to find Matt Damon's Bourne but i didn't, why i loved it..I never didn't in anyway compared the previous Bourne movies to this one, except for the genre, indeed the title imply a new story from the Bourne franchise (a new legacy) and that's is very OK with me especially if the leading actor and new protagonist of this legacy is the talented gorgeous Jeremy Renner. Jeremy Renner is not Matt Damon and ppl should just stop making comparison they are two different actors both very talented and very unique. I would watch both of them in a future project for the Bourne legacy... Great job!"

However Jeremy Renner is a refreshingly pleasant surprise as the new agent. He is a great actor who has tremendous screen presence and energy. Rachel Weisz as Dr. Snyder is outstanding. Ed Norton as Byer does not have too many lines but his expressions show why he is such a great actor. The story is excellent and so is Tony Gilroy's direction. The action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seats. The finale on the streets of Manila is aligned with the previous three Bourne movies. The locations chosen are perfect. The cinematography is grabbing especially the scenes which were shot in Alberta, Canada. The Bourne Legacy is a must see not only for the Bourne fans but also for those who love a good story and good action movies. I am going to watch it again and pay for it when it is released in August. It's well worth it!"

","Film: The Bourne Legacy Studio: Relativity Media, The Kennedy /Marshall Company Cast: Jeremy Renner, Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz Rating: PG-13 Running Time:135 minutes<br/><br/>In 2002 Jason Bourne the amnesiac spy/assassin loosely based off of the Robert Ludlem novels made his way to the big screen. Played magnificently by Matt Damon, The Bourne Identity was a breath of fresh air in the action-thriller genre which had been dominated by movies like ""Mission: Impossible"" and the James Bond series. <br/><br/>In the following years, two sequels (The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum) also starring Damon came along, each tolerable in their own right, both feeding off of the previous story but neither as good as the first.<br/><br/>Eventually the quality of the of the scripts were of such poor quality that even Matt Damon distanced himself and moved on from the franchise.  <br/><br/>If only the studio made the same move. <br/><br/>Supposedly Paul Greengrass, the director of the first three Bourne installments joked about a forth film being titled ""The Bourne Redundancy""which turns out to be ironically appropriate. I submit the even more appropriate ""The Boring Legacy"".<br/><br/>Directed by Tony Gilroy, writer of the first three Bourne films, The Bourne Legacy struggles to introduce new characters and attach them to the established narrative. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, we learn that the covert program that created Jason Bourne has a sister program run by another clandestine government agency like the CIA. The head of that agency (The Incredible Hulk's Edward Norton) is positive that the events of ""Supremacy"" have created an infection which needs to be""cleaned up"" - a euphemism for killing all agents involved in the ""Outcome"" program. <br/><br/>Aaron Cross (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) is the last of these Bourne-like agents who are  dependent on a combination of pills to maintain their amazing physical and mental skills. He's knows he's being hunted but desperately wants to obtain a refill so not to lose his lethal abilities. <br/><br/>Bored yet?  I felt the same way watching. <br/><br/>He teams up with a reluctant biologist (Rachel Wiesz) who helped engineer and administrate the ""Outcome"" agents and program who is also marked for ""cleansing"" as the rest of her team is massacred in a workplace shooting that was frankly, extremely uncomfortable to watch in light of the recent real-life mass murders in Colorado and Wisconsin. <br/><br/>What made the first Bourne film so captivating was the intriguing plot that accompanied Bourne's amnesia laced with the action sequences that showcased his innate abilities to assess a situation and appropriately and effortlessly kick ass. <br/><br/>And that's precisely where the Bourne Legacy fails. The plot is nothing more than boring and the action scenes not only pale on comparison to and in intensity to Bourne's, Bond's and Hawke's(of Mission: Impossible) they happen so late in the film that they hardly matter since you have literally already seen all of them in the film's trailers. <br/><br/>Ironically the tagline to this installment is  ""There was never just one."" There probably should've been."

In interviews of Jeremy Renner, he explained what Gilroy got him to do in the frigid environment. It sealed it for me; anyone willing to go that extra mile for a part (probably risking life) deserved to have his performance viewed. Granted, Damon IS Bourne; but Renner does not play Bourne, he plays Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>It's obvious Tony Gilroy knows his favourite character and does superb work with action movies. I suspect there will be yet another sequel, Lustbader wrote several, and if the ratings are still good, I'll go see it.

I actually don't understand the clandestine government organizations that spend millions on these superhuman agents and then pull the plug in the slightest danger and try to kill them all. I mean, relocating them or even giving them other assignments would be enough but noo they have to send men after them in order to keep it all a secret. I first thought Jeremy Renner(who I doubted would be a good addition to the action genre, and now he kind of makes me take my word back)would be replacing Matt Damon. But then I found out that this is more of a side story and actually liked the plot. The movie starts out slow but then after the first half exponentially picks up the pace and ends with a great chase sequence in Manila. Rachel weisz is impressive as the lab geek, and Edward Norton is well cast as the ruthless investigator. I also hoped Stacy Keach would have more screen time but it was apparently cut down due to the films long running time.(a little more than 2 hrs)The duo of Renner and Weisz does not have the same electricity between them but they still act well and the action shots, most of them looks like they were done in one take, are very good. And the final, rather mysterious super agent antagonist was very well cast. The only thing I did not like was the action takes soo long to pick up but I guess it was necessary to see what has become after Bourne raised a sh.t storm among the government organizations.

","Unlike some, I do really enjoyed this Renner/Bourne flic!<br/><br/>There are few flaws in this movie, and on the whole it is a delightful romp!<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz as the heroine, Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, the main character, and Edward Norton as the opposition, is a powerful mix.<br/><br/>Really nice movie for us who love action movies. Enjoyed every minute of it, from the very first scene, to the last!<br/><br/>Amazing action by Rachel, and as good by Jeremy, and the wolves are not bad either!<br/><br/>A fresh approach to action movies, drastically different from the previous Bourne flics, but they are too favourites of mine!"
"carmimol","10","20","35","23 August 2012"," Damon Looked like a Teenager While Jenner Really Delivered
","I love Jeremy Renner, his physicality, his intensity. He should have been the first Jason Bourne in the first place, because Matt Damon looked so young it was not believable. But Renner as an agent and looking 30 years old and above is more believable. Unlike Damon, Jenner did most of his stunts. Jenner is physically more believable than Damon. Jenner in his age looks more like an agent than teenager-looking Damon. Damon initially just got the part because of his name. But Jenner should have been the first Bourne.<br/><br/>The only reason some of the posts put Jenner down is because they only got used to Damon as being Bourne (just by association) but that does not mean Jenner was not right for the part. If Jenner had been discovered earlier, Damon would and should not have gotten the part.<br/><br/>I loved the action scenes. I loved the wrestle with the wolves. I loved the gritty background of Manila where most of the fight scenes occurred. I loved the fight scene in a very very narrow alleyway in the streets of Manila. Jenner did this stunt all by himself as opposed to Damon (a scene in Morocco where Damon was supposed to jump from the roof into a window, Damon had a stunt double, he did not do it himself). I loved the hand to hand combat, I loved the motorcycle chase. I loved the part were Jenner saved Weisz in her home, with his hand to hand combat and intelligence. I loved the part that Jenner was initially introduced as not being very smart before entering the program. That seems more believable to me than Damon being very intelligent and off the charts supposedly."

","At the end of the third movie in the Jason Bourne trilogy, the whole Treadstone/Blackbriar organisation was crumbling around the ears of those behind it (or so we thought). While this was happening, it turns out that various other programmes were under way. One of these involves an operative called Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who finds himself caught in the knee-jerk reaction to close down all programmes and get rid of those involved in them. He narrowly survives an attempt to kill him, as does one of his doctors, Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) and, together, they go on the run in pursuit of his much needed medication.<br/><br/>This movie has come in for some criticism, but I was quite happy with it for the most part. Cross has an inherent weakness compared to Bourne: it was reasonable to take Bourne as someone who had attained his abilities through training and conditioning, whereas Cross takes tablets which give him superpowers. The medication also put him in a Flowers For Algernon position whereby he will regress to musclebound idiot if he doesn't maintain his regime, but this potentially strong plot element isn't really concentrated on.<br/><br/>Having said that, the narrative powers along well enough, the action sequences are all well staged, Renner impresses, Weisz snivels adequately, and there are enough unanswered questions left to fuel a sequel."
"antoniotierno","Null","14","23","10 September 2012"," A bit cliché but packed with great action
","First film without Matt Damon and the Jason Bourne character. The movie turned out well and this is thanks to co-writer and director Tony Gilroy (who worked on all three previous films in the series) and Jeremy Renner, perfectly cast in the lead. The results are not flawless but good enough to provide the sort of action and storytelling that Bourne fans expect. Jeremy Renner has earned his way to this high-profile part, doing a great job since his performance in The Hurt Locker. He has the required physicality to make his character — a highly-trained, genetically enhanced undercover agent — totally believable. Furthermore he's perfectly matched with leading lady Rachel Weisz, also credible as a research doctor becoming a pawn and bail at the same time. On balance and on the whole the movie works, though a bit to long. To sum up I was entertained and I'm more than grateful for that."

","I had real doubts about the making of a Bourne film without Matt Damon , & worried seriously that the trilogy that I loved so much (miles better than Bond) would be tarnished. Then I saw the cast the trailers & read some early reviews so thought hang on this might not be as bad as I thought. My wife who hasn't seen any of the previous three went with me to a free screening & obviously didn't understand many of the references to Jason Bourne or the links to previous films , but stuck with it anyway. The cast gave it a reasonable go on what was at best an average script that was like a recycled version of the previous films. It was very muddled at the beginning hoping around trying to establish a plot. The action felt rehashed for example the big chase in Manila at the end of the film has been done before & much better as in the Moscow chase in the Bourne supremacy. The same applies for the assassin sent to kill Cross , done better in all the previous films. It is hopefully time to close the Bourne franchise unless Matt can be talked out for one last go. Jeremy Renner & Rachel Weisz gave it their best but this ain't no legacy , & whilst not a bad movie its not in the same league as the previous three."

","The Bourne Legacy in no way resembles the book. That probably doesn't matter because the Bourne films and the books have been diverging for years.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's Jason Bourne isn't the lead. That's no spoiler..anyone who has seen posters or trailers knows that. Jeremy Renner ( Hurt Locker, the Town) is the new hero Aaron Cross. Renner is a good actor and he quickly eclipses all memories of Bourne and makes the role his own.<br/><br/>Rachel Weiosz is the female lead and its the first time that the hero in this series has had a female co-star who makes an impression and has a fan base of her own. Both actors are excellent. The relationship between them works on many levels and Rachel's character is an important element of the story. Bourne's female leads were either an encumberance to him to be cast aside ( Marie) or a tacked on love interest to provide a trailer moment (Stiles).<br/><br/>The action is handled better, not that its better staged - the action in this series has always been first rate- but now that Greengrass has gone its less frenetic in its editing so you can see what is going on.<br/><br/>All the cast are convincing and the good news is that a sequel has already been greenlit so we'll see these characters again."

"alex-xela-alex","1","37","74","10 August 2012"," Laughably Terrible: Easily the most Boring and Intensely Stupid Action Film since Total Recall
","Either I'm insane, or I saw a different movie from the one that so many reviewers seem to like, especially on IMDb. This was easily the most boring and intensely stupid action film I've seen since Total Recall a week before. <br/><br/>Take every spy film cliché you can think of, take every absurdly terrible and confusing action scene you can picture, and combine it with an awkward and hilariously poorly-thought-out sci- fi twist about pills and drugs, and 'viralling-off' the pills Aaron need to take. <br/><br/>Seriously, the best shot of the film due to its incredible comedic value, was probably the one where the top secret agency guys figure out what the main characters are doing in Manila. The stereotypical nerd looks shocked and says, ""The stem cells..."" his eyes widening in disbelief, turning to his buddy who says, ""They're going to try and viral him off!"" Dun dun dun! Viral ... him ... off. Oookay. Did I mention that at the beginning of EVERY scene they find it necessary to include a hugely intense bass-heavy musical score, and usually a long distance tracking-over-the-city shot? Every scene.<br/><br/>The plot is about as interesting as a dead cat on the street. A dead cat that was run over and then beaten to pulp by a tyrannical three-year-old with a baseball bat. The big bad bosses -- who are actually trying to save the USA and their own asses -- in their top secret rooms decide to shut down the program. They kill everyone, particularly brutal in the only scene that made me feel anything other than amusement: the cold-blooded lab murder scene which is particularly disturbing because it's so heavy and out of place in such a silly, light-hearted film. And then Aaron survives the program-wide killings, as does the Doc. And then they find him chemicals/viral him off in Manila with the help of the hot Doc. The End. For real. That's it. The only thing that consoled me in the terrible trail-off cliff-hanger ending was that the film was FINALLY over. Because despite the awful, short plot they find it necessary to drag every scene out, including a god-awfully long scene in the hot Doc's big house. The bad- guys had machine guns, for Christ's sake. Why the hell would they need to search the house for her handgun, and then try and wrestle her down before killing her? Just f***ing shoot her once you've found out that she didn't tell anybody, for the love of God! I could be a better hit-squad. By myself. With a normal pistol.<br/><br/>And again, despite the relative simplicity of the plot at its core, the script tries to cover it up with layer after layer of complex and intense scenes, which makes it seem a whole lot more complicated than it really is. It doesn't change anything, it makes it worse. Oh, and suddenly at the end some Thai guy out of nowhere, who's actually also a super agent without all the bad stuff like empathy removed, decides to join in the fray. As if they threw it in afterward just to give Aaron a tangible antagonist that he could shoot. I think the Thai agent says about 0 words, and has the personality of a stick or rock with a painted face on.<br/><br/>A lot of people have spoken about how the actor for the two lead characters salvaged the film. Sure, they're fine actors. They don't salvage the film. They just make their own intensity seem clichéd and cheesy. Their characters are about as transparent as an exceedingly clean window, so that doesn't help them.<br/><br/>And the action scenes. Fair enough, there's some decent martial arts and all that stuff with the drones, blah blah. The scene in the house was OK. What really angered me, what made me dizzy with annoyance and frustration that the film was still happening, was the terribly filmed action scenes with the vehicles. I'm young, and my eyes are OK. I think I might be slightly mentally retarded though, because I can't follow the fast-paced action scenes in Manila for my life. They gave a two-year old who could just about walk, an HD camera on the end of a piece of string, and told him to waddle around swinging the camera. That's what the filming is like. I'm surprised I didn't see a toothless mouth try and eat the lens. All that movement, all that action, it's supposed to make you feel intensely INTO the film, like you're part of the action. It makes me feel like I have no idea what is going on and I'm not supposed to, because the action scene is excessively long and has no point, and the film-makers are just trying to cover it up with terrible shots. Yes, some scenes were intelligible, probably (I switched off after a while so I can't be sure).<br/><br/>Oh, and in the End, like I said, they get away just fine and dandy. The End. See you next time in part 5 of whatever we can milk out of you suckers next."

"toqtaqiya2","6","12","20","19 September 2012"," A worthy addition to the franchise. It's worth seeing for the performances by the two leads.
","The Bourne Legacy is a competent action thriller which adds to the trilogy of films made famous by Matt Damon. Obviously Damon isn't in this film so instead Jeremy Renner plays the part of Aaron Cross, a member of an American black ops program. Renner is very good here, and he manages to make Cross into an appealing character. Not only does Renner add a human touch but he is also physically fit so he did most of the stunts himself. Rachel Weisz, as Dr. Marta Shearing, was paired with him for most of the film. Her work is important for Cross. Oscar-winner Weisz was quickly cast for the role of Shearing, and like Renner she's very good here. She's believable as someone who's been thrown into a difficult situation. Edward Norton is another famous name in the cast. He plays Eric Byer, the antagonist of the film and Cross's former boss. The acting in The Bourne Legacy is certainly worthy of praise, especially the performances by Renner and Weisz. What harms the film, however, is the direction by Tony Gilroy. This is a bit strange because Gilroy is an excellent director. His filmography includes Michael Clayton (2007) and State Of Play (2009). He was also the writer for the previous Bourne films. His direction for this film is assured though he didn't do a good job with the action pieces. Most of the action is definitely exciting, but a few scenes were clearly not edited well. Still, the story is interesting. Gilroy is clearly aware of how things are really done in intelligence and the military. While faulty The Bourne Legacy is a film worth seeing. In some aspects I enjoyed it even more than the previous Bourne films."

","I have found the movie a bit slow compared to the previous trilogy and it seemed to me that there is like 30 min lacking as no action to punish the program's directors has been taken. Some parts of the movie are very slow and does not fit well with the constant action that we have grown accustomed to when Greengrass was at the helm. I think the producers should have in mind when tackling Bourne's movies that it is directly competing with James Bond, hence a bit more work is required. The fighting scenes are really good although the villain's character is rather unimpressive save for his motorbike riding skills. Jeremy Rinner is an excellent replacement for Matt Damon.<br/><br/>One excellent thing about the movie is that it deals with mind control and various experiments that may (or may have not) been taken at various intelligence agencies about this. I think it deals with that subject in a better way than the Manchurian candidate."

He's also less wooden in his interactions with other people.<br/><br/>OK so the opening scenes are slow and there is too much exposition and dialogue. When things get going however the pace never lets up. <br/><br/>Things brighten considerably when Rachel comes onto the scene. She looks better than she did in the Mummy years ago and is a fantastic actress.<br/><br/>The scene in the lab is suspenseful and horrifying in its echoes of recent real life tragedies. By the time Rachel and Jeremy team up in a scene that sees Cross dispatch four heavily armed assassins you'll be thinking Matt who?<br/><br/>From there the suspense never lets up with the two on the run across continents culminating in a fantastic prolonged chase in Manila.

"jamesharris0","10","19","36","10 September 2012"," possibly the best of the bourne movies
","The Bourne legacy introduces audiences to a new hero Aaron Cross, played by jeremy Renner from MI4. Cross is not simply a Bourne substitute but an intriguing character in his own right. Like Bourne we first see him floating apparently lifeless in a body of water, but as the film progresses we see Cross' story and personality diverge from Bourne's.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz ( still scrumptious at 40+) is the leading lady. Weisz's character is a Doctor and is ironically more like Marie (the female lead in Ludlum's novels) than the Marie who appeared on screen in The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>The beginning is a bit convoluted but it sets up the background that will hopefully be delivered in further sequels. Once the action starts it grips like a vice and the tension is aided by the fact that , unlike z-list garbage like the expendables 2, Cross' opponents are intelligent, capable and motivated. This creates a sense of threat and the audience can readily believe that the heroes might lose or be killed.<br/><br/>The confrontation in Marta's house is worthy of Hitchcock. Further tension and excitement follows in a globe trotting adventure that climaxes with a breathtaking motorcycle chase that tore my nerves to shreds.<br/><br/>Renner and Weisz are excellent in their roles. There is not one weak performance in the film. Do yourself a favour and see this on the big screen."

"TheUnknown837-1","7","10","17","17 August 2012"," Mr. Renner can carve yet another notch into his chain of triumphs propelling him toward well-deserved stardom
","Half of the fiscal successes of The Bourne Legacy unquestionably will stem from the second word of its title. The other half—and the chief reason why I question why the filmmakers didn't save some licensing fees by having this be a stand-alone story—comes from the levelheaded casting of up-and-coming action star Jeremy Renner. Mr. Renner is one of the most promising and consistently pleasing of modern-day movie stars: kept in shape, is distinguished physically from other actors, and, most importantly, can act. He is very good here, too, in this spin-off from the three very entertaining Jason Bourne thrillers starring Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Mr. Damon is nowhere to be seen in this fourth film—the only exceptions being a head-and-shoulders photograph of him that appears on some government files and on a news broadcast just once in the picture. At the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, he swam off somewhere in waters of New York, destination unknown. The Bourne Legacy builds its premise from a question I asked many times during the last three Bourne movies: are there any others? ""Others"" being CIA-trained agents turning against the governments that trained them. Mr. Renner is one of those ""others,"" who spends the first third of the picture performing feats that would make the guys from Survivor Man and Man vs. Wild seem tame. From out of this prologue grows a rather tricky and convoluted—to a fault—narrative involving a murder/suicide, a doctor (Rachel Weisz) pursued by government agents, and a lot of talk about viruses and chemicals.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I could pass the Plot Elements Test. Yes, the movie's narrative is too complicated, and some key scenes hustled through too quickly, for me to pass it off as a piece of surefire storytelling. When it was all over, I was not quite sure about just what all that talk about acids and chemicals really meant and how it was truly integral to the plot. I know it had something to do with human experiments and such, and that's about it. But I hardly care, as the movie is too insistently gripping to deny.<br/><br/>Director Tony Gilroy, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother, Dan, is not quite on the same action-directing level as people such as, say, Walter Hill or Paul Greengrass, who directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. He's getting there. Considering as he's only directed three movies to date—and he's already showing great promise—this is easily overlookable. There are numerous action pieces in The Bourne Legacy; the early ones are a little sketchy; the later ones are borderline-brilliant. I would have been happier to see him film the fistfights with more elongated shots where you could see a little more than just a fist ramming into somebody's nose or a leg hooking around a torso before quickly cutting to something that looks almost identical. However, when filming a gunfight or a motorcycle chase through a Philippine city—when he does set his camera more than two feet from the sets and stunt doubles—Mr. Gilroy's instincts come into terrific effect. He's also got a great sense of how his camera should move during such sequences. One of the highlights is watching Mr. Renner (or Mr. Renner's stunt double) scale up the side of a building, follow him through an upper-story roof, into a hallway, and then shoot down a villain. It's the sort of shot Stanley Kubrick might have done had he been more of an action-director.<br/><br/>I've already complimented Mr. Renner. There are a number of worthy people who make small, but regrettably forgettable appearances between the action sets. People such as Scott Glenn, Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, Oscar Isaac, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Albert Finney. Then again, the two stars are Mr. Renner and Rachel Weisz, who as we would expect, plays first his hostage then his love interest. Despite the fact that they have little to do other than bicker, run through hallways, shout, and then ogle at each other with lovesick eyes, Mr. Renner and Miss Weisz do have some subtly pleasing chemistry. I also appreciate that Miss Weisz was allowed to spend most of the movie without wearing any makeup, as I seriously doubt a woman running for her life would really find it necessary to stop and put her face on between assassination attempts. Usually in a role like this, the leading lady has little function other than to look pretty. Miss Weisz is allowed to be an actress, not mere eye candy.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne is not going anywhere. Beforehand, I was a little questionable regarding the studio to produce more films in the absence of Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass, and Doug Liman. The Bourne Legacy lays my doubts to rest. And Mr. Renner can carve yet another notch into his chain of triumphs propelling him toward well-deserved stardom. This is an actor who deserves such a title. And I look forward to Tony Gilroy's future films."
"arunashamal","1","25","51","16 August 2012"," Anything but a Bourne film
","Everything that was right with the first three films is absent from this film. All 3 films starts with a mystery and then begins this fast action cat and mouse chase city by city all over Europe and ends with Jason Bourne bringing the fight back into the enemy's doorstep. That is the pretty much tried and tested formula all original trilogy went by. Now compare it with the story line of this film.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy has a slow boring start to the film which tries to explain everything from the beginning and anyone in the Audience can guess what is the next step is. There is no mystery, no plot twists just a boring story line and two actors who try to make that work.<br/><br/>As for the actors I got nothing towards Jeremy Renner's acting but we fall in love with Matt Damon because he looks like this short guy you will see everyday on your way to work who has amazing ability to use whatever there was in his arms reach to his advantage. With Renner I feel like they were trying to make him this superhero guy who is special than the rest of us.<br/><br/>anyway. All I have to say is that it is apparent this film is made for love of milking the success of first films but not to make a great trilogy even better. Action is dull and boring, No mystery, No plot twists and finally no win for the good guy. This sucks"
"thesar-2","2","25","51","11 August 2012"," The Boring Legacy
","There should have only been one.<br/><br/>By the time the overlong 135 minute The Bourne Legacy realizes that it's an unwelcomed addition to the best trilogy in the history of cinema, it completes its minuscule 20 minutes of uninspired action roughly 2 minutes before the credits roll. If, in lieu of action, they wanted this as a ""thinking person's"" thriller, they also failed on that, as this was one of the most basic films, spy or not, I've seen in quite awhile.<br/><br/>Sowhat are we left with? Great performances? No. Plot twists? Nada. Surprises? Nope. Decent cinematography? Okay, it gets that for its hour-long stroll through the snowy Alaskan territory. In addition, I will say, after several mediocre Edward Norton performances, he stepped it up this time.<br/><br/>Sadly, I cannot say the same for one of my favorite actors and the person that was supposed to carry this feature: Jeremy Renner. I've been a fan of his for a decade now and he always seems to be getting better and improving himself and the roles he takes on. Well, no one's perfect and he took a giant leap back here. Mercifully, as the movie closed – and the end was welcomed, by the way, he did step up his game, but only so slightly. Overall, Renner's Aaron Cross wasn't just the faux pas Bourne-spy; his role was literally an idiot that appeared more lucky at times than actually trained.<br/><br/>The 3-minute-plot boils down to the final days of the true Bourne legacy when the big bad government is permanently shutting down all the programs surrounding the super-spies. On the target screen is semi-spy Cross and he nearly escapes assassination only to be worried about his drug addiction. (Don't ask; I've already gone too far...) He does team up with another nearly assassinated doctor of the program and together they're somewhat tracked with ten times less the suspense and awesomeness found in the original Bourne trilogy.<br/><br/>It thoroughly goes without typing that this chapter was as needed as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was. But, that's the bottom line fact. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is 100% unnecessary and felt like one very, VERY long deleted scene from the original films. Hell, even the action and fighting were so amateurish that it's an insult to stamp Bourne's name on this and not just name it Cross.<br/><br/>They should have; you will feel cross when you leave the cinema."
"elmeeksio","7","9","15","18 December 2012"," A good addition to the franchise
","There was never just one. With the Bourne movies now reaching the fourth adventure in the franchise, it would be easy to say it may be getting stale, however. Hold that thought. This is the fourth story to hit the big screen based on the novels of the late Robert Ludlum, and the first without former A-lister lead Matt Damon as the spy turned fugitive Jason Bourne. The Bourne Legacy plays alongside the events of The Bourne Ultimatum but follows another agent who is also on the run after the government decide to shut down and 'contain' the Treadstone programme. While Bourne is in my opinion Matt Damon's best role to date, Jeremy Renner gives a decent performance as Aaron Cross, another agent in the program, Cross is different to Bourne in that he is very much still part of the team when it goes sour, and is taken back when he is suddenly being hunted by his own people. <br/><br/>After a failed assassination attempt on his life Cross realises that he is being hunted down, and his attempts to find out why lead him to Rachel Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing whom works for the pharmaceutical company that supply Aarons meds. This is where there is a major difference in this story to previous Bourne films.. Aaron is the subject of military science viral treatments that boost both physical and mental health, making him a 'Super Soldier' (apologies for the blatant Capt. America reference) So when he suddenly becomes the enemy of the state going on the run seems the only option, but without the pills he has been taking to keep himself stimulated, he faces the threat of loosing all his new found intellect and strength, cue Weisz's character helping Aaron throughout the film. <br/><br/>With Tony Gilroy at the helm of this chapter, there is certainly no mistaking that this is a film from the 'Bourne' universe. The Bourne Legacy is in my opinion well worthy of this, it didn't exactly make me forget the previous films star but it didn't make me wish he was there either. Renner more than holds his own and the character of Cross as well as Ed Nortons turn as the 'Villianous' Head of the program, this film also at times really pushes it's PG-13 rating in terms of action. <br/><br/>Gilroy's ""Legacy"" is a little long, with a few of the scenes maybe better off seen on the Blu-ray extras. There is a good mix of both intense action sequences and the scenes in the offices showcasing the bureaucracy behind the program. When the action comes, it is thick and fast with some great stunt sequences that we have come to expect from these films. The Motorbike chase through Manila was my highlight. Renner does a good job proving he can be a leading man in an action film, and not to give anything away but I have a feeling we could see another film in this franchise with him at the helm, and I for one don't think that's a bad thing at all."

","If any movie deserves a Medal of Valor or an ""A"" for Effort this year I doubt there'll be a movie any more deserving than this one.<br/><br/>TBL is a really cool movie that is a lot of fun to watch, really well acted & directed. The script is convoluted but so what? It's not like the other ""Bourne"" films were lessons in straight ahead plotting & that is part of their appeal. You must pay attention to them.<br/><br/>Renner is an excellent choice to carry the ""Bourne"" DNA. In this movie the best plot twist is that he does it & very well. Rachell Weisz is the other best addition to the ""Bourne"" mythos. She is a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>The set pieces are waaay better than I thought they'd be. The sci-fi element is totally plausible & welcome.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, Paul Greengrass & Matt Damon raised the bar so high in the 2 prior Bourne movies you had to know that it couldn't be beat. It isn't here & not due to lack of effort.<br/><br/>There are nuances that Damon brought to character --a certain wistfulness, melancholy, doomed acceptance-- that Renner got better at capturing as this movie went on. This is Renner's best role since ""The Town"" & he makes a lot of it.<br/><br/>I guess the thing I miss most about this version of the legacy is what drives a lot of people nuts about director Paul Greengrass. I love his style of directing. His unfairly maligned visceral style really keeps me on the edge of my seat & joyfully off-balance. That jittery feeling is mostly lacking here & ergo about half of the adrenaline rush --but miraculously only half.<br/><br/>If you can separate TBL from the other ""Bournes"" then this is a movie that rates higher than the 7 stars I give it."

","We're on vacation. School has started so we flipped a coin: Expendables II or Bourne Legacy. We wanted action. We got it.<br/><br/>Legacy has a very thick, foggy start. You can't really tell whats coming until it's almost in your face. You got pills that seem really important. You got someone that seems to be running from something in a heavily snowed in mountain range. You meet people you have never seen before that have no history. In light of that, it's best to watch without weighing in on how it fits into the Bourne series. But slowly daylight grows and the plot becomes clear: Treadstone has mutated into splinter factions and the technology is still growing. <br/><br/>In many ways similar to Ridley Scotts last adventure Prometheus, we find ourselves in a alternate time line where one story overlaps another. With a few well place cameo's the director (Tony Gilroy who penned the previous Bourne blockbusters) runs a parallel story about chemically altered soldiers and their fate when Tredstone is under the magnifying glass. There are many elaborate action sequences, and the editing should cause ones nervous systems to collapse and convulse. Granted, the supersoldiers are enhanced to limit pain receptors, but nothing should outrun death so many times in such a short time frame. <br/><br/>Paul Greengrass would have been proud of the editor,but thankfully we did not have to endure the shaky cam. I would go as far as to say it was a good popcorn movie, however the popcorn sold at this venue was stale with the texture of styrofoam. My verdict is that it is a weak story with competitive action sequences. I would also say a bit overwhelming for kids under the age of 10, but seeing we saw this on the first day of school we did not have to contend with this. Theater was up to snuff: the digital media for both audio and sound were excellent - which always adds to an experience. -B"

In this case, though 'that' is more than shady government organizations tracking and spying on people by quickly gathering a parsing audio / video / photographic data.

I liked the acting in it and the cinematography was much better then the ""Hand Held video cam"" style of the Ultimatum.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass hit the nail on the head when he said that a fourth Bourne movie should be called ""The Bourne Redundancy"". Honestly, I know I could write a better story line for a Bourne squeal. One that at least adds some redeeming value to the Bourne story and that does not leave you feeling like you just watched a spy version of Alice versus the Evil Umbrella Corporation in Resident Evil.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this movie beats the same dead horse of a story line that died in The Bourne Supremacy and it starts more story lines then it ends. It was just made to lead in to a sequel. Unfortunately, I don't think it will do well enough to justify making a sequel and we will be left forever wondering how the story ends."

","Not having watched the Bourne franchise, I thought this would be awesome! Yeah, it was good. The first trailer for this movie looked so crappy, but when the second trailer came out, I started to get excited.<br/><br/>The script/Character Development: The characters were so interesting, that when you needed to get emotional you got emotional. Even though the dialogue was overloaded, way overloaded, I found myself starting to lag off this movie a little more. Don't get me wrong, it was written to perfection, but it was really overloading. Rachel Weisz character was probably the most fantastic female character in a film this year (except for Meridah in Brave, her terrific hair :P). She introduced her character very well. Some characters didn't need to be there, when you see the movie, you will notice it as well.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting was superb, Rachel Weisz was most enjoyable on screen. She had something that Jeremy Renner couldn't bring to the screen, and that made the acting of the movie complete. <br/><br/>Direction: Some scenes were sometimes scattered, but they picked up in the end.<br/><br/>More problems: NO CLIMAX! This movie had no solution what so ever which, in my opinion, makes the movie not needed and not really enjoyable material, especially if you pay $12-$13 for a movie ticket. With no climax, the movie really has no ending, and that is very shameful. I even stayed for the credits to see if something would pick up.<br/><br/>Overall: The movie was good, not perfect.

Renner is fabulous as the second generation super spy. My only real complaint about this installment (because it does feel like they are blatantly building for three more films) is that the resolution has no real teeth.

Renner and Cross give exceptional performances and support from Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The writer and director Tony Gilroy does a fantastically assured job, ratcheting up the tension to almost unbearable levels in places.

","Granted this is coming from someone who has never read the Bourne novels at all, but nothing about this movie screams ""Bourne"" to me.<br/><br/>I saw the trailers (just about all of them), I thought maybe it will be OK, I was hesitant because I did not recognise most of the actors in the cast from the previous films. Off to the movies I go, and well, I was looking for the remote with the fast forward button the entire way through.<br/><br/>You have to commend Jeremy Renner, Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz for what they were able to pull off with this film script. But for me the film did not have more than 1 out of 5 elements that I feel makes a Bourne film.<br/><br/>-Barely a mention of Bourne; -The government always seemed to have the upper hand in the hunt for the ""agent"" (less than 2 minutes of dialogue to catch up a 17 hour head start by these ""super agents""); -The agent never once (in the Australian version) made the government officials look like fools by casually letting them know he is watching them while they are scratching their heads trying to find him (despite what the trailer had in it). In the second Bourne film that happened twice; In the 3rd film, he broke in to their HQ while they were out trying to catch him; -The is an agent, running away from the corrupted government entity;<br/><br/>I get that they have to add something to make the everyday normal agents come up to that of the Bourne Character from previous films (in this case the medication), but in this film not even the title of the makes any sense.<br/><br/>For me the word ""legacy"" means to hand down or pass on your knowledge so that a new character can continue your work, which in this story would be to continue to take down the corrupted government entities that keep springing up.<br/><br/>The the previous films Bourne seriously wounded several normal agents but never killed them, he even came up against an agent in the first film that said the following line ""see what they make you give"", Bourne also said this line to another agent that was trying to take him out i believe in the 3rd film. Any one of those characters could have been brought back in combination with Bourne teaching them how to be as good as he is and it would have been a Legacy.

"petra_ste","6","2","2","26 August 2015"," Pill-popping Bourne
","Doe-eyed Rachel Weisz has the rare talent of playing potentially annoying characters - here ""damsel in distress"" meets ""naive scientist who ignores what her works are used for"" - and yet making them sensible and sympathetic. And yeah, I like Jeremy Renner too, although obviously in a more platonic way, with his quiet intensity which never turns into obnoxious macho posturing. Add to them Ed Norton as the antagonist coldly barking orders to a room full of technicians and you have a solid cast.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, both direction and writing fall short compared to the Matt Damon trilogy - and before someone says they don't need to be compared, let me remind this was titled The BOURNE Legacy.<br/><br/>Set-pieces are competent, nothing more. There is a rooftop chase, inferior to the one in Ultimatum, and a high-speed chase, inferior to the one in Supremacy. The movie clocks in at an acceptable 135 minutes, but feels longer - and *is* in fact longer than the three Jason Bourne movies, which were tight and breezy.<br/><br/>The script has issues, which is surprising as Gilroy is one of the finest writers of action/thrillers working today. Again, comparisons with the original trilogy are problematic. A mystery man who is found floating in the sea with a bullet wound and displays unexpected combat skills is more compelling than a super soldier popping pills to get stronger and smarter. An amnesiac spy struggling to unravel his past and achieve revenge against the agency which trained him is more interesting than a rogue agent infiltrating a factory... with the help of a scientist who does have access to that factory. <br/><br/>In the first trilogy scale and scope were larger, stakes higher. Norton's antagonist gets no closure, which is just weak (and his previous connection with protagonist Aaron Cross feels pointless); the other bad guy is the series' typical unshaven hit-man who gets killed in a flurry of blows before he can utter a single line. <br/><br/>Still, this is per se an entirely watchable spy flick. Maybe they should just have titled it Crossing Aaron.<br/><br/>6/10"

Playing the inquisitive, intelligent, humble, fight as a last resort, kill who you only need to kill kinda guy. Taking the meaning ""stay small"" very seriously. Some people might say the action from the earlier movies isn't there, in a way I agree. What was lost to the first Bourne movies is gained back in believable acting.

","'THE BOURNE LEGACY': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' meets 'THE BOURNE IDENTITY'; this spin-off of the Bourne franchise finds a new star, Jeremy Renner, taking over for Matt Damon as a new character with his own story in the Bourne universe. Like the other films it's loosely based on Robert Ludlum's books and takes one book's name only (while creating it's own entirely new premise, just like the other films in the series). This one tells the story of Aaron Cross, a member of a black ops program where soldiers are given pills to enhance their physical and mental abilities. They're all assigned to be terminated due to the actions of Jason Bourne in the previous films. This installment was directed by Tony Gilroy, who co-wrote all of the previous Bourne films as well as this one (with his brother Dan Gilroy). The movie co-stars former Bourne actors Joan Allen, Albert Finney, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn as well as newcomers Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. The movie is a little more dumbed down than the other installments but it's still packed with breathtaking action scenes and moves at a breakneck pace.<br/><br/>Renner is Aaron Cross, a former U.S. soldier of below average intelligence who's had his physical and brain powers enhanced through a black ops program called Operation Outcome. In the operation he is known as 'Number Five' and is addicted to green pills which make him stronger and blue pills which make him smarter. If he stops taking the pills he loses all his special powers and possibly something worse. When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, seen only in pictures) starts causing havoc and leaking government information CIA operative Eric Byer (Norton) decides to have the operation terminated and all the operatives killed. Cross escapes death and leads the CIA to believe he's dead. He then makes his way to the home of one of the Doctors in the program, Marta Shearing (Weisz), in order to get more pills. Shearing is wanted dead too so the two go on the run together. They're soon hunted down though by another government super soldier Larx-03 (Louis Ozawa Changchien), who was trained to be a relentless killing machine.<br/><br/>The film is very similar in style and mood to the other Bourne films (with a little bit of 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' thrown in as well, like I said). It is involving despite it's somewhat cartoonish premise and the two lead characters are likable despite their limited character development. Weisz and Norton are both on their A game like always and Renner proves he can be a dependable action star. It would be nice to see another film or two with him in the lead (hopefully with a smarter script) and a later pairing of him and Damon would be awesome. Overall the movie works, not quite as good as the other three films but about what you'd expect from the fourth film in a series like this and a reboot to boot.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","14","27","10 August 2012"," A stepping stone to the future of the 'Bourne' franchise
","After ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" became the most successful and critically praised film of a trilogy considered the consummate modern spy series, it was only a matter of time before the saga continued. With that film's director, Paul Greengrass, interested in pursuing other projects, and star Matt Damon uninterested in returning without Greengrass, Universal has been forced to expand the ""Bourne"" universe, and the result is ""The Bourne Legacy.""<br/><br/>For those up in arms over the continuing of the franchise without Damon front and center, fast-rising action star Jeremy Renner assumes the new face of of the series without skipping a beat as Aaron Cross, the product of another CIA program offshoot of Treadstone called Outcome. Backed by the talents of Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton — and co-written and directed by longtime series scribe Tony Gilroy — ""The Bourne Legacy"" keeps tonally with the original trilogy and generates the same degree of respect.<br/><br/>In terms of the ""Bourne"" consistency, ""Legacy"" maintains the back-and-forth structure of the skilled spy on the loose vs. the CIA division trying to track him down. The film takes place at the same time as ""Ultimatum."" When Jason Bourne becomes a media story as seen in that film, the CIA senses a public relations nightmare is about to unfold, and Norton's Eric Byer — the man behind most of the agency's black ops programs — has to clean up the mess.<br/><br/>Byer finds damning evidence connecting Blackbriar to Outcome, a program involving nine agents who have received physical and mental genetic enhancements and assist in top-secret military reconnaissance. Given the Bourne fiasco, he determines the best way to save the body is amputate the limb, and Cross and all ""participants"" in the Outcome program are targeted.<br/><br/>Given the advanced science involved in Outcome, the CIA employed a top-flight science facility to regularly check in with those agents and test new genetic drugs. Weisz's Dr. Marta Shearing soon finds her life in jeopardy and her name in the headlines, and after Cross survives an attempt to wipe him off the map, he connects with her and the two go on the run.<br/><br/>This story really opens the door up to the potential of the series going forward. At one point we learn just how many secret black ops programs the CIA has commissioned, which will surely capture the imagination of series fans who have steeped themselves in the world of ""Bourne.""<br/><br/>As its own film, however, ""Legacy"" is missing some key pieces. Especially at the beginning, Gilroy focuses extensively on connecting the original trilogy to this new part of the ""Bourne"" universe. One of his and Universal's primary concerns appears to be providing just cause for continuing the franchise rather than delivering a complete spy action/thriller. Even the opening shot of ""Legacy"" directly mirrors the closing shot of ""Ultimatum.""<br/><br/>Mostly, it's the conclusion that doesn't do the build-up justice. The script appropriately takes its time with the construction of Cross and Marta and clearly sets up their motivations, except that they are motivations out of necessity rather than desire, which ultimately takes a toll on the emotional payoff. ""Legacy"" just doesn't arrive anywhere, content instead to be the start of something new.<br/><br/>Sticking to the series formula gives ""Legacy"" a certain level of comfort. There's no lack of ""Bourne""-patented clever solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems, exotic locales or impressive enemy takedowns. If anything, it's a little too reliant on what worked in the past, unwilling to take big risks and consequently unable to strike any new notes.<br/><br/>More exposition also means less time for action. The trailer spoils most of the best action moments in the film, and in general ""Legacy"" doesn't aspire to reach the bar set by previous entries. Gilroy proves an adequate director in this regard, possessing Greengrass' eye for frenetic action but without the same degree of editing prowess.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Legacy"" amounts to a stepping stone to what can be for this franchise rather than exploding out of the gate as the start of something special. As has been the case with the filmmaking choices in key reboots this year, namely ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" there has been a willingness to make sacrifices in the first ""new"" entry so that future installments can run off the leash. In theory, Aaron Cross isn't tied to anything. He could even team up with Jason Bourne in the future and take it once more to Langley's doorstep.<br/><br/>There's legitimate promise in the future of all things ""Bourne,"" so at the worst, ""Legacy"" comes out as one of the lesser entries of an otherwise exceptional series. There are much, much uglier blemishes on the records of Hollywood's biggest and best franchises. If anything, ""Legacy"" should end up a tiny, even glamorous scar in the service of something great.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"

","I'm surprised there is a lot of praise for the lead actor here Jeremy Renner. Just like The Avengers, he is transparent and is barely seen - even in a movie where he is the lead actor. Matt Damon he ain't. <br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy fits more into the 007 mold. Gone is the raw fighting, the battered body and the chemistry between protagonist and whomever is doing the chasing. <br/><br/>This film has Renner performing acrobatics a la James Bond making it just another Hollywood action sequence. Even then, the action scenes are a mish mash of close ups and shaky camera movements that make viewing tedious.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne never did any acrobatics. He fought like a trained assassin and drove a little car like a man desperate to escape. This is what this film is missing. The desperation. If there is desperation to reach the goal, its certainly not shown. <br/><br/>This begs the question - Why on earth people think Renner did a good job here I cannot fathom. From his over exaggeration when frustrated, to when he awakes by jumping into the air, he reminds me of Nicholas Cage at his over acting worst. Renner is horribly miscast and lacks any screen presence. There was never any realistic drawn out bone crunching one on one fights Jason Bourne endured. Renner actually looks like he is ball room dancing when he fights. He does a twist or flashes his hands up in the air at the end of each battle. I actually found myself wanting to go back to the Edward Norton scenes. But even he was boring. <br/><br/>The bike scene was so ridiculous and it's nothing we haven't seen a thousand times. Renner even puts his Tom Cruise Ray Bans on for added coolness and Rachel Weisz looks idiotic dangling off the bike during the chase. <br/><br/>The Asian assailant has a brief introduction by way of coming off a plane, chases Renner, then dies. Not to mention the fact he can find Renner after losing him on a motorbike in Manila streets!<br/><br/>Then the movie....ends. <br/><br/>Yeah Renner is no Bourne, he's got this misplaced egotism I can't stand. And this is no Bourne movie."

Obviously there were others agents or assets in the CIA and their stories might echo or entwine or be influenced by Jason Bourne's. <br/><br/>Having got this out of the way The Bourne Legacy was rather enjoyable.<br/><br/>Jeremy Rener is a good replacement for Matt Damon and he does the required heroics ,stunts and romancing in fine style.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy once again writes and makes a good directing debut.

","I like all of the Bourne movies but this is my favourite. I'm not saying it is the best but it is the one I like the most. I think the lack of shaky-cam has a lot to do with it. Greengrass films are good but the inability to focus on what's relevant takes away from the enjoyment of the films. That is why Doug Liman's film, The Bourne Identity, is my favourite and The Bourne Legacy is my second favourite. There's not much between the two. I much prefer the characters of Aaron and Martha to those of Jason and Marie and the relationship between them is much better realised. Legacy is the start of a new character's journey and there are enough elements to produce fascinating sequels.<br/><br/>I hope Gilroy returns as director. 8.5/10"

"griffolyon12","9","9","16","17 December 2012"," A Marvelous Action/Thriller
","Before seeing The Bourne Legacy, I had never before seen any of the previous Bourne films, but upon seeing this spin-off, I am definitely willing to give them a shot.<br/><br/>In the film, actor Jeremy Renner portrays Aaron Cross, a government agent who has enhanced brain functioning and physical attributes thanks to an experimental drug program, funded by the government. When a fellow agent named Jason Bourne (who is never actually in the film), threatens to expose a similar government operation, the government shuts down Aaron's division and kill all agents, save for Aaron, who goes on the run, purely looking to survive.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is a taut cat-and-mouse thriller, with some of the finest stunts work you'll see in a film this year, with majority of the action sequences created in camera. Jeremy Renner once more proves he is a more than capable action movie star after his brilliant turns in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Avengers, this time proving he can carry a film all on his own, and he really should be doing more things like this, because he could be the next great action movie box office draw. Not to mention, the film just has more brains than almost any other action flick out there. You have to constantly be thinking to keep up with Tony Gilroy's script, that never spells anything out for you. You have to piece everything together on your own, but by doing so, you feel as if you're participating in the game of cat-and-mouse, constantly keeping you on your toes and anticipating what's next. The only flaw is the film is slow to start. It takes nearly thirty minutes for the film to really kick into high gear and draw you in, but once you are hooked, you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>I give The Bourne Legacy a 9 out of 10!"

The fabulous actor, Albert Finney, had the smallest cameo imaginable, and expected the film would make more of his presence. The same could be said about Joan Allen, who is also an exceptional actress, but hardly present. <br/><br/>The ending was perfect and definitely hinted at sequels where I hope supporting cast will have the chance to shine. <br/><br/>We loved Matt Damon in the previous ""Bournes"", but think Jeremy Runner was his equal!"

","I will try and keep this fairly short, but the main thing is i think the film is good... At over 2 hours it is longer than the previous films yet is required as it ties in the previous films, jason bourne, treadstone etc... I admit i went into this not expecting much without Damon being there but i can't say i really missed him. The film would work without the Bourne name with a few adjustments yet still considered to be good. What really makes this film work is Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz who perform brilliantly, and whilst it has the usual amount of action and god scenery it seems to work, in a way it feels similar to the bourne Identity in that it is a good film yet it sets up films to come; and this is where i think the film really succeeds as it makes a pathway to future bourne films (there are around 6 more books as far as i am aware)... I wouldn't be surprised of the next film had both Renner and Damon in it as they team up as that would sell a lot. I do hope they don't just switch back to Damon if he comes back and forget about him as he is a great addition to the films. Because of this the ending was the weakest part of it though being that this isn't the ""end"" then it is fair enough... We will see in a few years how they follow it on and in many ways that could determine the success of this movie..."
"Generalle_della_Rovere","6","17","35","9 August 2012"," The Bigger Picture
","Four years after the release of the original trilogy, the Bourne franchise paves its way to the silver screen once again. Admittedly, I too as with most fans was unsure whether the film would be able to stand up to its predecessors but indeed, it was a very immediate and immature response.  The opening shot made it seem that it would start where 'The Bourne Ultimatum' left of, a brilliant trick to say the least. The setting of the film is actually in coherence to that of the previous film, it actually used some of its segments to displace the time of the events occurring in 'Legacy'. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, did what he does best, as we can remember him from his most recent movie 'Mission: Impossible' as a more lively and dynamic counterpart for Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Renner was flawless in his character proving the original assumptions as whether he could pull it off completely wrong. Rachel Wiesz and Edward Norton with a piece of the whole film dedicated to them and the structuring of their characters were as crucial and pivotal to the development of the entire narrative.<br/><br/>The film stays true to its roots as to its narrative structure, the government, the lead female character, and the car chase scene, in this case, a motorbike race in the busy, crowded streets of Manila. Robert Elswit made the most out of the film to showcase the intensity of the story with the wonderful cinematography, living in Manila myself, I could only imagine the work and imagination it took for him and the whole crew to device the film's trademark chase scene. Kudos as well to Tony Gilroy, for not succumbing to the generic-one way story films these days rely on.<br/><br/>'The Bourne Legacy' is not as character driven as the previous trilogy rather, it mainly dedicates itself to the completion and delivery of the whole concept of the Bourne franchise. The issue regarding the fact that there were too many characters, too many actors to focus on is essential in building the while story. In the end, as it delivers  the bittersweet closure for the original trilogy, it opens up a new and fresh chapter for itself."
"estebangonzalez10","8","8","14","15 October 2012"," An entertaining spin-off/sequel although unnecessary film
","¨Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg. ¨ It's been five years since the third film of the Bourne franchise came out, now Tony Gilroy has been given the responsibility to direct The Bourne Legacy, a film that works as both sort of a spin-off and sequel to the Paul Greengrass franchise. As opposed to the other films this one does not star Matt Damon and wasn't adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel either. It just takes some aspects of the previous films and expands it by introducing a new corporation and new characters. Jason Bourne is only named in this film and the events occur at the same time as the events from The Bourne Ultimatum are taking place. I wasn't too sure about what to expect from this film since Matt Damon was the true star of the franchise, but I knew Jeremy Renner was a great actor. Matt Damon's career changed completely with this franchise, and he has made a name for himself now in Hollywood. Renner has also been on a hot streak ever since The Hurt Locker starring in some great films like The Town, Mission Impossible, and The Avengers so I did think he would be able to pull it off. My main concern had to do with the new director, Tony Gilroy, who I knew was very familiar with the franchise since he adapted the screenplay from the previous films, but wasn't sure he could pull off a spin off like this without the main star. Many people hated this film and I understand them, but I enjoyed this spy thriller quite a bit. Gilroy had already proved to be a good director when he was nominated for his work in Michael Clayton. This film may lack some of the great action editing scenes from its predecessor, but it was still a very well made action thriller.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before the story expands from the Jason Bourne universe and this film takes place at a parallel time while the events from The Bourne Ultimatum are taking place since Jason Bourne is referenced throughout the movie as he begins to expose Treadstone. What we learn from The Bourne Legacy is that Treadstone isn't the only secret ops agency and that there are many more. One of those ops is Outcome, where some subjects are given medication to enhance their abilities. When Treadstone is exposed, the rest of the agencies decide it is in their best interest to sweep things under the rug and therefore begin killing off all their agents. One of the agents from Outcome, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) manages to survive and begins looking for answers as to why his former bosses want him dead. Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) on the other hand is trying to control this crisis situation by eliminating anyone who is familiar with the Outcome program. He is one of the top men from the intelligence community that is after Aaron. Aaron, who is dependant of the special medication in order to survive, enlists the help of one of the doctor's that has managed to escape from Outcome. Marta (Rachel Weisz) convinces Aaron that she can help him get off the special medication, but they will have to travel to Manila. The only problem is that the intelligence community will do whatever is necessary to eliminate them before they can get too far.<br/><br/>I don't think The Bourne Legacy is as good as its predecessors, but it isn't a bad film either. There are a lot of new characters introduced at the beginning of the film and if you are not familiar with the original trilogy then you might get a bit lost since they kind of take a while to introduce the new premise. The film also seems to be building up to another sequel where we might have Jason Bourne introduced back to the equation, but the film does also work on its own. It's hard to avoid comparisons since both films take place in the same universe, but I do believe it does a good enough job to stand up a little below the previous films. I honestly had a very fun time with the film and enjoyed the Renner/Weisz duo. The story also takes place in different parts of the globe kind of like in the same way the other films did. The action scenes were entertaining so I do believe this was a worthy film and wasn't a disgrace to the original trilogy like many upset fans are saying it was. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I can understand how some people may be upset, but I did have a fun time with this film and enjoyed it so I'm giving it a thumbs up.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

I had never heard of jeremy Renner until recently and he has impressed me greatly this year.<br/><br/>rachel Weisz is still beautiful and gives a great performance as marta.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the performances is one of the strengths of The Bourne legacy but there are no weak elements.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy adds great depth to Robert Ludlum's concept with the addition of Aaron Cross and his network of agents. There is a slow beginning to the film as Gilroy ( who directs as well as scripts this time out) adds details that will resonate in sequels.<br/><br/>There are impressive action sequences throughout the film but they are more effective than most action movies as they combine suspense and action. You really feel that things could end badly for the characters that you identify with. Gilroy is a master of twisting the knife as far as suspense goes. The shootout in marta's house is heart stopping and the final chase is unbelievable.

The only downside to it is that it really is nothing all that different from the other movies in the series. For fans of the series who are afraid to see this because of Damon not being in it don't worry, this is a worthy addition to the series.

Makes me wonder who's giving this poor effort all those stars. I like Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, but there is virtually nothing to like about this film. The writing is poor -- if it's fair to describe a film with no story as one with poor writing -- and the directing is halfhearted.

The winter wilderness scenes were shot in a truly beautiful location and the clever ways the agent manages to save himself from his superbly outfitted attackers were appealing. At first I was confused as to what was happening but that just made me more attentive to a story which seems rather fresher than most to me. After awhile i grasped enough of the story to follow it. There was nice chemistry between the male and female leads. The stunts and action shots were wild! I played the motorcycle crashing into the post 3 times. The idea of the government keeping control of their operatives through drugs, disinformation, isolation and cheating sounds pretty much like what i have read is really going on in that world. The villains were as cold, ruthless and calculating as the impersonal agency they are supposed to represent. Mostly i enjoyed the hero's skill at outwitting an entire government terrorist operation and saving the fair damsel in distress. I also liked her coming into her own as a fighter and her saving him a few times. Soundtrack is good. I will be watching this again to catch what i missed.

These days there's so many bad movies made by teams that had everything to make a great one...<br/><br/>Some say it had no beginning or ending. Since its a follow up of the other trilogy they skipped a lot thinking people would have seen the others.

"jamesmartin944","7","7","12","4 December 2012"," Good stand alone movie but a bit pointless
","I get the feeling that the creators of the first Bourne movie had to work really hard to get the franchise off the ground - creating a script, using Robert Ludlum's books as source material, and pitching a synopsis to the necessary evil that is the film studio in order to obtain a budget that was just enough to complete the project. It was probably all very exciting and all those involved would have had a lot to lose if the film didn't work. The drive an ambition to make the best film they possibly could would have been present throughout the whole team, I would imagine, and this is where film making comes from a really good place - making a good film first, that will at least pay for itself, then making a profit second.<br/><br/>After the success of Bourne Identity the studio had every right to take the momentum and finish adapting the remaining books into movies. I had never read the books so wasn't really paying much attention when watching the opening of Identity - it was just another rental. I was made to sit forward and take notice though when Matt Damon's character Jason Bourne quickly disarmed two police officers leaving them unconscious without knowing how or why he had done it. These brilliantly choreographed fight scenes continued throughout as the plot unfolded and the memories of his past gradually came back to him. I couldn't wait for the next movie and was far from disappointed as yet more of his past was explained and the action became more intense in Supremacy. Ultimatum finished the franchise off nicely with Paul Greengrass' direction of the sequels creating a whole new darker and realistic edge to the mainstream action movie with its documentary style camera work and an ""in the action"" feel to the fight and chase scenes. James Bond take note.<br/><br/>So job well done. You have an ex CIA assassin on the run with memory loss (Jason Bourne) and fantastic intensity in the operations rooms, headed up by the amazing Pamela Landy played by Joan Allen, as government agents track Bourne using satellite technology with a view to taking him out. They send ""assets"" out after him, who have been through a similar behavioural modification program as Bourne, with a view to putting him in a body bag by sundown. This now becomes a winning formula.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy picks up this mantle and runs with it very well. Although we don't see Jason Bourne, he is mentioned throughout and it is obvious this story runs along the same time line as Ultimatum. Jeremy Renner plays Aarron Cross - an ""outcome"" agent, similar to Bourne's ""Treadstone"" program, who seems fine with being an assassin until his program is shut down and the government decide to kill off the evidence. His escaping these attempts on his life is essentially the plot with added science fiction in the form of genetic modification through medication. His reliance on this medication leads him to Racheal Weisz's character who works in the development lab for said medication. She goes on the run with him, creating a love interest,while helping him to source more meds so he doesn't have a really bad come down and / or become incapable of defending himself.<br/><br/>Fight scenes are good but not quite as slick as in the original trilogy. It is nicely shot. He fights wolves like Liam Neeson and the original Moby soundtrack kicks in at the right moments.<br/><br/>Basically a good movie but is more a money making exercise with very credible actors, like Renner and Ed Norton, thrown in to try and hide the fact."
"richy1024","6","7","12","27 September 2012"," Ravishing Renner runs the show, but does he do too much running? Wander what Matt Damon would think?
","Ten years on from Jason Bourne's lucrative appearance on the big screen starring Matt Damon, the biological experiment's ""legacy"" lives on through the pursuit of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner). Renner spends his time chasing multiple colours of pills for revival and survival whilst effectively being hunted by the organisation that implanted his enhancements into him. Although Renner has become a convincing protagonist since his major onset in Hurt Locker, regrettably the Bourne franchise will not be acquainted from the actions of Aaron Cross. The criterion of Bourne has formerly been set. It's a paradigm that audiences therefore only relate to Damon's unique, unparalleled and instrumental trilogy, energising and pulsating us with what is seen as the contender to James Bond (debatably, the ordeal that influenced 007's modification).<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy's extension to the original trilogy is impressive, but way off the pace. Gilroy's (a writer on the previous three Damon projects) intelligence of scientific jargon and terminology in the screenplay is quite remarkable, leaving us flabbergasted, having to refer to GCSE science in remembrance of how to use a test-tube. The camera works tirelessly to keep up with the action with an impressive chase sequence in the slums and a heart-stopping shoot-out in a highly secured laboratory. But, unsurprisingly when re-awakening the beast, Renner's character suffers from following in the footsteps of the already acclaimed Bourne. A feat, unquestionably too difficult to emulate. Cross' flashbacks reveal torment and struggle but rarely fulfil those experienced by the original agony felt by Bourne. Bourne had a sense of purpose, to discover and to reveal the darkness behind those who implanted him with a chip in his carcass and crimson palms. Bourne felt pure agony, denial, languishing from post to post; Cross enters a game of cat and mouse with the odd reflection on his past that seems a little less persuasive in conjunction to Damon's finest outings. Although there is some coherence between the original franchise and Gilroy's attempt at following on from the Bourne legacy, the movies' action sequences seem to overemphasise the 21st century's love for fast shoes and blazing bullets instead of concentrating on the foundation that was created by the novel Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum.<br/><br/>The film's course runs with smooth adequacy with small bullets of action fulfilling Gilroy's extremely tense motive with this outing. The relationship between Renner and Rachel Weisz is particularly eye catching with plenty of emotion and intelligence, accompanied with complete understanding of each others needs and responsibilities, after a fragment of wobbling never mind. Visually Gilroy's emulation is spot on with high flying activities, but undoubtedly Cross needs to be given purpose if he is to follow in the footsteps of his counterpart."
"Thomas-Giffin","7","7","12","28 August 2012"," Better than I expected
","In steps Tony Gilroy as director (screenwriter of the first three Bourne films) and now certified action star Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross in a film that has been pretty critically pounded (55% RT) but I actually thought was alright. I certainly didn't regret watching it at all, I found it intense and enjoyable although without the coherence and emotional draw of the previous Bourne films.<br/><br/>The main things I took away from this film is that there is potential for further films after Jason Bourne himself. I was concerned that without the central character, the movie would fail in every respect but actually having the film deal with the aftermath of Jason Bourne's actions in the previous three films is a pretty smart move. It allows the series to continue but following a different character, in this case augmented super agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner).<br/><br/>Another thing I took away from this film, The Avengers and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is that Jeremy Renner is a damn good action star. Especially for a 41 year old, he is every bit as likable as Matt Damon was and equally capable of kicking butt. The only reason Aaron Cross is not as well fleshed out as Jason Bourne is that the script and plot of the previous three films were superior.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit strange, the first part of the film is fairly heavy exposition. Characters from previous films are dragged out and new ones are introduced and things move at a breakneck pace. Ironically, at this stage, Aaron Cross is in one place doing very little for a long time. Some people have said that the film is slow and it doesn't leap straight into action but then none of the Bourne films have started fast, they set up the plot and then the pace speeds up and up. This film is no different.<br/><br/>However, the plot actually ends up pretty muddled and as the stakes get raised, your emotional investment doesn't increase as much so towards the end of the film, the film behaves like the events on screen are more important than they actually are. An example of this is another agent who we are told is utterly amazing and better than Aaron Cross, they have one chase scene as that's it. We are told how important this rival agent is and yet you don't feel that way. The best sequence of the film is actually pretty much halfway through the film, when Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz's Dr. Shearling join forces in a fantastically thrilling scene in a house. It is an action film in full gear and no other sequence in the film is as thrilling, intelligent and realistic as this one. <br/><br/>The film is also gritty as anything. One scene is particular is incredibly intense. It doesn't pull any punches and whilst it isn't that explicitly violent, the aggression of the scene is surprising.<br/><br/>So the credits rolled and I was happy. Happy because I'd seen a reasonable good action film that had its flaws but felt like a Bourne film."

Yes, he's survived, but his main concern is to retrieve more chems so that he can maintain his enhanced condition. No programme, no chems. So he finds Dr Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) to assist him with this. Will they succeed? <br/><br/>This film is enjoyable enough. It's similar to the other movies in this genre.<br/><br/>To me Jeremy Renner is an exciting actor. He specialises in tough.

We don't get spies and spy agencies anymore. Every spy is a super spy. Every agency is armed to the teeth with mind-blowing technology. The Bourne movies, the new Bond movies, Safe House and so on -- they're all like this now.<br/><br/>I suppose I've reached the point where I no longer enjoy movies that are based primarily on shootouts and chases, technology and superheroes.<br/><br/>In the movies in this new genre the security agency involved has incredible technology allowing them to visually track pretty well anything in the world. They can find any information they need in seconds. They have instant access to data bases you didn't even know existed. <br/><br/>They can do anything really. Instantly accessible CCTV, the internet, facial recognition software, and telephone tapping all play a huge role in these movies. These agencies now have miraculous, almost godlike powers.<br/><br/>There are always flunkies sitting at screens and then an intense man or hard-nosed woman standing around shouting orders at everyone. Put me though to Langley! (In this movie this role is played by Ed Norton.)<br/><br/>These agencies seem to have endless cash and will not hesitate for a second to do anything. Fly a team to Zurich! Deploy the jets to Zambia! Send out the drones!<br/><br/>To buy into these movies, you have to believe governments are routinely bamboozling the media and the politicians and spending hordes of cash on secret programmes. It's all a little too paranoid for me.<br/><br/>Moreover, in these movies the agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors -- and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee, although you never see them spending hours in training. They can fly airplanes, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives and computers, and knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts and computers to an unearthly level, but they're also sort of invulnerable. They're superheros really. (In this movie, at least they try to explain it.)<br/><br/>And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. In a spy agency you can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems. <br/><br/>Usually someone is on the run.<br/><br/>These films are a combination of the ""Spy"" and ""Superhero"" or ""Martial Arts"" genre, but with ""Science Fiction"" technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the ""Mystery"" genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them ""Action"" films. And of course they're shot in ""Exotic Locations"".<br/><br/>I know it's corny but I refer to these movies as ""MASSFLAMES"" movies (based on the acronyms for the genres listed above.)<br/><br/>All these movies seem the same to me, including this one. However, it's pretty good and if you like this kind of film I'm sure you'll love this one."

","I commend the whole of this installment of the Bourne series having good storyline, good computer generated effects, and good cinematography.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, as the main character of the story, portrayed his role well and is simply amazing. He did a very great job, and I consider the scene from Manila the best. The sound mixing and the cinematography was quite good to raise the tension on the part of the audience. Also, the scenes were good enough to balance the action-packed and the non-static part.<br/><br/>I also have appreciated the mixing of 26 tracks which are listed that covered a total of almost 64 minutes. It has contributed a lot in making the action scenes more intense and flabbergasting.<br/><br/>However, I believe the storyline was not that substantial. They focused more of the screen portrayals, visual effects, and camera tricks rather than focusing on the most important part of a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I like the total package, but wasn't sufficient enough."

After the bloated Dark Night, and the slightly less bloated Total Recall I expected to be checking my watch 90 minutes in as I did with those offerings, but when Bourne 4 ended I felt disappointed that it was ending. It is very fast moving, the action is excellent, the script is a brave attempt to weave the previous films into a new take on the series and I didn't find it poor, clichéd or in any way offensive. <br/><br/>The acting was very good except for one scene where Rachel Weiz went distractingly over the top but she was otherwise so good that that was easily forgiven.<br/><br/>What's wrong with the movie?

The slow spots had plenty of tension, there are plenty of twists in the plot line (maybe a bit too much at times), but once the pedal hit the metal, you're in for a great ride. Great editing during the chase scenes. It's tough to replace Matt Damon, but Jeremy Renner does a good job, along with a surprisingly fine acting performance by Rachel Weisz.

"comu-ercan","7","6","10","25 December 2012"," what is a fantastic film*
","The Bourne Legacy is an action film with a difference of a normal single fault, which has three great action film, part of a series from the fact that the signature. The audience from time to time with unnecessary dialogs occasionally suffocates the movie manages to experience the exciting times. However, the rest of the series as the affectation of his own films, this fourth ring, Greengrass and Damon would be lying if I said I did not call Damon. Matt pair candlesticks, action fiction, everything was superb, but at least a few on the stage Bourne could see. Film to considering separately not bad, but using the name of the bourne so I tried to make a premium compared. Bourne them hit the bottom of the trilogy, as well as the action is also a fantastic part of the screenplay and acting only a certain portion of the film and gave most of the action sequences in the first three films. I've seen it say it's not a search of dejavu but different players really watched. Beautiful, bored in a movie that will be followed. End of film is a little more fuller, but still not bad."
"XweAponX","10","6","10","10 December 2012"," Absolute Madness
","I expected this newest entry into the Bourne story to be a total redundancy, instead I received a kick in the rear end, to my most happy surprise.<br/><br/>As this runs concurrently with some of the events in Bourne Ultimatum which in turn ran concurrently with certain events in Supremacy, we have an overlapping story. I credit Tony Gilroy with keeping a level of continuity, despite several years of Technical progress. The time frame is kept by not showing currently used Smart Phones and Computers, so if this film is in the same time frame as Supremacy and Ultimatum, we can believe it.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing is not as cute as a button as she was in ""The Mummy,"" she is a mature woman now, but still very acceptable, In fact I did not immediately recognize her. She's just a geneticist, working in a lab at work she likes to do. She does not know the extent of the work. When she gets into the story with ""Aaron"" she is confused, and does not understand the stakes. Not at all like Franka Potente, who was living on the edge before meeting Jason Bourne, Marta is just a scientist, but leave it to Renner to give her a crash course in evading bullets, on the fly WHILE evading bullets.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner comes in to this film as a mountain man, a veritable ""Liver Eatin' Johnson,"" and we see right away he has extraordinary ability. The first shot of the film mirrors the last shot of Jason Bourne getting away in Ultimatum. In fact, the theme of Water that is all through these films is clearly kept.<br/><br/>This is a new world of secrecy, where people can be made a target just by speaking one word or having knowledge of a particular sort. This is a world where even the agents involved do not speak to each other, are not supposed to know each other, and Jeremy's character is simply identified as ""Number 5.""<br/><br/>At a glance, Mr. Renner does not look like the kind of gentleman who is in the secret agent business, he appears to be more interested in eating Livers from ""Crow Injuns"" (Apologies for using the word) like Robert Redford in ""Jeremiah Johnson."" But after a failed attempt at blowing him up using smart drones, he makes an immediate appearance change as he steals a random airplane and flies away.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Rachel Weisz is almost killed by the great character actor Zeljko Ivanek (""In Bruges"" and two ""X-Files"" among other appearances) when he goes mad by touching some blue muck in test tubes before offing himself. Rachel goes home and is apparently interviewed by FBI agents who are not what they appear to be - They are there to shut her up.<br/><br/>We don't have to know how Jeremy/Aaron Cross finds her, but he gets there just in time to prevent her assassination by these ghouls, after he offs them, he burns her house to the ground and they run away. Tony Gilroy depends on our knowledge of the previous films so that we don't really have to see how he tracks Rachel down, we know he can do it, and he does it.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Treadstone and Black-Briar were just small tips of the iceberg as far as CIA Black Ops are concerned, and Edward Norton as retired USAF Col Byer is shutting the USAF's agency down, which is called ""Outcome"" (I thought it was ""Alt-Com"") with Donna Murphy (Spider-man 3) in tow.<br/><br/>This movie is a feast of great character actors, but what makes this film stand out are some chase scenes that are so over the top of the previous Bourne films that those cannot even compare.<br/><br/>The complaint of this film is that the story seems to not make sense, but as I see it, it is not a finished story; I believe Tony Gilroy is expecting to make more of these, which he should, as we can see now that the story can be continued even without Matt Damon. So there is not really any resolution of the story. Basically it is ""The Birth of a Super Soldier"" - a New guy with even more ability than Jason Bourne, and a nemesis (Louis Ozawa Changchien as ""LARX #3"") who can just get up after being shot. Also, I read that this film depended on some ""drug addiction"" idea, but in fact it was not really drugs at all. but some complicated sounding genetics and virology, explained by Weisz. It sounded technical enough to be viable, and just enough of an issue to move the story along. The only suffrage is the ""run-out-of-time"" ending.<br/><br/>This film is way over the top. But Tony Gilroy actually did a great job Directing and Writing this chapter, and the cinematography is very good. If there is a sequel to this, I would be happy to see it."

"Staffenburgen","7","6","10","30 August 2012"," Underwhelming But Entertaining
","After seeing the first preview for this film a few months ago, I was an immediate skeptic. It looked like a carbon-copy of the other three Bourne movies with a different lead actor and updated special effects. Essentially, that is exactly what this film is. <br/><br/>The movie opens by introducing Aaron Cross, who's on some type of mission for a certain ""program"" in the middle of Alaska, miles away from civilization. The film doesn't waste time proving his resourcefulness or physical prowess, since it's basically implied by the title. Just as in the previous Bourne movies, he quickly finds himself on the run from an agency who, for a reason unbeknownst to him, wants him dead. As I said previously, this movie is very similar to the previous three. <br/><br/>Here's the good news. Jeremy Renner is a really good actor. He works magic with little to no help from the script, constantly turning what should've been a bland and uninteresting scene into an exciting and thoughtful one. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive here, demonstrating a side of her that I'd never seen before, which left me pleasantly surprised. Edward Norton does a reasonably good job as the villain behind it all, but his character is really too one-sided to provide him with a chance to shine here, so I'll reserve comment until after the next film(s) which will surely follow. <br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the film far more than I expected to. The story is nothing special, but it does make sense in the universe of Robert Ludlum's novels, the acting is great, and ultimately saves the movie, and the action sequences are very enjoyable and visually entertaining without holding back the storytelling. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not great either, it's just okay. <br/><br/>RATING: 6.5/10"
"stjem05","9","6","10","30 August 2012"," Story was lacking, but actors were great
","I felt bad for Jeremy Renner and Rachael Wiez because they did a great job acting in this movie and I feel they won't get the recognition they deserved because the story was lacking. <br/><br/>Basically, there really wasn't an a strong point to the story. There was nothing that inspired me about this movie. The main character wasn't trying to get back at the organization, or make the world a better place in any way, he was just trying to survive. Same with the girl.<br/><br/>That being said, the acting WAS great. The main actors had great chemistry and Jeremy Renner was gorgeous as usual. I really felt a connection to them and found myself on the edge of my seat (rare for me) rooting for them. <br/><br/>I watched it twice in the theatures (one of them was free for me) and I will probably watch it again when it comes out on blue ray just because I love the characters."
"GaneshCR","7","6","10","29 August 2012"," A rather weak spin-off but strong performances manage to keep this afloat
","The story concerns an agent after the massive fallout created by Jason Bourne's revelations. It has an impressive cast who are quite convincing in their respective roles.<br/><br/>The story, even though related to the trilogy, did not have the strength and the thrilling pace that made the series so popular. The trilogy had Jason Bourne fight his way throughout the world and at the same time come to terms with his own muddled past. There was also a fitting end to his story but the new one turned out to be a bit predictable. I did however feel that the story was faithful to Robert Ludlum's style.<br/><br/>It does benefit from very strong performances by the lead stars. Jeremy Renner is very convincing and looks very impressive in the action sequences, as does Rachel Weisz. The movie also benefits from the camera-work, compared to the shaky camera in the Greengrass movies.<br/><br/>I would say 7/10 for good action scenes and great performances by the leads."

","The Bourne Legacy does what is says on the tin. It is an action movie and nothing more which is fine because as action movies go, The Bourne Legacy is a pretty good one.<br/><br/>It does get off to a bit of a slow start. There is a lot of jumping around and a lot of information the uninitiated Bourne movie goers might not understand. It does eventually settle down and from there it is all action.<br/><br/>The action scenes are exciting and done well, but don't quite pack the punch Haywire (from earlier this year) did.<br/><br/>The acting was also good. Jeremy Renner plays the action hero convincingly and overall his performance is good, but his character is a little bland and lacks charisma. There are a few moments where Renner's acting really shines and you are reminded why he is a two times Oscar nominee.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is great. There is no action for him but his cold and calculating performance works well. It is great to see him back in a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is also good. She plays damsel in distress well but is more than capable of delivering more than this. All in all The Bourne Legacy is a good action movie that is more fun than thoughtful."

"lornloxor","9","5","8","14 August 2013"," Great reboot of the Bourne trilogy
","I don't get the hate this movie is getting, I mean a 6.7? This movie was excellent. It had great pacing, not quite like Bourne Ultimatum but then again that film was going almost non-stop. For me the little over two hour running time went by in an instant. In Legacy there's more time for reflection and developing the characters. Director Tony Gilroy was also responsible for the screenplays of the original Bourne movies so he's been with the film series from the beginning. And it shows. The plot is very plausible, interesting and complicated in a good way. This is a more cerebral action movie than usual so you really have to pay attention as some of the dialogue is very technical. I loved it though. The movie takes place in parallel with Bourne Ultimatum which was a smart idea. I enjoyed the background story and conspiracy angle this movie had, it was very intriguing. It was also nice to see that there were some real limitations on the capabilities of the CIA search team, it made the movie feel very real and grounded.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is charming and menacing as the new Bourne lead Aaron Cross, I really bought him as a professional spy and assassin. Rachel Weisz's character Dr. Marta Shearing was very well done. She acted in a realistic and very human way, being scared and bold when it was necessary. Edward Norton does a solid job as colonel Eric Byer who is tasked with cleaning up the mess Bourne left behind him. Matt Damon is only seen in a photograph but the casting is very strong even without him.<br/><br/>There's fewer action scenes (which are very good yet again) and longer stretches of exposition and talking than in the original trilogy. I appreciated that there wasn't too much shaky cam which is common in these sort of fast paced action films. The visual style felt very clean and effective. I loved how ton of stuff was implied by little actions and mannerisms. For example, when Aaron Cross starts to count down from 100 he does it in Russian which implies that he was meant to be a spy in Russia (he speaks other languages too but that's what he went to as his first choice). There's really a huge amount of tension during the entire film. I especially loved the cabin scene in the beginning and the intense lab scene. The music or lack thereof was also instrumental in building the tension, great job there by James Newton Howard. The ending fitted well with the tone of the movie and hopefully they'll continue making this series.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an excellent espionage thriller with a great plot, smart action and strong performances. You should really give this movie a chance, especially if you're on a Bourne marathon like I was."
"arnieiam","7","5","8","29 August 2012"," If this wasn't in the Bourne universe, then it would be alright
","The previous Bourne films deviate from Ludlum's novels drastically, now there's a film without the franchise character.<br/><br/>Now I think Jeremy Renner is an excellent replacement for Matt Damon (picture the Team America puppet if you will). He's come a long way since SWAT and he's become this token action star. But even he couldn't bring virility to this poorly developed character.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne has become one of cinema's bad asses. He's incredibly skilled, resourceful, crafty and one hell of a hand to hand combatant. But what's really cool about him is how elusive he is and how he taunts the people on his tail.<br/><br/>You don't get that vibe at all with Aaron Cross. And I don't blame Renner at all, I blame the poor scriptwriting. Where in any of the three films did we see Bourne having a dependence on pills? Or unaware that he's been surrounded by local police without someone yelling it at him? And in the film he doesn't even interact with his handler, Ed Norton, apart from a flashback scene.<br/><br/>I knew they wanted not to make a carbon copy of Jason Bourne but Aaron Cross is a Treadstone assassin, you think you would be seeing some strong similarities. What ends up happening the whole time is that you see a cheap knock off of Bourne.<br/><br/>And the main problem is that it had to force in these scenes reminding us it takes place in the Bourne universe. It shows how Treadstone is being uncovered when the plot surrounding Aaron Cross is completely different. Had this Jason Bourne plot line been erased you still would have had a generic albeit good film about an assassin trying to escape certain death because his government program failed. That would've been good.<br/><br/>This movie is enjoyable but not memorable and it should keep Jeremy Renner's career fruitful. It ultimately suffers from the and gives into the pressure of its franchise."

","I write with absolutely no joy to speak of when I post my first review for this site. Title: The Bourne Legacy. Result: heartbreak. And not in the good way. It would be easy to say that action movies aren't really my cup of tea but, seeing as I am an avid fan of the previous Bourne movies, I came into the theatre with anticipation as I realized that Jeremy Renner was, as it turned out, not playing Jason but rather a new character, Aaron Cross. I was intrigued and, foolishly it seemed, hooked. The first thing you need to know about this film is that there is no story of speak of: any hint of a plot had been sufficiently deleted once this script hit the editing room, it appears. What the trailer makes this movie out to be is nothing at all what it managed to deliver: boring, confusing, and stupid doesn't even begin to cover it. I hope my words (though I doubt the director will be reading this) cut the man who thought he could film a chase scene to the bone. Not only does this director (and, I suppose, the writers are to blame as well)accomplish the most dragged out scenes in Hollywood history but also he has gone on the cheap: yes, ladies and gentleman, it seems that other Bourne-related locations (Paris, Berlin, Tangiers, Zurich) have been sacrificed for the wilds of Alaska (oh, wow, groundbreaking) and Manila, the Phillipienes (I mean no disrespect to the natives of the Phillipienes but you do NOT have a Bourne movie in a place nobody has heard of). The movie is about two hours too long and, with the exception of Renner, Norton, and Weisz, I didn't care if their characters lived or died. A sliver of light to this other wise dark review is that Renner's performance pleased me greatly: not only does he have an uncanny resemblance to Matt Damon's Bourne but he projects a personality that makes somewhat sense with his character's trials: instead of Matt Damon's introverted, almost-mute, and angry Jason Bourne, Renner's Aaron Cross was funny, charming,socially easy going and emulated the same physical grace as Jason Bourne. It was only a shame that Renner's talent as an actor is otherwise shadowed by this disgracefully written and cheap attempt at continuing the Bourne trilogy. All I can say is this: Next time, the followup to the Bourne-universe had better knock peoples' socks off because, the way I'm seeing it, this film murdered one of my favourite franchises. And even Jeremy Renner is not enough to make me forgive so easily."

When i finally got the balls to watch it at the very couple scenes i knew this wasn't jason bourne movie because it wasn't trying to tell the same story. People had the issue of comparing this to the trilogy but if you watch not as a part of jasons story but just accept that it's in the same universe. The scripting wasn't too bad and of course the acting was over the top with jeremy renner and rachel weisz. I think this movie was created to answer some questions about the universe and bring in another program and it's participants to explain the programs. The movie also sets us up to the upcoming events. The thing is this movie is so badly criticised but people looked at it with a wrong angle. Overall it serves the purpose of telling a beatiful story, answering some questions about the universe and setting us up for the upcoming events perfectly."

","It might have received some patchy reviews at the time it premiered in the Box Office and Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross might be lacking Matt Damon's Jason Bourne instalment in the series of Bourne trilogy while Bourne scriptwriter Tony Gilroy chooses to carry the can alone, directs in place of Paul Greengrass. Generally, the film plot got off with a suicidal and messy start and was considered to be hard to follow but then things really started to pick up smoothly as Renner delivers an excellent performance as he searches the truth about himself while dodging bullets and explosives from the corrupt organisations he worked for. There are some good levels of action here with stunts and getaway scenes and that's perhaps the good thing I can say about the Bourne trilogy of films."

","What a relief! I mean it's a relief to be free of the whole Matt Damon thing. Jason Bourne was rightly retired for this one. And hopefully, the producers will continue with Aaron Cross for at least another film. He's great in this one. He turns in a great performance in the lead. There wasn't an instant that I thought about the previous lead. Moving onto to the second lead Rachel Weisz. She was fantastic. She was very believable in her role as a research scientist. A scientist who caught up in something she has no comprehension of. And unlike some other films where they try to make the female lead a Ninja. Rachel as Dr. Marta Sheering is beautiful, smart, and while can be rattled. She able to recover and aid Aaron Cross in his effort to save himself, and her. There's lots of action in this tense thriller. It involves an agency that has decided to shut down a program. And the effects of this decision are what this movie's about. There's a lot of talent playing subordinate roles in this film. Which further enhances the enjoy of this film. There's been a lot of discussion of the amount of technical jargon used in this film. Some feel that the story is vague and scattered. For my money I thought this was one of the better action thrillers. And the caliber of acting elevates the story. And gives you characters you really come to care for. And you want to see them safe. There have many big films that don't give you a hero that in the end you really care about. I'm Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz fan from now on. I'll be going back though their work to see what else I've missed. I was surprised. I didn't see this film until three years after it was released. And I loved it."

Renner's character, Aaron Cross, wants to stay alive and tracks down Weisz just to save his own behind. But he doesn't want to just live, he wants to live with all of his enhancements by way of his medications. It's best explained with the backstory of Aaron Cross. Before the super-soldier Outcome program, he had an IQ of like 5 and as a result of the program and the medication he takes, his IQ is significantly better. He runs out of his medication while he's out in the field training and to prevent himself from becoming stupid again, he goes to great lengths to track down more meds. In the process, he saves Weisz' life. The end. Great story... Good action flick for my dad who doesn't really understand complex plot lines and enjoys pure action."

","I feared the worst about this but ended up mildly surprised at just how engrossing it had been. Sure, it's milking the franchise for all it's worth but it does so quite entertainingly - but maybe it was all so empty-headed I can simply empathise better. They're flogging a horse with some life left in it.<br/><br/>Rogue super agent Aaron Cross is a thorn in the side of Uncle Sam only they don't know it for most of the movie; he dodges certain death a few times, causes incessant mayhem and picks up an emotional sympathetic moll in his quest for the McGuffin. There are many complex and unnecessary cul-de-sacs in the plot to fool you but ultimately that's all there is. And along with the photography there are many action scenes that are impressive, but it's mainly the two leads gruff Renner and tearful Weisz who carry the film and contribute the most. Although usually I've got a lot of time for Weisz I was wondering at first if Thunderbirds' Lady Penelope was a more believable and less wooden actress, but she certainly picked it up and by the climax was brilliant. Favourite bits: the pivotal sudden flare-up at Weisz's house and subsequent prolonged bafflement of the security forces; the improbable foot and motorbike chase through the slightly busy streets of Manila.<br/><br/>It's not as good as Matt Damon's previous three outings, but at least it's swift, honest and a fairly enjoyable time-passer. So it's OK, but whether it was worth all the money spent on its making is another matter."

","To be fair, it would take a lot to make a film like any of the films in the original Bourne trilogy. Like most people, I was dismayed when I heard Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon would not be back for the fourth film. But alas, they have found a way to continue the franchise. The fourth movie in the set, The Bourne Legacy happens to be a fair thriller that is better than anyone could hope for. Even though the plot seems murky and the script a little muddled, I'm glad to say that the absence of Matt Damon does not result in any failure.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy replaces Greengrass at the helm and as he worked with the first three films, Gilroy proves to be an apt director. The government is bent on destroying their program and that includes the termination of their agents. Aaron Cross escapes, and with Jason Bourne-like skills, he does all he can to get medication for himself and avoid the authorities.<br/><br/>I think this film works because the acting is very strong. Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon, but he is one of the most capable action stars today and shows off his moves here quite well. Rachel Weisz does a good job as the doctor and has a few pivotal scenes. Edward Norton essentially is the government baddie as he tracks down Cross and does well.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is better than anyone could have hoped for, even with expectations set so high. There are several big action pieces here and some are quite lengthy. I think the best action sequence is at the start of the film with the battle between Cross, the alpha wolf, and the nuke. The cinematography is top-notch and luckily, there does not seem to be much shaky camera. While nowhere as impressive as the original trilogy, this film still packs quite a punch. I rate this film 8/10."

"jeddjong","8","12","26","7 August 2012"," Bourne's Legacy Remains Untarnished
","The last movie that this reviewer saw was the remake of Total Recall, and films like that one would make one think: ""do we really need another Bourne movie – let alone one that doesn't even have Jason Bourne in it?"" Paul Greengrass, director of the later two Bourne films in the original trilogy, jokingly suggested making a fourth one named The Bourne Redundancy, and its star Matt Damon similarly expressed a degree of disdain for a new film. The whole concept of a franchise spin-off does seem to reek of Hollywood cash grab. However, rest assured – Bourne's legacy remains completely untarnished, because, boy, is this a good one.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is, unfortunately, a movie people haven't really been excited about. It's been lost in the shuffle of late-Summer blockbusters, and its premise has been met with indifference. Well, Tony Gilroy and co. have to be given their due. This was intended to be a straight sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum, with Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass set to reprise their roles as star and director respectively, but it eventually fell through. It's safe to say that Gilroy, who co-wrote all three of the Bourne films and who co-wrote this one with his brother Dan, has more than salvaged the situation.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is taut, intelligent, bristling with tension and excitement and is an overall harrowing ride from start to finish. Gilroy finds a near-perfect blend of smarts and action such that one never drowns out the other, and, thankfully, he's less of a shaky-cam proponent than his predecessor Greengrass was. The story is coherent, the characters reasonably well-defined, and just like the first three Bourne films there's always an undercurrent of credibility, and the realism that The Bourne Identity reinvigorated the espionage film genre with is in good form here. While some bits, particularly the ""super-soldier"" angle, are a bit of a stretch, it's never ridiculous and always absorbing. There's a sense of continuity established by the inclusion of some footage from Ultimatum as well as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney reprising their roles in briefer parts, and it's used just enough so the connection doesn't feel contrived.<br/><br/>One of the primary challenges this film faced was making Aaron Cross a well-defined character and distinct enough from Jason Bourne. This challenge is mostly overcome, in that while Cross isn't as complex and intriguing as Bourne, he's still great fun to watch. Jason Bourne was a confused and disoriented man who had to come to terms with his muddled past, make sense of the remarkable skills he possessed and preserve whatever new relationships he formed. Aaron Cross on the other hand knows full well what he's doing, and is a little more idealistic and fresh-faced than Bourne was. With the help of those special pills, he gains incredible physical and mental skills, shuffling between martial artistry, official documents forgery and resourceful Mac-Gyvering with ease. In an early scene, he outfoxes a pack of wolves and bests a military drone sent to kill him at the same time. That's pretty badass. Of course, there's a little of the inner conflict Bourne had so much of, but Renner makes sure to keep the angst perfectly in check.<br/><br/>Dr Marta Shearing, as played by Rachel Weisz, is a lot more than the token action movie chick. It's a clever move to have the female lead be a scientist indirectly involved in the protagonist's predicament, who is as integral to the plot as he is. Sure, Rachel Weisz probably doesn't quite look like a genetic scientist, but she's a lot more believable than the boatload of hotties Hollywood has been trying to pass off as geniuses for years (Denise Richards and Jessica Alba, anyone?) – and a much better actress too. She's the frightened woman jolted out of her everyday existence as much as she is an intelligent and level-headed scientist, and this isn't one of those films with a romantic subplot crowbarred in for no reason.<br/><br/>The antagonists in this film, much as in the first three films, aren't cackling, maniacal megalomaniacs – they're intelligence officers, analysts and bureaucrats acting under orders, efficient, quietly menacing and dangerously amoral, with a frightening wealth of resources at their fingertips. Edward Norton plays the main bad guy – which, for the geeks out there, means Hawkeye is pitted against the (other) Incredible Hulk. He's undoubtedly a brilliant actor, and doesn't let the fact that his character is mostly confined to mission control hinder his performance. For the most part though, he never comes face-to-face with Cross, but he and his team always feel like a menace. It's an exciting game of cat and mouse to watch, with Cross half a step ahead of his pursuers, but never for long.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy pulls through, retaining much of that Bourne spirit yet nary a sense of been-there-done-that or, God forbid, a direct-to-video feel. It turns out to be quite a bit more than a decently-written piece of fan-fiction – it's a clever, high-energy espionage thriller that could have easily felt slapped-together or cheap, but is instead well-conceived, well-crafted and well-acted. We certainly hope Matt Damon will be tempted to return to the series to team up with Renner should a sequel materialise."
"A_Different_Drummer","2","6","11","11 July 2013"," Worst Ending In Recent Film History
","Was there ever a film that promised so much and delivered so little? First, if they are going to put warnings on cigarettes, then this film should come with its own warning, ""Matt Damon pulled a 'Sean Connery' on us, and walked away from one of the most profitable film franchises ever .. so we had to work with what we had. Sorry."" This is merely a courtesy to the audience. And courtesy to the audience is in short supply here. The first hour promises so much. Renner's character, Damon's replacement, is introduced majestically. Literally, majestically. Not an easy feat, that, and critics who felt the entire (!) script was weak missed this. The second Act is a botch -- some sort of weird international medical thriller that seems like it was borrowed from Robin Cook or Michael Crichton. Makes you wonder if you are watching the same film? Did someone switch theatres on you? But the ending, OMIGAWD, the ending, is so off-note that you wonder if film students 100 years from now (when the movie is beamed directly to your cortex, I imagine) will still be writing about it? To salvage what little drama remains in Act II, the script conjures up a bad guy from yet another obscure Black Ops program who SUPPOSEDLY can outperform Renner or Damon (ie, the original Bourne). It is a cheap setup, unworthy of this franchise, but better than a kick in the head with a wooden leg. So how does this confrontation end? A battle of wits? Nope. A brawl, mano a mano? Nope. Riding on his cycle, Renner summarily shoots the new super-villain, and rides off into the sunset with the girl. Not making this up. Wish I was. Not the fault of the Director. The studio exec who signed off on this should be making change at a MacDonalds."
"jéwé","9","6","11","25 January 2013"," This is much better than sour critics say it is.
","A lot has been said about this film not really being part of the Ludlum legacy, not fitting in with the Damon movies and that is was actually made 'just to make money'. It's like 60s fans reactions to Rolling Stones records beyond 1969. And because of all that, and more, people did not like it even without actually watching it. But I did and I'm glad for doing so. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is actually a very good, tight thriller that only loses momentum towards the end. The first gripping and superbly filmed hour rushes by in great action style. Adding touches of previous films is precisely what I would have expected Tony Gilroy to do. I mean, he has never delivered a bad scenario and takes viewers seriously. Leaving the glamor locations from previous outings to instead add Alaska, Maryland and Manila is a nice touch. But it is on that last location that the plot leaves something interesting, something intelligent to be desired. As if Gilroy did not finish the script but just wanted to end with some action scenes. Or the studio did. <br/><br/>All in all, studios always make movies to make money and anybody who has even in this day and age not got a grip on that fact should move to unknown planets. Whether or not a sequel becomes part of a legacy is impossible to say right now. James Bond did a good job at it Jeremy Renner is excellent as our action hero and Edward Norton fits in pretty good even though he hasn't got much to go with. That the film looks much calmer (and maybe therefore somewhat more boring to audiences that can't sit still for two seconds) also has to do with the fact that this Bourne did not get the Greengrass treatment. For pace and editing it would be much more useful to compare this number 4 to the original Damon film. And even then these parts may differ as much as any director likes. <br/><br/>9/10 And if there comes a number 5, I'll watch that one as well."

","Into the fire we go for the series of Robert Ludlum's classic espionage thrillers. This time a new twist to the blackbriar gang, with a man nearly forgotten by his own people until it was time to clean house. Arron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a man on a mission to find out why a remote location he was in was blown to pieces. This leads him on a hunt back to his starting point a doctor (Rachel Weisz) who gave him enhancing drugs which was to be a final stage in the Treadstone era. Simply popping pills was to subdue his body's reactions against himself in order for him to think and act clearly. But in the midst of the tread-stone project, Bourne's legacy of tipping the scales led a man Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) to wipe out all evidence leading back to the project. Now Arron along with Dr. Shearing (Weisz) goes to Manila for her to concoct a special drug so Arron can fully go viral and not have to use the drugs he kept taking. The action was great, along with some seasoned actors one hardly sees anymore. Stacy Keach was a rather bland addition but kept the story interesting. As for Norton, his way of acting truly evil always brings a smile to my face. What was also a good catch was the way a few flashbacks occurred to show what has happened in the last ten years. This leading up to the present where a new hero emerges to bring down the tread-stone project even further. I hope that if they make another movie, this one will have Matt Damon to work with Renner in a co-smash it all extravaganza."

","Jeremy Renner plays a character much needier, in background, than Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Rachel Weiz is an A list actress who has elevated every film I've seen her in. The very believable build-up in the story to the point where she trusts Aaron - really sold the movie as far as I'm concerned. I emphasized with the doctor's terror, and I was soothed and calmed by Aaron Cross's reassuring manner as he converted her from total panic to partnership.<br/><br/>Stacy Keach, Scott Glenn and David Straitharn continue to depict a poison-fanged duo of back-stabbing, high-ranking CIA mavens whose words continually turn into miasma.<br/><br/>Cutting edge medicine meets 21st century Machiavellianism. This is a movie Aldous Huxley would appreciate. I take a gram and only am. Ending is better than mending.<br/><br/>Renner somehow manages to be the six million dollar man, Everyman, and the quintessential underdog simultaneously.<br/><br/>The movie is underscored by a baleful pulsing series of musical bass tones that accentuate the weird perils the doctor and the assassin are pursued by - and others that they thrust themselves into deliberately.<br/><br/>I thought that the LARX scenes were the best in a movie full of excellent set pieces. As expected, Aaron Cross is eventually pursued by a hit man his equal or greater. That was the pattern in the first three Bourne movies. Rachel Weitz's doctor serves as far more of an equal partner in meeting challenges than the feminine leads did in the previous trio of films.<br/><br/>The pacing the movie can and should be improved. Some of the dialog was delivered at such breakneck speed, I wished I had had access to subtitles.<br/><br/>I thought that the scene with Landy should be expanded - but perhaps that is the job of a sequel.<br/><br/>I do plan to watch the movie again - at least once more, preferably, when the DVD becomes available, with subtitles, so I can understand all of the dialog."

"DICK STEEL","10","12","27","9 August 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Bourne Legacy
","Written by the Gilroy brothers Dan and director Tony, with the latter having screenplay responsibilities for the earlier Bourne films as well, they had set up Legacy to tangent off from Ultimatum, with the beginning here taking place some 6 weeks before Ultimatum's, and running in a parallel timeline. The return of characters both major and minor in cameo appearances convince we're still in the same universe, and dealing with similar shady secret operatives who are hell bent at containing the damage that Jason Bourne is out to do through his expose of all the clandestine projects under the CIA. Rather than close the doors revolving round the possibility of Jason Bourne's return, Legacy had set it up so that the next film, if it happens, has more doors opened up for the narrative to move forward.<br/><br/>But for now the first hour can be extremely dry, as we take many steps back to see the earlier stages of the programme that Jason Bourne was put under, with the guinea pigs at various stages of experimentation, who remain dependent on the regular drug doses they have to take to maintain their super soldier abilities with heightened senses and physicality. We get introduced to Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, who's also on the project, and learn of the existence of many others, who are all on the crosshairs of the agencies they serve, in order to kill them off for the longevity of the programmes they are put under. Led by Edward Norton's Retired Col. Eric Byer who's brought in to contain the situation and threat that Jason Bourne is posing, Aaron Cross outwits them through an episode taken a leaf out of Grey, allowing us some man versus drone plane action sequences that set up Cross to be quite a formidable Bourne clone.<br/><br/>The introduction of Rachel Weisz' Dr Marta Shearing was in essence to provide for a Marie type character whom Cross can run around cities with in escape from their hunters, but more importantly to serve as a link to the drug formulation used to turn those in the programme into formidable assassins, being one of many scientists involved in genetic research, which as usual, comes with the deliberate weaponization from new research. To add to the story, how anyone can get to the level of Jason Bourne's expertise is given an explanation here, which is something yet to be explored in detail until now. One thing's for sure, the role is not one that's the typical damsel in distress, although being involved in a deliberate massacre may trigger some negative reactions in light of what had happened in the USA. It's one of the better stand out, though more harrowing scene in the movie, which may undoubtedly strike too close to home for the Americans, and the box office.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner's stock had risen in recent years after The Hurt Locker, with involvement in steady franchises such as Mission: Impossible, and Marvel's comic book films, and whether or not he'll take over Tom Cruise for further M:I adventures remain to be seen. But he's already cementing his role as Aaron Cross, and looks set to take the Bourne movies forward, even if there are rumours of a pairing with Damon for the next film. Renner worked the action sequences with aplomb, whether it calls for fisticuffs, rooftop chases or spectacularly weaving dangerously through Manila's traffic on a motorbike, and is convincing as an ex- army operative turned guinea pig who now has to bite the hand that fed it, constantly on the move in order to stay alive. It's early in his story arc, and it may seem Cross is on the backtrack for the most parts, so it would be interesting if, like Bourne, he's allowed to take the fight back to his hunters.<br/><br/>It took about 60 minutes before The Bourne Legacy exploded into life, and swung into the high gear formula its predecessors have been known for, but without the shaky cam cinematography that alienated and irritated some. Tony Gilroy decided to go for traditional techniques without being too flashy, which served well. Familiar ingredients defining the Bourne movies continue here, with the jet-setting, cat and mouse chases, and battle of wits. Protocol also comes in the form of the hunt being commanded from a control room setting in which Norton's Eric barks orders, and the multitude of ground work and effort going into tracking the needle in the haystack which is Cross and Marta. It's the hunter who becomes the prey, and vice versa reversal of roles, that has Legacy continue the good work set up by the initial trilogy.<br/><br/>If you'd take a step back, The Bourne Legacy had really kept it simple by introducing a slightly different premise than we're already familiar with, which in tongue and cheek fashion, went on to have the patient seek out his doctor for more medication, only to be brought to the factory for the drugs he requires, and an effort made to be weaned off. All these, with their employers hot on their tracks in order to finish them off, and keep their clandestine projects under wraps. It may not be the best film of the franchise given that it's the beginning of another, and had dwelled a little longer to have everything set up, but once it got its act together, the adrenaline never stopped pumping. It's also interesting to note how many variations of Extreme Ways can Moby come up with! Highly recommended!"
"RyanEberhart","10","5","9","11 August 2013"," The Legacy of Bourne Continues... Beautiful!
","Of the four Bourne movies this is my second favorite. Only because it doesn't have Matt Damon or Julia Stiles. However, to make up for it not starring Matt Damon they brought in Jeremy Renner. The director and producers didn't bring Renner in as a replacement of Matt Damon. Matt Damon decided that if Paul Greengrass wasn't the director on this movie that he wouldn't be in it. Tony Gilroy directed Legacy, so the producers were forced to go in a different direction. They did so by bringing in a new character, Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, is similar to Jason Bourne. He is an agent of the CIA, black-ops kind of stuff. However, Aaron suffers from a learning disability. Well, at least his alter ego does.<br/><br/>Again I have to list my favorite scenes. The first is Aaron removing the tracking beacon from his hip. He lures a wolf in and forces the beacon down the wolf's throat. The wolf takes off in one direction, Aaron in another. Unfortunately for the wolf, with the beacon in it's stomach, a guided missile blows it to smithereens. After this scene Aaron gets to a small airport and steals an airplane.<br/><br/>My next favorite scene is when Aaron saves Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) from being taken out by a CIA assassination squad. He kills each member of the squad and then helps Marta to burn her house down with the bodies still inside before escaping through the woods to an awaiting car.<br/><br/>I of course like the chase scenes in Manila. They are separated only by a few minutes but they should considered a continuous chase scene. The first part is of Marta running away from Manila Police and Aaron running along the rooftops in order to catch her and save her. Which he does. The second part is when another assassin, only referred to as LARX #3, chases both Aaron and Marta through the streets of Manila on motorcycles.<br/><br/>I would still choose Jason Bourne over Aaron Cross. I would also choose Julia Stiles over Rachel Weisz. Although, I do have to admit to having crushes on both Julia and Rachel. I can do that, can't I?<br/><br/>Anyway, I give this 10 stars out of 10."
"peterdavis","9","5","9","8 June 2013"," Secret agents in the snow is always a good idea.
","If there are going to be secret agents there should always be snow. It should be law. The best moments of James Bond (or even True Lies) for me are always on skis or otherwise messing about in the snow. Perhaps it's the extra danger of being so exposed to the elements, that if they stub a toe or hit their knuckles on a tree it will reeeeaaaaly hurt in the cold. Even George Clooney's ""The American"" starts out with an effective murderous opening around a wilderness cabin (...actually I'm now not sure it was snowing in that one or if I've subconsciously inserted the snow into my memory of the scene to accord it with my sensibility). Anyway, The Bourne Legacy has got the snow in so we're immediately off to a good start.<br/><br/>I saw this film on a plane and managed to really enjoyed it, so it must be EVEN BETTER than for just the presence of secret agents and snow. The last Bourne movie (#3) was really starting to wind down with too much repetition so I was not looking forward to this one and skipped it at the cinema. Then Matt Damon not being involved also seemed like confirmation that this movie would be a poor effort by a movie studio desperately wringing the last few bucks out of a dying franchise. <br/><br/>Turns out, however, that abandoning the original character was a great way to widen the universe of story/premise and really get creative. I most enjoyed the scene with the post-trauma counsellors. Great stuff from writer/director Tony Gilroy and some really ""proper"" actors (even a surprise cameo from Kenny the Aussie toilet cleaner guy) in this fresh ""reboot"" of a movie (though technically not a reboot). So there."

","Bourne is regarded as a very good trilogy. Honestly i never really was a fan of the first 3 films. They were enjoyable enough....maybe a 6.5/10 as far as i am concerned ! Anyway after seeing the trailers for the 2012 version i said...""hey this looks nice, but will it even be as good as the last ones"" ? after the first 30mn i understood that the BOURNE name was soiled...this movie was bad....yes BAD. what is this hype i read online ??? Story is poor, action is not interesting...and the soundtrack is not memorable ! Believe me this should have been a direct to Bluray movie at best...the only thing that saves this crap is the good lead actor and a few action moments that are nice. If you have not seen it, skip it, you are NOT missing a damn thing !"

","People who have watched Bourne series and expect the same kind of fast paced action and drama. This film will disappoint if you go with that thought. But if you watch the movie just to spend a good time and don't expect much then its a good movie to watch once. The movie doesn't have the fast pace and at the beginning it goes so slow that you wonder if this movie title had 'Bourne' in it. There are some dialogues in the movie which take the story nowhere, you wish they got to the point directly. The director of the movie is changed so should the title so that people don't expect much from this movie. Jeremy Renner does a good act and recently has come up as the new action hero."
"rivertam26","7","5","9","10 August 2012"," The best of the series sort of...
","I just rewatched well most of the Bourne movies(it was like 2.5 because I didn't have the time lol) this week to prep for this reboot installment. And I was glad I did I forgot how great they were. They were a smart mans action movie and felt raw and realistic in part due to Matt Damon's intentionally stiff, sort of cold, bad ass performance. The only thing that didn't play well was how slightly redundant the movies became after a while the second installment was way overlong and since his love interest is killed off in the beginning it definitely takes something away from the proceedings they felt darker and not as fun as when Marie was around but by the end of the film he began to get in touch with himself which was nice to see in a subtle character building scene. Entering into the Bourne Legacy I think it's important to have an open mind. This is a completely different movie. It centers on Aaron Cross aka no. 5 he's a sort of super soldier engineered by the government but after the events of the first two movies and during the events of the third his story unravels as the government begins killing off it's ""experiments"". As you can guess he escapes and makes his way to the doctor he met with for his dwindling meds that keep him strong physically as well as mentally. Chaos of course ensues he meets up with the doctor aka his new love interest played well enough by Rachael Weisz and they do a little globe trotting as they are pursued. It all seems fairly generic but the movie has an almost amateur, visual pizazz to it. The film feels a little clumsy and it definitely works in it's favor in my opinion, the action feels more real and not as stagey and the last motorycyle setpiece chase scene takes the genre to new heights it's kinetically electrifying I was literally on the edge of my seat and even yelled out a few parts. It's a fun flick. As for Jeremy Renner well he's no Matt damon which is a good thing because they are two different characters and his take on Alex Cross is more emotionally engaging which makes for a nice change and his relationship with Weisz although a slight bit forced feels solid. The movie smartly starts off with a scene of him emerging form ice cold waters scantily clad echoing the scene that started the franchise. And when he emerges I had already fallen in love, he's so sexy in this film and I'm sure this will really start his career as a leading man/box office draw he's enaging, masculine but emotional and he nails the fight choreography aggressively. All in all it's not a perfect film there are some questionable moments but overall I don't think you can compare this film to the first three it's a different beast a little less smart maybe but one hell of a wild ride. I'm exciting to see where it goes."

","Boise was lucky enough to get an early look at 'The Bourne Legacy' hosted by producer Frank Marshall. <br/><br/>So, 'The Bourne Legacy' isn't a continuation of the previous 3 movies.

Alex Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a new breed of super soldier from the Outcome program. <br/><br/>The action sequences are top notch. Like the previous 3 movies, there is an awesome chase scene...this time on motorcycles through the streets of Manilla!<br/><br/>For those looking for their Bourne fix, this movie delivers. While Matt Damon's character isn't in this film, Jeremy Renner's performance is a great reboot to this franchise. <br/><br/>One negative, if I have to call it a negative, is that the ending of this movie is way too abrupt.

"pranavbalakrishnan","4","8","17","15 August 2012"," A Bourne movie without Jason Bourne is kinda boring....
","Tony Gilroy's ""Bourne Legacy"" lacks the style and momentum of the previous ones which had a lot more action, better script, better characters and a better director. I really missed Jason Bourne throughout the movie who was very unique and had this amnesia which gave a mysterious touch to the previous movies. The movie made no sense right from the beginning. Everything happens too quickly and it had lots of similarities to the older films which made it a predictable plot. There wasn't much challenge for Aaron Cross unlike Jason Bourne. We can't get involved with the new characters emotionally even though Rachel Weisz gave a good performance. On the whole, the movie did not make much sense and the filmmakers were trying to make a re-boot mixed with sci-fi which I think was quite disappointing. And if they want to make another movie, they better get back Matt Damon who is surely missed by both fans and neutrals alike."
"SeussMeTub","8","10","23","8 August 2012"," Less Action, More Plot But Just As Good
","Since Matt Damon decided not to reprise his role as Jason Bourne the filmmakers decided to continue the Bourne franchise without him- the result is the Bourne Legacy. Although it has less action than Damon's earlier trilogy it is still quite entertaining and proceeds along a breakneck pace, never slowing down to be boring and is a welcome addition to the Bourne franchise.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner takes over as lead protagonist Aaron Cross but Damon's presence is constantly being reminded to us since the previous supporting cast from the Bourne Ultimatum (Albert Finney, Scott Glenn, David Strathairn and Joan Allen) all make cameos to make sure that we are firmly within the same universe. In fact the whole movie's timeline takes place at roughly the same time as the Bourne Ultimatum and the constant narrative shifts makes one even anticipate a Matt Damon cameo.<br/><br/>So what's the story about? Well it seems that Jason Bourne wasn't the only assassin in the Treadstone project but now it is revealed that there were other projects beside that one too. Because of the public fallout with the Jason Bourne expose the powers that be decide to shut down these other projects by killing everyone involved. Naturally Renner survives and with the help of surviving scientist Rachel Weisz tries to make sense of it all before they themselves are killed.<br/><br/>Renner's assassin is slightly different than Damon's since he is neither conflicted nor does he have amnesia but is instead addicted to some sort of blue pills that makes him more deadly. Jeremy Renner does an able job filling in for Matt Damon and the plot and action whirls fast enough to satisfy most moviegoers (though a workplace shooting may hit too close to home for some) but the younger crowd might bemoan the lack of constant massive explosions. For everyone else, its good enough to warrant more. The only weakness is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and seems to hint at a sequel due to a number of unresolved plot and character issues.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner teams up in the future with another Bourne movie!"

","OK, here's the thing--channel surfing and I came across a scene from this film--the one where the lab guy is shooting up a storm. So....it captured my attention and I decided I wanted to see this from the beginning--found on Demand. Voilà. Instant gratification without leaving my chair. What wonderful times we live in.<br/><br/>I start the movie and I'll be damned if I wasn't glued to the screen for the ENTIRE length of this film!!! I have seen the other Bourne films, and yes I am going to get booed here, but I found them confusing and boring, and fell asleep at all 3. To try and put a little perspective on this, I'm a girl who has never, ever watched a chick flick in my life and I've never seen an episode of Friends. I have a huge love of action, military, historical, and science fiction films. I've seen Gladiator at least 20 times, Alien and Aliens at least that, and the Godfather Trilogy? Well, don't even make me admit how many times I have seen that. I have watched movies incessantly since I was SEVEN years old. Cabaret was the first and why my Mother thought I should see this film I will never know--it actually created a fascination with Nazi history / atrocities, and a love for the Jewish faith.<br/><br/>So I SHOULD have liked the first 3 Bourne films, yes? But no. BUT I LOVED BOURNE LEGACY. After I watched it I came on IMDb because I wanted to see if there was a sequel yet. And WOW WHAT THE HECK, there were so so many awful reviews!!! Like, super bad, along with MAJOR praise for the first three!<br/><br/>Since I had fallen asleep at the other films, when I saw that this one was about chemically enhanced agents, I actually thought that somehow I had missed this part of the other 3 films, sleeping and all, so perhaps I should go back and watch again-- cuz I definitely enjoy science-fiction-ey and action mixed together!! The reviews quickly told me that duh, this part was new to the ""series"", and not much appreciated either.<br/><br/>I guess in the end, I must be getting old, and am easily amused. Because I really, really enjoyed the 2 actors, Renner and Weisz. He reminds me of Daniel Craig, who Weisz is married to, so that was cool. I also totally enjoyed the action scenes, thought they were fabulous, I was SUPER glued to my chair, and often I am fidgety and doing 2 things at once when watching a film. The beginning scenes in the Alaska wilderness? Great scenery, great action.<br/><br/>I want to be a super agent, damn it.<br/><br/>I guess the best I can expect is a sequel so I can once again live the life of a super agent vicariously!"

"johnathanpaulcathey","7","4","7","10 June 2013"," Its not Bourne but its not bad either
","I think too many people, myself included, expected wayy to much from this movie. A movie, especially with a new director and new leads, has to be able to stand on its own legs, even though its part of a series. <br/><br/>If you took this film out of Bourne land it was by itself, it will still stand. Would it be super great, no. Would it be the same as the first Bourne, no. But its a different direction so you're going to get a different vision. <br/><br/>To those who criticize Tony Gilroy as being arrogant and lacking the ability to gauge the audiences intelligence, I have to disagree. Is he arrogant? I dunno, I've never met him. Neither have you so be reasonable in your character accusations and keep your reviews to the film. I think he's a good writer, now granted the first three Bourne's were better, however they were written, as stated by Matt Damon, pretty much on the fly and Greengrass you know had a hand in it.<br/><br/>There are subtle moments, things in this story that make you wonder and question Aaron Cross' background. I think the science behind it is completely plausible and I don't put much past our government. I think the whole government cover up situation with more programs is again completely plausible. This is years after Bourne one - so the idea that they've stepped things up should be no shocker and completely reasonable. Im interested to know more about this world.<br/><br/>To those who say there is no reason for this movie, again I disagree. The character motivation is there. For Renner, For Weisz and for Norton. <br/><br/>Granted its not as well written as the first three and its not as good as the first three. But I'll accept it as the next step in the Bourne series and hopefully Damon and Greengrass return to finish it right."
"HelenMary","8","4","7","9 June 2013"," Jason Bourne, gone but not forgotten. Renner is incredible.
","When I heard the new Bourne was going to be without the incredible Matt Damon, I worried that this was another franchise that just replaced it's actors. However, this isn't the case. Bourne is still alive and well, and the 'Bourne Legacy' is reference to him not being the only Treadstone operative. The events of the previous Bourne Film (Ultimatum) are referenced as is Jason Bourne and Jeremy Renner does a stonking job of continuing the action, physicality but humanity of the previous films... with that dangerous edge that we know and love. Renner is brilliant. I hadn't seen him in much before this but his ability to project power in a scene and believably do all the things that he is shown doing, with a grace and speed that surprises. He works well opposite Rachel Weisz, and I loved the evolution of their relationship in a natural and compelling way. Terminator fans will like the almost Michael Biehn/Kyle Reese ""come with me if you want to live"" bit and Weisz is far more proactive in this similar situation to Chain Reaction, but realistically just as reliant on the resourceful and caring male. Unlike Bond films (Jason Bourne is the American Bond... and prior to Daniel Craig, better) where the female is just an addendum and something to fight/seduce, Renner and Weisz have a symbiotic relationship where her scientific and caring nature combined with the fear of being alone and lost, make for one of the most powerful and tender ""love"" scenes in an action film...<br/><br/>The action in Legacy is awesome. The fights, the survival, the scenes with the wolf (so realistic - I hope no wolves were harmed in the making of the film!), the parkour (OMG when he walks up the side of the house!), the shooting and the incredible motorbike stunts were breathtaking edge of the seat stuff. Renner is a force to be reckoned with in action films, and if he does a lot of his own work I'd say Tom Cruise has someone nipping at his heels.<br/><br/>A great piece of action cinema. Big, loud, bold and exciting. Great entertainment, good dialogue and writing and interesting characters. There were parts where things were spelled out a little too much, and I'd have liked to see Edward Norton utilised a little more - although what he did was of course great, but then he is acting genius - and perhaps the bike scene went on a bit long... and it ended too abruptly leaving me wanting more!"
"Tweekums","8","4","7","27 February 2013"," Decent spin off from a modern classic
","Set at the same time as 'The Bourne Ultimatum' this film follows another agent; Aaron Cross as he struggles to survive when his erstwhile employers try to eliminate everybody involved in the programme. Unlike Bourne he has been treated to improve both his strength and his intelligence; this means that he must keep taking medication if he is to remain the person he has become. To this end he seeks out Dr. Marta Shearing; the doctor who oversaw his examinations. It is lucky for her that he does need her help as the agency was intending to eliminate her too. She doesn't have the medication but knows where it is made: Manila. If they are to survive they will have to get to the Philippines and get the medication before the agency can catch up with them; it won't be easy though.<br/><br/>This film is pretty good; there is plenty of solid action from start to finish and a decent story the problem is that while it may have 'Bourne' in the title it doesn't feature the hero of the original trilogy and Aaron Cross isn't as good a protagonist as Bourne was. It also suffers from the fact that you really need to have seen the Bourne films to understand what is going on no time is wasted explaining what things like 'Treadstone' and 'Black Brier' mean. All that said Jeremy Renner does a good enough job as Cross and Rachel Weisz is good as Dr. Shearing. It is clear that the makers are hoping to make more instalments in the franchise as the story doesn't reach a proper conclusion so much so that it might as well have had the words 'too be continued' appearing at the end! I hope they do make at least one more as I for one would like to know how the story ends!"

In this movie the story was all over the place and didn't really connect much to other ones and the ending was horrible and it wasn't a cliff hanger unlike Matt Damon Bourne movies where he was shot of something no they just float off in a boat and I said what that's it for the many actions scenes it does not leave you satisfied at the end and is not very intellectually motivating unlike og Bourne movies.

"bob the moo","Null","4","7","30 December 2012"," Takes a while to reset but is solidly good once it does – not up to the original films though
","I had no great hopes for this film when it was announced that they were extending the franchise after the third film and it was with low expectations that I sat down to watch it. To give credit to the writers I did like the way that they stepped back into the same world rather than picking it up later or earlier than the original films. The plot sees actions taken to kill off all those who could expose Treadstone (ie those directly involved in it) due to the actions of Bourne threatening to bring everything down around them. In this film we focus on another agent trying to escape elimination and as such it works pretty well in terms of how it folds into the other films.<br/><br/>This allows it to be a rather inferior copy without having to deal with the accusations of it being one – because in essence it is a part of those films rather than a riff on them. The downside is that it does take some setting up; establishing new characters, linking them to the other Bourne movies, breaking it free from that narrative and then getting moving with this new thread – all of this takes time and it does show the strain within the first hour where it has a lot of words and very little action. This is a necessary evil but it does try the patience to a point in the first half of the film and at points through the second. A further downside is that it does stilt the flow of the film and when the action does come it feels rushed and that it doesn't have sufficient time to be consistent. It is still pretty thrilling once it gets moving but it is just the constraint of time and context – the ending also feels like a bit of an anti-climax as well, because we don't get the sense of the story going on from here (even though it clearly will). It does still work though and, although the action never gets to the standard of the previous films.<br/><br/>I thought Renner was on a hiding to nothing by trying to fill Damon's shoes, but in fairness he does do a really good job; he has the presence and he uses it well and it is just the shame that it takes the film so long to become ""his"". Weisz is a classy bit of casting and the film benefits from her support – again just a shame that it takes so long for the film to be given over to her. Norton helps minimize this to some point by being the heart of the first half of the film and being a good presence throughout – he works well and I would like to see him and Renner closer in the sequel to this film.<br/><br/>Overall Legacy isn't up to the standard of the previous films but it does still work pretty well. The writing is good even if it requires a lot of establishing before it can make the jump into this new film, but the starry and engaging cast help by virtue of their presences. It is in the shadow of the main films but it is still pretty enjoyable and I would be very happy to see this story be concluded in another film with the same cast and characters."
"devileye03","7","4","7","29 November 2012"," A boost to this wonderful series!
","Its been a longtime since I saw the first 3 movies in this series. So when I saw The Bourne Legacy, it was like a fresh start with some parts connected with previous movie in the series. Tony Gilroy who directed all Bourne movies has brought back the fast pace screenplay which keeps you interested till climax. Story is not something new. Beautiful visuals from Alaska to Philippines.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner was good in Ghost Protocol and even better as the lead, Aaron Cross. Brilliant action sequences, both fights and chase scenes. Wish the chase sequence was more in length. Rachel Weisz is the damsel in distress and she is good doing her part. The film would have been even better if it had more action. The movie is overall worth a watch for amazing action and performances by the lead pair. I would surely like to watch the whole series again. Must watch."
"basilisksamuk","6","4","7","14 August 2012"," Another decent film that needs to have a shorter run time
","As is often the case these days there's a decent ninety minute film hidden in here somewhere. Unfortunately it's often buried under a pile of unnecessary filler and exposition gone mad. The parts of the film that could be jettisoned to make it better, tighter and more pacey are mostly in the first hour of the film and you have to wait to the later part of the film for the exciting parts. Edward Norton is completely wasted in the long rambling prologue and I really struggle to understand why the premise of the film was so difficult to set up. The programme's gone wrong and the best way to clean house is to kill everyone involved; the Bourne-alikes all have to take drugs to enhance and maintain their power but a boffin, played by Rachel Weisz, will find a solution for our new hero. Why does it take the best part of an hour to set that up and why does Weisz have to play silly screaming scientist woman before Jeremy Renner turns her into a warrior overnight? <br/><br/>Anyway, the parkour sequence is good, though not as good as in previous excursions. The motorcycle chase through Manilla is excellent. Jeremy Renner is a much more convincing action man than ever Matt Damon was and has the capability to really lift this franchise out of the ordinary with the right script and director. In fact Renner would make an excellent Bond if ever Daniel Craig decides to hang up his guns."

","OK so I saw Bourne Legacy earlier today and I'll admit, I was disappointed. It's easily the worst of the series. It wasn't bad, there were actually some pretty tense parts in the movie, but there were some things that really bothered me as well.<br/><br/>A plus about the movie is the action (even though there isn't much of it). I thought the lab shooting scene was very tense for a PG-13 film and got me interested in the movie again because before that, the movie was very slow. The chase at the end was pretty good as well. The acting is pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Now something that really bother me was the plot. It felt like after a 2 hour movie, nothing was accomplished. The film feels unfinished because of this. As I said earlier, the film is very slow paced, especially the first hour. And with there only being three maybe four action scenes in the whole movie, you really got bored while waiting for the action to start up again. Gilroy doesn't develop any of the characters at all, even though the movie hints at Cross' origin, most likely setting up a plot point for the sequel.<br/><br/>Even though it sounds like I hate the film, I actually enjoyed it, just nowhere near as much as I wanted too, making it a disappointment for me.<br/><br/>6/10"

It's not a reboot, it's a logical ""what would happen next, given Jason Bourne's actions in the previous films?"" and so it is a great jumping off point.<br/><br/>The casting and acting is first rate, and I was genuinely on the edge of my seat because of what an intense and thrilling movie it was thanks to the work of director Tony Gilroy. <br/><br/>I highly commend the movie to anyone who enjoys an intelligent and exciting movie.

"John_the_Lamp","8","8","18","11 August 2012"," 'Legacy' is entertaining and gripping, but doesn't live up to the original trilogy.
","Alright, so I have actually been anticipating this movie for a while, but after reading some of the reviews, I cooled the thoughts of this being as good as the other Bournes. And I think that helped a lot. <br/><br/>So The Bourne Legacy is about Aaron Cross (Renner), another Treadstone operative, trying to find answers after being ambushed. Meanwhile, CIA officials (Norton) is trying to ""discontinue"" all Treadstone operatives after the events of the Jason Bourne trilogy. This leads to Treadstone's scientist (Weisz) getting involved with the scandal. The face of the CIA in this movie is played by Edward Norton. And Norton has always been a great actor, but due to spotty dialogue, he wasn't used to his full potential. The same could be said for Weisz, although she managed to make more with the script. <br/><br/>I know that most people have been sketchy about the whole idea of another Bourne movie without Bourne, but I can tell you that Aaron Cross has the same ability to kick ass. Jeremy Renner was fantastic as the follow up to Bourne. He had the brain and the brawn just like Damon. And Norton and Weisz' characters can relate to David Straithairn and Julia Stiles' characters from the original trilogy. This uses much of the same formula, but it ultimately leads to less originality. <br/><br/>But one thing that slightly annoyed me by the end of this movie, was how they kept on trying to link this film with the previous trilogy. And I know that it is the same ""universe"" as the previous trilogy, but it didn't need to be called a Bourne movie. Now it's going to be compared to the trilogy and it will lose that argument. And Aaron Cross will be compared to Jason Bourne, and it will lose that argument as well.<br/><br/>So there's my big complaint with this movie: its title. (As well as trying to connect Cross to Bourne) But there are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, I like how it took its time in the beginning setting up the story, rather than jumping into unnecessary action sequences. Also, the relationship between Cross and the Scientist works really well. Its believable and interesting to see how the questions meet the answers. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe that trying to make this a direct sequel to the Jason Bourne trilogy was a backfire and that they tried to make it too much like the trilogy. It would have worked best for them to take Aaron Cross' story and make it uniquely his without trying to tie him to Bourne. I would be in if there is a sequel, but I would love it if Damon came back to the game. {B}"

He spent the first ten minutes trying to figure out the best way to introduce the new prodigy but as a Bourne fan kick off was slow and dull.<br/><br/>No chemistry between main characters although Wiezs is awesome in her role and delivers a performance way beyond her script - but not her.

"wlk68","9","6","13","16 August 2012"," I liked it.
","It had a few flaws but overall, I liked it. I think Jeremy Renner has a really marvelous ability to blend toughness and vulnerability in a way that a great many actors don't. As such, I actually found Aaron Cross to be far more relate-able than Jason Bourne. He projected this undercurrent of quiet panic throughout the entire movie at the very idea that he would revert back to his former self – a poor man's Forrest Gump, as it were – and I found that to be both intriguing and sympathetic. He didn't want to go back to what he'd been, and with very good reason. Another thing I liked was how Aaron wasn't the one to survive because he was somehow better than the other agents but because he got lucky.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>I saw this for a second time and, as a result,felt the need to come and post a few more thoughts/comments. I've never been much of a Matt Damon fan, so I didn't miss him at all, and as stated above, I found that Aaron came across as more relate-able. Jason Bourne was a blank slate the way Matt portrayed him, so while I enjoyed the other movies, it was largely in spite of Damon rather than because of him. I'd be okay with never seeing Jason Bourne in any future films, though they can reference him all they want. So Matt, please be sure to keep your word! Jeremy was damn good, and I am pleased he's becoming more high profile. And yes, he was HOT in this movie.<br/><br/>Shame that the film is getting negative reviews, but not that surprising. These movies put Matt Damon on the map, so anyone invested in his involvement would be a hard sell. <br/><br/>I also thought that Rachel and Jeremy were extremely convincing with their deep connection in a short amount of time. Often, I roll my eyes at such developments, and never really bought Jason and Marie's love story. Yet, I found myself invested in Aaron and Marta. Rachel Weisz always manages to convey an inner strength in her roles while being vulnerable. Given the saturation of the physically kickass woman in movies these days, it's refreshing to see more of a balance in a female character (in an action film). Though her final actions on the motorcycle were pretty badass.<br/><br/>All that said, the movie did end abruptly, and left me wanting more and I very much hope that we get it."
"kevin-124-32038","3","7","16","10 September 2012"," Not even this talented star-studded cast can shovel enough sh*t off a script THIS BAD to make it good. Legacy effectively ruins the series.
","Mindless action flick I found unworthy of the Bourne title. The 4th installment (more of a spin off rather than an installment, which i find to be slightly less insulting) is subject to poor story telling, over-explaining of the poor story telling (which in turn makes the story awful), and is littered with action film clichés left and right, such as when lead female , Dr. Marta Shearing, is saved ""just in the nick of time"" or that suddenly there are all sorts of government assassination programs that were never mentioned previously in 3 films.<br/><br/>The film's protagonist, Aaron Cross, fails to capture any of what makes Jason Bourne the super agent that we know and love. When it is revealed that the protagonist is merely a superb secret agent because of medication/genetic mutation, it seriously hurts the entire film series.<br/><br/>In the previous 3 films, we know that nothing Jason Bourne does is by accident. it is carefully calculated premeditation, or it is carefully calculated improvization. Everything that Bourne does is done because he knows what to do, he knows whats going to happen, because he is the best. Bourne blends in, master of disappearing into crowds and speaks just about every damn European language known to man. Cross is none of that. From the very beginning of the film, through dialogue, you get the feel that Cross has no idea what he is doing or why he is doing it. Aside from knowing how to kill with his barehands, no parallels can be drawn between Bourne and Cross.<br/><br/>He lives merely by accident because he happened to step out of the house (oh that was convenient.) In a gun battle in the house he effortlessly slides across the floor into the basement of the house through a hole in the floor (oh thats also convenient.) In a foot chase across the roof tops he has no indication he knows that Marta is below him, he just happens to slide across the right roof top and stops for no reason (conveniently) Poorly conceived plot devices. The movie is littered with them. He's a super spy because he takes these pills (a plot device set up so there is an excuse to move the story to a foreign location), Aaron Cross is chased by wolves (a plot device so that conveniently he has a warm body to put his tracking device into), We're shutting down all our special operations assassination programs and killing all our field agents. except for one LARX #3 that we left alive in Asia, so we'll send him after Cross (plot device to give Cross a nemesis. A nemesis that he never even had a showdown with, in which case you could have completely skipped the ""hes from another special government program made for murdering people"" aspect and just left the motorcycle chase with a random goon.<br/><br/>all in all, the Bourne series has always been a ""smart"" action thriller. with Legacy, they took the smart out, and turned it into just another generic action movie. i was very disappointed in this film, i feel that it hurts the series a lot with all its shortcomings. the only thing that felt almost right was the fighting. and even then its not quite right. Bourne didn't kill anyone except for the assassins sent to kill him. Cross murders a number of people by shooting them, and even breaks one guy whos just trying to get by in the world as a security guard at one point."

","Saw a Sneak Preview tonight and it is an awesome suspense/action flick. The movie grabs you from the beginning scenes and never lets up. Jeremey Renner is a Grade A replacement for Matt Damon. He has become a first rate star for roles like this. The direction by Tony Gilroy is superb. This mans knows how to direct films like this! <br/><br/>The supporting cast (including a very fine Rachel Weisz) are very good also. Edward Norton in particular stands out in his role, which you would expect from a fine actor like Norton. In addition the stunts and the special effects were all first rate. Can't wait for the sequel that is surely going to be made......."
"rpete528","6","3","5","12 November 2013"," Falls short
","When you watch the Bourne Trilogy to me those 3 movies were equal in suspense and excitement. It's hard to come away with a sequel and have it be as good as the first one. Here, Jeremy Renner is really good in his role but I'm not sold on Rachel Weisz. It's like she is trying too hard?? When you watch her and Renner in the car when they leave her burning house it's like she is forgetting her lines or something. Just not very good acting. Anyway, the action scenes are really good but the story isn't. It doesn't carry the same flair or interest like the first 3 do. The movie is not awful but it's not great either. Good to see at least once. It gets a 6 from me."
"willowgrove","7","3","5","12 January 2013"," This is a different story folks
","I think, like my son said after watching this film, everyone expected another Bourne story. When they didn't get it, they were disappointed. I wasn't at all. <br/><br/>This is a different story with very different lead characters with different struggles. Because I approached it as such, I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>We are introduced to Aaron Cross, excellently portrayed by Jeremy Renner, a member of a different deep undercover program than Bourne, taking mysterious medications. What are these all about? Why is he taking them? What do they do? Who else is involved in this program? What are the goals?<br/><br/>Then we find ourselves in a highly secure laboratory following Dr. Marta Shearing, an expert in biochemistry and virology. Rachel Weisz's performance is very visceral and definitely drew me into the story and into caring for her character.<br/><br/>In the background are the happenings of Jason Bourne (during the Bourne Ultimatum) creating mayhem for the CIA putting all of the programs in jeopardy including the program that Aaron Cross is in. <br/><br/>When they come together to try and survive their attackers (a la Bourne) they develop a wonderfully subtle relationship; protective of one another as their teamwork is what gives them a chance of survival. <br/><br/>No, it's not Bourne, it's Cross. It's not all action, there is quite a bit of background detail and vital questions proposed. But the story is interesting and the main characters played by Renner and Weisz were complex, multi-faceted, real, and well developed. Kudos to the two of them for their fine work.<br/><br/>A great quote that is core to the story, ""Who told you this was okay?"" Food for thought."
"tristanclayson","9","3","5","10 January 2013"," A wonderful action film with everything Bourne fans should expect in a new protagonist
","This film was an amazing example of a sequel in a franchise that largely sees new faces, but doesn't fall flat on it's face. The acting was amazing, the overall concept well executed, and the writing was believable. However, this movie fails to garner a full ten stars because an important element was missing at the end, which I will cover in a few moments. <br/><br/>The protagonist of the film, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), is an active agent as part of project ""Outcome"" another continuation of project Treadstone and Black Briar built around the use of operatives highly trained and mentally prepared to do the dirty work that is black-ops for the United States in order to maintain the moral integrity for the rest of the institution. However, the character of Cross is different from Jason Bourne in that he has not lost his memory, but instead clings to the program for reasons related to the performance enhancement mentally he receives from the supplements operatives are given on a daily basis. This is all set aflame when the events of the Bourne Trilogy result in Edward Norton's character Eric Byer ordering the termination of every asset of outcome while the media awareness of the operation is diminished. This of course means the elimination of every operative, and the support and science staff that have helped create them.<br/><br/>The first result is many operatives being poisoned, and those in the field, namely Cross, being eliminated by other means. Cross escapes but loses availability to the supplements that allow for his enhanced physical and mental abilities.<br/><br/>Enter Dr. Marta Shearing, played by Rachel Weisz. When one of her coworkers is apparently switched on as a plant in the testing facility where genetic manipulation is researched and begins shooting everyone, she remains the only survivor of the mass killing that is explained as a mental breakdown. When a team of killers is sent to her home to clean up her escape and pose it as a suicide, Cross saves her in order to acquire a supply of the medication. Their fates are now intertwined as both are on the ""must eliminate"" list of Byers team.<br/><br/>What follows in back story is that Brenner's character Cross was legally retarded before entering military service, and his recruiter lied about his IQ score in order to get him accepted to meet his recruitment quota that month. If Cross does not gain access to the medication he requires, his mental acuity will slip from operational genius to village idiot. Dr. Shearing must therefore help him to make the effects permanent, and provides excellent motivation for both characters as she will likely not survive without the help of the mentally enhanced Cross.<br/><br/>This approach to marry the fates of the main characters was actually very well written. In the action that follows, much is had in the way of explosion and chase that generally defines a Bourne movie. While this action is lighter than some of the other Bourne films, Renner certainly demonstrates a physical ability to keep up with Matt Damon's Bourne. Rachel Weisz is a believable sidekick who is quick witted and relatively in control of herself. This all generates my 9 rating out of ten for the film.<br/><br/>However, and this will explain for many of you the other negative reviews, this movie is missing at least five minutes near the end. While the protagonists escape with their lives from the pursuit of Norton's team and one more operative from yet another Treadstone spin off, there is no resolution in the film for Norton's team and what they are doing to further the covering of their tracks. Yes, a scene with previous films characters and their involvement in the Bourne incident does occur, but Norton's team is simply forgotten at the end. This caused my wife to ask ""Wait, that is the end?"". Yes, a conclusion exists, but it is lacking that scene where Norton's character at least issues the directive that ""all stops are out until they are dead"", instead of just leaving it to assumption.<br/><br/>A director's cut could fix this minor flaw, and the beginning of another film could also bridge the gap, and also allow for Brenner and Damon to work together. This film ultimately makes that the desire of the viewer, that both of the legacy heroes come together to fix the world that has wronged them.<br/><br/>No, it is not Jason Bourne, but the spirit of those films is present in so many ways, and those die hard fans and casual action filmgoers will find plenty to enjoy here."
"kosmasp","7","3","5","3 January 2013"," Bourne to do this
","If a franchise is as successful as the Bourne franchise is/was, it is inevitable that there will be a follow up. Even if everyone was saying that the series was always meant to be trilogy. If you can overcome that fact and are able not to hold a grudge against the producers or anyone else involved in the making of this, you might be able to enjoy a fairly decent action thriller.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is the man when it comes to casting action roles of late. After his performance in ""Hurt Locker"" he did rise pretty fast. If the Avengers were incomplete, he might have gotten a bigger role in that one too. You can see why he is such a wanted man (no pun intended) in this movie too. Rachel Weisz has not that much to do, but her performance does give the movie another gravitas. The action scenes are superb, but we expected that (especially if we watched the trailer). Nice hints to the original movies too. Before you cry out, watch it is what I'm trying to say."
"charley-baltimore","10","4","8","14 February 2014"," One of the Best Action Films I've seen
","Wow- what a superb film. Starts out with an interesting plot in which we observe a Manchurian black operative survive against all odds in a freezing climate. Then somehow they weave it into a great story about the female lead waking up to the truth about the program and fighting the bad guys with Renner. I think they were both fantastic because they stay low key. The motorcycle scenes are really incredible - suspense throughout. I forgot all about Matt Damon 30 minutes into it. And I like Matt. I highly recommend this film. Gotta watch it again so I can enjoy the martial arts- impressive. Bonus is the attachment/love interest angle which develops and Renner is extremely easy on the eye."
"MajorBaleegh","10","4","8","20 November 2013"," Fantastic Experience
","Today I watched ""The Bourne Legacy"" the second time and went to IMDb to saw the reviews and was astonished that the reviewer who even don't like the actor Jeremy Renner was giving the reviews and reviewing this movie badly just on the pretext that it's hero was Jeremy Renner which I think I quite unjust. I have the experience of watching over 3000 movies in the past three years and found that movies in which main or the side cast performed by Mr. Jeremy Renner are all good and block buster movies. I specifically found this movie very appealing as Jeremy Renner possesses a unique personality; he is cute, polite, agile, tough, emotionally very stable, and confident and such a handsome guy that his personality appeals that he should be watched in close context as he is a perfect person. His action's along with acting of Ms. Rachel Weisz, was perfect and up to the mark. Both did their job well. Furthermore I think that Manila Police Department should pull up their socks and get some new recruits as their present staffs are not performing their tasks correctly. Overall it was a great movie and over hero was at his best. I will rate this movie 10 out of 10,"
"mfmoore-1","9","4","8","7 July 2013"," Wow. What did anybody hate about this movie?
","If you loved the other ones, I see no reason to dislike this one at all. I thought it really refreshed the series and made the entire plot line deeper and clearer.<br/><br/>Full of action, tension, and clever twists.<br/><br/>I think people didn't like that the went a little heavy on the sci-fi plot angle and was heavy on special effects, but the series did that two films ago.<br/><br/>Great stunt work as you expect with every Bourne film.<br/><br/>Maybe people feel it is a little redundant with James Bond films these days, I don't know. But I hope they make a sequel."
"MarithDutch","9","4","8","11 June 2013"," Great job, thank you for not ignoring Jason Bourne!
","Although I am a huge Renner-fan, at first I did not want to see the movie, because I thought there could not be a Bourne movie without Matt Damon. How wrong I was. I had been afraid they would try too hard to make Renner similar to Damon. Wrong again. They did an excellent job of giving some insights into the life of Jason Bourne at that moment, but didn't go into detail. The story lines seemed plausible (as far as an action movie can be, of course) enough to get me hooked, and the characters were pretty well fleshed out. Not too many details about them, but enough to make sure the audience will appreciate them. Only minor issue was the fact that Edward Norton barely left the office. They could have done more for his character in my opinion. The action sequences were great, especially knowing that Renner and Weisz did almost all of the stunts themselves. The ending actually succeeded in making me hope for a sequel, because they did a fantastic job in setting up this new story. One that reminds us of the Bourne-trilogy, but has no problem standing on its own. I'll be waiting for the next one!"
"xristosdomini","7","4","8","7 April 2013"," Liked it, not perfect.
","I'll start off positive-- I liked Bourne Legacy. There, I said it.<br/><br/>Bourne Legacy--had it come out right after Bourne Identity-- is a fine enough film in its own right. It is more character-based and Jeremy Renner does a pretty good job with his role (as he usually does). Legacy, however, is going to suffer in the eyes of most fans of the franchise because of the ridiculously high bar set by Ultimatum. The director tries to tie Legacy to the other films with occasional references to both Supremacy and Ultimatum, but the problem is that this film has almost nothing to do with Bourne in the direct sense. Thus, the attempts at tying this film in so directly with the others almost makes Legacy seem even more ancillary to the other three in the franchise... ""Here's what happening in Germany right now, so we are going to SE Asia.""<br/><br/>For the hardcore Matrix fans, you could make a comparison of ""Enter the Matrix"" and the film trilogy to Bourne Legacy and the original three. Not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly not of the same ""oomph"".<br/><br/>If you watch the original three Bourne films, there is a cinematographic progression where the cameras become more frantic and shaky from one film to the next, matching the action and intensity of the story. In Legacy, the story is much smaller and more compact, meaning the cameras are more fluid and smooth. In essence, it would be like watching the trilogy and then going back and re-watching Identity immediately afterward... after the hectic nature of Ultimatum, Identity feels very slow-moving and less adrenaline filled. Take that to the next level for Legacy.<br/><br/>Final word: Good, but not perfect... probably would have fared better if not for the monumental expectation created by Ultimatum."
"tieman64","Null","4","8","22 March 2013"," The Sin Eaters
","""At the root of Bond is something neo-fascistic and totally materialist."" - John Le Carre <br/><br/>The Bourne franchise stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a kind of anti-James Bond who, though a secret agent trained by the CIA, finds himself turning his back on his murderous past and waging a clandestine war against Treadstone, a Black-Ops arm of the US military.<br/><br/>As action movies go, ""The Bourne Identity"" is stronger than most. The best of its franchise, ""Identity"" features a number of low-key and inventive action sequences, most of which involve our hero using brains rather than brawn. Bourne's quick thinking, unpredictable and stays several steps ahead of his pursuers, the opposite of Bond, who's always playing catch up.<br/><br/>The film's sequels, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", merely rehash the franchise's first film, emulating its ""running man"" plot and attempting to mimic its action sequences, blow for blow. What was once fresh quickly becomes stale, and Bourne's ""ingenious"" battle tactics now rarely surprise. <br/><br/>Still, both films contain a number of subplots which aren't usually found in Western action movies. Here Bourne, once a state sanctioned assassin, tracks down the victims of his past and attempts to atone for his sins. Elsewhere he colludes with whistle-blowers and left-wing newspapers (The Guardian, itself slowly dying in real life), attempting to expose a CIA which routinely engages in off-the-grid criminal activities (in real life, they'd brazenly assassinate the leaders of, or engender coups in, Congo, Morocco, Jamaica, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Mozambique, Guyana etc). This is a far cry from James Bond (""Goldfinger"", we recall, opens with Bond blowing up the oil supplies of Latin American revolutionaries). Bond's the Imperialist's, misogynistic foot-soldier, Bourne's a disillusioned grunt in an age of Bradley Manning, Jullian Assange and John Kiriakou, which of course makes him a threat. As journalist Kevin Gosztola observed, ""To this day, the only CIA officer to go to jail for torture is now officially an officer who blew the lid on torture and who never tortured anybody."" <br/><br/>Bourne is himself both whistle-blower and action hero. A John Rambo for liberals, his journey is one from forgetfulness and a kind of cultural amnesia, to direct confrontation. He attempts to expose and remember, whilst the CIA attempts to cover up and silence. This aligns the franchise with 1970s political conspiracy thrillers; the State is the enemy, and Bourne's a loaded weapon aimed at his own former employer. Indeed, when pitted against foreign agents, Bond repeatedly says ""my argument is not with you"". Unlike Bond, a relic of the Cold War, Bourne's decidedly post-Cold War. <br/><br/>Bond's always had a very rigid sense of self-identity (""The name's Bond. James Bond.""). Bourne, though, doesn't remember his name, his past, his identity, and carries a satchel full of passports with faces he doesn't recognise. The locales our globe-trotting hero visits are similarly blurred and indistinguishable; everywhere looks the same. Bourne's both representative of a culture that doesn't really know what it stands for, and one which can't morally reconcile its post and pre amnesic identities.<br/><br/>Whilst a ""liberal action film"" is some kind of contradiction (the inevitable glorification and aesthetizisation of violence etc), the Bourne franchise nevertheless does atypical things. Women are consistently the film's moral guardians, Bourne symbolically turns books and pens into action weapons, the series goes out of its way to portray water boarding as an abhorrent act which leads to utter dehumanisation (water and water-boarding, continual motifs in the franchise, led to the very creation of Bourne) and Bourne himself is explicitly obsessed with ""what represents me?"" (and by extension, America). While Bond's your typical spy hero designed to bolster faith in crown, country and offshore escapades, the Bourne franchise ultimately deals with Bourne accepting the responsibility for his own moral corruption; he chose to be Jason Bourne. He is culpable.<br/><br/>No surprise then that Doug Liman, who directed ""Identity"", has a father who was chief counsel for the senate in the Iran-Contra Affair. And Paul Greengrass, director of ""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"", is himself a left-leaning Cambridge graduate and political documentary filmmaker.<br/><br/>The most interesting of the franchise, ""The Bourne Legacy"" was released in 2012. It starred Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another Black-Ops CIA agent. The film again rehashes the Bourne formula – Cross is pursued by the CIA, who again want him silenced – but also does a number of interesting, new things. It's explicitly concerned, for example, with issues of collusion and participation. How can organisms like Bourne and Bond exist, if not for the complicity of whole swathes of society? In ""Legacy's"" case, Cross maps a network of globe-spanning factory workers, scientists, politicians, engineers, all of whom contribute to the workings of an illegal CIA project. Fascism, then, depends on a complex mix of unconscious complicity, ignorance, compartmentalisation, collusion, separation, disavowal and outright secrecy. When the CIA project – Operation Outcome – is exposed, it then quickly evaporates, like shadow exposed to light. Members are hunted down, agents are ""suicided"", and scientists are reassigned or murdered. Such murders recall countless historical events. Regimes, from Ancient Rome to even 21st century democratic states, tend to squelch intellectuals when fearful of exposure.<br/><br/>As an action movie ""Legacy"" is weak. A stupid last act and many moments derivative of its predecessors undermine its fairly serious first hour. The film contains sequences involving Predator Drones, now the weapon of choice for the US military when it comes to naked war crimes. Recent legislation essentially makes it ""legal"" for such drones to assassinate brown and black skinned people. Accidentally killed civilian targets are then ipso-facto reclassified as ""terrorists"", ""insurgents"" or, as has happened several times, simply ""animals"" (dogs or cows). Of course Bourne and Bond are themselves drones. But while Bourne wants escape, Bond's the kind of guy sent to silence him.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Worth one viewing."
"jafco-1","8","4","8","17 February 2013"," Good flick
","This is an interesting view of the Bourne series, from another, parallel perspective. I had never seen Jeremy Renner before, but I thought his performance was excellent. I really grew to care for Aaron Cross. Rachel Weisz is terrific and beautiful as always. The drones/Hellfire missile sequences are scary as hell. I liked how a love affair grows out of the carnage that attends so much of the movie. Rather better than the 6.7 rating that it has so far drawn. It seemingly sets the scene for Aaron Cross and Jason Bourne to team up to really raise hell with some completely amoral Washington bureaucrats who think nothing of killing American heroes to protect their own sorry asses. Bring it on!"
"redeyedtreefrog","4","4","8","5 January 2013"," Saved by Rachel Weisz
","A 5 is generous. Overall The Bourne Legacy was slow when it should have been fast and fast when it should have been smart. Cross' motivation was singular, almost animalistic - smart pills (movie over!) For one thing, it takes more brains and skill to disable than to kill. Early on we are fed the idea that Mr Cross is of substandard intelligence without these little pills. Later we are told that if he survives being given a virus he won't need the pills anymore. The problem is that it's coming from all directions and doesn't stay with an idea (at least a good idea) long enough to make a connection, something to identify with. Jeremy Renner was like the energizer bunny on meth. Rachel provided the emotional connection and some stability. The only other thing I can say in a positive way was the relationship development between Dr Shearling and Cross. Go Matt!"
"owlglass","10","4","8","4 January 2013"," Finally, a decent Ludlum flick!
","Here's the lowdown: (a) I liked this movie a lot, (b) liked it better than even The Bourne Identity, which was the only moderately likable movie in the first trilogy anyway, and (c) thought that it was much more in the spirit, if not in the plot line of Ludlum's books. Here's a bit of rationale for these statements. First of all I actually read the original novels, and the Jason Bourne of the original trilogy of movies had little to do, except for general plot-points and miscellaneous McGuffins with Ludlum's. The novels were completely perverted in the scripts when they killed off Marie in The Bourne Supremacy. She was such an integral part of the life of the Jason Bourne character of the novels that I was totally flabbergasted at the screw-ups with the scripts. Then there were Matt Damon and Franka Potente, neither of whom came even close to being the Jason and Marie of the novels. Nothing against Damon and Potente per se; they just didn't fit. Period. And then came Jeremy Brenner and Rachel Weisz and it was like ""WOW! They did something right for once."" Maybe the plots weren't even close to anything Ludlum, but the characters certainly were much, much more like the Jason and Marie I recall from the novels. And characters are, after all, at the heart of everything. Plus, of course, the awfully pretentious and thoroughly nauseating Greengrass cinematography was gone, and so we ended up with a truly enjoyable flick. And, no, I definitely do NOT want to see a movie where Damon joins Brenner. In fact, here's a chance to pick some storyline from the original novels and let Brenner and Weisz run with it. And keep her alive for goodness' sake!"
"martimer","1","6","14","17 February 2013"," I want 206 minutes and $15 back. (Spoiler alerts)
","Just finished this and it was awful. The two lead actors did a fairly good job with their characters but were beaten down by multiple plot devices and egregiously awful scripting.<br/><br/>The story is nearly incoherent, with things just sort of happening as needed. For example, at one point all agents in the program are killed to end the damage, and yet when an agent is needed to go get the one that got away, there just happens to be an extra agent. What makes it more ludicrous is that part of the reason the program is being shut down is for instability in the operatives and this mysterious extra agent is even more unstable than the agent he is sent to kill. Woo HOO I am glad I was not in that writer's meeting!<br/><br/>Lots of very bad dialog. ""We have to get this DONE!"" (fist pounding on the table.) Very dramatic, heavy handed and ultimately unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The plot is given out amidst action sequences in a slow and meandering manner. The viewers are not really sure what is going on until almost halfway through the movie and then we sort of get to see whom to root for. Then we get to sit through several pointless dramatic sequences where the protagonists perform miraculous escapes. In the end, they get away and the movie ends.<br/><br/>Dreadful."

There is no chemistry between the leads (while they are great actors, they are given nothing to work with)! The pacing is awful, The script is dull, the climax is both long and boring. We were promised a fight between Renner and another agent. That never happens. unless you count jumping rooftops and shaky ,drawn out bike chases as a ""climax"".<br/><br/>By the time this movie was over, I ran like the screen was on fire.

Average<br/><br/>Overall the film is watchable, but very long and drawn out, there are some good action sequences but the overall point of the movie is useless.<br/><br/>It only gets interesting towards the end and you can tell there will be another movie, but you sense they are only creating more sequels for the sake of making tons of money not for the sake of a good film with a good plot"

","Can you imagine Bond without James Bond? Or Batman without Batman? How about The Bourne Legacy without Jason Bourne? How about The Bourne Legacy without the quality, impact, intelligence or lasting impression of the original Bourne trilogy? How can it be Bourne without Bourne? How can it lack so much when the writer/director, Tony Gilmore, wrote the previous three Bournes? Let's start with the tagline: There was never just one. We already know that. Well, those of us who watched the trilogy, witnessed numerous Operation Treadstone agents attempt to kill Jason Bourne in Identity and then the uncovering of Blackbriar in Ultimatum. Didn't Gilmore read his work as preparation before milking the cash cow once again? Robert Ludlum must be rotating wildly in his grave.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy apparently expands Ludlum's universe and portrays the debacle that is Operation Outcome, following the exploits of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) while the CIA is doing its utmost to bump off Bourne and sweep the increasing pile of doo-doo under the rug. One of the big cheeses decides everyone in Operation Outcome should die (déjà vu, anyone?) and so Cross goes on the run, picks up scientist babe Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who has just survived a massacre in the laboratory, and proceeds to kill lots of bad people with fists, feet, kitchen utensils and, probably, rolled up magazines.<br/><br/>It's pretty much what you watched across the real Bourne films but with substantially less clarity. The Bourne Legacy is a noisy, messy, cluttered film that resembles the almost-flawless trilogy and mimics it frequently (the opening scene sees Cross floating in water, stationary, before swimming down to the depths – it doesn't make sense but get used to it) without saying anything new or creating its own identity.<br/><br/>Post-film, I couldn't even remember the name of the protagonist and had to check IMDb to find out who the Bourne-copy was. While images of the original three films are still strong in my mind, I can only recall a general blur of chases, fights and explosions from The Bourne Legacy and don't really care.<br/><br/>The cast are adequate, there are numerous role reprisals and some (Paddy Considine most obviously) will have been paid again without having to set foot on set. Renner is a rising star and deservedly so and Weisz is always watchable whether giving us award-winning sincerity (The Constant Gardener) or visual bubblegum (The Mummy). But that isn't enough.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is fun, it is disposable and it filled a couple of hours one Sunday night, but no matter how exciting it is, no matter how good an actor Renner and Weisz are, this isn't Bourne.<br/><br/>When The Bourne Identity crashed onto our screens in 2002, reviewers went wild declaring 'It out Bonds Bond'. Then came Casino Royale and there was no more talk about it. Nobody is making those claims about The Bourne Legacy. Maybe they've already seen the trailer for Skyfall.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"duncan-gordon11","5","5","11","19 August 2012"," Missing the 'Bourne' factor.
","THis movie reminded me of so many other chase movies. The thing that made the first 3 Bourne movies stand out was, they were trying to get him before he got them. THis movie lacked a number of other things that made me just about walk out before the end. Firstly the intensity of this Bourne movie - no where near the same as the others. Next - the fight scenes - choreography left wanting, too dark to see what was going on, could barely see one scene. Last - good movies have good 1 on 1 good guy bad guy scenes, and a near death experience from one of those for the good guy, lets just say you will be disappointed with the last action/chase scene. Overall, it really missed the mark for anyone expecting a good powerful movie from the Bourne stable. And Ed Norton wasn't the guy for the top job in my opinion. Doesn't have a voice that instils fear, or command. 5/10."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","5","5","11","19 August 2012"," The Bourne Legacy (2012)
","The Bourne Franchise was incredibly solid, consistent, and awesome in every possible way. It ended on a high and should have stopped there, but even without Damon and Greengrass the franchise started again. This time we follow a different agent in a different government program. After the news of Jason Bourne breaks, the new operation decides to shut down which means killing everyone. The film takes ages to get going. It establishes itself as running at the same time as certain events in The Bourne Ultimatum while also trying to introduce Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, Edward Norton's government man, and Rachel Weisz's scientist. It's almost an hour before any action or any connection between these plot strands is established. Renner is fine in the role but his character just isn't likable. He kills mercilessly and just hungers after more drugs. The climax of the scene felt like an extended mid-way chase and then the film just ends, after having undone some of the closure at the end of Ultimatum. The action in OK but we have seen it all and not just in the Bourne films. There are also obvious moments of useless CGI including a bizarre scene with wolves. Quite why the wolves are included is anyone's guess. Cross even points out that wolves don't track humans, so why are they? I watched The Bourne Ultimatum the night before seeing this and all throughout I wiished I was watching it again. I also find it hard to remember any particular moment worthy of the franchise in this entire film. It isn't bad, it's better than some action films, but it could have been its own franchise without having to live up to such classic actioners."
"evan_harvey","5","5","11","18 August 2012"," Poorly executed & average
","The short version: started out interesting, ended dull.<br/><br/>The long: Jeremy Renner steps up as another Treadstone assassin, but he's hampered by the lack of decent script. Aside from an interesting initial 15 minutes, it ends up being the same story as the other 3 Bourne films: a US government assassin on the run from a bunch of other US assassins who want to kill him, is thrown together with an attractive woman, and who both manage to escape to the tropics with a FU message to Uncle Sam.<br/><br/>The problem here is that it's the same story. For the fourth time. Yes, there is a difference in the details, but not enough to make it worthwhile. Renner does an decent job as the new ""hero"", and so does the lovely Rachel Weiss. The stunts and set pieces are okay, but largely seen-it-before. The chase scene on the rooftops brought back memories of the excellent opening to ""Casino Royale"", but it was nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>The film takes place around the time of the 2nd Matt Damon Bourne film, but that's all it really has in connection to it, and after 15 minutes, any opportunity for a different kind of Bourne film is irretrievably lost. After that point the script devolves into a very generic story that fails to gain any sort of momentum. There's some little exploration of who Renner was before the Treadstone/Alcon drugs etc, but it's really just a plot point rather than a story.<br/><br/>Average film. Could have better used the $125M to feed starving children. 5 out of 10."
"thefilmguy7","6","5","11","17 August 2012"," The Boring Legacy
","I will admit that there was some good action beats, though most of them were reused from the previous films. I'll even admit that Renner was good in the movie. <br/><br/>However, almost every element that made the original trilogy great was absent here. The sense of urgency that made the other movies so well paced is gone. The awesome trademark Bourne music that beats like a clock is gone and is replaced with totally boring and forgettable crap. Instead of moving quickly and constantly making the audience engaged in a feeling of danger this movie seems comfortable hanging around in unnecessary scenes that don't really move the plot too much. Most movies move quickly through transitional scenes like going through an airport, but this movie takes about 15 minutes on it. The whole time you're just waiting for the movie to get to the point but it never really does. Nothing is really accomplished by the end other than one really uninteresting and drawn-out story point. It takes the movie 2 hours and 15 minutes to accomplish something that most movies get to about midway through. This gives most movies the chance to then build to some kind of greater goal, but not this one. <br/><br/>And the final kicker, and this should be a big one to fans of the series, they totally make everything that Bourne fought, sacrificed, and bled for in the previous trilogy meaningless. You know that awesome climax and resolution to Ultimatum where Bourne finally got the upper hand? How satisfied it felt as a fan of the series to finally see him complete his goal? Yeah they pretty much wipe that clean and stomp all over it in this one. Apparently everything that Bourne fought for didn't work and the previous three films were pretty much pointless. Thanks for spitting in the face of the fans. The Bourne Legacy my butt."
"sam_liverpool_rule","8","5","11","16 August 2012"," Amazing Job, But A Few Faults
","The Bourne legacy was a great addition to the Bourne franchise. Jeremy Renner does an excellent job as Aaron Cross and the whole cast do some amazing acting. The only downside to this almost perfect film is that the beginning is quite confusing (even if you have seen all 3 original films) and the ending lacks imagination. Although you may think this would ruin the film, it certainly does not. Throughout the film there are some great fight scenes, epic chase scenes and scenes synonymous to the Bourne series. Overall there is great acting and some memorable action scenes, which make this film what it is. It was an enjoyable film and i would be happy to see a sequel."
"samadkins","4","5","11","13 August 2012"," Just doesn't feel like Bourne
","I will keep my review straight and to the point. Watch the first three films (as I did) then go watch The Bourne Legacy. The movie just doesn't feel the same. No adrenaline, no amazing gun scenes (ok the house was decent), followed by the weakest ending I could imagine. Really? The guy on the bike was supposed to be the best agent they ever put into the field and yet he gets ousted by the doctor. Where is the agent on agent fight scenes? Where is the brink of death feeling and close calls? No wonder Matt didn't want anything to do with this film. The first Bourne film I almost fell asleep watching. What a disappointment."
"vicarious_tool","6","5","11","11 August 2012"," Decent but ordinary.
","There's nothing special about the film, just a replacement of characters from the original trilogy. In fact considering the length of the film you'd expect it to pack a story that is complete in itself, even if it was just a part of a possible series to follow, but it seemed rather incomplete to me.<br/><br/>That apart Rachel Weisz does a good job in the film, but personally I like Damon as Bourne much more than Renner as Aaron Cross. Also, there are some minor differences in the story line so it is not altogether boring. That along with some nice action sequences makes the film watchable and a decent time-killer(if you can spare some) on the whole."
"rgkarim","Null","5","11","10 August 2012"," A New Trilogy Begins
","Another weekend ,another movie and this time I'm reviewing none other than the latest additions to the Bourne series, the Bourne Legacy. Now while I am a fan of the original trilogy, I had my doubts that a fourth installment would be able to fit in with its predecessors. However, the action I've seen in the trailers for the last few months held some promise that the same adrenaline rushing scenes would be in this movie. So is this Matt Damon lacking sequel worth the hype, or should the series have stayed concluded as was promised years ago? I hope to answer that question below. <br/><br/>I guess the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the Bourne series is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Well aside from a few photo ideas, and a brief shot of his gun, there is little to do with the agent who caused so much chaos. Although his actions are the cause for the plot of this movie, the movie instead focuses on Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) an agent who has been deemed one of the best agents in his project. Although he has been complacent in his training and missions, the head of the department and new villain Eric Byer (Edward Norton) has decided to clean up their mistakes by eliminating the other Bourne agents. Cross however, manages to elude his captors and soon becomes the prey of the organization alongside one of his creators Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Despite what you might be thinking, Cross was a fitting character to enter the series. Like many of his roles, Renner did his homework for this movie and settled into the spy occupation just fine. However, instead of being the elite, stoic, plays by the book agent we saw in Mission Impossible 4 and goes into the rather clever and improvising killer. Renner uses his calm demeanor to ruthlessly execute his victims, which adds a layer of terror and threat to an already dangerous position. The fact that he knows how to deliver his lines with a deep intensity also makes him a little more bad-a$$ than Bourne. Unfortunately the directors decided to also make Cross a drug addict in this movie, so Renner had to practice being a little psychotic dependency as well. Unlike Nicholas Cage's acid trip in Ghost Rider though, Renner happens to act dependent without going overboard. The dependency just makes his mission more urgent and gives his character a weakness to his otherwise superman persona instead of making him do stupid antics that mimic the entire Project X movie. It's a good character development skill, but there could have been other weakness Bourne could have had. As for Weisz, well the actress still has her moves down and still looks stunning in just about every scene with her element withstanding hair. Fans of hers will be happy to see her return in full glory; essentially she is a non-British Evie minus the ancient Egyptian weapons. <br/><br/>As for the action of the movie, well there have been some cutbacks in that department. Legacy is a bit slower pace at the beginning focusing on more back story and catch up than actual action. A few shots of Cross' training are interspersed through an opening dialog of readouts, medications, statistics, and of course how deadly Bourne is. The background information that was missing from the first installments was nice to hear as it explained a lot about the political games involved in this project. Even the science made some sense, though a lot of it was Hollywood magic at its finest, but those who don't like the biochemistry jargon and techniques will find it boring. Despite the interesting information though, there was no reason editing couldn't have tightened up the dialog and made some cuts to the two hours and fifteen minute film. You may even find yourself dozing off here or there as you count the minutes until the hunt begins. <br/><br/>However once the prolonged introduction is done and the wheels are set into motion, the pace of the film picks up. Cross' skills are even more creative than Bourne's as he uses his superior ingenuity to outsmart his superiors. Those who have seen the trailer may remember the nail trap, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as Cross has more moves than a DDR dancer. Combine his ingenuity with fast paced kung fu, expert wielding of high powered guns, and a fitting soundtrack to add some depth, and you get some decent action scenes that the world has missed. Perhaps the only thing that could have made the action better was to extend the fight scenes a little longer than they were. What they lacked in fights though they made in chase. Renner and Weisz must have practiced their sprinting techniques for this film since most of the action was involved in navigating streets at top speed. A few of these chases were exciting, most likely due to the use of vehicles and loud instrument music, yet some just felt a little over-dramatic or pointless. I guess when you up the skill level of the enemies, i.e. replacing an army of civilian cops with some elite members of the squad, you have to know your limits. Regardless fans are sure to enjoy Cross's moves and be satisfied with where the series is going. Bourne Legacy is a decent sequel that helps fill in some gaps while opening new uncertainties. The writing staff has some questions to answer in the next film, which there is sure to be, and also needs to do more with what they introduced in this film. Perhaps then my wishes for action scenes will come true, but until then this is satisfying enough. My scores for this film are the following: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5"
"BBogus","9","2","3","11 January 2019"," Still the best one in the franchise (even 6 yrs later).

"wartuna","9","2","3","7 April 2018"," Mostly great
","Cutting in old Bourne scenes did more to weaken this than anything. The movie could have stood on its own. Great acting, impossible scenes (especially Alaska), great action, breathtaking cinematography, and an interesting plot add up to an experience much like the ""other"" Bourne series. Although I fail to understand why so many field and lab assets needed to be burned to the ground, other Bourne movies have a similar premise although not on so grand a scale. There so many despicable characters here, it is consistent with the reality of an administration and Congress gone stupid. Suspend all disbelief and enjoy this movie. I just wish I could take off as do Marta and Aaron do at the end."

I honestly don't understand why people don't like this film and don't consider it part of the series.
It is written and directed by the person who wrote all the films,how can it be unofficial or a copy?
Of course I give no spoilers but this is a great spy film.
Renner is a better actor than Damon and Rachel Weisz is great in this.
I realise she might not need the money but she should act more.

","This was pretty good. A decent story, good stunts and action. I really liked the inclusion of the parallel time line this runs on, with flashes to the three other Jason Bourne movies.<br/><br/>The new hero here is Jeremy Renner, a scientifically engineered, genetically enhanced CIA agent who goes on the run when his program is cancelled and everyone included is ordered eliminated. Along the way he kidnaps/rescues the research scientist (Rachel Weisz) who helped create him.<br/><br/>The story opens in Alaska where a bearded Renner as Aaron Cross is training 'Rocky 4' style, climbing snow capped mountains, doing tasks in very cold water and hanging out in the snow. Lots of running, some OK fight scenes...not cool Jason Bourne style but good enough. A couple decent chase scenes too with motorcycles through the streets of Manila.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is one of the suits trying to take him out from some office headquarters somewhere bland- he doesn't really add much. Stacy Keach is there and all the other series veterans show up as well; Scott Glen, Joan Allen, Albert Finney."

"iganboas","7","2","3","15 February 2017"," 8.5 - Better than Supremacy and Ultimatum, not as good as Identity
","I felt the need to defend this movie, as it is not at all a bad film; au contraire, it's a very good one, and I personally find it to be better than its two immediate predecessors.<br/><br/>From a storytelling point of view, I find that Supremacy and Ultimatum, while both are very good movies, follow the same standard formula first established in 2002 by Identity, and therefore, they lack the originality factor (yes, I know they're based on the Robert Ludlum novels, but I've never read any of them, so my critique stands), whereas I feel Legacy tells an original story in the already established world that feels fresh and plausible: it tells the story of a black ops agent from another project similar to Treadstone called Operation Outcome, and how the events of the first three films affect him and everyone else involved in Outcome.<br/><br/>The action is filmed just as badly as in Supremacy and Ultimatum, where the quick cuts, the shakiness and the weird camera angles make it very hard for you to understand what's going on. The locations on this movie, however, might be the most spectacular yet in the first 4 Bourne films, in particular the Alaskan wilderness.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are great and relatable, and the performances, specially from Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, are amazing. The chemistry between the two was spot on.<br/><br/>Edward Norton serves the part as the evil government guy in the computer room chasing our hero that we've come to expect from the Bourne films already. <br/><br/>The film is tense and intriguing and keeps you invested in the story. You genuinely care about our two leads and their outcome (no pun intended).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a welcome entry in the series, and brings in a much needed breath of fresh air to the saga. Really hope to see Aaron Cross coming back and teaming up with Jason Bourne at some point in the future. Definitely go see this one, guys."
"Sisiutil","5","2","3","24 May 2015"," Pales in comparison to the other Bourne films
","I'm a fan of the Bourne series so I had high hopes for this film despite the absence of Jason Bourne/Matt Damon. Unfortunately, while the movie had some appealing elements it fails to manage them properly.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the exceedingly slow start to the film. It takes an intolerably long time to get the main plot going; there's too much unnecessary exposition and too many superfluous ""look how cool our hero is"" action sequences. Furthermore, the best thing about the film is the genuine chemistry between Weisz and Renner, two very talented actors I'd like to see together again in a better vehicle. I'm amazed that the filmmakers could be so blind as to the appeal of the two leads that they let the movie meander for something like a third of its length before bringing them together.<br/><br/>Other problems include the lack of any genuine opposition for Aaron Cross (Renner). A supposedly superior assassin is eventually sent after him, but much too late and with too little character development or screen time. Compare that to Karl Urban's genuinely menacing turn in The Bourne Ultimatum.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, Edward Norton is miscast as the chief spook chasing Cross. He's too young (despite the obviously-artificial grey in his hair) to bring the needed gravitas to the role. Again, I couldn't help comparing him unfavourably to similar Bourne antagonists such as Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and David Strathairn, all of whom had the necessary lined faces and weight of years to sell the idea that they're men who've given their lives--and souls--to a series of dirty jobs in the service of their country, and are therefore willing to cross any moral line, including coldly sentencing their own agents to death.<br/><br/>Finally, as I watched the film, and despite the aforementioned charisma of the two leads, I found myself growing tired of yet another variation of the action hero/damsel in distress trope. I couldn't help thinking what a more interesting movie this would have been if the roles had been reversed--if Weisz had been the uber-capable agent and Renner was the fish-out-of-water scientist reluctantly helping her. Someday, perhaps..."
"brianmellow","9","2","3","18 September 2014"," Excellent Continuation of the Bourne Titles

It is almost as if some of the other user negative reviews are bitching because it doesn't have Matt Damon in it. Really? Legacy continues the great series without missing a beat and fulfills and expands the story line beyond everything we have come to expect from previous Bournes.<br/><br/>Characters are completely engaging, and the plot is very credible. I am never left feeling like any aspect is overblown or silly, the way so many spy movies are. This is a rarity among movies, and one that should be admired and respected."
"CMTiago","8","2","3","3 July 2014"," Elegant replacement, but we miss Bourne himself
","Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has stepped up and I would say that he is a worthy replacement, but it's just not the same thing without Matt Damon and his iconic Bourne character. After a wonderfully constructed trilogy, this franchise enters new territory with a change of characters, but with the same CIA secrecy and the same universe. In this movie, we find out that behind Treadstone and Black Briar, there is another covert program called Outcome that focused on developing bio- weapons that can be used to enhance the skills of their agents. Due to the ripple effects that occurred in the Ultimatum, the people responsible are looking to terminate everything and leave no trace and that ultimately sets up the plot for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Renner's Cross comes into the picture as an agent that escapes this dreadful fate and seeks out Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), another survivor of the clean-up, in order to get the viral treatment he needs to remain mentally and physically stable and therefore able to survive. The lead performances are great as Renner and Weisz expertly play their characters and understand them. Most importantly, Renner is very suitable as a combat expert and while not as awesome as Bourne, the shoes were filled quite nicely. As our CIA chaser, we have Edward Norton giving a good, if slightly less intense than any of the previous performances of this type of character. I'm usually not a critic of Paul Greengrass's shaky cam technique, at least not in Bourne movies, But I must say that Tony Gilroy's approach was an enjoyable and lighter one and I for one liked it. The script is, as you'd expect, a by the book Bourne story and a good one at that.<br/><br/>You might find yourself missing Bourne in this film and I think it would be awesome if Matt Damon could get on board again and perhaps team up with Renner's Cross. As far as this one goes, while it doesn't bring anything new to the franchise, it is still an enjoyable movie and on par with the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"

","As a fan of the Bourne series, I don't understand where they get off using the ""Bourne"" series as part of this title. Yeah, granted, they referenced Treadstone and Blackbriar throughout but that was about it. To me, this just didn't seem like it had anything to do with the original trilogy or even the books; although, I haven't read the books. To me, this just seemed like the writer wanted to try and capitalize on a good thing with the Bourne set.<br/><br/>This one didn't have the drive that the others had, in my opinion. But it did have a good idea in it with how they ran it semi-coinciding with the last one. Kind of a genius move to me but would have been better had it ACTUALLY had something to do with Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in it were up to snuff with the series but they appeared to be a ""blink and you miss it"" kind of fight scenes. The chase scene near the end was a good one with lots of evasive maneuvers by the drivers and good camera work.<br/><br/>Hopefully, if they do a sequel to this one, they do a better job of writing and directing with it than they did with this."
"blanche-2","7","2","3","21 January 2013"," Fantastic acting breathes life into characters
","I'm no expert on action films, so this review will not be as hypercritical or detailed as some others on this site.<br/><br/>I loved the Bourne films. ""The Bourne Legacy"" seeks to trade in on the Bourne name, without Matt Damon, and without Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>This is the fourth installment of the Bourne franchise and evolves around a new main protagonist, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner). The story continues on from the end of the third Bourne movie, and concerns itself with the result of Jason Bourne's exposure of the Blackbriar program.<br/><br/>In this plot, due to the scandal started by Jason Bourne, the government program called Outcome is eliminating their agents and shutting down the program. ""Outcome"" seems to be some sort of amalgamation of Treadstone and Blackbriar. However, their agents have had their chromosomes altered, giving them heightened powers of speed, brain, and brawn. This is done by giving them pills. They change the pills given the agents and, one by one, the agents die.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays Dr. Marta Shearing, a scientist who manages to escape annihilation when there's a shootout in the lab. Cross helps her escape, and the two of them go on the run as they're both marked for death. But Cross needs his medication, or as he tells her, they won't make it. But Marta doesn't have the pills -- in fact, she's a scientist on a need to know basis. The pills are manufactured and stored in Manila. So that's where they go.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the wonderful characterizations developed by Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, this wouldn't be much of a movie. And actually, I found myself concentrating on them rather than the story. Their chemistry is wonderful. The villains were pretty blah -- Stacy Keach and Edward Norton -- both of them a little too straightforward.<br/><br/>There was much discussion here on IMDb about the action sequences. I frankly loved the motorcycle chase - to me, it was breathtaking. As I say, I'm no expert.<br/><br/>What I most remember about the first Bourne film, which I saw in the theater, was the element of surprise -- the type of thing that makes the audience jump a bit off their seats. There wasn't any of that here. The Bourne Legacy was directed by Tony Gilroy, who has been successful in other ventures and certainly knows the Bourne franchise, having written the past scripts and this one. He's less successful here and one suspects the Bourne franchise is out of steam.<br/><br/>If Aaron Cross is going to continue, the stories have to be rethought. Hollywood does this kind of film very well - in this case, the script was a letdown."

The movie also ""Stars"" (Edward Norton) as a retired Colonel who's called in to hunt them down and destroy all evidence of the CIAs involvement in operation Treadstone and Blackbriar. Norton has about fifteen minutes of screen time throughout the movie and all he really does is shout out exposition dialogue nothing more.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching this movie if your looking for a half decent action movie to pass the time with but just don't expect it to be as good as the original Bourne movies because you will probably be a bit disappointed."

","This is the BEST Bourne flick of them all! The special effects like the others are excellent. My kudos go to the writing/script which not only shows the tremendous feats performed admirably by Renner, but also sows together and explains the advanced science and theories used by the agents and technicians. The acting from Renner, Weisz and all the cast, is outstanding! Very believable tale of a scientific breakthrough and the governments abuse of that breakthrough!"

","Yes I loved all of the Bourne movies and I would love to see Matt Damon comeback and do another sequel. But Aaron and Martha seemed to have a real chemistry together, and it would be ashamed to let it go to waist. I did love Aaron, he was incredible and just lighted up the screen. I really believe that there is an audience for both actors (Damon, and Renner) because they were both able to make a connection with the audience. I was secretly rooting for both of them to make it a life and safe until the end of all the Bourne movies. As most people I am sure who saw all the movies. Although, as a girl I wished that they would also be more romantic scenes among all the action. Hoping for the next sequel."
"LukeCustomer2","9","1","1","29 January 2019"," Crackling with action and consequences
","This movie gets a bad rap and I don't understand why. This movie follows another CIA program Outcome (to Bourne's Treadstone). The Outcome agents are trained to have more compassion / emotion and have the added help of being sort of mini super heros. All receiving a virus which gives them an extra 1% smarts and 1% physical ability. The viewer's entry to this is Outcome 5 / Aaron Cross (Jermey Renner). Due to Bourne's activity the decision is made to kill Outcome and everything to do with it. Surviving that, Cross has another problem, he has no medication which he is dependent on. This sets up a great dynamic, severe personal stakes for the main character. It also sets up a race for Aaron, he must get the medication before the powers that be realize he survived.
This makes for a really great film. Crackling suspense and action sequences with real consequences.<br/><br/>The other main character is Dr. Marta Shering. She is a medical doctor that has treated Aaron in the Outcome program and can get him the medication he needs. Such a better female character than anyone in the Borne movies. Yes, she needs Aaron, she isn't a CIA agent but she can use a gun and is pretty smart on her own.<br/><br/>In fact, something good about this film is that everyone is smart. Everyone going after Aaron is smart and act as if hey are smart people trying to get him with very neutral motives.<br/><br/>They don't seem very interested to make a sequel to this movie but I would like to see it."

"ThomasDrufke","7","1","1","29 July 2016"," As a Bourne Film, It's No Good. But as an Action Film? Solid.
","As the 4th Bourne film in the series, 'Legacy' isn't all that inventive or revealing. But as a spy-action-thriller, it's pretty solid. And Aaron Cross is hardly as interesting as Bourne, but Renner's charismatic presence is more than enough to get by.<br/><br/>In the age of shared universes, Universal decided it was a good idea to make another Bourne film in 2012, after years of trying to get a 4th Damon film off the ground. While the script and direction from Tony Gilroy relies heavily on the same tropes of the series, I can't say it's a film that shouldn't have been made. It should have just deviated from the source material even more than it did.<br/><br/>With that said, I like the fact that the film takes place at and around the same time that 'Ultimatum' did. The approach to have Jason Bourne's actions impact Cross' and the rest of the Black Ops agents was a smart one. It's a far better decision than having Renner be the re-casted Bourne. But as Cross, Renner is quite good. I'm not sure he got cast in all of these franchises, but he doesn't seem to disappoint.<br/><br/>Renner is complemented by a powerful performance from Rachel Weisz, who plays Cross' former doctor. Much like Bourne and Marie in 'Identity', they have great chemistry together and Weisz thankfully more with her character than what's written on the page. Edward Norton plays the new suspicious C.I.A figure, which has become a classic Bourne trope at this point. Although I think Norton is a good actor, he didn't do anything as Eric Byer that impressed me all that much. With minimal screen time together, it was tough to grapple onto Byer's perusal of Bourne.<br/><br/>The action and cinematography are much easier to watch without Greengrass' infamous shaky cam. With that said, there is far less action mixed with a slower pace. The film doesn't really become interesting until 30 or 40 minutes in.<br/><br/>In all, The Bourne Legacy largely handcuffs itself and falls into the series tropes too often to be considered on the level that the previous 3 films are. But good performances from its leads and some interesting action makes it a nice cable watch.<br/><br/>+Renner & Weisz<br/><br/>+Solid action<br/><br/>-Handcuffs itself<br/><br/>-Falls into the same tropes<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"anaconda-40658","7","1","1","19 August 2015"," The Legacy Continues.
","The Bourne Legacy (2012): Dir: Tony Gilroy / Cast: Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Joan Allen, Stacy Keach: While the reputation of Jason Bourne is threatening corrupt agencies, what audiences may be reluctant to accept is Jeremy Renner playing a character who isn't Bourne. This all occurs while references and images of Matt Damon are made. Why not make Renner Bourne? It worked for the multiple actors who played James Bond. Renner emerges from the Atlantic wilderness where he was fighting off wolves. He needs a particular medicine made at an outlet where a sudden act of violence occurs that leaves several dead. Renner is part of the same agency as Bourne and is a type of super soldier whom the agency attempts to terminate. Renner holds strong under the illusion of marketing suggesting a Bourne identity while clearly not so. Rachel Weisz holds her own as someone who worked at the lab where the medicine is manufactured. A price is on her head as well and she becomes resourceful particularly during a motorcycle chase where she becomes instrumental in offing a pursuer. Edward Norton has a somewhat limited role as someone at the agency who struggles to keep this chaos under wraps while being fed the same Bourne subplot that viewers never get to see. This is a well made action thriller by director Tony Gilroy who made the excellent Michael Clayton. This does not measure up with that film due to themes that are traded for action stimulation. This is a pointless exercise without the actual Bourne character but at least the legacy is worthy entertainment. Score: 7 / 10"
"t-viktor212","9","1","1","1 July 2015"," Just enjoy it.
","I noticed there's a quite extended fanbase complaining about the existence of this movie. If you liked the previous ones, there is a quite big possibility you might like this one too. From cinematrographical point of view and action, it's of a very similar tone as the first trilogy of movies. <br/><br/>The main difference is what makes people not like this movie: you don't have Jason Bourne as the main character, instead Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner. Because of this I've seen in many reviews an overly though criticism. First of all, the slightly sci-fi like twist of the film. Which is really slight. Seriously, mission impossible is truly sci-fi. This had a 1/100 amount of sci-fi content which made many people hate it. I guess The bourne viewers mostly are sci-fi haters. I'm not, but still I can assure that compared to other movies the sci-fi content is extremely limited, and is not visual too. Besides, this Sci-fi content I'm talking about, is not that ""impossible"". Yet another thing about the bourne legacy is that it seems more a new beginning to a trilogy, rather than a follow-up to the bourne ultimatum. The bourne ultimatum was quite a concluding movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow, if you don't have these limitations, you'll find out that you will quite like the bourne legacy."
"anthonymichaelbangert","7","1","1","6 February 2015"," Ten Minutes of Action
","The fourth film in the Bourne franchise takes place during Bourne Ultimatum, and mentions Jason's name a handful of times, but nothing else about this movie really has anything to do with the character. When the events depicted in Ultimatum are started, anyone involved with any of the projects like the one Jason Bourne was part of are killed off. Enter Aaron Cross, an agent from one such project, who uses experimental drugs to enhance his performance (a part of the project). He was lost for a while, and away when the killings of all the men and women were happening. Now he's running low on the drugs, and teams up with a doctor to get the enhancers permanently in him, while avoiding being killed. This action film has a whole lot of talking, and very little action. In a two hour and fifteen minute movie, there are about ten minutes of action. The cast is great, and the acting is pretty good, but the script is terrible. This cash-grab movie was not as good as it could have been, and should have never been done.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 10- The score was action packed, even if the movie was not.<br/><br/>Script: 0- Nothing about this script made sense, or worked. It was a jumbling of events that just made sense.<br/><br/>Originality: 10- The ideas in this movie were there, and different, just not executed well.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 5- The shaky cam worked decently, but there were definitely strange camera angles and movements that just did not work.<br/><br/>Casting: 9- Almost everyone in this movie was casted well, and Jeremy Renner is a great actor in place of the void of Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Acting: 7- The actors could have been a lot better, but weren't the worst.<br/><br/>Overall: 6.8"
"CinematicInceptions","5","1","1","14 December 2014"," Weak story and script, but decent acting and execution.
","While the technical aspects of this film were done just fine, I cannot call it a well executed movie. The story and script were quite lacking in multiple places and had unremarkable potential to begin with. Out of the original Bourne movies, I have only seen the first on, but the story in that had a very good base plot, natural and visible growth, and plenty of room to go into a sequel while remaining complete.<br/><br/>There wasn't much of that in this reboot. The whole plot was based off of a couple of pills that were important for an unknown reason. Perhaps it was explained and I missed it, but even so, it was a rather flimsy basis. We saw that everyone who took the new pills died since their organization wanted all of the ""Bourne Projects"" terminated. However, I felt that this was insufficiently explained as well. From what I know of the second and third Bourne movies, I could guess at their motive for poisoning all of those people, but the fact does not change that the motive was insufficiently explained. It inflicts the same sense of incompletion that we got from Mission Impossible 3 when there is no explanation of what the ""rabbit's foot"" is. The last half-hour of the movie involves Aaron Cross being chased by the assassin, and this also feels incomplete. The whole sequence where the assassin chases Cross through the streets of the Philippines city felt like it belonged in the middle of the movie instead of the climax. Once the chase is finished, it feels like there is more to come. I thought that there was going to be another thirty minutes or so after the climatic scene. There really isn't a good reason for Ed Norton and company to stop chasing Aaron Cross after he takes out the assassin apart from the risk of losing whatever other mercenaries they send after him.<br/><br/>The characters were also pretty weak, though well acted. The introduction of Aaron Cross comes over just fine, but after that it kind of goes downhill. His obsession about getting a refill on his pills is presented in a way that makes him seem almost like a drug addict. Dr. Shearing's character was also introduced naturally, but once she started getting interrogated, her character arc declined. The interrogation scenes with her seemed too drawn out and I felt like her character became annoying at this point. I won't make any definite statements, but I will say that her character and the way she fits into the story could potentially cause annoyance for prospective viewers too. The progression of the relationship between Cross and Shearing was rather unnatural. They both seem rather averse to each other at first, and nothing that comes after that makes it plausible that they are implied to end up together at the end. Our only other main character is played by Ed Norton, who, like our other two main roles, does a fine job acting. I suppose there isn't anything outstanding to criticize for his character apart from his role being a rather stereotypical government antagonist.<br/><br/>On the more positive side, the spy style action is decent with some infiltration, a couple of gun fights, and the extended chase scene at the end. Other spy elements come into play with the way Cross and Shearing have to disguise themselves to get on, through, and off of the plane ride to the Philippines. The beginning training exercise is also pretty good in terms of spy elements, though there is little strict action here. One spy movie element that is not present at any point in this movie is the use of fancy spy gear like in the Mission Impossible and James Bond movies. This isn't necessarily good or bad, but it is something to be conscious of going into the movie. <br/><br/>So in brief, it feels sort of like the Bourne Identity, but with a much weaker storyline and less likable and convincing characters. The action and technical execution are slightly redeeming qualities, but not enough to override the points where it lacks. I suppose another redeeming aspect is that there is no forced attempt at humor to frequently annoy viewers. So watch it if you can't find anything that looks better and want something relatively exciting and entertaining, but if you want a solid storyline, you are almost guaranteed to find a better one from any given selection. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."

","Holy, batcrap. I grew up reading the Bourne novels, and watched the tragedy that was Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. The first two Matt Damon Bourne flicks were very good; the third sort of declined. And then we got to this thing. I was enthused about it, even though it was a departure from the Bourne-concept itself. And I'm not sure who Jeremy Renner's agent is these days, and while I find him to be a very good actor, but you can't sling a dead cat right now without hitting a movie that he is in. And he tried, I think, to make the best out of whatever poorly functioning script writer put this one together. The same goes true for Rachel Weisz, who is normally a quality actress and is beautiful to boot. Her job in this movie was basically to cry and have her cheek quiver. I always list my reviews as containing spoilers, in case I give too much info out, but I really try to avoid such. But let me say this: The first 30 minutes of the movie could have been compressed into about 3 minutes. The same is true for a 10 minute series of nothing but swiping security badges at doors. Truly, 10 minutes of walk, swipe, walk, walk, swipe, walk, swipe--oh crap, swiped it wrong--swipe again, walk, walk, swipe. And then there is a motorcycle chase at the end of the film. This would be a good time to get up, go to the restroom, and come back, because you will miss nothing exceptional here for 10 minutes or so. A few good stunts, and some very good fight scenes. If they had launched a Bourne-themed hour long TV show (and let's hope they don't do this), they could have compressed this movie into the pilot by eliminating all of the crap and I still would not watch the second episode."

","So first up, like some other reviews dictate, the acting here was pretty good.<br/><br/>Now, on to the story and script. Did you know that TBL is based on a new series of books (there are 4) written by someone who did't write the original 3? It is. Because of this, the story here is terrible and it could be argued that there really isn't one. If you told me that I would have believed you.<br/><br/>Renner and Wiese try their best to make this movie work but it can not be saved. Trying to shoehorn so many references from the previous movies and establish new characters and sub-plots, coupled with poor direction, make this movie comparable to a trash can outside a nice resturaunt. It is full of stuff people used to like but is now compiled into a heap of undigestable crap.<br/><br/>Give this a watch and a try if you love the Bourne movies, maybe you'll like it.

","Ike: The Bourne Legacy has a theatrical thumbprint like the others, but this isn't a bad thing. This thumbprint has steroids!<br/><br/>Aaron Cross is stronger, faster, and quieter than our buddy Bourne. The writing is fast paced, leaving out a lot of the story with all the details. However, the action is heavier and faster and precisely what a majority of movie goers are looking for. This same type of sequel progression happened when we received Daniel Craig as 007. But don't misinterpret my comparison, I am not complaining.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy's visionary direction is like a linear line with the Bourne series, always going up. In every action movie Tony has directed, he is emphatic on making an emotional connection with viewers, an important ingredient in every successful movie. Even with more action and less dialogue he was able to accomplish just that in The Bourne Legacy. But dialogue loving freaks, screen writing nuts, and plot huggers beware twists aren't as prevalent in this one.<br/><br/>One area that was strategically average was in the cinematography. Almost all the action scenes were heavily cut, mildly choppy, and close up creating a stronger sense of quicker action. By doing this you lose out on some real quality opportunities in the realm of action. The fight scenes are less sexy and more wham. But that is self admittedly petty in the grand scheme of things. The Bourne Legacy was extremely well done!<br/><br/>***I am not just a science experiment, but steroids and adderall made me this way<br/><br/>Cinematography: 7/10 Writing: 8/10 Acting: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10<br/><br/>The Rehash Critics -Ike"
"zetes","7","4","9","30 December 2012"," A worthy follow-up to the original Bourne trilogy
","Seemingly a cash-in to keep a popular series alive, The Bourne Legacy turned out quite a bit better than I expected it to be. Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) is a good choice to take the reins, and it connects well with the series' ongoing story. It's kind of a side thing rather than a true sequel. Jeremy Renner plays another super-soldier from the Treadstone program. After Jason Bourne's attempt at escaping his handlers, the Treadstone program is hastily canceled by the government, which basically means that their super-soldiers are to be terminated. Renner is the only survivor of that group. He's now out of the special drug the government gives him to keep him going, and he goes after Rachel Weisz, a doctor who has frequently worked with him in the past. Weisz was also targeted by the government, since she knows too much, and she and Renner escape together, fleeing to Manilla to search for the drugs. Meanwhile, a team at the CIA (including Edward Norton, Stacy Keach and others) are trying to find them and take them out. There are some particularly chilling sequences, most notably Zeljko Ivanek's freakout, which might prove hard to watch after recent gun violence in the United States, but that also makes it even more horrifying. The action sequences are just as well done as the previous movies (those who hated the Greengrass Bourne movies will be happy to know that Gilroy drops the shaky cam almost entirely - it's still hand-held, but barely noticeable). The film does get bogged down in some of the talkier sequences, which often seem to be filled with a bunch of techno-babble, but when it moves, man, it moves. Renner is a fine lead, and Weisz is very good, too."
"Elliot-ball02","6","4","9","30 August 2012"," Great Acting but no plot or conclusion to the film
","i saw this film today hoping that it would be new and exciting however i was very disappointed with it. Both Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are great actors which is clearly seen as they try to make the best of this film and their shallow characters. However, the film is still a big let down and is ironically giving the Bourne franchise a bad 'legacy'.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film started off okay, giving us a good build up, although it was quite slow to really kick off. From there on, there was no plot. It was simply avoid getting shot which frustrated me because i expected a big story line as it was a Bourne film. It felt to me like the whole film was one big build-up to a big finale that never happened. It's as if they cut the last half an hour of the film off. Even though the action scene's had the fast vehicles and gunfire that the Bourne films usually have, which was some enjoyment, there was no clever escape plans or scheme's to kill the bad guy.<br/><br/>Finally, there was no villain. I pretty sure it was supposed to be Edward Norton but his great acting talents were wasted. All he did was sit in an office and bark orders, if i remember correctly, i don't even think he left the CIA building. This is a double fault really because obviously if you have no clear villain then how are you going to have a good ending. For example, in the other Bourne films there is always one man who is the clear villain, Alexander Conklin (Identity), Ward Abbot (Supremacy) and Noah Vosen (Ultimatum). Which is probably why this film had a terrible ending."
"rgblakey","5","4","9","19 August 2012"," There was never just one in the Bourne Legacy
","When word got out that Matt Damon was no longer apart of the Bourne franchise it was a bit of a letdown as they delivered some surprisingly great action films. With the addition of Renner and taking a new direction to the series added some interesting promise of what could be done, but will it work and keep the franchise alive or just be a nail in the coffin to end the franchise? <br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy follows an operative from the same program that gave birth to Jason Bourne who is forced to go on the run. For the most part this is a pretty good addition to the series, but defiantly has some struggling moments. The first half of the film works to set up the whole new series of events and characters, but moves at a snail's pace. They were smart to use both old and new characters for this addition, but the slow build you have to endure could easily push people away from getting to the fun interesting action part of the film. Once things finally start moving it picks up a bit with some great action and interesting development, but still never really delivers the one two punch that the previous entries managed to push out. Renner does a great job with the character, but his loses something without having some mystery to solve. He has his memory and knows what he is doing and it really takes some of what makes the Bourne series so fun away. While there isn't a lot of action, what we do get is pretty intense and well done.<br/><br/>The biggest issue besides the pacing to this film is the seemingly abrupt ending. You spend almost two and half hours with these characters and then it just seems to suddenly end without any big send off. Yeah there is a big action sequence, but nothing that felt like the ending. As the final scene plays you are left there with a sense of ""that's it?"" While there are some major issues, this does have the chance to set up a new direction to the series and does have redeeming qualities, just doesn't deliver as much as it could have.<br/><br/>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"
"kluseba","7","4","9","17 August 2012"," More of the same but on a quite high level
","As a big fan of the Bourne franchise, I was expecting this movie with mixed feelings. I was afraid this movie would only be a rehash of the solid trilogy and give us more of the same but on a lower level than usual. On the other side, I was looking forward to see a new chapter around the conspiracy legacy as I felt that there were still some things left to say and see after the last film.<br/><br/>In the end, I got a mix of both positive and negative expectations. Let's start with the bad points. The story in here really is nothing new and quite predictable from the beginning to the end. There are no twists and there isn't as much sweating action and tension as in the first three movies. I would have liked to see some more innovation in this movie with a more profound script. Even though the character of Jason Bourne is mentioned throughout the flick, I would have liked to see a closer connection to this unfinished story line but maybe that's something that may happen in the future as this new film clearly is a start of a new series if there are no unexpected pitfalls. I might also add that the movie had nevertheless a couple of lengths to get kicked off in its first two thirds. Some people say that the new movie ended when it really started to get intense and that the finish happened to be rather abrupt. This is true as I would have liked to see some sort of a more developed epilogue to this film.<br/><br/>Now, let's point out the positive elements. First of all, the acting of the two main actors is surprisingly good and you really believe these characters. They are maybe not as charismatic as a Franka Potente and a Matt Damon but it's a quite close call. Apart of that, the settings for the new movie are as stunning or even better as in the first three flicks. The chosen locations are the winter world of Alaska, several cities in the United States of America and Manila in the Philippines. I really liked the survival elements of the first third of the movie, the character development that occurred in the second part of the flick and the incredible chasing scenes through the streets and on the rooftops of the city of Manila. Even though the chase was a little bit overlong with around twenty minutes of literally called running time and even though the chase lacked of a true final highlight, I was really impressed by these diverting moments that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.<br/><br/>To keep it short, this movie will divide the fans into two camps. Some might find this beginning of a new era useless and not unique enough to survive. Others will be pleasantly surprised to see a movie that features all the trademarks people liked so much about the franchise. This flick won't win any prices for innovation but it's quite entertaining and makes you want more after the fast paced ending. I was critical and still have some negative things to point out but in the end there were much more positive than negative elements in this movie and I'm looking forward for a possible sequel. <br/><br/>On this level, the Bourne flicks might maybe one day get the same degree of appreciation as the James Bond franchise if Hollywood carries on to write more intriguing screenplays around this phenomenon."
"Troy_Campbell","5","4","9","16 August 2012"," Doesn't add to the Bourne legacy.
","Beginning with a training exercise in Alaska, this sequel spin-off ditches Matt Damon's Jason Bourne (although he remains an off screen presence) in favour of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), a fellow super-assassin trying to be exterminated after the public CIA fallout that concluded The Bourne Ultimatum. The eminently watchable Renner naturally delivers the goods and he capably carries the franchise forward in Damon's absence, however he is let down by a substandard plot that underwhelms when compared to the original trilogy. A rather simplistic story – Cross is in search of more medication whilst attempting to stay alive – it struggles to manufacture tension or intrigue, whilst being quite tacky in its efforts to incorporate the narrative within the existing series. The action is surprisingly scant too; there's only one noteworthy set piece in the first two acts and the climactic motorbike sequence is largely unimpressive. Thankfully Renner, his love-interest Rachel Weisz and pragmatic big bad Edward Norton all step it up a gear and ensure this 'sidequel' doesn't tarnish, whilst ironically, not adding to the Bourne legacy."

So its safe to say I had high expectations. So how was this film? It was good overall but it is a tiny bit disappointing knowing this is from the Bourne series. As a normal, generic spy film it's up there because it is smart and interesting at times and it is acted well and the dialogue was written well but the story was not. They show pictures of Matt Damon to remind us that it is still part of the Bourne series but to me that's just not good enough. I was upset at the lack of Matt Damon in this film but that was not going to ruin it for me. What ruined it was the ENDING! There's a sweet action scene then bam! Credits roll. It leaves you like ""Wha?"" Also, there is a lack of action in this film for me. And I am an substance over action person but the beauty of the Bourne films is that there is a sweet story, some action and more sweet story but this one is story, action, end. To cut it short, Bourne Legacy feels like a grade B Bourne film but a good spy film. Just take away the Bourne from the title."

Plenty of folks complaining about the story but ignore that if you want to simply enjoy a decent well-made action movie.<br/><br/>There's a few twists on the Bourne series that make it interesting enough. It could use a few more fight scenes, they've done a great job on making these seem so realistic in previous movies.<br/><br/>But I'd say this sets up the Bourne series to continue on positively."

","The Bourne films are entertaining, having Damon as a lead lends depth to the mysterious agents. This time Jeremy Renner gives us a more visceral force, and though he's not Superman, he certainly demonstrates that his abilities are special.<br/><br/>In this entry Renner is facing extermination, and he is survival mode for most of the story. Mostly, he is on his own. For the second half of the story he teams up with Dr. Shearing (Weisz), one of the people behind the project who finds herself facing death because of her association to Cross and other agents.<br/><br/>There are some thrilling scenes in the film; some remind us of the tension in Alaska, a place where beauty and danger seem to exist harmoniously, and it doesn't hurt to have a computer-operated drone to raise the tension levels for a couple of the super soldiers.<br/><br/>We visit a few worldwide locations as Col Byer (Norton) expects a clean resolution to his orders. Norton matches Renner in the intensity scale, though his role is different as he represents authority and is ready to justify the means in order to achieve his goals. Everyone of his words drips with authority, arrogance, and there is no room for interpretation or argument.<br/><br/>The final part of the movie has some exciting chases in the heart of Manila, as we see Cross try to escape one very surprising, last-minute adversary, who might prove to be his match. It is in this part that the direction weakens a little because executing this type of scene must be very difficult. It is not bad at all, but there are moments when the editing falters a little bit, and that might weaken the overall effect of this confrontation. The best thing about the film is that it leaves us with a taste for more proving the fact that as long as there is charisma and talent involved, combined with a hero and a villain that are almost equal matches, we do care about what happens up in the screen."

","Sometimes it is a good thing to step back and chill a minute. Even knowing the propensity for this director to use rapid-cutting techniques didn't prepare me for the confusion and, well let's admit it, big fat headache it gave me while at the same time trying to focus on the quivering hand-held camera. Yikes! Just 'cause you know how doesn't mean you have to use all your tricks at the same time. This was a good story that tied onto the Bourne mythos and rebooted the movie franchise with actors who were terrific. Good action sequences and stunts also, so my advice to the director or directors of future Bourne (or will they be Cross?) flix is to trust the viewer to ""get"" the drama without adding in those cinematography gimmicks."

","The Bourne Legacy is an action thriller film directed that are based on Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne novels. It is the fourth installment in the series. The film stars Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton together with franchise veterans Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its events and directed the movie. <br/><br/>Aaron Cross is a member of Operation Outcome,a US Defense Department black ops program which employs pills referred to as chems that enhance the physical and mental abilities of field operatives. Cross is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise, where he must survive certain activities and traverse rugged terrain in order to arrive at a remote cabin. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three, who informs Cross that he broke the mission record by two days. Meanwhile, a British reporter who was writing on operations Treadstone and Blackbriar is assassinated. The Blackbriar and Treadstone programs are publicly exposed, leading the FBI and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate CIA Director Ezra Kramer, Deputy Director Pamela Landy, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen, and Treadstone clinical researcher Dr Albert Hirsch. Kramer requests help from Eric Byer, a retired US Air Force colonel responsible for overseeing the CIA's clandestine operations. Byer discovers a potentially damaging video on the internet in which the lead researchers for Treadstone and Outcome appear together at professional functions in public. To prevent the Treadstone investigation from finding out about Outcome, Byer decides to shut Outcome down and kill its agents. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable because the government has separately initiated next-generation beta programs, including the supersoldier program LARX.Byer deploys a UAV to eliminate Number Three and Cross.Cross hears the drone's approach and leaves moments before a missile destroys the cabin with Number Three inside.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is by no means a bad film. Unfortunately, it just has trouble living up to the real world Jason Bourne 'legacy.'It couldn't ever hope to match the Paul Greengrass/Matt Damon movies for sheer punch and propulsion, but it's as close to replicating them as you could expect, and marks another excellent entry into the Bourne movie franchise.It may not be the thriller the first three films managed to be but it's well written and very entertaining."
"newby_rox3","8","3","6","18 March 2013"," If this gets more into virology, say an epidemic, I can't wait for a sequel.
","******* SPOILERS *******<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Bourne Legacy. First I LOVED the cinematography and the gorgeous views in Alaska and the Phillipines and its waterways. I appreciated there was a lot less hand-held cam shaking than the first Bourne film. And even if this was an action movie I thought some of the non-action was great.<br/><br/>I thought Legacy should have started out fresh with a new name, and without even mentioning Jason Bourne. The film stood on its own merits.<br/><br/>I won't give it an organic qualification -- ""a film that senses or feels (or doesn't sense or feel) ..blah blah."" But as an action film -- fistfights, firefights, chases, it got the job done. The bike chase went on a bit too long though. As an IMDb reviewer here said, once the fighting gets going, you're thinking, ""Matt who?""<br/><br/>The premise of a Supersecret Project Superhuman fighter force program gone awry, and the government needing to terminate everybody once involved in it -- the warriors, the scientists, the administrators -- satisfied my Yet Another Government Conspiracy fix (in real life I'm not that paranoid). <br/><br/>The opening scenes were splendid shots of unadulterated snow peaks. To me, action is jumping from one peak to another, at 2,000 feet, just to help Cross arrive at the destination two days early.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the technical talk though I think some of the chemistry may have been mumbo-jumbo. A better explanation of ""viraling out"" (which caught so many viewers' interest) was needed. I sense there's some truth in the whole gene delivery and targeting cells with a vector unload process Shearing explained to Cross. At any rate this movie got me curious enough to look up some things on virology, genetics, and radio communications on drones. <br/><br/>I thought the way Cross tricked the drone team was cool -- covering the tracking device implanted in his thigh with metal eating utensils. And later cutting the tracker out of his own thigh and sticking it down the throat of the 400 lb wolf he neatly manhandled. But I think a search & destroy combat drone would have a bunch of different radio and sensing devices to not be fooled by a simple piece of aluminum. Maybe this worked as chaff in WWI but I don't think UAV science is so eminently primitive. Even if it only had radar that trick probably would have been pretty obvious and could have looked like the ""Echo"" signal the drone team called Cross' transponder. My guess: these drones can sense every form of electromagnetic radiation so anything short of shooting it down (as he did) or with your own ray gun wouldn't do a thing. One of my favorite lines was, ""I think he (Cross) shot it down with a high powered rifle.""<br/><br/>I enjoyed the conversations during the lulls. When Cross met with the other ""participant"" in the cabin, the chat revealed a very defensive soldier who was about to be murdered by his government. And the part about his ""fallen in love,"" wasn't that believable but charming anyway. I also enjoyed the Command Center team, with the drone talk.<br/><br/>Another conversation Cross had with Dr. Shearing after they escaped the hit team at the burning house was pretty good. But here too I wonder about the credibility of Shearing's ""Neuremberg"" defense of following orders and not being ethically accountable for the program's consequences because of her ignorance from the ""blind"" quality of the tests and her naive faith that she was somehow helping her country. That such a a highly accomplished virology doctor and researcher hasn't had that little internal moral debate yet is just too much to swallow. But that scene did get pretty good -- with Cross saying, ""What? You're the doctor and you have no Plan B?""<br/><br/>I thought Cross' and Shearing's flight was made that much more interesting with the tracking team closing in on them, narrowing a 17-hour lead down to actually catching up to them in the Manila factory.<br/><br/>I thought the ending was lame. The message hollered through the whole movie by the principals is that our government is evil and will kill you and every person you ever knew should you be on its hit list. So that they'd endanger a trusting family man and his young child by helping them escape on a boat means Cross & Schearing are evil too -- or they just forgot. Anyway, this super-traceable route of escape from the all-seeing US intel group with all the cameras in the world at its disposal, is a natural setup for a sequel.<br/><br/>Acting was good. Renner has a more focused aura than Matt Damon and his pugnacious-looking face make him seem more like an Ordinary Joe. Weisz was super and in some shots she looks plain, so that made her rely more on her acting, which she did splendidly. We were spared the sappy love scenes. Though I liked his acting I couldn't quite see Edward Norton in the role of ex-Air Force Colonel. The Dr. Foite going crazy and shooting everyone in the lab was chilling. I can't believe actor Zelijko Ivanek in many roles, yet he always comes through for me. <br/><br/>Wouldn't mind seeing a sequel. Yeah, bring in Matt if you must, but they should have developed the viral aspect -- a horrifying and scary notion that has kept defense types awake at night for years and years -- and leveraged the concept that sickness and a bio or viral attack is as frightening as anything.<br/><br/>Instead they cheapened the film with the introduction of another Terminator -- without any of Arnold's charm. When all the cool talk about unloading vectors and radio PIDs boils down to an unfeeling, fighting robot, that's when a movie loses a big part of its appeal to me."

I'd say my favorite scene in the movie was probably the end moter cycle scene because it was just so extensive and made you want to just fast forward to see what happens! Believe it or not, this is actually probably my favorite Bourne movies because it gets a little old just to keep seeing Matt Damon in each movie when it seems like each of the movie had their same plots, but this one was better because it had a cast change.

","Starring: Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton<br/><br/>Synopsis: The fourth instalment to the Bourne franchise see's Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) a member of one of the black ops programmes Outcome. Taking place during the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum', we see CIA's Deputy Director Pamela Landy being questioned about Treadstone project and the operation BlackBriar all of which has come to light due the events of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, and Bourne Ultimatum). Also linked due to his involvement is Noah Vosen who's also now being investigated by the FBI too. Eric Bryer (Edward Norton) a retired USAF Colonel responsible for overseeing the CIA's clandestine operations is called upon to help stop any further information being leaked and to stop other programmes becoming public knowledge. <br/><br/>Review: this film opens with a quick recap of Ultimatum and shows Aaron on a training mission, the best I can make out project Outcome as only a few members and is still in early stages of development. Aaron a former highly trained and skilled soldier now an Outcome agent who is being controlled with performance enhancing drugs, making him stronger, faster and giving him better memory than an average person. Norton (Fight Club, Incredible Hulk and American History X) makes the decision to eliminate all members of Treadstone and Outcome as Pamela Landy Knows about these two projects and to keep the many others in the dark. Norton is at his best as a villainous CIA member, giving orders to kill all involved and including scientist behind the green and blue performance enhancing pills the Outcome agent's use. Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Dream House) Dr Marta Shearing targeted by the CIA for her involvement is rescued by Aaron, who recruits her help in him becoming free from using the pills. <br/><br/>Beautifully shot with a lot of the world's destinations being used, exciting action sequences and an overall good story, let down it's every twenty minute referral to Jason Bourne. This feels like Lazenby's Bond movie, always mentioning the previous outing. I felt that it never truly gives Renner (Avengers, Swat) any chance to get started and become someone we want to care about. Some of the story feels rushed, especially when it comes to another agency sending out someone to take care of Cross and Shearing. I believe if it didn't have the constant references to Jason Bourne and the earlier films this would have given the franchise a new look and possible sequels, from what I've learned to date nobody is really interested in seeing another film now unless Matt Damon is attached, this might not be an end to Aaron Cross, however if given another chance keep the Bourne references to a minimal and let Aaron Cross's story become the forefront of the story. <br/><br/>Verdict: A poor man's Bourne but not the fault of the actors/characters but he story focusing on Jason Bourne and not Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>See this if you liked: Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, on her Majorities Secret Service, Bourne trilogy."

VERY SADLY it didn't come close and it hurts. <br/><br/>Lets face it the other films were AWESOME!!! and this change-up without authentic author written material just had ""FAIL"" written all over it from the onset and Damon knew it. <br/><br/>Truth be told if they just introduced this film as a new film un- associated with the Bourne trilogy it would be an OK film, but don't pit a Yugo against three finely tuned Ferrari's. It didn't fool anyone.<br/><br/>The core problem is it is this film fails miserably while pretending to replicate the same balance, pace and intensity of the three predecessors. Its just not there... you want it to be and you can feel the film trying but its nothing more than lipstick on a pig and you can feel it midway through the movie.<br/><br/>The earlier films were in your face gritty and this one was Hollywood diet-grit due to a weak script and too many other minor deviations from the original formula. <br/><br/>In addition to the weak and a repetitively themed script, liberties with other low-key casting choices from other films just gave this boat another anchor. <br/><br/>Why add Norton and Weiss? Like Bourne himself the earlier casting choices minus Julia Stiles were somewhat off the grid choices. Weiss just didn't fit at all... and Norton has been amazing in other movies but i will take a Conklin, Abbott or Landy any day of the week over his re-hash character.<br/><br/>The cinematography also felt noticeably more Hollywood than Bourne style unfortunately or else i was already clouded with disappointment and anger.<br/><br/>The good is that Renner did not try to become Bourne in the movie, he was his own character and i liked what he brought, but even his madd skills couldn't get this thing close to the same league as the other films.<br/><br/>I've always envied Matt Damon's decision making when it comes to choosing movie scripts. Initially i really really wanted him to stay with the series no matter what, but after seeing this one now, he once again made the right call by staying on the side line. <br/><br/>Verdict: Renner big thumbs up but sadly this film had big shoes to fill and never got its feet in.<br/><br/>If you can't do it well why do it all???"

","Its almost unfortunate that BOURNE is attached to the movie.I think it made audiences feel it should be on par with Ultimatum, when I think what we are getting is IDENTITY in a parallel universe. Although I felt the story did a good job of tying the whole world together... There were some holes in the story. That said - I believe this is a start to much more. AND the movie itself was still very entertaining.<br/><br/>Any story issues were well handled by Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weiz, and Ed Norton. All gave STELLAR performances. Renner's physical prowess left me exhausted and exhilarated all at the same time. The action sequences were really good and Renner looks better than he ever has.<br/><br/>Marta (played my Weiz) was an exceptionally believable character. And Ed Norton just does a great job being a total bastard.<br/><br/>You have to release any Matt Damon/ Jason Bourne expectation. The reality is it a different story with in the same world. And I do strongly believe it is a story worth looking into. My biggest issue with the movie is that we didn't dig deeper, just wider. I had hoped we could have seen more of the process of becoming and agent, a look into Aaron Cross' first assignments. The story mentions emotional noise from the outcome agents... show us! Even a little more of the back story of who Kenneth Kitsom was.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough some of the trailers and previews shows scenes that didn't make the final cut. After seeing the movie three times. I have to say my love for the movie has grown. Between the first and second time I saw it - the movie opened up to me. I think I was no longer distracted about how this transition would work - and instead I was just pulled into the story. I am still displeased with the ending. A typical leave them hanging Bourne ending, but this was a little premature I think I felt like we needed just a little more resolution than this ending gave us. <br/><br/>All in all Legacy really is a great and entertaining film. Renner and the whole cast were spectacular in their performance. I look forward to more from this series and hope we get the chance to dig deeper in upcoming installments."

There's breathtaking action, notably a bike chase, which is fast paced and wonderfully shot by director/writer Tony Gilroy.<br/><br/>Continuing the series tradition with a cast of heavy weights, Edward Norton and the marvellous Stacy Keach put in first-rate appearances. Rachel Weisz is on form as Marta Shearing and carries the emotion during the events of Legacy, her arc feels genuine especially as her and Cross' friendship develops. While former cast members including Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and Joan Allen are reduced to cameos, video footage and photos which link the series. These connections are significant as the story runs parallel to Bourne's conclusion.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Legacy follows The Bourne Identity's format a little much to the letter, scenes are reminiscent of the first outing. It lacks the intrigue of the others and is less than subtle in referencing Damon's outings.

","Hear me out. I read the original novels before the movies began coming out. Imagine my excitement...and then my disappointment. Matt Damon was no Jason Bourne, and sorry, Franka, but you were no Marie. The characters were not even close to those in the books. And in my opinion, the character makes the entertainment, whether it be in the form of a novel or a movie. Matt Damon couldn't have been a worse choice to play Bourne. <br/><br/>Moving on to ""The Bourne Legacy"". This movie was so much closer to the books. Sure, the story line is a little different compared to Jason's, but the characters had so much more depth. Renner nailed his role. He's tough without acting over-macho; he's vulnerable; he asks questions. Weisz did a great job as well, playing a very intelligent woman put into a crazy situation. Her reactions were realistic, which I found endearing.<br/><br/>(Did I forget to mention the cinematography in the first three movies of the series??? Ugh.) The cinematography was much less nauseating in this film. This was a much better film on many levels. From the acting, to the characters, to the story line, to the directing. <br/><br/>SPOILERS HERE!<br/><br/>What ticked me off the most about the earlier films is that they killed of the second most important character in ""The Bourne Supremacy"": Marie. She was the most important person to Jason and he wouldn't have continued on without her. Yet he's perfectly fine. It completely ruined the series for me. (Not to mention the fact that Marie plays a rather large role in the second novel...)<br/><br/>Why am I comparing these films? Because the first three get praise when they are garbage, and this film, which is quite good, has a low rating. <br/><br/>This movie has action, character development, true romance, a good story line, good acting and had me sucked in from beginning to end.

So they set out to Manila, viral out Aaron, run through the narrow lanes of Philippines, keep riding away from another assassin and eventually set out onto the sea escaping from the radar of CIA.<br/><br/>Full review here - http://bit.ly/Mqu4jI"
"mreyno02","4","5","14","9 August 2012"," Legacy
","Apparently Jason Bourne really isn't special enough to make another quality movie about him, as the story telling takes off in too many directions. True it was only last week, but not since the Total Recall have I been so disappointed in a movie. With these two examples, Hollywood is presently destroying some perfectly good concepts. Probably trying to pull a slick one, the writer(s) tried to use the spirit of the Bourne story, to plant lots of Easter Eggs, which simply exploded in the viewers face. As if in covert style, this effort harms the franchise from which it is trying to escape. While there is some of it throughout, the action sequence (the absence of an 's' to end the last word is not by mistake), which the regular fan is used to, doesn't happen until much too late in the movie. If you want to accept this as Jason Bourne's legacy, this movie leaves too many things undone, and in my opinion The Bourne Legacy should not include any reference to Jason Bourne in the title."

","AARON Cross is one tough guy. We know that because the flick shows us freezing his ass out in some godforsaken part of the US. We know that he can jump, climb and shoot with great skill, which make me wonder if he should have been an Olympic athlete instead of an assassin.<br/><br/>The movie then abruptly shifts to office politics and discursive yak-yak that should not predominate an action flick. Viewers won't care for that. They come to a Bourne flick for the action.<br/><br/>That said, the first movie showed a great romance between Bourne and his girlfriend. In this flick, it's forced and contrived.<br/><br/>The doctor killing his colleagues brings back memories of last month's Colorado theater shooting and this week's massacre of 6 people in a US Sikh temple. The scene may have been an inadvertent one, but that's what viewers will think about when they are watching the movie.<br/><br/>Cross may have the same killing talent as Jason Bourne, but he definitely doesn't share the latter's enigma, coolness and debonair quality.<br/><br/>We get to see lots of shootings, driving, making fake ID cards and breaking into a Manila installation. Nothing new.<br/><br/>The flick's piece de resistance is the chase across rooftops in a Manila slum, running in narrow alleys, jumping off bridges and a motorcycle chase.<br/><br/>Is this a Bourne flick or another run of the mill flick?<br/><br/>This movie doesn't bode well for the Bourne franchise. Where art thou, Matt Damon?"

"davelucas1974","9","3","7","5 April 2013"," Far Better Than Expected!!!
","The Bourne Legacy - Since his Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker, actor Jeremy Renner has somehow morphed into Hollywood's new go-to action hero. While I would love to see him do something with a little more meat like that again, I grudgingly have to admit that I am beginning to really LIKE him as an action hero. His characters are smart and interesting and he never looks like he's TRYING to come across as tough or capable. With the parade of blustering buffoons that the genre has tried to push on America for decades, he (along with Daniel Craig) really stands apart as a subtler, more human alternative. And it's working. He contributed to granting Mission Impossible a far better relaunch than I had ever expected in Ghost Protocol and now he's done the same thing leading the cast of the newest entry in the Bourne franchise.<br/><br/>Part of what makes Legacy work is that Renner is not playing Jason Bourne. He is a NEW character set in the WORLD of the Bourne films. Photos of the fugitive Bourne make it quite clear that IF Bourne appears with Aaron Cross (the new character) in a future film, the intent is still for Matt Damon to play that role. In this way, Renner is not forced to try and out-Bourne Damon. Instead, his performance is allowed to stand on its own merit, and it stands quite well.<br/><br/>He gets able assistance from a stronger ensemble of talented actors than you usually get in an action thriller. Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Corey Stoll, Zeljko Ivanek, Albert Finney and David Straitharn all added to my enjoyment of the film. Oscar Isaac is particularly engaging in a small role. I've been hungry to see more from this actor ever since(continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)"
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","7","19 August 2012"," A rebooting that works rather well
","Who would have thought that the Bourne franchise could survive without director Paul Greengrass, actor Matt Damon, and even the Jason Bourne character himself? That it does, and does so rather successfully, is primarily down to Tony Gilroy. He wrote the screenplay for the three previous Bourne movies - ""Identity"" (2002), ""Supremacy"" (2004) and ""Ultimatum"" (2007) - and, five years after we might have thought that the conspiracy had run its course, he's back as both writer and director (for good measure, he also conceived the story).<br/><br/>OK, it may not have the originality of the earlier works and the final chase sequence (a full 15 minutes) is too long, but I found the plot more intelligible and, in a film with no downtime, the tension and the action are sustained for the full two and a quarter hours, all the way from Alaska to Manila.<br/><br/>As the great tag line explains"" ""There was never just one"". In the fall-out from the conclusion of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the Defense Department is forced to freeze all its covert black ops programs which involves dispensing with the services of some exceptional assets, but one agent - Outcom 3 or Aaron Cross - wants to stay alive which, to start with, requires him to find a way of coping without his steady supply of ability-enhancing green and blue meds. The rebooting of the franchise works so well because of the casting of Jeremy Renner, an actor of real presence and physicality, as the rogue agent. After more than a decade of solid work, Renner achieved 'overnight' success in his breakthrough movie ""The Hurt Locker"" and he is now set to be a major action star.<br/><br/>Cross needs to team up with neurophysicist Dr Marta Shearing who is played by Rachel Weisz, an accomplished actress who can pull off a role which is a lot more than the usual girl along for the ride. Cross's nemesis is Retired Colonel Eric Byer, portrayed chillingly by the ever-able Edward Norton. Even the smaller roles are filled by strong actors and, throughout it all, we have an insistent score by James Newton Howard.<br/><br/>The critics have been rather dismissive of ""The Bourne Legacy"", but audiences are enjoying it - and I certainly did."

I wasn't at all familiar with Jeremy Renner at this time so it seemed like a clean slate to me. I've subsequently seen Renner in both Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and The Avengers and loved both movies and his performance in them.<br/><br/>Even arriving at the cinema and sitting down to watch this I had literally no idea what to expect. I was, I am relieved to say, pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Renner's Aaron Cross is a fine new character and the plot is good, there are a few clever moments.There isn't as much action as there is in Ultimatum , the action quota is higher than Supremacy and Identity and the action scenes are, as to be expected, excellent.<br/><br/>Never been a huge fan of Rachel Weisz but she was good in this.

This movie shows that Pamela Landy, who looked like she was going to be a HERO after the Treadstone fallout, is now looking to take a serious fall and be charged with treason!<br/><br/>I could imagine Jason Bourne coming out of hiding to either prevent her conviction or help her escape. Also, if the people responsible for killing his girlfriend (Marie) and trying to kill him are now allowed to keep their jobs and face no jail time then that would also be enough motivation to finally take them down for good!<br/><br/>It would be great to have the now fully med-free ""Super-Soldier-Spy"" Aaron Cross join Bourne on this mission to take down these two rogue CIA/NSA groups.

The locations, directing, and set was done on the cheap/rush. Nothing new with the Bourne Legacy. This installment looks like a non H B O made for T V movie.

Watching this film wasn't even painless (especially a mass murder scene that could have been lifted directly from today's headlines), but it most definitely was brainless. It also seems to have been made with a sharp eye on its budget. It's just less expensive to shoot parts of the film in an East Asian slum. <br/><br/>And why is the great actor Albert Finney making a cameo appearance in this movie.

"avadheshbagla","6","4","11","12 August 2012"," The Bourne Legacy actually suffers from being exactly that, Jason Bourne s legacy!
","Caught d movie on its worldwide release. The Bourne Legacy actually suffers from the Legacy of Jason Bourne as on a standalone basis the film is actually above average. However being a sequel which actually runs parallel to the 3rd film (a first of sorts for sequels i reckon) the film fails on tempo and action is jaded and somewhat falls flat in comparison to the tempo set by Matt Damon s and Paul's grasses Bourne franchise Films, which are also known for being aggressive in execution. Especially the style of camera work (first person view) in Jason Bourne films really adds to the tension but here i actually fell asleep during some parts as they just talked and talked and then talked some more! Since originality in screenplay is dead the studios now rely on just milking successes full franchises (splitting 1 part into 2's like harry potter n upcoming turkey twilight for egg) rather than taking risk with something new or fresh. At the end your are left pondering, Why is this film there? the Bourne series finished as 1 of the best action spy trilogy and this film feels like those attempts such as Terminator 4 and terminator 5 which despite having Christian Bale dint wet any 1es appetite! Sadly The Bourne name may get this 4th installment (without Bourne actually being there!!) the required box office numbers and we may yet see another sequel, which will again be a waste of time,space,money,acting talents etc. The thing with good things is you should know when its done with rather than confirm that its over, sometimes going out on a high is the right thing, which this film surely isn't. If u do see it then erase the previous Bourne films from Ru memory and treat this on its own merit and u may well enjoy it as something above average but the moment u start comparing this 1 with previous Matt Damon's installment this 1 turns out to be a cold turkey!"
"treylanthier-424-172436","5","4","11","11 August 2012"," Action-Packed Mediocrity
","Before going to see the latest installment in the Bourne series, make sure to whip out your checklist of things to expect: a government conspiracy involving supersoldiers, an innocent female that is dragged along for an unromantic adventure which she has very little purpose in, a running-on-the-rooftops escape scene, a high-speed car chase that goes on for ten minutes too long, and a supersoldier whose objective is to take out another supersoldier.<br/><br/>Yes, this checklist could apply to any of the three Bourne movies starring Matt Damon. After Legacy, it's clear that these trademarks are customary of any film in the series. The action sequences were impressive at times, drawn out for too long other times, but all in all, you're bound to get what you're expecting. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, fresh off of his blockbuster role in Avengers, picks up the reins right where Damon left off, and a brand new cast follows, including Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.<br/><br/>We're immediately reintroduced into the world of genetically-enhanced spies with a training facility in Alaska, which Aaron Cross (Renner) progresses through with flying colors, until the program's termination comes into effect and he finds himself on the run from a government agency that wants him dead.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Of course it does. This is no different than any other Bourne movie. Renner's performance as Cross wasn't on par with Damon's performances, but other than that, the acting was very similar, the action and pace were very similar, and the entire movie had a 'been there, done that' feel to it.<br/><br/>Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily, because each of the three previous Bourne movies had a lot of these things in common as well. But sooner or later, this trend gets old. You can only rehash a plot so many times before it wears thin, and this is a prime example of why some series should end on a good note.<br/><br/>This is about as average as a movie can get - I had my checklist ready, and I knew what to expect coming in. I was completely satisfied, I got what I wanted out of the movie, and that's as far as it goes. No surprises, nothing but straight, in-your-face action for 135 minutes. <br/><br/>Don't expect anything more or anything less than a middle-of-the-run action flick."
"Christian_Dimartino","8","4","11","11 August 2012"," A pleasant surprise.
","When I first heard about The Bourne Legacy, my first thought was, ""Here we go again."" It definitely wasn't at the top of my must see list. My main reason was that the first three films worked so well with Matt Damon that I couldn't picture the next film going on without him. But luckily, The Bourne Legacy holds up just fine. Fasten your seat belts, you're in for a good time.<br/><br/>We who have seen the trilogy know that what happened with Jason Bourne didn't go according to plan. But as it turns out, Jason Bourne wasn't the only one involved. In fact, there are quite a few people involved, and after the Bourne fiasco gets out of hand, the organization behind it decide to take care of all loose ends, eliminating everyone involved. Except for two.<br/><br/>One is named Aaron Cross(played by Jeremy Renner), and the other is a nice doctor(played by the lovely Rachael Weisz) who was simply doing what she is told. The two of them know each other from the past. After they are both nearly killed, they decide to team up and outrun the people desperately trying to shut them up.<br/><br/>Considering I have seen the trilogy only one time, i was afraid of going into The Bourne Legacy, mainly because I thought I would be lost. About twenty minutes into the movie, I was thinking, once again, ""Here we go."" But luckily it finally came through. I had a good time here because, thank the lord, I knew what was going on. The people I was with all fell asleep because they were lost, but I hung in there, and it was a good ride.<br/><br/>There are some terrific action sequences, it's very entertaining, and Renner and Weisz make a good team, especially because they are so talented.Michael Clayton director Tony Gilroy, who penned the scripts for the first three films, does a nice job here. But there were some flaws. It sort of drags on, you really have to at least know something about Jason Bourne before you see it, otherwise you won't know what in the heck is going on,you get a sense of de ja vu, and lastly, Edward Norton.<br/><br/>Norton is such a great actor, but he really doesn't get to do a whole lot here, and if you're going to have someone as talented as Norton in a movie, you need to give him something to do. Overall, it's a pretty good movie. Don't listen to the critics, it's worth your time. Watch the first three before you go into it. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>B+"
"cattjones","8","4","11","11 August 2012"," Excellent Escapism
","Of all the Bourne films (identity, supremacy, ultimatum and legacy) I have to say that I liked this one the least. I like this one the least because there was no Bourne in it. I do think that writer Tony Gilroy did an excellent job in introducing this character and making the audience realize that his circumstances are the results of the first three Bourne films. The story line is basically the same as the other films.. Bourne must die and we must hunt him down (in this case Aaron Cross). When the last film ended you knew that Treadstone was on its way out and there were drastic measures that were sure to follow. Well, this film is the result of those drastic measures. You know from the trailer that Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has been genetically enhanced, but they do not tell you much else (which is good). He somehow hooks up with Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) and you start to get that ""I need to find a cure"" kind of feeling. To top it all off there is the introduction of a super human, Larx #3 (Louis Ozawa Changchien) who is an emotionless, focused, killing machine. I guess these kinds of ""terminator"" characters have become very popular because I saw his would-be female equal just last week in Total Recall. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) was responsible for cleaning up the whole mess and covering up all the evidence of the past. Wow, he should run for office (smile). The entire cast did a good job in delivering the intent of this film including the left over cast members from the previous films (Joan Allen, David Staithaim, etc.). I think they should make one more Bourne film where Aaron Cross runs into Jason Bourne. They should call it The Bourne Reckoning. I don't think that the Bourne series should end without Bourne in it. I know it is not just me. I liked this film well enough, although it was a bit long (over 2 hours). I have always been a longtime fan of the Bourne series so I was not about to stop now. This is a film that would be worth the price of a ticket, if for no other reason than to encourage Matt Damon to come back and finish out this series the right way. I am giving this film a green light."
"yuki_xxyu","8","4","11","10 August 2012"," The script is really ""wide-open"", in the sense that now anyone can add in another new program at any time.
","On the contrary to most reviews available online now, my feeling is that the first half is actually more content-compacted than the second half. Literally, there's no subtitle on the screen for the last 20 min -- they don't need it cuz there's no talking, only fighting, motorbike chasing, parkouring, etc. So what's next after the pair get rid of a hunter and find some temporary peace? Oh yes, we are expecting sequel...<br/><br/>I like the first half because it's full of drama, wisdom (on both the ""good"" and the ""bad"" sides), and emotions gradually grow, as well as audience' awareness of what is happening. Forget about Jason Bourne, there are much more going on there, compared to which, an amnesic agent who is fighting to regain his identity looks just trivial. <br/><br/>Aaron Cross actually got ""profit"" from the Outcome program -- his less-than-average intelligence got improved. And he doesn't want to lose it, which makes him not look so ""moral"" -- he stays in the program just to stay away from a even worse life, while his recruiter, Byer, and even Dr. Shearing, believe(d) that they are serving their country, at least. <br/><br/>I feel that Cross started some casually romantic feeling towards Doc during the repeated visits for examinations. I mean, you don't really count the times you meet a certain doctor in a few years, unless you have some special feeling for him/her. And that near ""harassing"" lines inside the examination room. While Doc started to look at No.5 in a different way when he was focusing on preparing a fake passport for her. Maybe that was the first time that she saw one of her ""participants"" really working in the field. There's the saying that ""Man who is seriously working is the sexiest"" (or some line like that), absolutely true.<br/><br/>The script is really ""wide-open"", in the sense that now anyone can add in another new program at any time. So there can be endless hunting, endless new agents/opponents, therefore endless sequels, if fans buy it. James Bond must get envious, cuz he cannot even kill a bad guy too fast sometimes but has to keep that for a future sequel. My only concerns are, first, now they've used up the idea of high-speed chasing and chaotic parkour in a crowded city, what other fresh things they can come up with next time? And second, since Aaron Cross has got permanently ""infected"", he needs the pills NO MORE, so the story actually needs the Doc NO MORE? hmmm that's a dangerous sign for a hero's lady in such a franchise... <br/><br/>P.S. An interesting finding: Outcome had 6 remaining agents when it started to be burned down to ground. We've known that 4 were killed (1 in Pakistan, 1 in Seoul which I believe is the one under-covered into N-Korea intelligence network, the lonely ranger who got ""demoted"" for falling love, and No.6 who is the black guy), No.5 a.k.a Aaron Cross managed to escape, so who and where is the last one? A thread for sequel? Hope they didn't miscount..."

Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton are carrying the movie on their shoulders, keeping it afloat.<br/><br/>But this won't change the fact that the script never achieved to really take off and keep us in like the first 3 movies did. The 3 previous movies were served by a script which was always focused on realism. A story about a man struck by amnesia willing to find out who he is only to discover that he's a CIA assassin and he became a high valued liability making him a priority target for his ex-employer.<br/><br/>But here it's about one of those CIA recruits, some kind of chemically enhanced super soldier who tries to survive when the CIA decides to shut down the very program he was part of because of Bourne's actions. It seems already weird to see that guy swallowing those mysterious pills and bring some gibberish about it but it becomes clearly out of touch when he has to face that super assassin who would be more fit in Terminator rather than this.

Then, all of a sudden, he discovers that a drone is trying to blow him up.<br/><br/>Eventually, the film moves past Ultimatum and becomes about another secret government agency. They're feeling threatened by Jason Bourne's uprising and trying to kill their own assets before they have the chance to retaliate.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with this film is that it tries to be cryptic. It's capable of telling us what's going on, but chooses not to--which can be frustrating when watching a movie. You can tell that these events are opening the door to something cool in the series, but it just doesn't let us figure out what that is until later.<br/><br/>Often times, we find ourselves scratching our heads, hoping that it all ties together in the end. And it does for the most part. But even when things click, it means nothing of value. You just accept it and hope it will make sense in the next film.<br/><br/>We're also never entirely sure how it all connects to the Bourne series--other than the same people are involved. But the glimmering hope that it's going to open the series up to something grander--the bigger picture--makes every piece of this film intriguing.<br/><br/>Regardless of the mysterious plot, it's really entertaining. The action and chase sequences are high-quality, and there are some really intense scenes. It's all fun in the end.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 85"

","Trying to follow a legend in any field is difficult, Gene Bartow following John Wooden at UCLA, and Tim Cook following Steve Jobs at Apple, but it is particularly true in movies; George Lazenby following Sean Connery as James Bond and every man in Hollywood following John Wayne in westerns. Following Matt Damon and the Bourne trilogy is no less difficult. Legacy has done it not with a sequel but with a story that parallels the story in the Bourne Ultimatum. It's a neat trick that is a little confusing at time but generally works. Using Jeremy Renner is a brave and daring decision. He is not particularly handsome but fits his part as the resourceful chemically enhanced former slow witted Marine PFC very well. One soon is cheering for him against the same monsters that dogged Jason Bourne. Rachel Weisz is not as convincing as the naive biochemist love interest but she isn't bad. Edward Norton and Stacy Keach lead a strong cast of characters trying to kill our heroes. <br/><br/>There are special effects and chase scenes that are consistent with the previous Bourne movies. Our hero's ability to outwit, out run and out fight dozens of expects is fun to watch. The long chase in the Philippines is long but lots of fun. <br/><br/>To be sure, there are plot weaknesses for example, why did the lab doctor start killing everyone? Did he go nuts from drugs someone gave him or was he ordered to do it? <br/><br/>All in all is was a very enjoyable movie. Although with a new story line and hero, it was on par with the last two movies in the Matt Damon set."

","I was very impressed with this movie, but the acting was what made it stand out. <br/><br/>Jeremy, Rachel and Ed all gave really great performances. Rachel was amazing. Her emotions were so intense that she could really draw you into her character with a simple facial expression. Jeremy was clearly the super strong and confident knight in shining armor that all action movies require. However, it was the way he could also act out vulnerability, comedy, empathy, fear and endearing qualities that gave his character real depth. Ed did an awesome job being the cold-hearted, all-business, government official. One could almost hear the gears reeling in his head as he tried to figure out what was going to happen next. <br/><br/>The plot line was well developed and moved from scene to scene effortlessly. <br/><br/>The action scenes were well executed and exciting, although some chase scenes seemed to run a little long.<br/><br/>The cinematography was a little rough. The scenic views were incredible and clearly they took their time in finding just the right sites. However, most of the time it was shaky, as if someone was literally carrying the camera while shooting.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, there were only 7 swear words throughout the whole film. It was actually very refreshing to be reminded that every other word didn't have to be a swear word to make a movie great.<br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie, especially for action/adventure fans."

"alindsay-al","5","2","4","6 March 2014"," Not the Legacy Bourne deserved
","I have recently seen the Bourne trilogy and loved all three of them so my excitement for this 4th instalment was high going in to watch it. However, this wasn't the film I wanted or expected, I believe having the franchise name of Bourne attached to this film really hurt me even more when it was kind of a mess. This film is based at a similar time of The Bourne ultimatum with a new agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) in his own situation with the CIA. The main problem with this film is that for a Bourne film this is a surprisingly boring film for at least the first hour with little happening. This character of Aaron Cross is just not as likable or interesting as Matt Damon's iconic character Jason Bourne and this hurts the film as Jason Bourne is mentioned throughout. I must say that Jeremy Renner's performance is good but as I said before he just isn't Jason Bourne and one of my favourite parts of this film is seeing the characters from the previous films and how it links with this film. Also the end action sequence is the one part where this film feels like Bourne and is one of the times I thought it was awesome. This along with the tense fighting scenes are the strength of this film whereas the narrative isn't to the par of the other Bourne's or other films. I hope that there is a 5th Bourne film with the original Director and Matt Damon coming back as Jason Bourne, if this isn't going to happen then this should be the end of Bourne for now until it eventually gets fully rebooted."

","This wasn't as good as the original three, but I wasn't expecting a whole lot when it was announced Jeremy Renner was taking over. To my pleasant surprise it stuck to the roots of the original three movies, and I wound up having fun with it. Tony Gilroy was a writer for the first three movies, so he knows what it takes. What really made Bourne Legacy were the potent action scenes, and some of the chase scenes really made my jaw drop. The one involving the motorcycle chase had me on the edge of my seat. That was really well done. What about Jeremy Renner? I thought he was excellent as Aaron Cross and made for a good replacement for Matt Damon. He is no stranger to action roles. Having prominent roles in Mission Impossible IV & The Avengers, he is no stranger in this regard. He is not only believable, but I had a blast watching him kick everybody's ass. Rachel Weisz is a favorite of mine, and she was very effective. Her chemistry with Renner was pretty good, and she was easy on the eyes as per usual. Stacy Keach is solid in support, as are Edward Norton & Scott Glenn. Joan Allen also returns in a small role. There are a few Jason Bourne mentions in this one, so he is not fully absent. Matt Damon doesn't appear at all in this one, though<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It's pretty entertaining in all honesty, and has potential to turn into a solid franchise. I'd be more than happy if future sequels came out. Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross is a potential money maker. I'd also love it if they made a sequel where Jason Bourne & Aaron Cross team up.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Expanding the mythology already established in previous films for no particular creative purpose except ""people like those Bourne movies,"" this fourth installment is a watered-down yet wholly acceptable ""Bourne"" film. Do you like ""those Bourne movies""?<br/><br/>Warning: it's the weakest of them. It's 72% as riveting as ""Bourne Identity,"" about 91% as good as ""Bourne Supremacy,"" and 65% as strong as ""Bourne Ultimatum."" <br/><br/>But most sequels to classic franchises aren't even in the same ballpark of quality--which is why I stress those slightly absurd numbers. If you want to see a film almost as good as ""The Bourne Supremacy""--here it is. <br/><br/>As a fan of the Matt Damon trilogy, you might resent the opening-up of seemingly closed narrative threads--but the film delivers an authentic ""Bourne"" experience, nonetheless. Barring objections to the plot in light of the series having ""ended"" in ""Bourne Ultimatum,"" you're in slasher franchise territory, on some level--you either like the formula or you don't. The recipe for entertaining filmmaking has not been botched, due to the inclusion of series scribe Tony Gilroy as creative mastermind. Everything feels plausible, exciting and categorically better than any ""action"" film has been in years, except for ""those Bourne movies."" <br/><br/>Despite the addition of near-science-fiction to the mythos, the film is far more realistic and credible than poor ""Bourne"" knock-offs like ""Hanna"" and ""Salt."" As a fourth sequel, that's remarkable quality control. Gilroy probably could have made a good ""Die Hard"" film if the executives at Fox weren't barking Chimpanzees."

"austinicity","7","2","4","22 January 2013"," Better than the reviews
","I usually don't write reviews, unless there is a significant disparity between the common audience perceptions. This is a movie where I find that phenomenon. Seems either people like it or hate it.<br/><br/>First I want to say I enjoyed the movie. It is not a waste of time. It is not a movie that you would get up and walk out on. I don't understand the whole ""poor plot line and lackluster script"" argument being given by some of the reviews. This movie is set up exactly the same way The Bourne Identity was. The script, dialog, cinematography and plot are parallel to The Bourne Identity's script, dialog, cinematography and plot. Both movies follow the same formula. The only reason why people say the plot sucks is because this story-line is an off shoot of tredstone and black briar programs. Jason bourne's character has very little impact. I think people assumed since the title of the movie is ""The Bourne Legacy"" that the story lines would be more in-tangled and interconnected. This movie has more to do with how the agency is handling the breakdown of their secret black ops programs rather than the ramifications of those implications - meaning it spends more time focusing on the whole agency rather than the personnel emotional turmoil of one or two characters - even though obviously this is an action movie and there is plenty of satisfying action. <br/><br/>I would love to see a sequel in which it had little to do with the actual black ops agents or assassins or whatever you want to call Jason Bourne and Aaron Cross, and more to do with Pamela Lundy, and Col. Eric Byer - the administrators - what happens to them? I mean what happens at the court hearings? It is like the CIA vs CIA. What does this mean for the intelligence community? - there is a whole slew of plots that could come out of it that I think would make for a really good psychological thriller. There is still a really big and entertaining plot to be explored here. <br/><br/>The only cretinism I can give this movie is that Aaron Cross's character doesn't come full circle like the Bourne Trilogy; but rightfully so. He doesn't have amnesia or some personnel vendetta against the agency, he just wants to survive the cutting block. In that respect I think it was a very good movie and I hope they keep making more of them."

","This film has an interesting story line but is written and filmed terribly! It lacks the rawness and razor sharp choreography in the action scenes and indulges waffley/wordy banter and superfluous petty emotion that just makes for irritating distraction. It is not congruent and simply lacks intelligence for a serious secret intelligence agency film and lacks a cut-to-the-chase plot or flow. It's one thing to explore a branch-off story line, but it's lost the flavour of the things that were appealing about the Bourne series to keep me connected.<br/><br/>If I were judging it as a film in itself, I might've rated it higher.

","I didn't think Jeremy Renner portraying Aaron Cross would be a suitable replacement for Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, but he kind of grows on you after a while. Especially after the good guy/bad guy sides begin to assimilate, and we learn that shutting down Treadstone and Black Briar actually meant shutting down all the operatives that were in them. That's pretty harsh if you ask me, but I guess the espionage world goes by a pretty strict set of rules. So in this one, we find out that Aaron Cross had genetic alterations made to two of his chromosomes, with his 'green', physical side gaining a one and a half percent rise in his mitochondrial protein uptake, giving him increased cellular tempo and muscle efficiency, while his 'blue' side intelligence underwent increased neural regeneration and elasticity, with improved sensory function, pain suppression and genomic targeting. Even with all that, I couldn't figure out why, when Aaron and Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) were trying to make their escape from the Manila lab, they didn't simply put on a pair of pink gown and hats to blend in with the rest of the panicking work force. It would have been so much easier. By that time I had forgotten all about Jason Bourne, and figured out what 'legacy' was supposed to indicate, even if we only got a single snapshot to remind us that he was once the principal character of the series."

The movie fails to follow the principle of showing not telling which the previous Bourne movies did beautifully in their cinematography. Bourne legacy drives the plot mainly through dialogue which is poorly written and the overall movie feels generic. However the film is still entertaining if you don't make comparisons to the previous films.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was actually with Rachel Weisz.

","Let me make it clear: there are two ways in which you can possibly check out this film -<br/><br/>Either as something at par with the previous films of the series or as a standalone film.<br/><br/>If you're watching it expecting something as great as the previous Bourne movies, then this film might not just impress you, because it misses not just the magic of writing but even Bourne himself (and this is no spoiler). Jeremy Renner is a very good actor who plays Aaron Cross brilliantly, but just don't expect another Jason Bourne; You'll get a first Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>And that's something great.<br/><br/>If you're watching it as a standalone film, then you might not be disappointed, but due to some continuity and better understanding reasons, it IS recommended to watch the previous movies. Anyways, the film has been shot very well. If there's something this film has at par with the previous movies, then it's undoubtedly the action. All action sequences are mindblowing and exhilarating, especially the chase sequence in the climax: it was really AWESOME!<br/><br/>The film however disappoints on the editing front. The first 30 minutes are painfully slow with just a few good shots and scenery. The screenplay is a little convoluted during this time, and it requires a lot of patience to wait for something exciting to happen. The previous Bourne movies were gripping right from the beginning, and this doesn't happen with this one. But right after the first 30 minutes are over, you get exactly what you'd have wished for: explosive action sequences and thrills. From here, the film goes almost right till the end. <br/><br/>THE BOURNE LEGACY is an enjoyable action thriller ""Bourne"" out of the previous films of the series, and with its excellent action sequences proves to be an energetic action thriller worth watching. I hope Jason Bourne and Aaron Cross meet in future. What will that movie be called, then? THE BOURNE EXCELLENCY, I guess."

","The first Bourne movie was really the high point for this now foursome. Matt Damon was quiet and controlled in his portrayal of a man who had loss his identity.

So now comes this reboot and frankly I was hoping for more but not expecting it. Jason Renner is okay in his role but his role is part of the problem. Jason Bourne you cared about, Jason Bourne you could identify with and that's probably due to Matt Damon's performance but also it was due to the fact that they made Jason Bourne a real flesh and blood man. The same cannot be said for this new ""Outcome agent"". They hint at his back story but their so concerned with leaving themselves something to talk about in the next film that the audience frankly doesn't get this new character. Yes he fights great, runs and jumps but you've seen it all before. Inbetween those moments there is a lot of nothing from him. In fact his chatty nature really works against the whole character persona of these guys who exist but don't exist. The behind the scenes in Washington with, the brilliant Edward Norton and Stacey Keach (who I was glad to see) is far more intriguing but they the story doesn't allow for what could have been some really great stuff. Poor Rachel Weitz who I also think is a great actress is totally wasted until the end of the movie I really wanted her to die. Well I'd say that this is the end of Bourne but I know that's not true."

","Seriously the story could have been a little more improvised and suited for the action ... the acting was good....action scenes was well taken ... but overall it lacked the Bourne touch... It lacked the Matt Damon magic and the older Bourne movies style and thrills ...the assassin which at all bourne movies used to hunt down bourne was more strong and a sure strong enemy but in this bourne movie that thai assassin sent by the CIA could not make a good run for the action created...it was just vague and bike chasing in the end instead of cars was a change but was kinda stretched and long, making it boring and tiresome .... Renner tried to give his best ...while Weisz and the rest of the cast did a nice job... maybe it could try make up for this movie in the next installment if there is gonna be one... its a watchable movie if u like action movies."
"jmcginn174","5","4","12","10 August 2012"," It was like they were trying to force a round peg into a square hole with this story and film.
","Going to the midnight showing of The Bourne Legacy I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I had with other movies I've had doubts with. Like I had doubts with when I went to see the Bourne Identity, but before I get to my opinion of the film I must first talk about the films that came before. After all Legacy is a continuation and a direct sequel to the Bourne films, so I must first talk about the previous films a little first. Back in 2001 and 2002 leading up to the Bourne Identity I had only remembered seeing Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan and Good Will Hunting nor had I heard of the books Identity was based off of, so I had my doubts about the film. Still I took a chance and was happily surprised. The Bourne Identity was a great film. The action wasn't over the top like much of the action films of the 1980's and 1990's. It had a unique story, which at the time I don't remember it having been done like it had with this film. The characters were interesting, and the music was great. The film led me to Robert Ludlum novels the film was based off of. I read his three Bourne novels and I must admit I enjoyed the Identity and the rest of the films more then I like the novels. Right now I can only think of one other time that has happened, and it was with The Lord of the Ring series. I enjoyed the novels, but they were truly great books. The films on the other hand were great especially the first two. When The Bourne Supremacy came out in 2004 I had no doubts about the film or Mat Damon this time. It was a great film, and that was even with them killing of Marie an important character from the books and a character I liked. That's how good Supremacy was for me, and who could forget the car chase seen in Moscow with Karl Urban. It's one of the best car chases scenes of all time along with the likes of Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin and The Road Warrior. When The Bourne Ultimatum came out in 2007 it had a lot to live up to, and through I thought it would be good I didn't think it could surpass Supremacy, but again I was wrong. Ultimatum was as good if not better than its predecessor. That's a rarity in films and franchises for a third sequel to be as good if not better than the film that came before. Right now I can only think of a few films like The Revenge of the Sith, The Dark Knight Rises and Alien 3. Ultimatum was a great film and had a good ending. I know the studio and director left an opening for another film, but in my opinion they should had let sleeping dogs lie. Robert Ludlum had stopped writing Bourne novels back in 1990. I know Eric Van Lustbader is a capable writer, but Ludlum had finished Bourne's journey and the novels feel forced. Matt Damon was moving on, and so was Paul Greengrass. If Universal really wanted to continue with the franchise it should have gotten down on its hands and knees and begged those two to come back, and pay them whatever they wanted. You can see why I had my doubts about Legacy. Still with that being said I'd still gave it a chance like I had with Matt Damon and Identity back in 2002, which leads us to Bourne Legacy.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Where to begin? I could start with the lackluster action, the uninteresting characters. No I'll start with the forced story. When I saw the trailers it looked like they were trying to turn Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) into some kind of super soldier. If I want to see a movie with super heroes in it I'd go to see any of the super hero films that come out every few months now a days. That was what was so good about the Bourne films. Sure Jason Bourne was government trained killer, but he was still human, and could get hurt. It's one of the reason's the films were so good. In Legacy they tried to destroy what was so good about the previous films with the story about genetics and drugs turning people into super soldiers. Then there is Gilory trying to force his failed story into the Bourne universe. It's like a child trying to force a square peg into a round opening it just isn't going to work. That's what it feels like in this film as director and writer Gilory tries to force his story with Bourne's. Sure Gilory was the writer for the previous films, but he had inspiration from Ludlum's books. If he created this screenplay on his own then he needs to stick to adapting screenplays from novels, because he can't do it on his own. Maybe Universal forced him to do it this way after all I know they were desperate to keep this franchise going. If so then I can forgive him for his lackluster to bad screen play. The only thing or person that truly saves the story is Aaron Cross. His story is compelling especially how he came to be part of the program and who he was before it. The character kept me interested in the film.<br/><br/>Sorry I'm not posting my full review, but IMDb doesn't let users post reviews with more then a thousand words for some reason.

"Mustang92","2","3","8","21 December 2012"," BORING Legacy
","This movie is a mess, it's convoluted, it attempts to be highly intelligent but fails miserably. Nearly every scene has either medical jargon or CIA/intelligent community lexicon in it, but... after the first 15 minutes of the movie, you no longer care whether you actually understand the lingo they're using or not. Phrases such as ""She's going to try to viral him out""... pulleeeease. Every frickin' scene has rubbish in it like this. I guess that's Tony Gilroy's attempt to show how smart he is, and we're SUPPOSED to think, ""Cool, I've never heard this before."" But instead of being successful with this, Heir Director & Screenwriter only succeed in making us roll our eyes during every scene.<br/><br/>I think one of the problems, I regret to say, is what I call the curse of the Director who also wrote the script. Far too often, the Director who gets to direct his own script is far too enamored with his/her own words, that they have no perspective on telling the story. Because in this film, there really is no story.<br/><br/>And perhaps because of his past success with the first 3 Bourne scripts, and his success with writing/directing ""Michael Clayton,"" the studio gave him free reign. But this was a mistake for this film. (Universal almost always ranks at the bottom of the 6 studios every year for Box Office grosses... clearly, the execs at this studio don't know how to oversee the creation and execution of good scripts. Of course, this could be said for all the studios. But when the studios at the top of the leader board earn twice what Universal does, clearly the folks at Universal have their heads up their butts.)<br/><br/>Back to ""Boring Legacy."" The other problems here -- and I simply don't understand it, because Jeremy Renner has shown charisma in his other work -- but he is just plain boring here. Flat and uninteresting. What happened? Is playing a troubled hero not in his bag of skills? Or is Tony Gilroy's direction so horrible that he messed up Renner? Rachel Weisz shows some spark here, but her dialogue is so horrible, that she's stuck with trying to make us believe it. All the other actors in this film, including the stars, are also flat as hell. NO ONE is really interesting in this film. Jesus.<br/><br/>Acting: D-<br/><br/>Set Pieces (action sequences): D-<br/><br/>Directing: F<br/><br/>Screenplay: F<br/><br/>Dialogue: F<br/><br/>Production: D<br/><br/>My last complaint. We travel to a bunch of cities, but the tone, the color timing, everything about the photography was also flat and boring. For some films, this *might* be appropriate. For this film, it only makes the whole experience of viewing it much worse.<br/><br/>The shame of all this? The first 2 Bourne movies were excellent. The 3rd one, decent. ""Boring Legacy"" however has tainted the franchise for me, and please God, don't let Universal make another one. Unless it's got Damon starring in it, AND someone else other than Gilroy directing.<br/><br/>And that's telling, actually. Damon refused to do a 4th Bourne film with Gilroy directing. I wonder why."

","When I first saw the commercials for the Bourne Legacy, I thought they would've done something close to the book but have a different actor to do Bourne. Having recently read the book, I had still had it fresh in my mind. But instead of him almost getting killed and stopping a terrorist attack while evading the CIA, he goes to manila to get viral out so he doesn't die? Maybe the book they did it off of wasn't the book i read (mine was Robert Ludlum's written by Eric van Lustbadder). However I did get some humor out of it (Spoiler alert, like when he destroyed the drone with a sniper rifle). They did a good job with picking the main leads, but I mean really?!?

","This movie looks great and, at first glance, seems like a worthy follow up to the earlier movies. After seeing it, however, I can say that, while it does have excellent acting, directing, and so forth -- it's just the story that's a bit weak. Without giving away specifics, it's fair to say that the movie attempts to follow several different developing story lines, to its detriment. The entire affair feels disjointed and disconnected. In the earlier movies, jumping from city to city and between different characters was an effective way to push the story forward and really notch up the tension. In this movie, it's just frankly confusing at times and absolutely stalls the momentum. One story line in particular felt completely superfluous and tacked-on. All things considered, not a worthy successor to the Damon movies despite Renner's outstanding performance."

There are intense sequences of thrills and action throughout the movie. The action looks very much real and is simply amazing.<br/><br/>MATT DAMON portrayed the character of JASON BOURNE in first three movies. In this movie, another field agent AARON CROSS is replacing JASON BOURNE character. The movie subtitle itself mentions THERE WAS NEVER JUST A ONE which explains the replacement of the character. MATT DAMON acted so much brilliantly in three movies that it made a lot of expectations in viewer's minds for fourth movie. JEREMY RENER fulfills this expectation completely.<br/><br/>There is an excellent on screen chemistry between JEREMY RENER and RACHAEL WEISZ throughout the movie.

","As we glean from the title, ""Bourne Legacy"" is about discovering what the highly trained CIA agents can do to sort of live up to Jason Bourne (i.e. Matt Damon).<br/><br/>While I don't think Jeremy Renner quite achieves Damon's level (part of it is we don't really understand Renner's motive to fight back against the CIA other than the fact that they tried to kill him and he needs pills), Renner does strike an imposing figure from the very beginning as you watch him go through his training program. He seems to at least be up to the task and we should get a better understanding of what he can do in subsequent film(s).<br/><br/>Because make no mistake, writer/director Tony Gilroy appears to be planning at least one more film after seeing the ending to 'Legacy'. It ends so abruptly that when the score came up signaling the end, I had to check the time because I had no idea the 125 minute run time was up.<br/><br/>People will complain about the incomplete story (the film felt as if it could continue for another 60 minutes easy) but if you look at it in the context of there being more films, there should be no problem with it.<br/><br/>Where this movie delivers is in its initial storyline and the intelligent writing throughout the script. The premise of genomic enhancement feels very real considering our time. The way the film incorporates that and the new CIA programs like Outcome and Larx, to me, is gripping. One of the biggest appeals to me of this series has been learning about the assassins and in this film you feel as if they are getting better and stronger even if you don't really see whether they truly are. The film does an outstanding job for the first 60 minutes of tying in what was happening as the third film came to a close and in the days immediately following.<br/><br/>Where the film lacks is a clear understanding of what Cross's motives are. We understand him trying to evade the CIA after they try to eliminate him but do his motives end with his cycling off medication and going into hiding? Is there something more that Cross wishes to achieve? All of these agents enter the program they are in because they want to help their country, even Jason Bourne had this motive, so perhaps something will occur to awaken that desire once again.<br/><br/>Renner is good, Rachel Weisz is outstanding (very refreshing to have a good actress alongside the leading assassin) and Edward Norton does a solid job as Col. Eric Beyer leading the clean-up team at the CIA.<br/><br/>You see potential for more from Cross and it's intriguing to me to see what developments Gilroy will have in store for us. I hope we haven't seen the last of Jason Bourne (and Damon) in action, though. It'd be nice to see a Cross/Bourne partnership to accomplish some task whether it's aiding the CIA or helping to expose the poor leadership once and for all, etc."

","Now pay close attention: despite what the title says this is not a fourth entry that further chronicles the journey of Jason Bourne; instead this is a stand-alone film that exists in the same ""realm"" as the original Bourne series and features some of the same characters and circumstances. This time around the protagonist is Aaron Cross (Renner), a member of a CIA black ops program who becomes a marked man after the program overseer (Norton) decides to eliminate all assets, that is until Cross acquires help from a reluctant scientist (Weisz), thus making them both a target. Not as tense or engaging as you'd like it to be, with a plot that's often too convoluted for its own good, but fairly effective at times thanks to good pacing, inventive action scenes/stunts, and solid work from Renner and Weisz. **½"
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","3","8","12 August 2012"," The Superspy Torch Has Been Passed
","""The Bourne Legacy"" is a competent and satisfying spy action thriller, although I suspect it will be problematic for those unfamiliar with the first three ""Bourne"" films. This fourth chapter isn't quite the start of a new trilogy, as some of the ads have suggested; the events of the previous installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" are heavily referenced, as are bits and pieces running through all the films, most notably the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs. It's never fair, having to catch up on ancient history before delving into a new installment, which should always be allowed to stand on its own. Still, if you can get past the intricate details, you may find that the film is engaging. It benefits strongly from the presence of Jeremy Renner, who takes the reins from Matt Damon as the next superspy-gone-rogue, whose name is Aaron Cross. With a fresh character at the helm, the series doesn't seem so repetitive.<br/><br/>Although there is unfinished business with the original trilogy, which were based on novels by the late Robert Ludlum, this film behaves as if the story were staring all over again. This means that it's less about the plot and more about the craft of a spy thriller; scenarios are manufactured primarily so that Cross can employ his superior skills, not the least of which is his ability to engage in hand-to-hand combat. As the film progresses, the action will only get more elaborate and occur more frequently. It all culminates with a rather spectacular motorcycle chase on the surface streets and highways of Manila, at which point Cross is being pursued relentlessly by both an assassin and the entire police force. Does any of this mean anything? I'm hard pressed to say. But I sure enjoyed watching it. And the fact that the final shot is a boat riding off into the sunset suggests the filmmakers knew to not take the film so seriously.<br/><br/>The film opens with Cross, a specially trained agent for a CIA offshoot called Outcome, roughing it in the snowy wilderness of Alaska. At precise intervals, he takes a dwindling supply of blue and green pills, which are later revealed to enhance mental and physical abilities. His unexpected encounter with another Outcome agent (Oscar Isaac) is cut short when a guided missile destroys the latter's cabin. He goes into pure survival mode; as he's being shot at by unmanned fighter planes, he removes a tracking device from under the skin of his stomach and forces a wolf to swallow it. It seems Cross is being hunted, although he doesn't know why. Fortunately, we in the audience do. Here enters Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a CIA official who has made it his mission to have the remaining Outcome agents assassinated. This comes on the heels of Jason Bourne's personal quest for the truth, which in turn led to the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs being publicly exposed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we meet Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a genetic scientist for Outcome. A series of unforeseen events, kick-started by her trusted colleague's inexplicable shooting spree, bring Shearing into Cross' life, the latter saving her life from CIA agents sent to assassinate her. We, of course, are not supposed to question the ease and speed with which Cross is able to make his way from Alaska all the way to Virginia – or perhaps it was Maryland, although I don't think it matters in the slightest. That's just how it happens in stories like this. Anyway, after fleeing the scene of a burning house, Shearing tells Cross that it's possible to make the side effects of his medications permanent. He only needs to be injected with a very specific type of virus. Trouble is, this can only be done at a pill factory in Manila. And so they board a plane for the Philippines, unaware that the CIA is tracking them down.<br/><br/>The Rachel Weisz character is developed on a somewhat more advanced level than the Franka Potente character from the first two ""Bourne"" films. Shearing's profession, for one thing, has some bearing on the plot, which is to say that her actions can actually advance it. And because she understands the science behind the medications Cross has been taken, she does double duty as a provider of exposition. Having said that, her inclusion is still largely out of obligation for a female sidekick. This becomes especially apparent during the final act, at which point the pace dramatically picks up and we're inundated with stunts and special effects. It's strongly hinted that she will become his love interest, which should come as a surprise to no one. I have a feeling their relationship will be much less open to interpretation once the next film is released.<br/><br/>I sound like I'm complaining, but really, this movie gave me everything I expected and actually wanted. It's not a great film by any means, and it certainly doesn't try for anything original as far as spy thrillers are concerned, but it sticks to its established formula well, and the cast was engaging. I don't think we're meant to delve too deeply into stories like this; they exist primarily as escapist entertainment, giving us plenty in the way of structure and spectacle but not so much in the way of meaning. I knew ""The Bourne Legacy"" was intended to be mindless fun when I saw a shot of Jeremy Renner scaling the walls of a house with the impossible speed and fluidity of Spider-Man. I watch these films convinced that there's no more mileage for a sequel to cover, and every time I'm proved wrong. This either means these films are genuinely good or I've become lazy. I prefer the former explanation.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"sanddragon939","8","3","8","12 August 2012"," Upholds the Legacy...despite its flaws
","The Bourne trilogy, loosely (VERY loosely!) based on the international bestsellers by Robert Ludlum and starring Matt Damon as the amnesiac black ops agent on the run from his former masters, redefined the espionage-thriller genre for the 21st century; with its gritty, realistic action; serious themes and emphasis on character and plot over glamour and exoticism. No less a franchise as James Bond has since been stylistically influenced by this groundbreaking series. But unlike the flamboyant 007, Jason Bourne's story was one with a clear beginning, middle and end. That end masterfully came about in the closing scenes of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. For years it was believed Universal had finally laid one of its most successful franchises to rest - but inevitably, mass popularity and the lure of unprecedented commercial success won out, and 'The Bourne Legacy' is the result...<br/><br/>The Bourne franchise is back, but oddly enough, Jason Bourne isn't. When Matt Damon, perhaps rightly, declined to return his iconic character to the big screen, Universal cast Jeremy Renner to play an entirely different character, albeit one patterned after Bourne at least on the surface level. Tony Gilroy, screen-writer of all Bourne films too date and the director of this one, has described 'Legacy' as not so much a sequel as much as an 'expansion' of the universe, and having seen the film, I have decided it is prudent to take him at his word.<br/><br/>The early part of 'The Bourne Legacy' runs parallel to the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Even as Jason Bourne races across the globe, exposing the Treadstone program he was once part of, Colonel Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton), becomes increasingly concerned about the fall-out Bourne's very public actions will have on the myriad of US Government sanctioned black ops program. When the sh#t finally hits the fan (in the aforementioned ending of 'Ultimatum'), Byer decides to liquidate the 'Outcome' program, closely related to the now-exposed Treadstone. This involves not only the termination of its deep-cover genetically enhanced operatives, but also the scientists behind the breakthroughs that made the program possible.<br/><br/>The movie follows the stories of the two survivors of the purge-Outcome field operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and Outcome scientist and medical researcher Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who must depend on each other for their very survival. The pulse-pounding and often brutal action scenes are complemented very nicely by the chemistry between Renner and Weisz's characters. Marta is definitely a much superior female character to Franke Potente's Marie and Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons from the trilogy. And Norton's morally ambiguous Byer comes across not so much as a villain as much as the uber-pragmatist, a self- confessed 'Sin Eater' who buries the 'moral excrement' in his work deep down inside. But where the film derives its strength from characterization and action, it is severely flawed when it comes to plot...especially towards the end. The conclusion is abrupt and provides hardly any resolution, beyond the tacit assurance of yet another sequel set in the Bourne universe...For a series that prided itself on its masterful story-telling, 'Legacy's' open-ended conclusion is sure to leave a sour taste in the mouths of many a die-hard fan and critic alike!<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'The Bourne Legacy' set out with a specific purpose-to make the Bourne franchise viable again by expanding the universe through new characters and concepts. It certainly achieves THAT purpose and more, but fails to retain the standards of its predecessors when viewed as a stand-alone story."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","8","11 August 2012"," You've already seen it after reading the plot synopsis
","The Bourne Legacy is one of those movies that you've already seen after reading the plot synopsis. It is about a man who is on the run from a secretive government agency that is trying to kill him. That's it. There is really nothing else that needs to be said. It looks and sounds important. It opens with a lot of important-looking government people who have a lot of of top notch computer equipment talking insider jargon about something that sounds really important. It takes us a minute or two of confusion before we realize that it doesn't really matter what they are talking about. All that yakking is just exposition to set up a long chase. Why didn't they just skip the chatter and get to the chase? The movie opens with an intriguing series of events. A man (Jeremy Renner) is floating in icy cold water and reaches out to grab a cylinder. He pulls himself out of the water and we realize that he's half-naked, exposed to the elements in the snowiest mountains of Alaska. He sits by the fire to warm himself. His cylinder contains green and blue pills. For the next hour, or so, he will spend his time in that frozen wilderness wrestling with wolves, climbing mountains and taking his medication.<br/><br/>That's followed by some events that are not so intriguing. We sit through a lot of boring (and rather confusing) talk from those important government people (who are played by Edward Norton, Stacy Keach and Scott Glenn) who are very upset that their secret agent program - called ""The Program"" - is no longer so secret. It seems that ""The Program"" has suffered a security breach, so the important people order all of their field agents to take a triangular yellow pill that will take them off ""The Program"" – the hard way.<br/><br/>Yet, as you might expect, one stubborn agent refuses to take the pill. That's our friend in Alaska, who is briefed by the agency with a missile that destroys the cabin he just exited. With some quick thinking he takes out the drone that was carrying that missile and goes on the run. That's the set-up for the rest of the movie. This man, whom we eventually learn is named Aaron Cross, has been given medication that will enhance his survival abilities, thus making him an important asset to ""The Program."" Aaron needs the medication; unfortunately it was destroyed along with the cabin, so his only hope is to find the doctor who prescribed it to him. She's Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a biologist who was in charge of dispensing medication to the agents in the field. In a very scary scene, a fellow doctor (Zeljko Ivanek) goes insane and shoots everyone else in her lab, so she goes on the run herself, eventually joined up with Aaron as they trot across the globe.<br/><br/>From there it is one long chase as operatives from ""The Program"" try to kill Aaron and Marta as they attempt to get to The Philippines to get their hands on some of Aaron's medication. That means a lot of disguises, phony passports and surveillance cameras watching their every move. It also means that we get several spectacular stunt pieces and shoot-outs. There is a car chase, a foot chase, and a very long motorcycle chase around the streets of Manila while our heroes are chased by a dogged assassin whose role in this story is left kind of a mystery.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is, of course, the fourth film of the Jason Bourne series that started 10 years ago with ""The Bourne Identity."" Up till now it has starred Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, but he grew tired of the series and bowed out. Now, we have Jeremy Renner (in truth, a scruffier and much more focused actor) in the lead. He gives the film a certain amount of credibility, but what does he have to work with? Unlike the latest James Bond pictures which contain a lot of action but also gravity and weight and a tight storyline, this series is kind of threadbare. What it needs is a script with some purpose, some focus, and a better narrative. This particular entry is all over the place. The film is sure-footed as far as its action scenes go, but to what end? This is a competent, good-looking action picture that is all style and very little substance. As action movies go, you could do worse (see this instead of ""Total Recall"".) but you won't take much away from it when it's over.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"
"jai84@yahoo.com","7","3","8","11 August 2012"," A Bourne Legacy minus Bourne
","Can a Sequel/Spin off stand up to the original series without it's protagonist ??<br/><br/>This is the million dollar question I asked myself when I first heard about this movie being made. Watching the film it seems everyone involved with this project at Universal also had the same question in mind because although the movie is not half bad it is stuck between trying to be a departure from the original trilogy while also trying to retain the structural similarities with it.<br/><br/>It took everyone by surprise when both Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass decided not to come back and do a fourth one which was being planned as the final chapter before the inevitable reboot. While Damon brought a very sympathetic and human side to this spy character, it was Paul Greengrass who infused Bourne 2 and Bourne 3 with a non stop sense of kinetic energy that worked very well for the franchise .<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy, writer/director knows this universe very well having written all the previous films and it shows. There is a lot of filling the gaps in the plot in the first half of the movie where Gilroy resorts to lengthy dialog and slow paced editing to expand on the idea of why and how is CIA going to kill it's rogue agents referencing events from Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum to give us a sense that the narrative is set running parallel to those two movies. It comes of as a smart writing move to let us know more shady details and background about the whole CIA recruitment and training program and why do they want to run down their own super spy program.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays Eric Bryer, an ex military recruiter for the agency now brought back to ""clean up the mess"". It's a welcome departure for Norton who revels in playing grey characters and he does justice to what is given to him. Watching him perform I was asking myself why did they not cast him as the lead in this one, he does not look too old for the part and would have made a solid upgrade from Matt Damon.But keeping my nerdy wishes aside I realized how good Jeremy Renner was in this role as Aaron Cross, from the opening sequence in Alaska to the hyper kinetic climax in Manila he seemed right for the part and elevated a few sequences with his unpredictability. The memory loss of a super spy is done away with a sci-fi element that does seem a little too convenient at times. Helping him on his journey for survival is Rachel Weisz as Dr.Marta Shearing who is indirectly contributing to the cause of creating these super spies via administering what is referred to as ""chems"" (enhancing drugs) into their bodies. This is where the movie somewhat has it's biggest failure, there is absolutely no chemistry between Renner and Weisz even though the director included a few scenes to build on it.<br/><br/>The movie boasts of more strengths than weaknesses in editing, cinematography and excellent background score by James Newton Howard. While it may not have many crowd pleasing moments which will leave many average action movie goers somewhat disappointed, I was more than happy to enjoy the more logically constructed plot . It is clear from the beginning that Gilroy is going for a more cerebral and toned down approach compared to the previous films. There is radical shift in the second half of the narrative and the movie never lets up after that. The last 20 to 30 minutes really crank it up on the action quotient that leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>So here it is, while not as great as it's predecessors the movie is a solid entry into the franchise if you can sit through the talky and expository first half. Matt Damon is surely missed for his presence and charisma but Renner fits right into his role and ensures that the Bourne's legacy is not tarnished after all<br/><br/>7 stars out of 10."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS The original Bourne flick starts with Jason Bourne suffering amnesia and seeking hi identity, such search leading him to question his ethics and morals prior to the amnesia. Kind of cliché, but it works.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy has no such deep meaning: Aaron Cross isn't searching for ""reasons why"". He's simply trying to stay a step or two ahead of the spy masters.<br/><br/>On the other hand the lack of Raison d'être did not occur to me until after I left the theater. The movie is well thought out, well acted, & well shot. It really does have everything except deeper meaning. The fight scenes are good and the chase scene at the end is fantastic (a hallmark of the Bourne series). The spy masters are portrayed as true believers of their cause, which somewhat removes them from 'obvious bad guys' as we are often accustomed in movies, but does provide a fuller characterization of why the hard choices are made than was attempted in previous Bourne films. Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz both deliver excellent support performances.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

","Most of the movie is basically just footage of the previous Bourne movie. I kept waiting for something exciting and new to happen but it never did.<br/><br/>The lead actor of the film, Jeremy Renner, moves very sluggishly and haphazardly, especially in comparison to Matt Damon, which makes his fight scenes look hard to believe. It's like his foes had to act like his hands were magical hands that would cause you to fall to the ground just by touching you. The wrestling on WWE looks more realistic than this! Matt Damon actually spent months of training in the arts of Filipino Kali, Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do, and the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira. On the other hand, it seems like Jeremy Renner's parents kept him in home school where he never got to see a real fight in his entire life!<br/><br/>Extremely suspenseful music was playing in scenes where the characters are just talking. In fact, 90% of the movie is just talking. I can't believe this bore fest is classified as an action film. It should be called a documentary!<br/><br/>The main villain in the film, the CIA's secret weapon known as ""Larx-03"", is introduced like he's going to be all tough and everything. Let's just say that both him and Jeremy Renner move like their afraid of falling down and getting hurt.<br/><br/>In closing, I am a big fan of the Bourne Trilogy! In fact, I believe them to be masterpieces. However, the latest installment doesn't deserve to use the word ""Bourne"" in any part of the movie, not even the credits."

","Can there really be a Bourne film without Jason Bourne? Well James Bond managed to continue it's franchise whilst changing the lead, so could Bourne? Well the answer unfortunately is no. I went into 'The Bourne Legacy' with high expectations, and they were not met by some distance. And I thought 'The Dark Knight Rises' was a let down.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stepped away from this entry in the franchise when the director of the last two films, Paul Greengrass was taken off the film by Universal. So we now have the writer of the previous films Tony Gilroy to direct this latest film in the series. Jeremy Renner takes the lead role as Aaron Cross who is an outgo agent. After the secrets of Tredstone and Jason Bourne are leaked to the press, all the other agents in the program are meant to be disposed off. However, Aaron Cross goes on the run with a scientist from the organisations played by Rachel Weisz. Edward Norton is great as Eric Byer, he works for the USAF and is trying to track down Cross.<br/><br/>That's the set up for the film and that is pretty much the whole film. I can't recall ever feeling so uninvolved in an action film before. The action is hard and fast, but at the same time very tedious. The moments that aren't filled with chases and explosions are characters talking to each other about nothing important. In fact, if it weren't for Jason Bourne's name being mentioned now and again in conversations, then this would not even be a Bourne film. It would just be a standard chase film.<br/><br/>The chases in the film are good and in parts pick the film up, even if to be dropped back down when the action is over. In fact the action saves me from giving the film a really low score, even though I'm not going to give it a high one either. Oh, and the film doesn't so much end as it does stops. That's right, the film stops in the middle of two characters talking. But by that point I wasn't expecting anything else.<br/><br/>The thing I loved about the original Bourne series was that it had as much brains as it did action. The character of Jason Bourne was as much an enigma to himself as he was to the audience. This made the character intriguing and made the action sequence a surprising spectacle as the audience was unaware what the character was capable of. In this film, we have Jeremy Renner, who I really like, playing action man who just beats up the bad guys.<br/><br/>All the intrigue has been left behind and all the ground braking cinematography that was used when Greengrass was in charge has gone. The film feels very empty, lifeless and just a money making scheme that has little respect for the first three films. 'The Bourne Legacy' didn't blow me away as it did bore me.<br/><br/>It just goes to show Bourne isn't Bourne without Bourne. In my opinion, if Bourne isn't going to be in a Bourne film, then don't put Bourne in the title. Now that was a lot of Bourne's in one sentence."

","THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) ***1/2 Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, Scott Glenn, Zeljko Ivanek, Albert Finney, Dennis Boutskiaris, Joan Allen, David Strathairn. Revved up chapter in the ongoing spy franchise this time without Matt Damon (although his image is floated about) instead focusing on another candidate for the undercover secret project to make a super soldier in this case Aaron Cross (intense Renner at his best) who learns of the nefarious underpinnings while attempting to stay alive long enough for exposure of the powers that be with unlikely help from one of his doctors/scientists enlisted to the project (Weisz slipping in effectively). Written and directed by Tony Gilroy (who penned the previous BOURNE flicks with his brother Dan) fits like a glove (a velvet once with an iron fist) in delivering a dense and at times very chatty exposition flowing auctioneer that thankfully kicks into gear with some truly hair-raising awesome stunt works namely a secluded house invasion and one of the best cinematic motorcycle chases ever committed to celluloid ala THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Long live ""BOURNE"" ."
"lotekguy-1","4","4","13","9 August 2012"," needs less chatter, more splatter
","The good news is that there's another sequel in the exciting hit espionage series that starred Matt Damon as the superspy who didn't know he was one, based on widely-read novels by genre master Robert Ludlum. The bad news is that neither the author nor the star had anything to do with this production. Instead we get Jeremy Renner as the next generation of chemically-enhanced operatives after Mr. Bourne, working from a story written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Based on this evidence, it's hard to believe Gilroy adapted the first three novels into such successful screenplays, since this spin off is, above all else, so dull.<br/><br/>The hush-hush program our intelligence services devised to create agents like Bourne is under fire, with leaks about its sordid activities about to cause a storm of backlash. The honchos scramble to destroy all evidence of what they did and how they did it, including silencing the unveilers with, as they supposedly say in the biz, extreme prejudice. Renner is the one who gets away, threatening international disgrace, and a whole bunch of careers. Those with power rarely give it up willingly. So Renner's on the run through a globe-trotting series of action scenes that never manage to add up to the thrillfest we've come to expect from this franchise.<br/><br/>The first hour is confusing, with so many players briefly shown in so many parts of the world, and far too much dialog for the amount of action. Renner is even stiffer than usual. Some of that is consistent with his character's training, but it still makes a less compelling bond with viewers than the norm for heroes in such flicks. Gilroy is also wanting as a director (his first high-octane venture, after the relatively cerebral Duplicity and Michael Clayton), deriving less payoff in the chases and fights than he should have wrung from the budget and assets on his sets. Among the big summer action epics thus far, this one ranks as the most disappointing."
"xtian_durden","7","4","13","9 August 2012"," No more sequels.
","Not as exciting as any of the first three films. Even though Jeremy Renner gave a fine performance that for me is still considered below Matt Damon's, the whole movie is lesser, in the plot, in the writing, in style, in wit, and in almost every way you look at it. The second part of the movie became totally different, and it was packed by chase scenes that just wanted to fill in for the last few minutes of the movie. For me it didn't felt like a ""Bourne"" movie. I was really looking up for Tony Gilroy who had brilliantly written the three films, they wanted to equal the first Bourne films but they fell short. In my opinion, the weakest in the series. Please no more unnecessary sequels."

","*SPOILERS* <br/><br/>Oh boy The Bourne Legacy is not a good movie, but it is way better than Jason Bourne but worse movie than The Bourne Ultimatum. It has great action sequences better than In The Bourne Ultimatum, but that doesn't say much. I never liked The Bourne Ultimatum and I don't like this movie ether. It is not a good movie and I really don't care that there is no Jason Bourne in this movie. <br/><br/>I would say it is solid but the character Aaron Cross does not work for me, he is selfish and useless to me a real dead agent! All he cared was to get the Virus and those pills to survive. He saved Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) by agents only to used her to get the pills and the Virus so that he could survive. <br/><br/>Seriously this movie is horrible, the plot is weak, not logic and an interesting science fiction movie the lead character Aaron Cross is not likable.<br/><br/>This movie is way too long and really boring at sometimes. I like Edward Norton in this he was fantastic I love the actor he is acting skills are fantastic. I actually cared more about Norton's character than Renner character. <br/><br/>The airplane vehicle Predator, an unmanned aerial vehicle like the one featured was excellent weapon and I like it. <br/><br/>The motor chase was a really decent action stunt in which Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz real performed. That is why I can say the action sequence is much way better than it was performed in Bourne Ultimatum. Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner were fantastic and acting from them was really good and I like it. <br/><br/>I only liked these three actors I mentioned Edward Norton, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz and the motor chase sequence an that is all the rest of the movie is useless to me and an watchable except if I want to waste my time. <br/><br/>The plot, the sci-fi and the story just didn't worked for me. I didn't like how this movie crucified Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) as the fall guy and the CIA covered everything up and get away with their crimes I really did not like that. <br/><br/>I don't understand this movie, Aaron almost did not do anything trough entire movie, he escaped the CIA agents but the bad guy got away he didn't expose them he did not do nothing but run which it is stupid. <br/><br/>Someone said it is way better than The Bourne Identity well it is not, it is worse than Bourne Identity. <br/><br/>This is not a real spy movie, there are no espionage in here at all. <br/><br/>I would rather watch James Bond Movies, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, XIII: The Conspiracy, The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger miles way better movies than Bourne Legacy.<br/><br/>The rating for me is F 1/10 I don't hate the movie, but I don't like it, it is not a good action movie like everyone is saying it is just a waste of time. The movie starts slow, it is boring, not enjoyable and forgettable."

Renner and Weisz carried the entire thing, but outside of liking them I cared little or nothing for the ""characters"" or the ""story.""<br/><br/>What made Jason Bourne so compelling was that he was completely lost and there were strangers trying to kill him - a double nightmare loaded with action, mystery, and suspense. Further, we cared about him not only because his situation was scary and he was frightened, but because he was also repenting and struggling with what he was and did while brain washed at Treadstone. Aaron Cross and Dr. Shearing however are two characters of little interest simply running for their lives from the government they were working for. Aaron Cross in fact, as per a scene with Ed Norton, could be considered a ready and willing villain! He's not trying to get his life back, or get out of the business, or clear his conscience, he's just a killer that wants to stay smart (remain on enhancement meds) and not get killed. There's nothing to figure out, no ending to arrive at, and therefore nothing to follow, connect to, or really care about. <br/><br/>This movie was total bore that simply rode on its loose association to the far superior Bourne Trilogy."

Making a new film and using the franchise name Bourne is a responsibility. I guess Tony Gilroy did not care about that. There are new people watching Legacy as it is their first time Bourne movie and Fans who expect a lot. None of the audience was satisfied. I am a Bourne fan myself and I was prepared for ""It will be an Okay film."" I wasn't really expecting much and even I was disappointed.<br/><br/>----THE BADS----:<br/><br/>-Since it is an action movie I can easily say there weren't many breath- taking action scenes in Legacy. On previous Bourne films Jason had a lot of hand to hand, 1 on 1 fight scenes with another agents like himself for 2-3 minutes.Realistic, struggling, no music at the background, hard, fast and brutal. On this one, Aaron Cross successfully beaten up few fat cops to make his way up to somewhere but that's it.Rather than this, there were not enough mind using skills either.<br/><br/>-Jason was speaking in 2-3 different languages in every movie depending on the situation.Oh yeah, that's right there weren't many situations on this film.<br/><br/>-Aaron Cross character is a newbie okay I can tolerate that but still he shouldn't be an agent going in the cabin in the woods at the beginning of the film, keeping up the smile with ""Hey !, What's up !?"" to Sayid inside.These guys are serious killers, there's no place for friendliness.Obviously, it is the script's fault not Jeremy's.<br/><br/>-Musics ? They were not that good plus sorry but what happened to the real Bourne theme music with violins ?<br/><br/>-Trailer explains the whole movie and also the whole action scenes too so we watched whats unnecessary in the film.<br/><br/>-Spending Edward Norton for nothing.I believe Norton was in this film for a favor and he just liked previous films.<br/><br/>-Too much stupidities about yellow,blue,green skittles when just one syringe is enough.<br/><br/>-Killing agents and the already-not-aware-of-anything scientists is not the best solution. -The epic funny return of the Asian agent flipping-like-a-coin agent after he was shot on the motorcycle chase.Which year is this ? 90s ?<br/><br/>Thankfully Matt Damon was not in this film because I would lose my respect for the other 3 as well.Scenario was bad, I felt like they were short on budget and the time so they decided to make something up quickly. If they worked on the film ""just a bit"" more smarter and carefully, it could be a fantastic 4th film.They actually caught a point about something to hold on to but still failed it.<br/><br/>----GOODS----:<br/><br/>The first 3 movies was so good that I kinda liked this one with the influence of the trilogy.

","In the previous films it is the story of Bourne's quest for identity/redemption that drives the narrative. With the carefully constructed development of the Bourne character you ""empathise"" for Bourne. He is an ""innocent"" who doesn't kill unless he has too. As good as Renner is as an actor, this movie didn't gel like the others which Is a director/script problem. Aaron Cross is simply not a compelling character. Gilroy might have written the screen play for the other movies, but previous director Paul Greengrass does a far superior job in directing both the action and plot elements. His work is sorely missed in this movie. <br/><br/>Other problems abound throughout the movie. Where are Pamela Landy and Noah Volson? Tacked on the end as a cheap after thought so that there can be a sequel. The ending feels odd as there's no real resolution.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful elements in the previous films was the music; the clear musical 'themes' in the previous movies for each character/scenario instantly conveyed both plot and gave the audience an emotional connection with narrative. I would have expected to hear echoes of these themes in a movie claiming to be a ""legacy"" of the previous movies - but not one of these is present which I found really disappointing.<br/><br/>This movie had big shoes to fill ... and didn't.

"craigiyama","5","3","9","24 August 2012"," Good, but should and could be so much better
","Where do i start with this movie, I have very mixed feelings about it. If judged by the standards of the previous Bourne movies then it is at best mediocre and thats probably being a bit too generous. If judged on its own and ignoring its predecessors then it's actually pretty OK. <br/><br/>Lets start with the positives. The action scenes are for the most part well shot and edited. The main chase scenes suffers from a few too many close up shots and quick cuts which can make it a bit hard to tell exactly what's happening but overall it's pretty good. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is another plus, he does an excellent job with a very poor script and tries his best to bring some life to the role. By far the biggest plus point of the movie is Rachel Weisz who does an excellent job as the damsel in distress and is the most believable character in the entire film. <br/><br/>Now for the negatives. The story line is awful, set to occur simultaneously with the events of the other Bourne movies Ed Nortons character tries to shut down all the various operations with super spies which led to the creation of Jason Bourne and Aaron Cross(Renner) in case the public becomes aware these programs exist. He then tries to kill all the agents and succeeds apart from Renner obviously. <br/><br/>This is where the problems start as Renner then has no other mission apart from scoring more of the drugs he needs to keep himself pumped up. He has nothing to discover or learn about himself or why this is happening and his character never develops. He doesn't try to find out who is responsible or why. He still has all his memories so there's nothing for him to learn and there are a series of pointless flashbacks to his previous life which tell us absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The pace is very slow and takes ages to get going and when it does the chase lacks the suspense and sense of danger that made the previous Bourne films such a thrill. There is also no resolution its like the chase ends and then so does the film, I'm not sure if this is so it can lead into a sequel but Renner and Weisz are just sailing off into the sunset having accomplished nothing more then scoring his drugs, which then why does he need if he's just going to sail off and retire. Which makes the whole film seem very pointless and like a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>By far the biggest plot whole which is completely inexplicable is that after Renner scores his drugs Norton sends another super spy to kill him. Fine you'd say, every movie needs an equally tough baddie to challenge the hero but they'd just killed off every other super spy and only Renner survived so how is this other guy suddenly available for work. <br/><br/>So overall not bad if you just want to watch some action and good chases but let down horribly by a poor script, storyline and complete lack of character development and purpose. A poor addition to the franchise and clearly released purely for an easy buck and not because there is anything to add the Bourne storyline."
"quinnox-1","5","3","9","20 August 2012"," Mediocre
","I gotta agree with those who thought this was disappointing and just blah. The script and plot were terrible, jumping all over disjointedly, and there was no sense of excitement at all, or thrills. This is supposed to be a thriller with action but it doesn't deliver on either one. The action scenes were meh and lackluster. No big payoff at the end like you might have expected either. Jeremy Renner could be good as an action star in a better movie than this, but not this one. There were several scenes that seemed shoe-horned into the movie just to have some of the stars from the earlier movies get a cameo. This was not even close to the same league of the earlier Bourne films."

The chase scenes are exhilarating but cranky husband reminded me that we've seen it all before in recent Bond movies. Renner is a dull Bourne and not a patch on Matt Damon.

","It seems quite a few people didn't enjoy this movie for rather similar reasons, but I give it a 9/10.<br/><br/>It all depends on what you expect from this so-called sequel.<br/><br/>If you want someone like Matt Damon / Jason Bourne, with the same convoluted cover-up plot lines, and tense scenes from beginning to end, then you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I understand that loyal fans want more of the same, out of respect for the novels, original films, and their star and directors. But bear in mind that Legacy isn't based on anything Ludlum wrote, features a new cast, with Gilroy directing.<br/><br/>So I decided to expect changes, but just enough carried over from the Bourne trilogy to keep me satisfied.<br/><br/>The result: a high-octane thriller which has many standout moments; some of the best action sequences I've ever seen; superb performances from the supporting cast, but most importantly, a stellar turn from leading man, Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>I agree the first 30 minutes are slow, but welcome the opportunity the audience is given to observe an Outcome agent's rigorous training up close, since we never saw this in the Bourne movies.<br/><br/>Too much scientific / medical jargon weighing the script down? I found it riveting - but maybe that's because I'm a doctor myself. :) <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is, as always, excellent. Dr. Shearing is conveniently female, but Weisz infuses the character with quiet strength, stopping just short of tipping over the edge in a key scene where Shearing dissolves into hysterics.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is sorely underutilized but does his best regardless. There's only so much squinting and frowning one can digest before the routine gets old. I'm a big fan of Norton's, and he is one of the finest actors of his generation. Here's hoping he'll be back in Bourne #5, with Col. Byer's role expanded.<br/><br/>Director Gilroy does an admirable job following in the footsteps of Greengrass and Liman. I especially appreciate the less complex plot in Legacy - Bourne Identity was easy, but Supremacy and Ultimatum gave me whiplash - with more time allocated to the action.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Jeremy Renner. I've seen quite a few of his films, and applaud the producers and director for casting a 41-year-old instead of someone much younger. Renner is a double Oscar nominee, which helps a lot in the dramatic segments. However, he also possesses an astounding degree of athleticism, which wasn't apparent until Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, but is fully showcased in Legacy.<br/><br/>Remember Tom Cruise dangling outside the Burj Khalifa in MI4? Renner is equally up for danger as he sprints across rooftops and zooms through heavy traffic on a motorcycle in Manila. There're many more exceptional scenes with Renner's face clearly visible in the shots, but my personal favorite is the one at Shearing's countryside home, where Cross / Renner scales 20 feet of wall then launches himself into a 3rd floor room, before running to the top of the stairs to deliver a crack shot at an agent standing at the bottom.<br/><br/>Don't believe it's Renner? Check out The Bourne Legacy movie special with Alex Zane. There're clips of Renner scaling the wall, running across the flimsy rooftops, doing tumbles, riding the motorcycle at high speed etc.<br/><br/>Or better still, take a look at this amazing YouTube clip, at the 3:05 mark - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvIxaVNLXIg.<br/><br/>This is exactly what a Bourne movie needs.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see whether Bourne #5 will team Damon / Bourne with Renner / Cross. I have a feeling the latter is going to kick the former's ass.<br/><br/>Last but not least, thank you Mr. Gilroy, for including Singapore in your script! :)"

","When I first saw the trailer for this release I felt a mix of excitement (due to fact I love the original Bourne films) and slight apprehension as Paul Greengrass is not involved and most notably Matt Damon. The thing that gripped me most in the original films was not only the clever story lines and the well executed action scenes but it left the viewer thinking ""that could and probably has happened."" Bourne Legacy is very far fetched and a mediocre action film at best. Jeremy Renner is a great actor and if not for him I might have walked out of the cinema half way through in disgust at how this film has taken a classic franchise and gone completely way off track from where the story line ended. Some scenes left me feeling as though I was watching an early 90's Sylvester Stallone film, which I love by the way, but are a far cry away from the intelligence portrayed in the original films. There's a lack of story telling that we've come accustomed to from the Bourne franchise and instead the film relies on big explosions and stunt scenes to distract the viewer from a poorly executed and not well thought out film. if it weren't for the original films it would be an ""ok"" action flick, but its sad to see that Hollywood yet again squeeze's life out a franchise for one last pay day when it should have been laid to rest."

He really tried hard to step on the shoes of MATT, but the BAR that was raised by previous trilogy is so high that in the end it was so disappointed to waste a talent like of JEREMY. We have never seen our beloved Bourne smiling and cracking jokes in the trilogy, but AARON character does everything that Bourne doesn't.<br/><br/>BORING BORING.

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>The spy thriller has come of age in recent years, bringing with it enough violence and explosions to permanently dull one's senses with its onslaught of hair-raising stunt work, kinetic chases, and exaggerated leaps off buildings that would maim or kill any mere human being. With the body count ever increasing, so must the dare-devil exploits. This genre continually tops itself to produce cheap thrills for its adrenaline-deprived audience members as it sacrifices logical leaps and sensible plotting for the sheer ride of it all. The goal seems to be: the more convoluted and fast-paced, the better the end result.<br/><br/>The spy too has become a superstar without the super powers usually given to the comic book hero ( yet another genre that has gained popularity lately ). He usually has formidable survival instincts, neat gadgets, and undeniable strength to help him succeed at foiling the villain at all costs. This tried-and-true formula is set and really to be unleashed in the latest venture entitled The Bourne Legacy, a follow-up to the profitable Bourne trilogy ( without Matt Damon in the lead role as super agent Jason Bourne ).<br/><br/>One can easily say that its central hero has been "" re-bourne "" in this most recent installment to the billion dollar action thriller series as Jeremy Renner takes over as our new protagonist. Renner plays Aaron Cross, one of a series of genetically enhanced agents like Bourne. Think of a bionic man gone rogue, minus the superhero status or mythology. As the agency tries to rein all of its covert operatives, Cross moves from one location to the next, from one thrilling escape to yet another.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the film jumps around at such a frenzied pace that it becomes disconcerting. Various ideas pop up with new villains in various locales. Nothing makes a great deal of sense whenever the script tries to merge the old with the new. It doesn't successfully align the previous films with its new cast of characters and their undercover missions, but it tries. And tries. And tries. <br/><br/>When we last saw Bourne (as in Jason ), he had plummeted into the dark watery grave never to be seen again. The Bourne Legacy begins with that similar image, except this time, it's Aaron who emerges from the cold waters. The correlation is totally intentional as the film repeatedly links the previous pedigree shamelessly. This recognition factor seems to be everyone's covert mission. Back in service with what amounts to token cameo roles written just to reinforce that Outcome are such fine actors like Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn. They all look dreadfully serious, waste their talents in a short speech, and earn that hefty paycheck.<br/><br/>Inspired by Robert Ludlum's novels and directed by Tony Gilroy ( who also wrote the screenplay for this film and the previous Bourne series ), The Bourne Legacy is more of the same. It's generic repackaging, but a very well-made action film. The film is devoid any real emotional power and not as effective as the earlier efforts, but it remains standard high- concept fare. ( In those more involving films, one cared about the hero and the political fallout with its characters. With ""old"" Bourne, who is always referred to in this film but never materializes, the moviegoer was piecing together his repressed identity as a trained assassin just as he was. Here, Cross already knows who he is and his career choices, so the plot is rather simplistic for our ""new"" hero and the movie-going audience: it's escape, keep movin', or be killed. )<br/><br/>The talented Renner isn't given that much to do in the acting department except to run, jump, and shoot, which he does quite efficiently. He also develops a nice rapport with Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing. Their scenes together heighten the suspense level and give the film some merit. Edward Norton brings enough menace to his role as Colonel Byer, the mastermind involved in the behind-the-scenes scenario. <br/><br/>With all the C.I.A. cover-ups, betrayals, and killings, the film loses its ways with its talky exposition and unnecessarily intricate plotting. But what makes The Bourne Legacy worthy of viewing is the well-staged and choreographed action sequences, which, pardon the pun, are on overkill. Especially exciting are a shoot-out midway through the film and a solidly directed climactic motorcycle chase that builds tension effectively.<br/><br/>This most recent installment continually entertains and production values are top-notch. Gilroy knows how to keeps the story moving, even if his script ( co-written with his brother, Dan ) plods along more than soars. As action thrillers go, The Bourne Legacy doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it does lead the way for other future chapters in the series. And the money kept rolling in.

","I went into the Bourne Legacy with no expectations whatsoever. The critics' review of the film were so all over the place that I had no idea whether I would be royally entertained or bitterly disappointed. In the event, I was royally entertained. I loved the intricate backstory explaining how Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) came to be such a super warrior and the complications that came with it. I thought Renner's work here was the best he has done since his memorable performance in The Hurt Locker. <br/><br/>The film's production values could hardly have been higher. I gave high marks to its colorful locations, fine cinematography, and brilliant ensemble cast. The producers took care to cast fine actors such as David Strathairn and Elizabeth Marvel in small roles. As usual, Rachel Weisz was marvelous, although I barely recognized her at first. It appears that she has had some cosmetic surgery, which, while leaving her still beautiful, changed her looks. No matter, she was still fine. <br/><br/>After the, to me at least, very interesting exposition of the background of the Outcome subjects, the movie shifted into high gear, with heart stopping chases, on both foot and motorcycle, through the streets of Manilla.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross in The Bourne Legacy is a worthy successor to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in The Bourne Trilogy. 8 Stars out of 10."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","2","5","20 June 2017"," Nowhere near as bad as feared, but what was the point?
","Having recently watched the original Bourne trilogy films, they left me with the sense of how did it take me so long to see them. Really liked 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' and loved 'Ultimatum', even if neither were flawless.<br/><br/>Didn't really have high expectations for 'The Bourne Legacy'. From hearing about it, it did seem like it, despite having the name Bourne in the title, would not feel like a Jason Bourne film and that it would not be the same without Matt Damon. It also sounded like it was not much more than a pointless cash-grab. Finally seeing it, giving it the benefit of the doubt as deserved, 'The Bourne Legacy' was nowhere near as bad as feared and there are some good elements. To me, however, it wasn't a particularly good, let alone great, instalment and one really does question the point of it.<br/><br/>There are obvious strengths. On a visual level, it is every bit as slick and stylish as the original Bourne trilogy and the locations are stunning. The music pulsates and fits well without being over-bearing. While the action does seem not enough, some of it is executed very well and are pretty exciting, the highlights being the tense shoot-out in Weisz's character's home and the climactic motorbike chase that despite perhaps being on the too long side delivers big on the thrills, so much so one wishes that too much of the rest of the film delivered just as big.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner had big shoes to fill and does so more than capably. Matt Damon and the character of Jason Bourne are very much sorely missed that it feels like a gaping hole has been left, but Renner does bring intense steel and vulnerability. Weisz's character is somewhat underwritten, but she makes much of little and shows an appropriate and necessary sympathetic charm.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Edward Norton phones it in in quite easily the weakest villain of all four films put together, injecting very little menace or gravitas at all. The supporting cast do do capably enough, but too many of them have next to nothing to do, some like Stacy Keach are so underused that one questions why they are even there in the first place. Paul Greengrass and Doug Linman Tony Gilroy is not, while showing beforehand he excelled as a writer there was an air of inexperience in his directing. It seemed like Gilroy was trying to hard to imitate Greengrass but without the excitement and intensity.<br/><br/>In 'The Bourne Legacy', the thrills don't come consistently with some scenes going on for too long and feeling muddled and underdeveloped. The script is messy, doing very little with the characters and too often it is far too talky but without the intelligence, subtlety or sharpness of 'Identity', 'Supremacy' and particularly 'Ultimatum'. It's very clunky and confused as well.<br/><br/>Story also could have been much better executed. It starts interminably slow, and while the connections and overlapping to the previous films (particularly 'Ultimatum') were okay on their own their placement was clumsy, convoluted and upset the flow. Understanding a film is very rarely a problem with me, some of 'The Bourne Legacy' was ridiculously convoluted.<br/><br/>Overall, a little better than expected but it wasn't needed. Anything deserves to be judged as standing on its own feet without being compared, but the drop in quality is so significant after the first three films being as good as they were that it was incredibly difficult to ignore. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"LloydBayer","6","2","5","26 October 2013"," Where's Bourne?
","Having scripted the first three films of the franchise, Tony Gilroy returns for this fourth installment of the Bourne series and in the process, replaces regular director Paul Greengrass. Strike one! It's not unusual when screenwriters get to direct their own movies. Normally, this is an advantage to the director who then becomes the best person to understand how the story should be interpreted on screen. Clearly, the end result here is not outstanding, nor a sequel, but more of an off-shoot that begins sometime before the preceding events end.<br/><br/>Except for a mere mention, it takes a good half hour before you realize that Jason Bourne is not even in this film. It takes the rest of the film to realize that this is not about Jason Bourne at all. In fact, Jason Bourne is just the tip of the iceberg, or in my case, a bait to watch this movie. Proprietors of 'The Program', the same government spooks that double-crossed Bourne are now in hot pursuit of another agent that goes by the name Aaron Cross. Headed by Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) and Eric Byer (Edward Norton), this secret division of the CIA has only recently learned that they have bitten off more than they can chew. You see, there are certain pills that once consumed, serve as powerful genome therapies to the body and mind. Cross needs this to stay one step ahead of the CIA. His only aid is Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who incidentally knows all about these pills. She also knows that there is a way to retain the effects of the pills without the need for periodic consumption, but must first head to the production source - the Philippines.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film if it weren't for the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner as Cross. Make that Renner and Weisz, the only two redeeming factors in an otherwise unnecessary excuse at prolonging this franchise. Often referred to as a 'late bloomer', Renner brings on the same tenacity we loved about him in the Academy Award winning THE HURT LOCKER. As we have seen before, Renner radiates brute courage when personifying the do-or-die audacity of being pinned to the wall. That said, Renner's Cross is a polar opposite to Jason Bourne. Where the latter lost everything thanks to his superiors, Cross was an average Joe before signing up to 'The Program', to be someone, to be part of something. Once you have this power, this clarity, it becomes a territorial fight to not loose possession of the only things that add value to existence. Renner does this in the most convincing manner possible. Weisz on the other hand, has more screen time than most females in action movies. She not only supports Renner, her performance is at par, while vindicating her inclusion in an otherwise male dominated franchise. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Norton. As the antagonist, he is left with nothing more than barking out orders, which is a waste of his talent considering he could have played the methodical and manipulative villain he is known for.<br/><br/>Coming back to Gilroy, my disappointment lies in the manner in which he chooses to tell his story – an action thriller where most of the action is displaced by extended periods of special ops mumbo-jumbo. Despite this, LEGACY has its moments, but these are few and scattered. The action scenes are intense and the franchise's signature chase sequences are back though they lack the finesse of what we've come to expect from previous directors. There is also the overuse of industry jargon that serves to recap, if anything, that Gilroy knows the difference between James Bond and a super soldier; that Robert Ludlum is the real deal in comparison to Tom Clancy; that viewers may have never read any of these books. Strike two! What's worse is the thought that after all the muddled mishmash, Gilroy expects to see this franchise grow by milking the word 'Bourne' and serving it with the word 'Legacy'. Strike three!"
"sturgeon3736","4","2","5","11 July 2013"," Felt completely disjointed
","I've seen all the other Bourne movies- several times each. When I sat down to watch this one, the first half of the movie just jumped around and felt like it was disjointed. Seemingly a forced attempt to bring all the movies together- which didn't work, by the way. I was so confused, I got up and went to wash the dinner dishes. When I came back, my absence helped because it seemed to have launched into another act and more of it made sense- they let the current characters run with the story instead of flipping back and forth. Overall, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The actions scenes were too close in similarity to the other movies- not sure if this was done for overall ""feel"" or just laziness. Wasn't impressed."
"Bruce722","7","2","5","16 December 2012"," Good movie but not as good as the Damon films.
","Though The Bourne Legacy doesn't quite live up to the original Bourne Trilogy it is still an outstanding movie in its own right. For one, Jeremy Renner does an absolutely phenomenal job. While I don't think the character development or acting is necessarily up to par with Matt Damon, I think he more than legitimizes the film. I also thought that Rachel Weisz did a solid job and Edward Norton provided a decent villain for the movie. In addition to the acting and character development, the plot developed superbly. I thought making this film coincide with the Bourne trilogy was genius. Honestly, the only elements of the movie I didn't enjoy were the general lack of action and the outlandish aspects of some of the action sequences. These two poor aspects coupled together to really hurt the movie because it would start to drag but then when action would finally happen it would sometimes be silly. Still, this movie is definitely worth watching... just don't expect it to be as good as the first three."
"freemantle_uk","6","2","5","27 August 2012"," He is going to run out of brain
","Continuing the Bourne series seems like an impossible task: The Bourne Ultimatum had rounded up Jason Bourne's story line with Blackfaire being shut down and both Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass refused to return to the series. But of course studio filmmaking is a business and no studio really wants to get a money making franchise go, so writer Tony Gilroy was promoted to direct a fourth entry and an new star, Jermey Renner, took the risk of replacing Damon in the lead action role.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) has cause a storm and forced the CIA into making reckless decisions and mistakes. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), the director of a clandestine operation for the CIA and Department of Defence decides the best cause of action is the eliminate the various projects and agents similar Blackbriar and Trendstone operations. Two victims of this decision are Aaron Cross (Renner), an Outcome Black ops operative who is training in Alaska and Dr. Martha Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a bio-chemist working on a Government project. Both end up needing each other, Shearing needs Cross to survive, Cross needs Shearing to supply him with pills (known as chems) to keep his higher levels of intelligence and physical abilities as Byer with the backing of the intelligence and military community hunting for them.<br/><br/>For an action thriller The Bourne Legacy is a very talky film, people talking about operational statuses and missions, the interlinking of the events from The Bourne Ultimatum and what the follow up was and the scientific explanations how the pills work. They is little action in the first half of the film, with only the drone strike and some The Grey like scenes in the beginning. The other set pieces were an attack on a house and the chase in Manilla. The action was too infrequency. It was clear that Gilroy wanted to capture the style and magic of Greengrass' direction but his pacing was too slow. The elements were there, the CIA agents monitoring events and running the operation in a control centre, the use of computers to find out background information and hiding in crowds. It is great that the annoying shaky cam has gone but the action is still too quickly cut making fist fights how to follow. The shoots out and the chase in Manila were better and entertaining. But there is a lack of an equal to Cross like Bourne had in the previous films, i.e. The Professor and Desh.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy has more of sci-fi story because the CIA are genetically modifying agents to be mentally and physically then regular agents which does not mesh well with the more realistic world and tone of the previous films. It seems more like the story for a series of Alias or in a comic book then a Bourne film. In the previous film it was implicated that Bourne's abilities came simply from training and mental conditioning and brainwashing, not genetic enhancements. As Empire Magazine said in their review it that it boarders on parody that Cross needs pills to prevent him turning stupid.<br/><br/>Renner, Norton and Weisz were all excellent in their roles and they did give the film their all. Renner is very convincing as an action hero, having the right build and is a very talented actor and Norton and Weisz are top professions. I was worried that in the trailers Norton and Weisz seemed a bit stiff and that the film was just a paycheque to them but they proved their talents as actors.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy has its moments, is entertaining at places but it would have worked better as a standalone film. It is a 3 out of 5 star film and Bond is still king of the spy action genre."

","After watching 'The Bourne legacy', I was left cold.<br/><br/>Conveniently, this is how the movie begins, with Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) engaging in some form of scavenger hunt, whilst traveling through vast, snowy mountains. Somewhat unsurprisingly, one scene cuts to another, lots is talked about Jason Bourne and I'm lost within the first 20 minutes. Typical Bourne... why can't the writers make it a little more simple? One thing turns to another and we discover that Aaron is attempting to discover more about the 'programme' (sound familiar?) and all of a sudden, he is running from them, whilst hunting for the 'meds' he needs to keep his brain intact.<br/><br/>The whole film just seemed like a massive cliché to me. The only person who could give him the 'meds' was an attractive girl (Rachel Weisz), he had to travel the world to get these 'meds', he was running from the CIA AND there was a 30 minute action scene at the end...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here, I think Renner played a great lead, and he was much more likable than Matt Damon from the previous movies, however, the storyline was MUCH too familiar."
"3xHCCH","6","4","15","9 August 2012"," It Did Not Really Matter That It Was Shot in Manila...
","""The Bourne Legacy"" has so much hype in my country not only because it rides on the coattails of the amazing Bourne Trilogy starring Matt Damon. Even more significantly, it is due to the fact that a considerable number of scenes had been shot right here locally, in such places as the San Andres Market, the Pasay Rotonda, the Navotas Fishport and Palawan. The shooting of the movie was front page news and was on the daily evening news shows. When the trailer showing the Manila scenes was released, it trended massively on online social networking sites. Everything pointed to a widely successful August 8, 2012 opening date. Unfortunately though, Mother Nature had other ideas, as one of the metropolis' worst monsoon flooding which inundated many parts of the city happened before and right on that day. All of a sudden, ""The Bourne Legacy"" did not seem that important anymore.<br/><br/>I personally felt that this movie, while very exciting at parts, did not really live up to the quality of the first three Bourne movies. The lead actors Jeremy Renner (as Treadstone Agent Aaron Cross) and Rachel Weiss (as geneticist-virologist Dr. Marta Shearer) did very well in the acting department to keep the scenes vital. However, the story (for a Bourne movie) was uncharacteristically sketchy and really, barely there.<br/><br/>This film follows the aftermath of the third Bourne film when his agency Treadstone was already being investigated and threatened with exposure. All remaining Treadstone agents were being systematically eradicated. Cross and Shearer have to evade the government counter forces led by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who did not really feel like a real danger for our heroes. We learn the ""scientific"" reason why Treadstone agents have super-human abilities, which was too incredible. The Manila connection was weak and unbelievable. The street chase scenes in Manila were a big blur, and basically what we already saw in the trailer. The ending felt rushed and too convenient. If you knew Philippine geography, the final scenes would be funny.<br/><br/>I don't know, but I think I simply expected too much from this movie. It has all the Bourne elements there, but it felt lacking. It was only the charisma and talent of the stars that carried the film. I was disappointed that it did not really show anything iconically Filipino to represent the country. I don't think the ""jeepney"" really counts. The slums used could have been any slum in the world. Nothing really positive about the Manila or its people was shown, which was a letdown. If ever there is a sequel though, I would still watch if only for Renner and Weisz, and maybe to find out what else can be done to liven up this series. I would not really count on that sequel too soon though."

","Following the conclusion of Ultimatum(which is not followed up on, instead they undo the resolution, with a potential promise of getting into it in a sequel to this spin-off... something I am not interested in at all, as this is such a disappointment, and in general adds nothing in particular to the franchise), once this finally gets going about halfway through, this has Aaron Cross(Jeremy Renner, who(admittedly unlike the pretty Matt Damon, whose presence, however, is sorely missed throughout) looks like he's been through something brutal, and who has the intensity, if not quite the charisma, to play a role like this... and the charisma between our two leads is better, if still not compelling; he is vulnerable and he doesn't feel psychic as the old lead did at times, instead, in fact, things do not work out perfectly for him each time, with him having to improvise(not only plan), something that could invigorate these if it wasn't surrounded by such hefty fail) and Dr. Marta Shearing(Rachel Weisz, who is sort of a stand-in for Franka Potente, and this really feels like a retread of Identity... with that said, she's quite good, and in general the acting is great... everyone supposed to be working for spy organizations come off as professional) run and hide from the killers sent(to keep the operations a secret) by the CIA, led by a slightly underperforming(which means, still fantastic) Edward Norton spinning around himself barking orders that you try to comprehend to a room full of techies and monitors(get used to that, by the way... we're stuck there for maybe 60% of this). This is tense throughout, if there is an inordinate amount of plot(in a bloated movie that is half an hour longer than the others, simply because it's excessively complicated... in fact, the word ""unnecessary"" sums up this entire picture, produced simply because the others made money... at least they didn't bring back Jason, with his story being completely and satisfyingly closed), and yet, almost nothing actually happens. When this occasionally graces us with action, we get to see that Gilroy, unexpectedly, has a relatively solid handle on it. I am not fond of Greengrass' style of making us feel like we are in the midst of the chaos, with speedily cut, tight, shaky-cam shots making up the coverage. In this, like back in the original film, we can follow what happens, without it being less exciting. The martial arts sequences are especially cool. There are shootouts. The climax is a fun chase, however, even on the edge of my seat during it, I could not help but note its similarity to Terminator 2(and it wasn't the first thing in this), and at times, this really comes off as a mainstream Hollywood flick, a sad fall for this series. This gets into sci-fi elements, for no discernible reason(why drugs to control the agents? Controlled psychological and physical trauma is more convincing), and in general loses a lot of the credibility its predecessors had. Why not, then, just cut the ties, lose the Bourne name, why go for realism(as it does) when you don't follow through? Stunts and the like were pushed to the limit of what we can believe over the course of the three that came before this, and thus, with this escalating it further, it goes into levels where we do not buy what we are looking at happening in our world. There is a little violence, not graphic though sometimes disturbing, and mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this only to those who will not be comparing it to the others, and urge them to be prepared that this is largely talk, and hoping to get more made. Don't reward their lack of effort, please. Vote with your wallet. 6/10"

I was hoping it would have traits similar to those that made The Bourne Identity such a good movie: enveloping story, strong lead role, and intense, yet cool action. This movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>This summer's new Bourne movie had a new face: that of Jeremy Renner. Although we were all used to Matt Damon as the lead awesome-super-agent role, Renner fills his shoes nicely and provides an overall great acting performance. I enjoyed hearing Renner, as Outcast agent Aaron Cross, give lengthy conversations about what they did to the agents in question and how that all tied into the big picture. <br/><br/>Although there was action that was stylized after the original Bourne trilogy, there wasn't enough of it. There were a handful of scenes that showed off Cross's prowess with all sorts of weapons and machinery, but the fact that these scenes were few and far between left me wanting something more. The other portions of the movie were spent talking about the storyline, which if you haven't seen the original Bourne movies (and I mean recently), it will somewhat confuse you. Key phrases that tickle your memory of years past are thrown around like trifles and although you don't need to understand the story to enjoy the movie, it does help. If the story seems gray to you and you seem to be asking questions that sound like ""Why are they killing them?"" or ""Why do they want to do that?"", be quick to hold judgment and go watch/re-watch the original series.<br/><br/>Everything is tied up nicely in the end (if you can call it ""tied up"") but although the movie is a good 2+ hours long, the ending is sudden.

"moviexclusive","6","3","10","7 August 2012"," Too many familiarities, a less-than compelling Bourne replacement, and mediocre action sequences means this spin off fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors
","To find an actor in place of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne was going to be close to impossible, so series writer Tony Gilroy did the next best thing – he created a Bourne-like agent in the form of Aaron Cross, and cast character actor Jeremy Renner in that role. Not only that, to leave room for the possibility of Matt Damon's return, Gilroy created what we would call a 'side-quel' – in other words, a movie whose events unfold in parallel with that in the last Bourne movie with Damon, 'The Bourne Ultimatum'.<br/><br/>It's a good premise we'd have to admit, but Gilroy here makes one misstep – he decided to take over the reins from Paul Greengrass as director. Oh don't get us wrong, the veteran writer who first ventured into the director's seat with the critically acclaimed 'Michael Clayton' and then the playful 'Duplicity' is a capable director in his own right, but his inclination for exposition as well as his lack of experience in crafting the sort of tense action that audiences have come to expect from any respectable Bourne film prove to be this 'Legacy's' weakest spots. <br/><br/>Indeed, one of the key reasons why the Bourne films have been so compelling was Doug Liman's (who directed the first 'Bourne Identity') and Greengrass' ability to tell an intriguing espionage story within the context of a traditional action movie, paring down the narrative to its essentials so the overall film moves at a lean brisk pace. Gilroy however clearly favours plot over action, and while that isn't a bad thing in itself, it becomes so when it's clear what story (scripted by Tony Gilroy together with his brother Dan) there is has little to add to the Bourne universe beyond what was already established in the earlier films. <br/><br/>So once again, Cross goes on the defensive as the CIA tries to shut down one of its programmes, fearing the backlash that will no doubt follow if it were leaked to the public. The connection to Bourne? 'Outcome' was a companion programme to 'Treadstone', though genetic modification was applied only on the former. Narrowly escaping a drone attack ordered by the Agency on a remote Alaskan bunker, Cross returns to the United States to find his genetic meds he believes are crucial to his survival – blue for brain functioning and green for athletic performance. <br/><br/>Help once again lies in a lady whom he will develop a connection towards by the end of the film – a certain Dr Marta Shearing (Rachel Wesiz), who herself had a harrowing escape from her ex-colleague programmed to kill all scientists with knowledge of 'Outcome' (and a word of caution that this particular shooting scene might offend some sensitivities given the two recent real-life shootings in the United States). Beneath a lot of talk about how super-soldiers like Cross can be created by the interaction of viruses, chromosomes and mitochondria is really a straight-forward chase film where Cross and Shearing have to stay one step ahead of his former boss Eric (Edward Norton). <br/><br/>If 'Bourne Legacy' feels familiar every step of the way, it's because you've actually seen parts of it in different Bourne films before. The crisis room dealings ring smack of 'Bourne Supremacy' and 'Bourne Ultimatum', the slow-burning relationship between Cross and Shearing is reminiscent of that between Damon and Franka Potente in 'Bourne Identity' and even the extended climax featuring a parkour-like chase through the rooftops of the shantytowns of Manila followed by a motorbike chase sequence through its busy streets reminds one of two similar sequences in 'Ultimatum'. <br/><br/>Alongside a distinct lack of originality, Gilroy also never gives his audience much reason to care about his central character Cross. The first three 'Bourne' movies were told primarily through the eyes of Bourne, allowing their audience to experience his confusion, determination, perseverance, and thirst for justice. Here, Cross is on a mission to find his pills, and while that is well and dandy, it just seems trivial and uninvolving compared to Bourne's mission. Gilroy's choice of giving more screen time to Shearing and Byer without the presence of Cross also renders the latter a hazy blur, difficult to identify let alone empathise with. <br/><br/>And that is despite the best efforts of Renner, who cannot be faulted for not trying his best to fill Damon's shoes. Renner does his best with a thinly written part – you can see his dedication to making the hand- to-hand combat sequences thrilling – but without a compelling backstory, his Cross never quite becomes more than a stock type. <br/><br/>Those looking for the same level of adrenaline-kicking excitement as 'Ultimatum' will be severely let down – the action sequences here pack less oomph, take too long to get from one to the other, and are often over too quickly. The one and only sequence worth mentioning is the climax earlier described, and derivative as it is, it is the closest that the film comes to matching the same white-knuckle thrills that the previous movie packed in generous amounts. <br/><br/>Of course, 'The Bourne Legacy' is also an unfortunate victim of its predecessor's expectations. Yes, the past three films were definitive in shaking (and we do mean this literally) up the espionage genre with pulse-pounding action, in no small part thanks to Greengrass' fast-cut hand-held camera-work that has since been copied ad infinitum. Coming after the legacy of these films, this serviceable action thriller is a letdown, with little of the exhilaration nor the intelligence that made its predecessors so iconic. Truly, it says a lot when you realise how much you miss Bourne every time a picture or reference to him is made in this movie."

","When I 1st heard that Tony Gilroy was directing the talented Jeremy Renner in a new Bourne movie, I thought that the Bourne series was going to Rock all over again. After watching the movie I'm thinking, What a waste of a good actor and decent subject material!! OK, Renner did the best he could given te scope of his character, as did Rachel Weisz and the other supporting actors. However, The screenplay should have been a lot more exciting given the script. The build up was tense and made me excited to see what would happen next. I waited. And I waited. And when things started happening in Manila, I thought I was watching a B-grade JCVD movie or something! I mean come on! A stronger faster super soldier? That was all they could come up with as a finale for a respectable spy series?? Did the writers watch a Cheesy B-grade movie marathon when they were thinking up of the story? Very disappointing. Matt Damon and director Doug Liman chose wisely to stay away from this mess. And the ""critics"" who think this is a smart thriller methinks are deluding themselves!"
"Likes_Ninjas90","4","3","11","5 September 2012"," An unwarranted, misguided relative, who at each dizzying turn continues to outstay his welcome
","When an unseen Jason Bourne blows the whistle on the CIA and the various projects they are involved with, a crisis point is reached. Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is employed to shut down Operation Outcome and to eliminate the agents involved. One of those men set to be killed is on a special training mission in Alaska. His name is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and he has to go on the run. Also under attack is Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who survives a shooting in her lab, where special pills are developed to enhance the physical and mental state of an agent's mind. After escaping Alaska, Aaron saves Shearing from being murdered and asks her to help him with a process that will allow him to uphold his enhanced strength. The pair continually avoids capture from all ends, leading up to a deadly chase in Manila on a motorcycle. <br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy spawns an unwarranted, misguided relative, who at each dizzying turn continues to outstay his welcome. The fourth sequel in the franchise is a result of the banality of Hollywood's imagination: what is profitable must be relived, rebooted and reproduced. With the amount of money spread around Hollywood, films and their directors are being treated like brands. If a film has a fresh idea and an unknown director, it will be deemed less bankable and therefore less likely to attract a higher marketing budget for fear that audiences won't grasp an unknown concept. Hence, riskier films are moulded by studios to include popular but overly familiar staples, like the car chase, or the love interest. The Bourne films, adapted from Robert Ludlum 1980s spy novels, are essentially action-mysteries, but pitched at a slightly more grounded level than the genre usually calls for. They're a profitable brand too because together the first three movies starring Matt Damon earned close to a billion dollars. I loved the gravitas applied to the very first movie but its sequels are outright plagiaristic of its template, and wrapped in a nauseating overcut visual style that people seem to confuse with being innovative. On top of these existing problems, is there anything more foreboding for a series than not having the original talent available? Tony Gilroy takes over from Paul Greengrass as director, having penned the screenplays for the previous films. Troublingly, he's not even adapting a Ludlum story anymore. Ludlum wrote three Bourne stories himself but died in 2001. The series was continued by author Eric Van Lustbader, who has almost annually written seven separate stories. Legacy is the first adaptation of his work and hopefully the last. The most surprising criticism of this film is just how boring it is. Minus Damon, this film is left with a new character that is thinly written and not well established, dumped in action sequences that are big but as overcut as they have ever been. Gilroy describes the film as being on a larger canvas and expanding the universe, but that space is filled deliberately with everything we've experienced before, only not as thrillingly. <br/><br/>There's a lack of precision in the overall construction of the film. The opening scenes in Alaska, for example, are overextended and intercut with various story threads so that the film is longer (it's the lengthiest of the series, running at 130 minutes), more convoluted and confusing than it ever needed to be. And if you're expecting wall to wall action, the story is bogged down by dense periods of science- fiction jargon, posturing as real conversation. I really felt these conversations dragged and didn't add depth to the characters. When the action does strike it's sloppy because it's so chaotically handled. Faster is by no means better. There is one powerful scene where a brainwashed scientist attempts to shoot everyone inside a lab. I couldn't help but think of James Holmes again and for that alone the scene has an unintentional sense of reality to its merciless nature. It also helps that the spatiality in this scene is clear. Later action sequences though, specifically a numbingly long motorcycle chase, are so overcut and fuzzy that it's never clear where the baddies are in relation to our heroes. The film will also have you believe that you can be shot off a motorcycle, thrown into a fruit stand, and have the strength to continue riding again. And if you were to accuse this film of being ridiculously overproduced you only have to look at the cast. There are hugely talented people here that aren't well served by the script. Rachel Weisz is left to sob and just seems to exist for the scientific exposition. She could be a great emotional hook but they don't know how use her properly. Renner's star power in Hollywood is rising but throwing him into action scenes is no substitute for genuine personality or depth of character. He needed a lot more of both here to utilise his talents. I didn't find anywhere near as sympathetic involving as Damon. On a final note: what is Shane Jacobson (Kenny, 2006), doing in this film? It's a tiny part but rather depressingly, it reminds you of what the local talent here have to subject themselves to in order to be noticed in Hollywood. And that's putting it nicely."
"mtbgtown","5","3","11","12 August 2012"," Acting as good as can be with stillbourne script (see what I did there?)
","Did anyone notice they played it out with the same ending theme song as Ultimatum? Is this arrogance, or are they right in assuming no one will care? Jeremy tried his best to save the script with good acting (Rachel not so much) to no avail. The story had steep hills to climb in act I, which they solved lazily with POOP-TONS of dialogue. Now granted, I bitch when I see a redundant graphics like ""ALASKA SECRET TRAINING FIELD SITE!"" Don't get me started on dumbed-down writing. But I found myself dozing off to clichéd scenes, like ""How do you sleep at night knowing you're creating super soldiers? I just want to be an average sensitive guy!"" or, ""I don't know what the secret drugs are for, I'm just the scared, hot scientist who makes them! But secretly I do know, I just need to cry for five minutes, then you can threaten to leave me behind!"" <br/><br/>Why certain reviewers see this as an attempt by Gilroy at being a great screenwriter, I don't get. It's straight off the shelf overwriting with signposted dialogue. Maybe this is DVD foresight -- who will buy it if all they remember is the complicated story? Actually, that's exactly why I buy a DVD. The story engrossed me. I need to see it again and again. That's why I don't own Avatar and never will, because ""what story?"" It's why I do own ""Michael Clayton"" which I can't believe he wrote, and not Bait, which I can.<br/><br/>At first I thought he had a different ending planned if Matt Damon said ""yes,"" but since he didn't, the ending just tapers off with James Cameron-like rote lines, ala, the powerful ""I changed my mind."" Overall it's a sophomoric, minimally funded effort on a now waning franchise."

","I feel that it is my duty to take some time to write a review on this movie; I had to create an IMDb account just to write it. I'm not going to spend a long time writing a cute review because I've already spent $50 and 2 hours of my life in this endeavor. I saw each previous Bourne movie in theaters and own two of them; they were unbelievable with awesomely choreographed fight scenes, Jason Bourne ingenuity, and heart-racing and stopping action and suspense! HOWEVER, this Bourne Legacy movie somehow does have the same artistry of the others; there is significantly more dialog; many of the action scenes were so fast that I could not determine what had just happened; the pursuer team was so impotent that they were laughable; the musical score was sub-par in comparison; etc. There are only a hand full of movies that I've seen in my life that it has crossed my mind to leave while watching, and this was one of them. The best part of the movie was the first 30 minutes, and then the story just got lost. To add insult to injury, they play the hip and edgy Bourne them song when the credits rolled as in the other Bourne movies. Unfortunately, this just reminded me of how far the movie had missed the mark. Due to the unneeded complication of the story, I cannot even recommend this movie as one to rent when it arrives as a video rental; I wish that I could. I'm very disappointed."

Big mistake. Sometimes you watch something hoping that it will get better in the end, but this one didn't, it got worse, with a far too long chase scene and then just fizzled out incomprehensibly and I just sat there and thought, well OK I know that the actors get paid s**t-loads to appear in films like this, but how can you possibly defend it's crassness?<br/><br/>So what was wrong with it? Pretty much everything really, it was far too long for a start, the script was just too difficult to follow, and the only thing that saved it was the performance of the two main actors."
"forbes-glen","4","2","6","1 September 2012"," Bourne- Lite
","It's been a disappointing summer for the blockbusters. Unfortunately The Bourne Legacy is no exception.<br/><br/>Legacy attempts to pick up from where the excellent Bourne Ultimatum left us, beginning with the end scene of Jason Bourne floating in the water, and attempts, as the Bourne Ultimatum did, to interweave a couple of scenes from the previous movie, Bourne Supremacy, to tie the plot strings altogether. Unfortunately the attempt is less successful here.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds it appears there is more Theadstone type projects running. The events of Ultimatum leads Eric Byer, head of some of these operations, to shut down the remaining ones. And when we say shut down, we mean killing all agents and anyone who has been involved in the projects. Jeremy Renner plays Aaron Cross, one of the Bourne-type agents, training in Alaska. All agents but Cross is wiped out, and he attempts to find out why. Also he is dependent on pills. Rachel Weisz plays a doctor in one of the labs where Cross has been ""tested"" and given his pills. He's no more of one of them. So Cross locates her, who herself is the survivor of her workmates being exterminated, and they head to Manila to get more pills.<br/><br/>Sounds boring and convoluted? That's because it is. This is Bourne-lite. To me it seems to have been an attempt by people who just aren't as talented as Paul Grenngrass and Matt Damon to re-create a Bourne movie, and they just can't cut the mustard.<br/><br/>Tom Gilroys' directing is solid enough, with some shaky hand held camera work for those Bournesque action scenes, which are few and far between. The pace, especially for a Bourne movie, is slow. Where's the tension? I was on the edge of my seat for the Waterloo scene in the Bourne Ultimatum. There is a lot of plot, which is at best, head-scratching. We had to look up on the internet why he was taking the pills, it was never really confirmed in the movie. And it's not a movie about who Aaron Cross is, it becomes about him tracking down the pills he needs. Even the characters explanations, when they come, don't end up really being explanations. Who again is Ed Nortons' character? Huh?<br/><br/>And unfortunately Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon. There's just no personality in his Aaron Cross, and no mystery about him. You never make any connection with the character. Ed Norton seems to stick out like a sore thumb, it left me and my fellow viewer wondering what made this picky actor choose to be a part of this. Rachel Weisz plays her part with some depth, but it's all very predictable, we know what's coming. Kudos to the locations team on the movie, the locations and some shots of the movie is spectacular, especially the locations set at beginning.<br/><br/>I never thought the idea of doing another Bourne movie without Greengrass and Damon would work, and I was proved right. Easily the weakest Bourne movie."
"John K.-2","6","2","6","18 August 2012"," Lacks originality - and from a Bourne film, that's especially disappointing
","The biggest thing that this film made me realise was that the entire Bourne franchise contained an internal contradiction. The first three Bourne films were praised for the gritty realism of their action - heroes who actually hurt themselves, journeys that were delayed by traffic jams, etc. Yet when the plot finally unravelled its secrets, we find that Bourne and his ilk are genetically modified super-humans.<br/><br/>This film therefore has to treat these super-humans as, well slightly superhuman -- and the result is that the gritty realism is replaced with a character who's more like James Bond (but without the sophistication or humour) than Matt Damon's more realistic Everyman who was bewildered by his own capabilities. The script tries to deal with this by casting the hero as one drug-dependent man (plus Rachel Weisz) against the world, but it just ends up being another running away film, like the Fugitive.<br/><br/>Poor Weisz is cast as a scientist who has to run from her employers and spends most of the film running and looking scared. I'm not criticising her performance -- she's good at it -- but she should be because she's played exactly the same role before (e.g. in Chain Reaction), right down to her upper clothing gradually being reduced till she's running around in a singlet. She's a better actress than this film gives her the chance to express.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences are pretty good, and the cast do their best with the material they're given. But the plot of this film is one you've seen many times before -- and from a Bourne film, that's particularly disappointing."
"kgprophet","5","2","6","15 August 2012"," Misses the Beats - But not a Waste of Time
","There are several flaws to this sequel. First, was the strange opening act, which for an action thriller was very sedate. Second, was the unfortunate lack of charisma by Jeremy Renner. The last sentence I found very surprising to write, since I think his work in ""Hurt Locker"" and ""The Town"" was very magnetic. One has to point the finger at the director Tony Gilroy. I found the movie lacked the right tempo, missing the beats where a sharp new piece of the puzzle should have hit the screen.<br/><br/>The first act is completely without momentum. Renner is introduced, slowly, without any dialogue, as he trudges through the mountains. He's unconcerned about who he is. He never shows a great deal of urgency when his life is in danger. He seems a little calm most of the time. Fireworks yet? No, he shows up at the cabin. But lo - there's an unexpected agent waiting for him. Here it comes the moment of attack? No, they sit around and drink. The first act is intercut with a recap of the Bourne movies, trying to lay the foundation for a new secret agency with new code names. Ed Norton thankfully puts a face of integrity on the whole new merry-go-round.<br/><br/>Most audience members looking for a good action-packed Bourne sequel will find themselves a little short-changed. There are many moments in the plot that could have been expanded for a few extra thrills.<br/><br/>**MINOR SPOILER AHEAD*** For Instance, when the chemically altered agents are killed off, it is done simply with a pill. They fall over with a nose bleed, pretty unexciting. How about they become suicidal? Or they are chased by an assassin instead of taking a pill? Think outside the pillbox guys! **END SPOILER*** <br/><br/>The whole motivation for Renner to run around and elude the bad guys, is pills. Sorry Mr. Gilroy, lame. Rachel Weisz, the only excellent element in this film, desperately tries to explain the whole pills program. It takes several pages of exposition. Guys, 1 page instead of 10 pages to explain the MacGuffin doesn't make it any more believable. Really.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I kept my attention on the story, finding little emotional attachment to Renner, but enjoying the acting talent of Weisz and Norton. I also found fault with the soundtrack. Again, no sense of fireworks, no hero beats. Better pacing could have saved this film. The biggest sequence you watch near the beginning is a drone attack on Renner. The casual pacing of the dialogue and editing saps most of the tension from the sequence. Gilroy fails to catch the moments of sixth sense with the right music cue or edit that helped turn Matt Damon into a superhuman. Renner has the super-abilities, but the moments aren't captured dramatically.<br/><br/>If this script was produced without the Bourne product placement, it may have stood out on it's own, and provided audiences with a slick thriller that didn't need to fulfill the action requirement. Renner should not have to live in the shadow of Bourne, but the studio sees the brand name as insurance that audiences will show up to the theatres.<br/><br/>I will barely recommend this film, finding enough parts to be watchable based on good filmmaking, even though the sum is not a greater whole."
"achyutaghosh","8","2","6","14 August 2012"," Does not let spectacle erode substance, or style destroy thought
","The Bourne series (comprising of 2002's The Bourne Identity, 2004's The Bourne Supremacy, and 2007's The Bourne Ultimatum) redefined the spy movie genre- first up it was one of the few movies to be better than their source material (Robert Ludlum's books were not a patch on the films), it created a heady concoction of realism with fantasy, along with edgy action sequences, a believable hero and crucially, topped it all off with an apt ending- no wonder they made over a billion dollars at the box office. And yet again, 5 years down the line- we have a reboot/sequel, whatever you may call, but i think the word that best fits The Bourne Legacy is sidequel- there is NO Bourne, just some vague references...it takes place in a time-line overlapping the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, and introduces a new central character in addition to tying in lines from the previous movies. Is the movie any good? Or more importantly, was the sidequel necessary? <br/><br/>The basic plot is not largely different from its predecessors. Bourne's public revelations at the end of The Bourne Ultimatum have had far ranging ramifications- all government secret soldier programs are being hastily shut down, active agents and scientists associated with those programs are being mercilessly exterminated. But come what may, one of them refuses to be put down- Alex Cross, played by Jeremy Renner is a different kind of Bourne. His super soldier routine requires active medication- and the blue/green pills that he takes give him almost superhuman strength, pain resistance, agility, and acumen. Alex survives his assassination attempt to unite with Dr. Marta Shearling (Rachel Weisz) who can help him remove his dependency on the pills yet keep his enhanced skills. The rest of the movie is one long across the world chase sequence, where Alex and Marta pool in every skill at their disposal to stay ahead of the wolves, both the howling type and the tech laden ones, led by Edward Norton's Eric Byer.<br/><br/>The good things first- fans of the original Bourne series will surely be satiated- Jeremy Renner is an excellent replacement to Matt Damon. The first sequence in Alaska sets up interesting traits of his character- he is smart, resourceful, curious and a does not hesitate in giving it back ("" You should have left me alone""- he says to an insistent wolf while popping in a GPS tracker down its throat). Renner 110% looks the part and plays it with both charisma and sincerity. The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible 4, The Town, Avengers- seems he is the go to guy for action movies currently, and he delivers excellently too. So often people get the damsel in distress wrong, but age has only made Rachel Weisz prettier and experience, a better actor. She is utterly believable as a scientist out of her depth and on the run. Even though there isn't an explicit romantic angle, the chemistry between Renner and Rachel is sizzling. Like Denzel Washington, Edward Norton's mere presence in any movie makes it a couple of notches better. Essentially the villain and passionately convicted to the cause, he is underutilized here, but even then manages to add a touch of class. The action sequences are right up Bourne's alley- raw, electrifying, and the climactic rooftop- bike-top chase sequence will surely go down as one of the greatest ever, there are a couple of suspenseful scenes as well- none better than when a scientist goes berserk in an utterly cold and calculated way. The dialogs are concise, and the soundtrack catchy.<br/><br/>It has its share of imperfections though, the movie at 136mins feels too long- there are segments which tend to drag and would have worked better with some editing. This is also not for people not familiar with the series as it picks up directly from the previous movies, and so there are humongous sections tossing out lingo such as Treadstone and Blackbrair that will be understandable to dedicated followers of the series. Plus, though the action was good, i would have wanted a bit more of it. Tony Gilroy wrote all the previous Bourne movies, and directed this one, and while his script is top notch, the direction, though competent, could have been better- the plot is simple enough but the attempt to link it with the Bourne of yore is a bit confusing.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this movie is kind of like passing of the baton- while the ending was open enough, reboots/remakes are always about money and box office success will determine whether there is a Bourne 5 or not- whether Cross or Bourne work together, or against or fly solo. Unlike recent CGI special action flicks such as Total Recall, The Bourne Legacy does not let spectacle erode substance, or style destroy thought- it takes time to pick up speed but once it does, its one hell of a ride, besides the fact that it fulfils what 99% of the audience want ie. to see beautiful people do exciting things. 8/10- remember to take the popcorn!"

","After a five-year stint, BOURNE redux (the fourth chapter) has returned with a pristine cast starring a red-hot Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another secret agent going rogue (not Matt Damon's Jason Bourne), which I just watched in the cinema, from the original trilogy's screenwriter Tony Gilroy, this project is his third director job after MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007, 8/10) and DUPLICITY (2009, 7/10), although it fails to supersede Damon's version, but no one should conceived that situation at the first place, fairly speaking the re-ignition has a diverting start.<br/><br/>Running around 135 minutes, the film begins with a faint slow start, with a transition from Bourne to Cross, the intricate sub-plot is Gilroy's trump card, there are variable characters coming and going in the first half part (lots of cameos from the old trilogy), leading the way is new bureaucracy antagonist Edward Norton with his ultra-hectic staffs, then interweaving with another sideline context o the secret bio-lab where Rachel Weisz is residing;meanwhile Cross is trapped in the middle of nowhere in the snow land, fighting against wolf packs (a homage to the ending of THE GREY 2012, 7/10?), evading and sabotaging pilotless cruise missile. <br/><br/>So obviously Gilroy skimps on the action sequences for the rest half of the film. The lab- slaughter intensity is masterfully done compared with other showboating maneuvers (forcefully put a tracker inside a CGI wolf), which may not be proper to American's vulnerable nerves since the authenticity is strikingly nerve-racking. After that the next highlight is our hero saving the girl set piece, thanks to a more-than-average cast, this part is also neatly and gratifyingly exercised. <br/><br/>The final culmination is set in Manila and it is a roller coaster rider without brakes, but a precipitate ending on the picturesque tropical sea may feel a shade less considerate, although one could expect it as it dares not stretch out of the average length of the cinema-goers' habit like THE DARK KNIGHT RISE (2012, 8/10) fearlessly did. <br/><br/>Truthfully speaking, I hold no grudge with the reboot, and actually I prefer Renner's chattiness to Damon's woodenness. One wishful thinking, don't kill off Weisz's role in the next one like what they did to Franka Potente in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004, 7/10), she is such a bonus to the film even if her role is still a female accessory in the typecast action thriller."

Despite not having Matt Damon running the show, there is an impressive lead from Jeremy Renner, alongside the always dashing Rachel Weisz. With very intense action sequences and an intellectual script, this film has itself going...until the plot kicks in. Unfortunately, Gilroy isn't really able to bring the stories together, with Renner trying to run away from Treadstone, but trying to get from them the substances that made him strong and smart, and Norton trying to stop the media from getting more information that Bourne and Pam Landy let loose. If you're going out to see an action film, you might want to skip this one, especially when 10 minutes of the 135 minute film are action. Now, if you love a film filled with dialog and great acting, then this is the one.This film proves that the Bourne series is at its end, but is still entertaining."

The Bourne Legacy is the perfect example of a film that tries to kick-start a new chapter in an old series when the old series already went off on a high note and didn't need any new additions. <br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy pretty much begins towards the end of The Bourne Ultimatum, with clips from the original trilogy popping up here and there just to tell the audience that they're still in a Bourne movie, except with no Jason Bourne. There's some techno babble, and some chase scenes, but every aspect of this film feels recycled, and carries that feeling that it's all been done before, except much better. In the end I thought the movie was okay, but seeing how hyped I was to see this film, makes even more disappointing.

","This is the best film of the Born series as for me :)
(sorry, fans of Jason Born!)
The one of a little amount of films where partnership between a man and a woman is so strong, equal, humane and unloaded of sex and romantic stuff. They are both are great partners, have their own important roles, take care about each other and this way they win an awful killing machine with incredible possibilities. Not so much because Aaron is a superman and Marta is a great scientist, but much more because they respect each other and hang together, even when there is no selfish need to do it anymore.
Love the nature views, bright episodes of rescuing of the heroes, choosing of places and enviroment. And touching subtle episodes of caring. There is much more love in this film then in the most films with love-scenes! Marta is not a sexual object, she is a professional scientist and great comrade-in-arms, she has no special skills and superpower, but rescue them both and not just once. And I'm really happy no woman this time was sacrificed for some ""great purpose""!"

","Just how many other people were there in the Treadstone programme? How would each fare if 'written-off' by the government. These are effectively the questions asked in this film. Jeremy Renner is superb - he out-acts everyone else in the film and deserves recognition for the way he managed to hold the film together despite not very good direction, The rest of the cast is strong - just look at what else the supporting actors have done since this picture. Rachel Weisz was perhaps a surprising choice for the potential love interest, but she certainly held her own and was out-acted only by Jeremy Renner. I won't even describe the plot - there are sufficient reviews already - save to say it was quite confusing until the film was watched a second time. As others have said, the actors gave better than the screenplay and direction deserved. Still, it is an enjoyable film and deserves a second or third viewing."

","I didnt miss Matt Damon for a second, because Tony Gilroy, who was director AND writer, made this Bourne edition into (one of) the best sequels.

Then there is Rachel Weisz, the ever charming and talented actress. Splendid performance. Then a list of supporting roles that make your eyes ache: Edward Norton, Oscar Isaac, Stacey Keach. I dare say that this 4th edition of Bourne has got the best acting in it of the entire series. From leading to supporting roles everybody is very impressive.<br/><br/>Photography is done by the legendary Robert Elswit who conjures up some of the most beautiful pictures. Really a master at work. Music and editing dance with each other in this movie, what a joy to watch and listen!<br/><br/>Number 4 in the Bourne series is realistic, fast and reeling with suspense.

"destinylives52","7","1","2","28 August 2016"," A worthy addition to the ""Bourne"" movies
","""The Bourne Legacy"" is the 4th ""Bourne"" movie and the first one that doesn't have Matt Damon, unless you count pictures of the actor shown in a few scenes for reference. Taking over the leading role in this movie is Jeremey Renner, playing a super-secret spy working for a super-secret agency within the CIA. Unfortunately for Renner, he is part of a spy program that produced Jason Bourne (Matt Damon); and since Damon has turned rogue, the CIA fears other agents of the program might also flip out and turn against their handlers. The super spy programs are torn down, and the super agents are killed offexcept for Renner, who barely manages an assassination attempt on his life.<br/><br/>Renner must now evade CIA assassins, which he is very adept at. His biggest problem are the meds that he has to take on a regular basis so his body doesn't break down. This leads him to Rachel Weisz, a doctor whom he has had frequent contact with within the spy program — a doctor who knows too much and is also a target for termination. Alone, they have no hope of survival — Renner needs his meds and Weisz needs someone to protect her from the assassins and get her ""off the grid."" But together, they might be able to come out of this nightmare alive.<br/><br/>""Legacy"" is a good offshoot of the ""Bourne"" movies, almost as good as the previous three movies. Where this movie falls short of its predecessors are: 1) the Jason Bourne character is much more likable; and 2) ""Legacy"" doesn't really take off re: intensity and action until about 30 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Legacy"" is the **SPOILER ALERT** scene when Weisz reveals to Renner what his meds do: they enhance his body and mind, essentially making him a superhuman. This explains how Damon (as Bourne) and Renner can do the amazing things we see them do in these four movies, like beating the hell out of multiple enemies within a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Fans of the ""Bourne"" movies will, of course, be disappointed in not having Damon reprise his role. But this movie is a must-see for ""Bourne"" fans because it gives more backstory to Jason Bourne and the overall programs that he was tied with; and ""Legacy"" in and of itself is an entertaining, action flick.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"athena24","7","1","2","24 August 2016"," Entertaining
","I think it was a nice addition to the Bourne film series. Redundant? Maybe. Bad and unworthy of the previous installments? No way. Overall, i had a good time watching the movie so I'll start with what I think was bad and then proceed with the good in order to finish with a positive impression. <br/><br/>The script in the first half of the movie is the weakest link. The decisions of the heads of the operations were very questionable and I had lots of whys and hows running in my head. Is all this massacre was necessary? How did Aaron find the Dr and at such perfect timing? The factor of chance was too apparent here. It's slightly surprising given the fact that the director wrote the script for all the movies in the series<br/><br/>Eric Byer's character could be better written. I don't think that Norton is the best choice for the role, but it's beyond that. His dialogues were quite clichéd. Again this is more noticeable in the first part of the move.<br/><br/>The Good: pretty much everything else. The action is well choreographed, not too exaggerated and exactly in the right amount. Just like all the previous installments had. The leads, and most of the support actors were great. Aaron Cross is not a copycat of Jason Bourne but a different agent, and Renner does a very good role at doing this. The script turned out for the better in the second half, and the actions from the operations headquarters seemed much more logical.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I found Bourne Legacy less coherent than the previous movies in the franchise. However; with a very good action, acting and pace it was a very entertaining movie."

","Limited to only leaning the very basics of Bourne-ology until a few days ago,the main thing I knew about the 4th in the series was that the main makers of the series rarely mention it. Boldly calling itself ""legacy"" I decided to find out what kind of legacy it was giving the franchise.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Learning that the CIA's program to create super assassins by bringing dead soldiers back to life, Col. Eric Byer decides that the only way the project can remain secret,is if all who were involved in it are killed. Working on a training exercise,agent Aaron Cross is caught by surprise,when he spots a drone strike targeting him. Tricking the drone/CIA into believing he is dead,Cross decides to go on his own strike against the CIA. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Adding another spy agency to his CV after joining the IMF, Jeremy Renner shows a clear enthusiasm for the role, (with Renner performing the motorcycle set-piece himself)he just makes Aaron Cross look too clean cut,with Renner keeping Cross in a mildly mellow state,even when a drone strike is being aimed at him! Wanting to get their hands on Cross, Stacy Keach, Oscar Isaac and the welcomed boo-hiss sight of Zeljko Ivanek give the film some good sparks as Cross's obstacles,but each appearing wanting for a deeper movie that they could really set their sights on.<br/><br/>Sitting in the director's chair after being the main writer of the series,co-writer/(along with his brother Dan) director Tony Gilroy & cinematographer Robert Elswit track down a slick,glossy look,with the ""shaky cam"" of the last two movies being replaced for a calmer style that captures Cross's outwitting the CIA in a crisp manner. Keeping things in the family by bringing his brother John in as editor,Gilroy disappointingly sands down the ""grounded"" grit of the series via Drone strikes and fantasy high-tech gadgets,which causes the fight scene to never feel like they are building up towards the show piece.<br/><br/>Drastically re-writing the plot when Matt Damon turned it down,the screenplay by the Gilroy's takes the impressively unique approach of re-visiting the past films in the series,but from the CIA's perspective,which does lead to the title working as a good companion piece to the original trilogy. Given the longest running time of any Bourne,the Gillroy's fail to take advantage of the canvas with an ill-advised turn from murky espionage to a Sci-Fi (!) world of super soldiers and ""wonder"" drugs,which leads to this being a film that does not live up to its legacy."
"Jim-512","7","1","2","10 November 2015"," Unexpected
","Being intrigued and entertained enough from the Bourne Trilogy (and having bought the 'completed' set) I was a bit put off by the introduction of another 'Bourne' movie, presuming it to be a lame attempt to capitalize more on the franchise. So much that I didn't bother to watch it - till now. I must say that I found everything about this movie unexpected. The integration of this story with snippets of the original (Ultimatum) was very well done. There is one thing I find in many movies, though, to be disappointing, believability. Its the subtle things that a person may or may not do that makes a story convincing. That the fine, technical details are NOT over-explained (to assure the watcher 'gets it') is laudable (I love looking details up later on a subsequent viewing). When a filmmaker takes the effort to add those little subtleties to a movie, I take special notice, and Legacy is full of them. (One of the things I loved about Haywire). Renner is a great branch from the Bourne character. This movie will be added to my collection."
"bombadil-esquire","9","1","2","25 August 2015"," Not in the category of ""unnecessary sequels""
","The action of this film is not less than satisfying, unless you came for Matt Damon. Although Jason Bourne's fighting would be more worth the watch; Renner's character is a fine addition to the Bourne franchise-plot, as he is the subject of a new conflict that sensibly is a result of the same CIA-conflicts that arose from the three movies before.<br/><br/>With that in mind, with there being no plot-holes nor bad acting (when one watches a second or third time), and with good ways that they tie in literal events of Bourne Ultimatum consistently with the goings- on in this one, it is wrong to say that The Bourne Legacy has caused the much-beloved series to ""decline"".<br/><br/>Bourne Ultimatum is indeed the high point of the series, but regardless, this film is a perfect example and option for a ""agent vs agency complications"" movie."

","Rachel Weisz (sp?) is not a great actor for the role she plays. Kind of gets annoying at a lot of times. The sad part is that the movie could not follow the plot of the book (in which Jason Bourne was the main character), because Matt Damon refused to be a part of the movie. Thus, the plot is entirely different then the book. The book's plot was incredible and would have made a great movie, but I guess Damon was selfish and set them up for disappointment. Still an alright movie, but the plot is a little unclear and Weisz acting sucks. It's just no match to the real Bourne Trilogy. Should you watch, do not have the expectation that it will be as good as the first three movies. Because in my opinion those were easily 10/10 and this one was probably 5.5 or 6 out of 10"
"Jacobsnemesis","9","1","2","14 January 2015"," Overlooked and Underrated. The Best Bourne Film Yet.
","I was surprised to see that the average score for The Bourne Legacy on IMDb was around 6.7/10 and to me, it just reinforces the idea that people's opinion of a movie is defined by their expectation going into it. For me, this was the best Bourne film yet. It's arguably the most intelligent of the four, with great acting, believable characters and a great script (which has received some very unfair criticism in some of the reviews here). <br/><br/>It goes at a slower pace than the previous three films, which may be a problem for some people. The action scenes are not as frequent either, although when they come, they are outstanding. One particular chase sequence is up there with the best I've ever seen in cinema. <br/><br/>Aaron Cross is a good lead character and very well played by Jeremy Renner. Perhaps the film would have benefited from dropping the Bourne name in the title, but it's understandable that they kept it for commercial reasons. The way this film intertwines with the story of Jason Bourne is also very clever and well done. <br/><br/>Overall, a great film and worth watching."

He was the perfect choice.<br/><br/>This movie has a similar feel to Shooter for me. I can watch it a few times a year. Just satisfies. The only flaw was the most overrated actor now in Hollywood, Ed Norton. He along with James Woods are the boring actors who try to have more screen presence than they can.

","The Bourne series ended with the last instalment, and now comes a 135 minute death rattle called ""The Bourne Legacy."" It's a peculiar movie, both over-plotted and under-plotted, encumbered by layers of detail and yet with no details invested in or developed. And it all but squanders Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, although with actors less appealing, ""The Bourne Legacy"" would be even worse.<br/><br/>The film is almost opaque in its storytelling. As the film starts, Renner is in a cold, woodland area, injecting himself with blood, taking swims in freezing water and climbing mountains. We don't know why he's there, and we never quite find out. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne is in New York, apparently creating a stir, although we never see him. And there's a journalist in London who is about to expose Operation Treadstone, or perhaps Blackbriar, and no one ever explains what these are, or what the difference is between them.<br/><br/>The assumption is that the audience has just seen the entire Bourne trilogy this week and has committed each detail to memory."

There are some thrilling action sequences though and the Renner and Weisz deserve praise for their solid performances despite an almost non- existent story and script. Edward Norton's part was a disappointment because he didn't really nothing other than bark orders and spout patriotic clichés.<br/><br/>The movie is never really quite sure where it's going. A bunch of chases and then suddenly it's over, very abruptly and with no closure at all.<br/><br/>Norton, Weisz, and Renner are all great actors and this could have been a great movie had it had a more purposeful storyline and fleshed-out characters. As it stands it's a decent movie but nothing memorable and certainly won't stand the test of like the original trilogy."

The story is extremely repetitive about how government controls everything while trying to never leave a trace of the mess they get themselves into. There is plenty of action on this installment but honestly nothing we haven't seen before. The movie is too long - over two hours of back and forth, parallel happenings that try to impress to deliver an open ending that certainly may inspire yet another sequel. Bourne may spend the whole movie trying to save himself, but it's the viewers who should be running away from the theater to save their pockets."
"ferguson-6","6","3","12","12 August 2012"," Run Away! Run Away!
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Bourne series has often been viewed as the American version of James Bond ... more serious and with more action. Doug Liman directed the first, which was taken directly from the Robert Ludlum novel. Paul Greengrass then assumed control over the next two and added hyper-kinetic speed to the action sequences and focused on the conspiracy theories, with a fascinating hero looking to take down a corrupt system. Involved in all three as a writer, Tony Gilroy takes over as director in this fourth entry. Unfortunately, the Bourne series is not similar to Bond, in that the directors and lead actors are not so easily replaced.<br/><br/>With Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) present only on computer screens, Jeremy Renner takes over the lead as the next super-spy-weapon. When Pam Landy (Joan Allen) blows the lid off Treadstone in a Congressional hearing, the shady back office meetings lead to the decision to shut down the program. We all understand what that means ... destroy the assets and lose the records. This decision is made by Edward Norton and Stacy Keach, both new to the series.<br/><br/>The decision leads to a vicious scene featuring the always dependable character actor Zeljko Ivanek who almost completes his assignment, but misses out on Rachel Weisz (playing Dr Marta Shearing). Dr. Shearing is involved in the manufacturing of the ""meds"" that keep our super-spies and super strength and super intellect. Yes folks, our superheroes are roided-up! You have to hand it to Dr. Shearing - for a lab rat, she has a remarkable ability to stay alive despite being the target of many highly trained assassins. Of course, she does have a bit of help from Aaron Cross (Renner).<br/><br/>Here is the real issue with the film. Instead of Bourne trying to bring down the corrupt system, this is really two hours of survival mode for Aaron Cross. It reminded me of the Monty Python bit as they face opposition on their castle storm ""Run Away!, Run Away!"". Most of the first half of the film is spent with him in search of meds, like any common drug addict, and the second half is spent on a motorcycle chase that goes on forever.<br/><br/>As an action film, this one works just fine. The limited fighting and expanded chase scenes are well filmed and intense, it's just that as a viewer, it really isn't as much fun to cheer for someone who is running away as it is for someone (Bourne) looking to bring down a corrupt system. In addition to those I've mentioned, we get brief appearances from series' regulars Albert Finney, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, and Paddy Considine.<br/><br/>The hope is that this is just a placeholder in the series. It's been five years since The Bourne Ultimatum, and hopefully, if the series continues, we will get Paul Greengrass back in the director's seat and Matt Damon teaming up with Jeremy Renner to wreak havoc on the true enemies of the state. Otherwise, the American Bond ends up as nothing more than an action film with no real purpose."

The previous actor was not brought in with his character very well and only in spots very thinly.

First of all, it's not Bourne without M. Damon -- he's the face of the franchise, he wasn't killed off, there's no reason for making a sequel without him (and if he doesn't want to be in another Bourne movie, then there doesn't need to BE another Bourne movie). Second, the acting was pretty bad in this new installment. The actors aren't necessarily bad themselves generally, but they really didn't fit these roles. Third, the camera work is atrocious to say the least! Most of the action scenes were simply unwatchable! To sum up, this sequel is an insult to the rest of the Bourne series. It didn't add anything to the original 3 movies before it. If you don't want to ruin the Bourne movies for yourself, skip this one.<br/><br/>As a standalone (with a diff't title), it might've (though not likely) been a decent movie, but as a follow-up to the Bourne trilogy it absolutely bombed."

After the trilogy ended i never thought about bourne again until i heard that Jeremy Rener was going to play the lead CIA experimental agent/spy. It starts off well, right from the start you know what's going on and you see how deep it actually is and how many people are involved and what the people in charge will do to keep it secret.

(That would have been a good spot for some slo- mo.)<br/><br/>What I didn't like, at all, was the movie's ending. (That's the reason for 6 out of 10.) It wasn't so much as end as it was an unashamed set-up to the sequel. My recommendation is to save your theater money, and to catch both this one and its sequel from Redbox or Netflix.

He's certainly not the stud that Matt Damon is either, and we girls love the handsome leads so pay attention! While I liked the ""Michael Chrictionesque"" subplot, the rest of the film felt more like Rambo going back to rescue lost soldiers than a spy thriller. While it moves and builds nicely in the first half hour, it turns into chase scenes that are thoroughly unbelievable and just go on too long.

Alice in Wonderland or The Matrix proposed a better use of ingestibles.<br/><br/>But even giving this plot line a pass, and just looking at the film itself, comparisons to Matt Damon's classic series is inevitable. This movie does not shirk from that comparison, but tries to interweave some plot points, unfortunately it also regurgitates many of the exact same scenes...with only the geography being different. But running on the roofs in Manila versus running on the roofs in Tunisia, motorcycling through narrow streets add nothing to the overall skill sets we are looking for in genetically altered and able to wage urban warfare"" men and the similarities do not bode well for the capable acting skills of Jeremy Renner (he had better fight scenes in MI4: Ghost Protocol). It's been done before and it's now boring, AND Matt Damon did it better, mostly because the plot was better and really worked in his favor.<br/><br/>Treadstone, Blackbriar, and other failed government programs are re-written here for no apparent reason. There was no true ultimate villain, there was not a series of trained operatives fighting one another, there was simply a few flashbacks, a lot of cops, security guards, some agents clearly over their head, and the pills as the major protagonists.<br/><br/>Wait for Netflix/Red Box/cable whatever, this really isn't anywhere near the calibre of the previous Bourne movies."

A number of scenes resemble scenes from other movies in the series. This includes the hiring of an agency killer to kill Cross, similar to the scene in Tangier in Ultimatum, and the chase on rooftops also reminded me of a similar scene in Ultimatum...The movie is 135 minutes long, and even though the end comes suddenly the ending makes sense for a future sequel.

While Total Recall and Brave were technically well done, I was not engaged and did not really care that much what happened.

Ice Age 4 was a great movie on its own but especially for the 4th...Peter Dinklage as the voice of the Pirate Captain Gutt was perfect. And while I had not watched any of previous Spiderman movies, I did catch this one and was entertained.

That brings me to Bourne Legacy. Bottom line: I would rank it at the top of this list for engagement and entertainment and have seen it twice as I could not bring myself yet to watch Expendables 2, even though I very much like Bruce Willis (Red) and Jason Statham).

It's another Bourne film without the presence of Jason Bourne/Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot, the movie is in essence a talky movie about an agent who had been dependent on ""meds"" and finds himself struggling just as the ""programs"" start shutting down. Compared to the previous three Bourne films, The Bourne Legacy had more dialogue (which could burn you out) and less action.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Jeremy Renner does make a good action star and you can see more talent from him. Really, his appearance as Hawkeye in The Avengers was just a small preview of what he can do. His character Aaron Cross was arguably shallow but was saved by Renner.<br/><br/>Oscar winner Rachel Weisz plays the supporting role Dr. Marta Shearing but in a big way in terms of screen time. Compared to other action flicks that have female supporting roles, Weisz has a bigger on-screen presence and added some importance to the plot.<br/><br/>And there was also Edward Norton whose sheer talent made up for the lack of depth of his agency executive. Norton makes a good executive who is brash, tough and demanding. <br/><br/>Since this movie had an excessive amount of dialogue, I should say that the motorcycle chase scene that was filmed in the Philippines was the closest thing the film had to an action highlight. For me, the Philippine motorcycle chase was a nice reliever (from the lengthy talk) and added some much needed speed to the film's pacing just enough to save it from being a total bore.<br/><br/>It's kinda hard to recommend The Bourne Legacy to everyone. If you are the type of viewer who is obsessed with the Bourne franchise, be it the books or the films, then this movie just might prove to be good. If you cannot handle a Matt Damon-less Bourne film at all, skip this."

","I'd give this *** 1/4 Out of *****<br/><br/>Now I love the original Bourne trilogy that centers around Jason Bourne and when I heard that this wasn't going to have Matt Damon in the role I thought it wasn't going to be good but however after seeing that Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye in The Avengers) will be in the lead role and that brighten my mood but I still thought he couldn't save the movie & I ended up eating my words along with my popcorn. But I should point out that if your a fan of the Jason Bourne character I hope you'll be happy with just hearing his name & seeing a couple of his pictures because he's not in this movie. I also should point out that this movies story is a lot more complicated to understand than that of Jason Bourne because like I said he's not in this movie and it focuses on Aaron Cross or Agent Outcome #5. Now the plot in a nutshell about this movie is Outcome #5 is like Jason Bourne he was a test experiment and with that being said he has the same inhuman qualities and advanced fighting skills as Jason Bourne and he shows that a few times (and it doesn't disappoint) but he need green pills to keep himself stabilized so he saves Marta Shearing (Rachel wieitz) an Outcome scientist who was meant to be killed by the CIA who has killed every Outcome Agent & Scientist (except Aaron Cross, herself, & Jason Bourne) so he convinces her he's on her side and he'll protect her of she helps him. So they go to Manilla where we learn his real name is Kenneth James Keitsom a private who was seemingly killed in the Iraq war. So she injects when the drugs he needs and is cured but keeps his enhanced physical abilities and they're pursued by LARX-03 an assassin then in Matrix: Reloaded like chase scene that was very entertaining and kept my attention they get away from him, seemingly knocked him out, and escape via a boat to parts unknown ending the movie. Now like I said this story is very hard to understand and it wasn't until about an hour and a half until I understood everything (that I will say was boring and almost had me asleep) they jumped 5 gears and satisfied me. The ending does make you angry because your expecting more but if we get a sequel we'll see it. Is this movie of the year? No but it's FAR from being the worst."
"jaychou_21","7","2","7","12 August 2012"," The legacy is lost.
","With very little connection to the first three movies, the storytelling in ""The Bourne Legacy"" is hollow, the action is sparse, and does not truly follow the legacy left by its predecessor.<br/><br/>I believe Jeremy Renner is fully capable of taking over the franchise so closely associated with Matt Damon. The fans of the Bourne trilogy that followed the adventures of Jason Bourne still can't get over the fact that their hero is gone and has been replaced by Renner, a very suitable leading man, physically and emotionally. Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton added gleaming support to the rather lackluster structure of the film, screenplay-wise.<br/><br/>Robert Elswit's arresting cinematography and John Gilroy's smart editing makes the film look first-rate. The chase scene in Manila is reminiscent to the iconic Moscow car chase scene in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Though the motorcycle chase sequence shot in our busy streets will never be able to equal the adrenaline rush elicited by the first three films, it's fair to say that it comes close. The rest of the action scenes were solid and not overdone.<br/><br/>The script was infused with jargon and sufficient action to divert the viewers from the movie's lack of soul. Even the great performances by Renner, Weisz, and Norton couldn't save the movie's thin plot and bleak conclusion. The ending was unappealing and abrupt it left most viewers at a loss. You can easily paint the disappointment etched in their faces as they hesitantly stood up from their seats and slowly left the theater.<br/><br/>There are many questions left unanswered, such as why Outcome chose the Philippines as its laboratory for the sought-after pills. If the writers' intention is to leave room for future vicissitudes in the franchise's continuity, then it makes for a lame excuse. The idea alone of making a Bourne movie without Jason Bourne is ludicrous. In this respect, the fimmakers have succeeded in making the Bourne fans feel cheated and the new audience underwhelmed for trying to force a puzzle piece that just doesn't fit.<br/><br/>For something so highly anticipated and over-hyped, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a huge letdown. I gave this movie a 7/10 just because 25% of it was shot in Manila (a preposterous judgment for an equally absurd film)."

They could have easily cut 15-20 minutes from the movie and none would have been the wiser.<br/><br/>The Bourne trilogy was very good as it was and did NOT need another movie added to it. Matt Damon re-invigorated his career playing Jason Bourne, while Doug Lyman and Paul Greengrass with Tony Gilroy as their go to screenwriter, showed what talent and creativity can produce by literally turning the spy thriller genre on its head! Proof is in the pudding as they say and the two subsequent James Bond movies reflected that new reality. Craig's 007, is, like Damon's Bourne, a much more somber, violent and unpredictable man, with a penchant for close-quarters-combat and revenge.<br/><br/>""The Bourne Legacy"" was an unfocused, at times meandering and messy film. Which is kind of surprising, given that Tony Gilroy's directorial debut was the superb ""Michael Clayton"", I don't know, but I expected more..I mean what was the deal with that whole episode with the wolf, I mean I know and understood what happened in it and its purpose. Still, I gotta ask, really?! <br/><br/>The cast was alright and while I like Jeremy Renner as an actor, ""The Hurt Locker, ""The Town"" and now ""The Avengers"", he really did not shine like his usual self in this movie. It looked like he tried to step into Damon's shoes and continue his ( no pun intended) legacy, however that did not work at all...Rachek Weisz was OK but the rest of the cast was just there...<br/><br/>I hope that they really stop making anymore Bourne movies, with no Bourne in them.<br/><br/>However, given Hollywood's on-going identity crisis and lack of originality and creativity, I doubt that we've seen the last of ""Bourne's universe"", which in this movie fan's humble opinion would be a mistake!"

","Jason Bourne is dead and buried. Robert Ludlum wrote three books about him and that was it. Hollywood took the books and turned them into movies that are remotely similar to the books, but the merit was more Matt Damon's than anyone else's, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the Legacy. It is a film that has nothing to do with Bourne other than a hook to start the story. The details and complexities that transpired into the Bourne scripts from the books were non existent in this film. The oversimplified plot finds a rather plain secret agent from ""yet another"" government secret program running for his life together with Rachel Weisz.<br/><br/>While I like Jeremy Renner and I think he can do a lot in the movie business, his role was ridiculously unidimensional. Rachel Weisz's role was not much better, but was actually the more complex in the film and she played it well. The other stars in the cast could have been any number of actors, since their acting skills were not required in their small and cardboard roles.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I have to give kudos to the trailer. It didn't give up anything about Renner's character or the general plot, therefore enabling the belief that the film has anything to do with Jason Bourne. It has earned a lot of money to undeserving people. Alas, the legacy of Robert Ludlum will not be found in movies, especially Hollywood ones, so go reread the Bourne books and skip this failure of a film.<br/><br/>As a separate point, there is a Bourne Legacy book, the first in a series of seven, written by Eric Van Lustbader. They have nothing to do with this film."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","8","19 September 2012"," until the 2/3'rd mark...
","The Bourne Legacy had potential to be really dynamite, with good (non) romantic chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, and I was genuinely interested in his story as the (non) Jason Bourne of the story. In fact, I was glad for at least the first half the film was relatively action-free, and I could try to understand what this Treadstone thing was that came apart and then fell asunder.... And then the second half - no, I'll be more generous, the last third - came along, and it became another chaos-cinema spectacle with a chase through a Filipino city that is just ludicrous, and yet played completely straight.<br/><br/>The sad part is that Tony Gilroy, who wrote some if not all of the other Bourne movies and is a damn good director in his own right (see the excellent studio drama Michael Clayton and the good if not great studio comedy Duplicity), knows this world and finds a way to make the dramatic angle work without Jason Bourne. Indeed I found Aaron Cross, Renner's character, to be interesting because we don't know much about him at first, and yet it's not Bourne all over again; he knows who he is, at least sort of, in pieces (an ex-soldier who was 'turned' over to this special program and one of nine 'Recruits' for the program). All we know is, he needs his drugs. It's a nice drug-addict parable. What does he need it for? Well, to be a superhero, of course.<br/><br/>Seriously, that is the logic working here, and yet I could buy into it, because of the movie-science as laid out by Weisz's doctor, who is really into viruses and has a stable career... until her co-worker flips out and shoots up their lab (a really, genuinely tense sequence that shows Gilroy and DP Robert Elswit in their element, giving enough time to shots, and mounting dread as to how this guy can't be stopped - a more horror movie version of Cross mayhap). Surely the plot with Edward Norton, reduced basically to looking concerned throughout the movie and occasionally yelling at Stacy Keach, is not intensely interesting, mostly because we've seen it all before, in all three previous movies really. A man-hunt, track him down, squash the program, etc etc, oh and there's Joan Allen for a moment, move along.<br/><br/>What I had a small hope for was that Gilroy, a fairly sophisticated Hollywood director, and Elswit, who did a sharp job shooting the possibly equally preposterous spy thriller Salt, would change up the action just a little, and not make things as chaotic-actiony as Paul Greengrass had done with his previous films (it's been so long since I've seen Doug Liman's film so no comment there). But alas, Gilroy must have also thought that given that he's already dishing out a more intriguing character and dynamic between the male/female leads, and that there's more at stake, he has to give the audience what ""they"" want. And what is that? Brash, chaotic cinema: super fast cuts, close-to-the- character shots, spatial madness really. But where Greengrass, for his over-reliance on it (even in small dramatic scenes really), could manage it with a certain flair, I was lost in the miasma of the chase that ensues first over rooftop and then on motorcycle through the city. <br/><br/>So much built up, and then it was hard to care except in little touches, such as how the Chinese equivalent of Renner's super-drugged-up-spy-hero would be a bit more aggressive and dogged since, well, I dunno, he's Chinese (I'm merely speculating on the part of the cynical filmmakers). Will the series continue? I dunno. Renner is a capable and talented actor, finely physical but can bring the emotional weight when he has to, and Weisz is a fine addition. Yet, ultimately, Bourne Legacy is disappointing more because of who it's coming from. Had it been hacks, I might've forgotten about it. I may still, but not easily."
"darthmatthew-442-606491","7","2","8","21 August 2012"," A good action movie, but not deserving of the Bourne name.
","Immediate questions surround the Bourne Legacy. Will the action match up to the original trilogy's? Can Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross match Matt Damon's Jason Bourne? The answer- no. The Bourne Legacy is an above average action movie, but it's not worthy of the Bourne series.<br/><br/>Several things critical to the Bourne atmosphere were absent. The classic Bourne soundtrack by John Powell has been foolishly removed, and along with it, the breathtaking suspense present in the originals. It was like Star Wars without John Williams. Aaron Cross was a good action movie star; however, Matt Damon is Matt Damon-his outfit, his personality, and his bearing were made to be in the world of Bourne. Aaron Cross with his more contemporary look felt out of place. He felt almost as if he wanted to be Jason Bourne, but couldn't quite make it happen. Aaron Cross was just not as cool, unable to match Bourne's ability to completely control a situation as he did in scenes such as Waterloo Station.<br/><br/>But now that we have those questions out of the way, we can get to the real point. The Bourne Legacy standing alone. The following is a review that is hopefully void of comparisons to the original- as it should be written.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, The Bourne Legacy is an above average action movie, and manages to avoid most of the action movie clichés. Jeremy Renner does a good job of breaking out of the mold of the flat action hero, and also avoids cheesy line deliveries, resulting in an overall interesting action hero. Rachel Weisz does a decent job as a supporting cast member; however, while being interrogated, her dialogue broke down into panicked babbling that dragged a little long.<br/><br/>The story felt different than the average action movie, adding depth to a genre dominated by kiddy pool deep narratives. On the contrary, this does not exempt it from my criticism. Saying that it is better than the average action movie script, in reality doesn't mean much. It still makes many mistakes and is below average as a film script. The Bourne Legacy tried to hard in the beginning to gain its depth, resulting in me sitting through scene after scene not knowing what their meaning was until finally, about two-thirds of the way through, some of it was explained. The writers spent too much time establishing the premise of the film that questions just backed up like a traffic jam; there were too many ideas to sift through. And at the end of the day, the movie ended, and left many of the ideas stranded on the freeway, no doubt for an inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>The action was the redeeming factor in this movie. Aaron Cross's ingenuity during combat (using a fire hydrant as a gun, etc.) was refreshing after watching hours and hours of movies with people using guns ('cause that's just boring). All joking aside, The Bourne Legacy achieved what many action movies see as impossible. It was somewhat realistic. There was no magic bullet dodging-Aaron Cross used his quickness to evade his attackers line of fire, rather than diving into the open guns blazing (I'm talking about you Bond!), and occasionally, he would get shot too. The action scenes did have an occasional blunder, such as Aaron Cross and his opponent putting on sunglasses like they were high-rollers getting out of a car, and then zooming off on a chase scene. I suppose if you're going to get in a car accident, you might as well look cool while doing it.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is a good action movie. I am a huge fan of originality, and the Bourne Legacy was able to capture that kind of feel. It didn't however, achieve the Bourne atmosphere; moreover, Jeremy Renner can't hold a torch up to Matt Damon. In fact, I believe this movie should have been its own. The Bourne Legacy had almost all the components of a separate movie, but for whatever reason kept the small connection. Unfortunately, the Bourne Legacy had a careless ending, which damaged the Bourne Ultimatum's ending (can't say why, no spoilers). The Bourne Legacy was an average, refreshing action movie, but it shouldn't have been Bourne."
"Robert_duder","7","2","8","20 August 2012"," Ho-hum follow up to an amazing franchise
","When I read about the latest instalment to the Bourne franchise, my first thought was could they do it without Matt Damon. The short answer to that is...no. Damon is Bourne and without Bourne there is no Bourne film and Legacy shows that while there is plenty of more story to tell you can't just leave behind the key elements. Bourne Legacy's high point is that you can't an epilogue to characters from the original trilogy. The people involved in Treadwell and Blackwater and the corrupt Government agents and also a play by play on where Bourne is. But then the film is basically saying...meanwhile...and showing us a different side of the Bourne program. This could be okay but they also changed the format of the film. It is far more political thriller than spy action flick. The Bourne series always managed to balance both. So the pacing is very slow comparatively. Its still a smart, well written, decently directed film but it doesn't hold its own against the others in the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is Hollywood's It guy right now. Ever since The Hurt Locker his career has really sky rocketed. I like him but I can't ever seem to LOVE him. His performance in Legacy is decent but not amazing. Either him or his character doesn't have the stamina to really rivet you to the screen. He's not as dark and ominous as Damon's Bourne, and he just doesn't seem to get a lot of action scenes in the film. Rachel Weisz who is an incredible actress does a decent job as Renner's cohort in the film. She certainly gives the best performance in the film. They don't spend any time developing a romance between them but just let the characters develop themselves and that part works well. You will notice plenty of faces from the other films and get a much appreciated update of them and their stories. Edward Norton joins the cast and he's always a welcome addition and he made a great pseudo-villain.<br/><br/>Director Tony Gilroy has been a Bourne co-writer since the first film so it was a wise decision to have him take over as director. He knows the series very well and the film still has the same feel as its predecessors. Whereas the first three films had this exotic gritty feel to the setting, it felt like Legacy tried too hard to capture the exotic locales instead of just letting it flow. For every action scene there were two long scenes of dramatic build up and it made the pace feel just too slow. Lovers of the Bourne franchise (which I am) will probably like Legacy but will ultimately leave them longing for the first three films. Bring back Damon! 7/10"

","Giving five to this movie is generous, I think that the acting by the two leads was good, however like the others have said, the script just didn't do justice to the Bourne franchise, and the ending was nothing compared to the ending of the final Matt Damon Bourne film, hopefully if they do another one, they'll get someone else to write the script and give edward norton a bigger role because after seeing what he can do, I was disappointed that he had a minimal role, what was good was how they tied it in with the other films, and the action sequences. But even these weren't enough to change the fact that the script just didn't have the same impact the other ones did. So I really would only recommend this film to those who haven't seen the other ones"
"akritchever","4","2","8","15 August 2012"," A spy thriller that fails to deliver any thrills
","I'm a big fan of the Bourne series, so I waited with some anticipation for the reboot/quasi-sequel - ""Bourne Legacy"". In hindsight, I should have curbed my enthusiasm - ""Bourne Legacy"" is a competently assembled film with excellent cast, but it fails to deliver the thrills or advance the plot of the franchise in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with earlier Bourne movies, the short synopsis is that a secret U.S. program has been creating experimental super spies/assassins, using behaviour modification, drugs and gene therapy. Jason Bourne is the product of this program, he loses his memories, go rogue, and by the end of the third movie has exposed the program and its sinister shadowy government handlers. Bourne Legacy takes place chronologically just before the third movie and ends at the same time as the third movie in the series does. In my opinion a moviegoer who has not seen the previous three films will be confused throughout the first act of Bourne Legacy. Not a small amount of confusion for a newcomer to the series will be that the namesake of the series - Jason Bourne - does not make an appearance at all. This movie deals with the consequences and ramifications of Bourne's actions on the program and the people involved in it. There will be explosions, chases, parkour, and fighting wolves with bare hands. There will also be long, tedious expositions, meaningful looks being thrown, and a couple of exotic locales.<br/><br/>The main characters of ""Bourne Legacy"" are Jeremy Renner playing another rogue agent of the program that created Bourne, Rachel Weisz as the scientists involved in the program who's trying to help Renner's character, and Edward Norton as the government hatchet man in charge of covering up the program. Many faces from the original trilogy also make appearances. The cast is excellent and Renner's and Norton's performances particularly stand out. Renner brings humour, humanity, and dignity to the role, and Norton has a frigidly calm professional demeanour dripping with sinister insinuations. Weisz - an actress I've adored for many years - is generally good in her role, but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>So why didn't I like the movie then? It's actually rather difficult to formulate, but a few points stand out. For one thing there isn't enough globe-trotting going on. Most of the film happens in the U.S., and indoors, and could be set really anywhere, unlike some of the original series where much of the action happened all over the glove (OK, Europe mostly) but in recognizable locales that actually made sense in the story. In ""Bourne Legacy"" the final climatic chase/fight scene happens in Manila, but it is never explained why drugs for secret U.S. government program would be manufactured in Philippines - isn't Mexico or Costa Rica closer? The addition of Manila as a set piece feels very tacked on and random - maybe the studio got a grant from the Philippines government?<br/><br/>Another gripe I have is that ""Bourne Legacy"" doesn't throw much of a bone to newcomers as I've already mentioned. We get flashbacks to second and third movie, there's constant talk about Jason Bourne, various names and code names from the previous movies get tossed around without providing much background on it. In fact, the plot in general is poorly written, the pacing is either too slow or too fast (you know there's a problem with a spy thriller when you check the watch in the middle of an action scene to see how much time has passed). There are many expositions and cut-aways to show what's going on while the main characters are doing their shtick, but these just serve to confuse the viewer and slow down the pact of the movie. Other than a gripping scene in a laboratory, none of the action scenes succeeded in being memorable or tense.<br/><br/>But by far my biggest problem with this film is how unnecessary it is for the trilogy. Its goal is to show us the repercussions of Bourne's actions in the original trilogy, and introduce new characters who will carry the franchise forward, but ""Bourne Legacy"" does not advance the overall plot of the series in any meaningful way. It ends the same way that the third movie does (spoiler alert!) - the program has been exposed and now the media is all over it and there is a senate committee investigating it. What else do we learn? Only a bit more thorough explanation as to how the program succeeded in creating super agents, and a bit more background on the scientists involved in the program. That's about it. If this film was meant to be a reboot - it didn't feel like it as it required too much prior knowledge. If this film was meant to be a sequel - it didn't succeed either because it doesn't advance the plot or the characters from previous movies. Bourne Legacy was a competent, but ultimately thrill-less thriller."

","I left the theater wondering what what missing. The action was there as would be expected, but the over all plot as well as the sub plots labored to keep our attention in-between the action scenes. The story line was well done as it tied the other three movies in nicely, but in the end what we really wanted to see was Jason Bourne. One quick shot of his picture just didn't do it for me. Jeremy Renner did an OK job, but came across as uninterested in playing this part. The fake scruff on his face was ridiculous. The support cast was fine, but I felt Ed Norton never really had enough time in the film to really impact it the way he could have...you could have cut out half the back stories and made it an Ed chasing Jeremy story which would have breathed in the much needed excitement and the connective tissue to compare to the other three films. In the end Matt Damon was sorely missed and is noticeably the glue that kept this series together. Our only hope here was the corny ending that left it open to another installment...hopefully Jason Bourne returns to help Aaron Cross right some wrongs. I suggest waiting till it comes out on DVD or PPV."

","I actually hoped this movie would do justice to the old series even without Matt and Greengrass, but I was completely and utterly wrong in thinking so. My guess is if Robert Ludlam had been alive and watched this movie he would have made another book where Jason Bourne gets murdered by Tony Gilroy. I mean, what the hell did he think by penning a great novel/movie trilogy with idiotic plot and over dramatic dialogues and slow moving documentary styled movie (exception for old bourne trilogy as it was penned and Tony just had to furnish it a bit).Everyone here in the review stated that Jeremy did marvelous job without a script but personally he is not even one-fourth equivalent to Jason Bourne portrayed by Matt and the character of Rachiel weisz and the stupid plot about pill with virus was just made so that somehow they make a story around Bourne fame and then make money out of it. Even the action sequence couldn't hold out in front of Matt's Bourne trilogy, the action choreographer did some stunts which were really annoying and unrealistic say for example the bike sliding the rails.Even the music failed and was too annoying and didn't provide the vibe. And the extent of boring action sequence can be felt when Jeremy Renner(the protagonist) fell asleep during the bike riding sequence and his message on mirror ""No More"" indirectly could be taken as No More movies on Jason Bourne, I had enough of this(just joking).This movie has not even provided minimum eligibility to be tagged to the tail hair of Matt/Greengrass/Ludlam's version of Bourne. In the trivia its given that Before this movie was seriously considered, director Paul Greengrass jokingly suggested to make a fourth Bourne movie called ""The Bourne Redundancy"" and he was damn right about it.Hope they don't make another movie out of Bourne's name which could be as tiresome and boring as this one."

Now this one doesn't have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) in it, since he probably declined the offer to be in this sequel. And is now replaced by Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross. And there is also Rachel Weisz as the tag along girl for the main guy on the run from a big corporation that wants them both dead. Now the acting from the two including Edward Norton is spot on good. Edward Norton is the new head of Treadstone after Alexander Conklin. And he barks orders most of the way through in this. This whole movie is basically the bad guys trying to cover things up and get rid of any loose ends, even if it means killing people. The other Bourne movies were the same but this one is more direct about it, while lacking the cleverness of the previous movies. When this movie ends however it feels like it's missing quite a bit. It's a Bourne movie but it just didn't seem to have enough action as well. Leaving room for sequels is alright as long as the movie is satisfying but that isn't the case here. It just felt like a set up for the next movie in this franchise without it being satisfying. A good way to leaver room for a sequel is when the movie itself is satisfying but you anticipate and crave for the next movie. That just isn't the case for this one.

","this film was great it put together the thinking and action of the first 3 with a little humor from the new agent Aaron Cross. i find that if you look at the film by itself you will be confused and out of touch. but if you actually enjoyed the other 3 and want to see how the situation bourne started escalates then watch this film. it does what 3 did for 2. takes important scenes and makes them make a lot more sense. i would like to state its no academy award winning film i gave it a 9 because as a series as a whole this makes the movie a higher number. by itself its probably a 7.5 to a 8. i loved this film i think people are way to over the top about ratings and if you like action then go see this if you like the other bournes watch it if you are just interested in the movie and have not watched the others watch the others then this you will enjoy in a lot more this way. anyways if you are reading this thanks hope it helped somewhat enjoy the movie and member if you go into it thinking it is crap you might not like it just cause of your attitude just the same if you over hype it it might not meet up to expectations just go to enjoy yourself and you will."
"menkomigen6","1","2","9","6 December 2012"," Probably the worst movie of 2012
","They tried to milk the Bourne franchise further by producing yet another cookie cutter run of the mill American action movie. The result is the most boring and bland film I've seen in a long time. All the characters are boring, even Edward Norton who is undoubtedly the best actor makes the most of his role but falls miles short of making the movie interesting.<br/><br/>I'd say this movie is fit for children who doesn't care about a meaningful storyline, but then I'd say you are a bad parent for not learning your kids to appreciate good movies. I'd not pay 2 cents to watch this, and the time I spent watching it was wasted, and my life lost a bit of meaning because of it.<br/><br/>TLDR; Don't watch this movie, it's utter crap. I wonder when the culture of Hollywood will allow for American producers to start making some more progressive movies, with new ideas and well thought out characters, who can captivate their audience."

","Any user who rated this movie 7 and above is just a classic Bourne fans, nothing useful for your reference. This preview will based on the comparison of all previous 3 Bourne Trilogy. The previous Bourne Trilogy can be so successful due to the solid stunt acts and spy-alike- conspiracy. The movie has good acting, good story line but the major stunt looks downgraded, especially in the fighting. In Bourne Trilogy there'll be always a famous stunt guy to act as the nemesis of Bourne (aka the final boss), while in this movie the nemesis looks scary + non-emotion (as usual) but wielded less than 10 punches and died in the most ridiculous and the funniest way. The core stunt is basically a cat and mouse bike chase, take down a few guards, police, and agents. The best part of the movie that you wanted to fast forward to is the fight at the mansion, the rest you may skip ahead. I would recommend to buy or rent a DVD instead of wasting the reasonable money and time in the cinema."

"CinemaCocoa","5","1","3","13 April 2017"," Intended spin-off is more of a cash-grab.
","An almighty cash-in, or for once a clever spin-off from the Bourne trilogy? I'm afraid mostly the former. Now I was suckered into the trailer for Legacy, and even the tagline: ""There was never just one"" I couldn't argue against, after all, Matt Damon's Jason Bourne was part of a super soldier program. Plus this film takes place during the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, the third (and most exciting) in the trilogy. But unfortunately what we get is a pretty big case of ""missed opportunity"".<br/><br/>Aaron Cross is another man with no past, but unlike Jason he was not part of the Treadstone program but a sister program were participants are trained and enhanced with pills. When Jason Bourne's actions trigger the Treadstone program's assets and agents to be erased, the same must be done for the other programs and Aaron finds himself hunted down. His only ally is a scientist, Rachel Weisz, who is also marked.<br/><br/>The film takes an age to get started. We are subjected to an onslaught of crazy editing and ambiguous character development as the film tries to establish Ultimatum's storyline, Aaron's storyline, the multiple programs, and how these relate at all. When things go wrong, the film has the unsettling sense that something more interesting is happening elsewhere (read: Ultimatum). Most of the dialogue dissolves into ""What's going on??"" ""I don't know anything!"" for nearly half the film, poor Edward Norton is given little to do except tell brainless executives over-and-over what's happening.<br/><br/>The action is crammed into the last thirty minutes (yes, I checked the time) and it is greatly underwhelming. In fact, the whole film is underwhelming. It is terrible because Jeremy Renner plays an interesting variation on the Bourne character and there is potential in some scenes, but the story around him is such a rehash that I couldn't find myself caring.<br/><br/>Not enough synchronicity with the previous films, if establish characters had been used more I may have accepted Legacy as more than just an unnecessary addition. I love the Bourne trilogy, and perhaps Legacy would benefit as part of a film marathon but I somehow doubt it."
"Uriah43","6","1","3","13 October 2016"," Operation Outlook
","Although the character of ""Jason Bourne"" (played by Matt Damon) doesn't appear in this film, the movie basically begins where ""The Bourne Supremacy"" left off with him having escaped from Moscow and subsequently providing top-secret information pertaining to ""Operation Treadstone"" to key officials. It's at this point that a new character by the name of ""Aaron Cross"" (Jeremy Renner) is introduced who is part of a similar (and equally sinister) CIA program called ""Operation Outcome"". As it so happens, Aaron is being punished for going off the grid for a few days by having to train in extreme winter conditions somewhere in a remote part of Alaska. What he doesn't know is that Operation Outcome has been compromised and in order to cover everything up the primary executive in charge named ""Eric Boyer"" (Edward Norton) has ordered the execution of everything and everyone involved. This results in the liquidation of several agents with Aaron and a female scientist named ""Dr. Marta Shearing"" (Rachel Weisz) being the only ones managing to elude their assassins. Unfortunately, Eric has other methods and resources at his disposal and he remains very intent on completing the task at hand. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite shifting the focus away from Jason Bourne, this film still managed to make room for another sequel--with either Matt Damon or Jeremy Renner as the primary character-by cleverly side-stepping any major impediments to the overall course of events. On the flip side, I must admit that the chase scene at the end was much too long and improbable to be taken seriously and actually detracted from the movie as a whole. In any case, it was a decent addition to the Bourne Series and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
"caseynicholson","5","1","3","16 August 2016"," An Unnecessary Deep Track for this Franchise
","I'll start by saying that I almost gave this movie 6/10 when I first watched it, but then I went to see the new film, ""Jason Bourne"" which is out in theaters just now before penning this review. Having seen the latter, I bumped this movie down to 5/10 stars. Read on for why.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with the Bourne movies, Matt Damon plays the lead character in the first three movies plus the latest, the aforementioned fifth film in the franchise. This movie, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is the fourth in the series, and does not star Damon at all. Instead it stars Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker""; Hawkeye in ""Marvel's The Avengers"") who plays the role of a trainee for the same covert CIA black ops super-soldier type of program that Damon's character had evidently gone through prior to the beginning of the series. The movie is not a prequel, as it tells its tale after the events of the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" (and in fact the first half of the movie is told in conjunction with that movie). Still, the whole concept of the film is to provide insight into the behind the scenes happenings that led to the Bourne black ops program.<br/><br/>That said, while the movie is okay, what it winds up being is a ""deep track"" so to speak--it's the equivalent of a B-side song from a popular band's latest album. It's not bad, but it's just not what you want to see from the franchise.<br/><br/>The film does go into a fair bit of detail to explain the background of Treadstone and BlackBriar, the twin CIA programs that the previous movies revolve around. But while the plot is fairly engaging, it gets so deep into that back story that it winds up really only being of interest if you're a huge fan of all things Bourne and want to see the movie not so much as a standalone treat but as a film made especially for you as a Bourne aficionado. <br/><br/>None of this is to say that Jeremy Renner doesn't do a great job in the role he was asked to play for this movie. The problem is not the acting nor the action element of the film. Rather, it's that the film is just too marketed to the geekiest of Bourne fans for it to maintain its own appeal.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is one scene in the film that caused me to not like the movie. That scene is basically a mass shooting scene--a workplace mass shooting at that--that plays out on screen for much longer than it should, and goes into much more detail than it should. The scene seemed to last a good five minutes, and I felt like I was watching a torture porn movie--and one that was basically made to appeal to people who think mass shootings are cool. That whole entire scene could have been condensed into a brief cut that would have communicated the same message and kept the plot the same without the grotesque use of this very particular type of overt gun violence. Take that scene out and this movie goes up to at least 6/10 stars.<br/><br/>As for what I noted above about the latest movie, ""Jason Bourne"", I thought that maybe the events of this film might be brought up in it in some way. The franchise is huge on stringing together its various plot strings into a cohesive narrative. But to my surprise, ""The Bourne Legacy"" doesn't figure prominently in the new movie whatsoever. There's a tiny Easter egg moment where the code names for the programs used in ""Legacy"" show up on a computer screen in ""Jason Bourne"", but other than that there's nothing at all. That said, this movie is a completely unnecessary chapter in the franchise history--a deep track that is alright to listen to for die hard fans, but not one of the greatest hits.<br/><br/>For all of the above reasons, I'm going with 5/10 stars for this movie. I can't really say that it's a ""bad"" movie, but it also falls flat of being a good movie as well."
"Tehmeh","6","1","3","3 September 2013"," Actors, especially Renner, make this decent enough to see once.
","Just watched it. What to say? It's a bit of a mess. Perhaps I'm just dumber than your average person, but the script was more complicated than the plot itself was. The storytelling, editing, everything should've been simplified. The movie would've been more effective that way. I always liked the first Bourne movie of the previous trilogy the most. It didn't try to be smarter than it was, it already had a solid foundation. Pacing was great and the lack of shaky-cam was a blessing. This one feels like the last two films of said trilogy.<br/><br/>Here, we have Jeremy Renner giving a great performance in a mediocre movie. Every time he's on the screen he steals it scene by scene. Rachel Weisz is decent, and one of my favorites Edward Norton is seriously underused and eventually wasted in this movie. Nobody gives a bad performance. Actors make this one worth your while.<br/><br/>The basic plot isn't bad. It's good enough. Gilroy took a lot out of it with his pacing, which doesn't work for me. I didn't get too invested emotionally - which was exactly the case in the last two Bourne movies too. This story is not as complicated as it's made out to be, so why choose this approach? <br/><br/>Gilroy just repeated the pacing and storytelling methods of the last two Bournes (which he also wrote but didn't direct). Using the same style makes sense since the happenings of those movies occur in ""real time"" parallel to this story all the time. I appreciate the effort, but it just doesn't work. If anything, this story should've been presented in a more simple and personal manner. <br/><br/>Gilroy not only copied the style from the previous Bourne movies, but REPEATED almost all of the 3rd act from those last two Bourne films. That was unnecessary, tedious and didn't work well. You get running on the roofs, eye-raping chase scenes with a thousand quick cuts that hurt your brain while you try to comprehend the big picture visually, a token counter-assassin, shaking cameras and narrow urban streets. The 3rd act was where I gave up on this movie. They did not have to repeat the two previous Bourne movies, especially like this. Tiring, useless and very disappointing. Especially when this had all the potential to be a very solid movie. The basic plot was there, characters were there, excellent actors were there.<br/><br/>That said, there are some good scenes in this movie. Especially one taking place in Weisz's character's workplace and another in her house. Every scene that makes Renner's characters deeper is also good and exciting. Some fights are not that bad for a PG13-film. I hate shaky-cam action more often than not, but not counting the 3rd act, it didn't bother me that much. Definitely not as much as in ""Bourne supremacy"" which is a very, very hard film to watch. I have a huge problem with Paul Greengrass' directing and camera work in that one. About that PG13..these are not kids' movies. These need to be R-rated, seriously, even though it wouldn't have made this film a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I hate it when I see a movie that's decent, but could've been so much better. Like with ""Looper"", this movie had all the elements to be a really exciting film, but someone (Gilroy) lost the ball. Renner's character should've been the abslolute centerpiece of this movie, now he's just...another piece. A big piece, but still just a piece. He carried this movie, and more emotional investment to him would've been a good idea.<br/><br/>But hey, if you haven't watched it, and you like Jeremy Renner, at least he will not disappoint you even if the movie does."
"elshikh4","Null","1","3","14 February 2013"," ""Like a door that keeps revolving, in a half forgotten dream"" !
","OK, there is nothing new here. I saw (Rachel Weisz) running with a guy through many action sequences before in (Chain Reaction). I saw a long motorcycle chase before in (Torque). And I saw the matter of rogue secret agent on the run, being monitored by high CIA execs, who damn him all the way, due to his permanent elusion from them, obviously in 3 previous (Bourne) movies!<br/><br/>Actually the plot is so silly. The secret intelligence program, by the name of ""Treadstone"" or ""The Outcome"" (the movie can't decide!), has been failed because its founder downloaded his birthday or something on YouTube! There is even more. As a result for that, the intelligence has to terminate ALL THE AGENTS AND THE DOCTORS OF THE PROGRAM!!!!! Now, this is silly and dumb. Why not reusing them for something else, after plastic surgery or anything?! So, if another secret got leaked, the CIA would terminate itself, killing all of its staff??!! What a drivel! And to fairly sum it up, the rest of the plot is just an excuse to watch the 2 leads running and running and running. And then, at an abrupt point, the movie ends, as if it's ""Hey, our time is up, we'll catch you later, with the answers, in the sequel. Bye Bye!"". Don't tell me that this didn't make you unsatisfied and provoked?!<br/><br/>While this is, I think, an intro to a new Bourne series, it should have, at least, built some dramatic ground. However, drama, and characters, aren't things to be cared about or heard of in this territory! So don't shout ""How they forgot that writing a history for the lead, makes him more human, and makes the audience get attached to him as well?"", or whine about ""Why they didn't elaborate on the story of the girl who he was using her name in his partner's fake passport?"". Because the movie-makers had no time for this or that. They just wanted to utilize the Bourne formula of super secret agent, who runs from his superiors, all over the world, doing some hot action while that, and wins at the end. However, I missed (Matt Damon). He provided some serious inner bitterness as the title character, strongly in the first movie, of which this one doesn't know how to make, or doesn't want to make!<br/><br/>After putting the plot, or any seriousness, aside, what could be left? I know. Firstly, the very talented (Rachel Weisz). Although it's originally not a movie to ""act"" in, only ""run"", but (Weisz) did some good acting, mastering her role as emotionally stressed person, who found herself suddenly thrown in an ocean of blood, while not understanding a thing (surprisingly her lines were well-written). Secondly, (Jeremy Renner). There is some good fighting on his behalf. Not to mention that he looks so macho unlike (Matt the-forever-boyish Damon). And thirdly, some cool action with catchy directing. Other than this, there is no ""other than this""!<br/><br/>The ultimate fact about this movie is that it is frankly empty. So, I kept asking questions about its reason of being; why to repeat the whole Bourne world again? It wasn't great world in the first place. And why not making a movie of its own, away from the legacy of Bourne? The answer: 1) it's Hollywood. It became lately like a pure merchant, and no artist, who sees just deals not movies. Therefore, whenever glimpses a movie with a box office glow, Hollywood must exploit it to the end of it (or us!). And 2) when it comes to ideas, they're bankrupt. Hence, prolonging Bourne's life, or rather name, could be good for another movie to keep the industry going on anyway. Apparently, the Windmills of ""Hollywood"" Mind have become so boring, industrializing only more and more of air.<br/><br/>So, accordingly, this is a project, a moneymaker, a commercial movie, with some action and thrill. And also, this is unnecessary sequel; unoriginal, repetitive, and deprived of anything unique. Undoubtedly, making it as a parody out of the Bourne trilogy should have been more creative and seductive to watch. But in another, more necessary, movie then."
"nerfball_king","4","1","3","23 January 2013"," Interesting approach, impossible execution
","Plot line is this: Aaron Cross is another super-soldier, just like Jason Bourne. The Treadstone program is going to be exposed and possibly shut down, so all people affiliated with the program (including Cross) are being wiped out. So, Cross needs his super-soldier drugs to stay alive, so he steals a plane and flies from Alaska to Chicago, then rescues one of the lab agents from sudden death, then they go to Manila to get him his fix. Throw in some impossible high- speed chases and shoot-outs, hand-to-paw fights with wolves in the wilderness, innocent people being executed in a mass shooting, a weird conflict with another UNKNOWN super- soldier and you've got this movie. <br/><br/>The story is wayyyy too complicated from the get-go, to the point where you just had to stop thinking and ""enjoy"" the cartoonishness of this film. <br/><br/>I like Jeremy Renner as an actor, and thought he was exceptional in The Hurt Locker and MI: Ghost Protocol, but this movie was not one of his better roles."

","""There was never just one"", a neat way of explaining Matt Damon declining to sign up for this fourth entry into the series.<br/><br/>Aaron Cross (Renner), another enhanced operative for an even more secret government organisation ""Outcome"". We meet him as he undergoes Alaskan training, the reason for which is never really explained, although we certainly know that taking his tablets is important and is required in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>It's not long before Washington types decide that the program is in danger of being exposed potentially leading to further revelations of the ""Blackbriar"" and ""Treadstone"" programs. This cannot be tolerated and therefore ""Outcome"" has to go, including all of those involved.<br/><br/>This is essentially one of those movies where something is exposed, the top man demands ""give us the room"", mere mortals leave, decisions are made and people start to die.<br/><br/>No sooner has Cross warmed up and caught his breath, he realises he has become surplus to requirements. A steady drone in the distance turns into a real drone on the horizon and the hunt begins.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a diligent science lab technician Dr Marta Shearing (Rachel Wiesz), vaguely acquainted with Cross following many medical checkup's, finds herself part of the ""ruthless downsizing"". Managing to join with Cross following a disturbing event at the laboratory, the two go on the lam searching for med's to get Cross ""viralled out"".<br/><br/>Edward Norton (Byer) and Stacy Keach fill the morally ambiguous program director type roles. A smattering of the cast from the previous films are also on hand to bring continuity to the series, albeit in blink and you miss em' roles, step forward Joan Allen, John Glen, Albert Finney and David Strathairn.<br/><br/>Renner handles the action well but does not have Damon's effortless screen presence. Wiesz only gets to look scared, out of her depth and freaked out and yet does that well as anyone, although the chemistry between the leads is lacking. Ed Norton makes a reasonable job of portraying someone quite prepared to make tough decisions, supposedly for the greater good, whatever that might be.<br/><br/>Unlike previous Bourne entries, the film as a whole does not work well. The dialogue is weak, notably a scene in an escaping car that turns into a shouting match. Far too much time is spent chasing the next tablet and the motivation and support for the ""Outcome"" organisation, remains as obscure as ever.<br/><br/>This is a film where the protagonists can disappear in Manila with no tracking device, Byer then deploys a dedicated large team to track them and seemingly within moments they are found. Phillipine police and SWAT teams are bashing in doors and yet no one officially knows anything in Washington.<br/><br/>Tony Gilroy takes over directing duties, as previous director Paul Greengrass had always stated three films was enough. Despite being involved with writing previous efforts, the step up to the role of director has not been as successful as many had hoped for Gilroy.<br/><br/>It could well be argued that this is just a film that did not need to be made, the three previous films were very successful and the character arc, arguably complete. Much like the continuation of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, the last vestige of art has been sacrificed at the altar of the dollar available from a built in audience.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A disappointing entry in the Bourne series, despite sterling efforts from the leads, with lacklustre direction, a weak story and only partially saved by excellent played for real stunt work.<br/><br/>Lets hope that Damon's ""Bourne"" can be found and reunited, if this cinematic universe is to continue, preferably with a more competent director.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","15 December 2012"," Fun but flawed...it'll do until something better comes along
","I come to this film as a huge, huge fan of the Bourne trilogy. They're films I can watch over and over again, enjoying them repeatedly each time. So I was eager to see how this spin-off worked out, given that Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon have chosen not to return to the fold at this time.<br/><br/>The worst thing about the film is Tony Gilroy, who returns to the franchise having been a writer on it for a long time. Here he directs as well, but he's no Greengrass, and it's pretty obvious most of the time that this is a piece of emulation. Lots of the scenes recall other, better moments from earlier films. It's almost as if Gilroy is looking back nostalgically on what worked in the past, hoping that he can repeat the same success here.<br/><br/>He can't, although THE BOURNE LEGACY remains a fitfully entertaining movie. The action sequences, when they come, are very well handled and almost on par with those of the original trilogy; a showdown in a house is a highlight, and the lengthy motorbike chase at the climax is brilliantly conceived. But, at a two-hour-plus running time, there's actually very little action, and genuine problems with slow pacing. Some of the time I was looking at my watch, waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz (whom I usually dislike) are blameless, both turning in decent, character-focused performances, and when stuff's happening the film gets really good. But it's all the extraneous stuff that drags it down: the repetitive attempts to tie things into the same timeline as the Bourne saga. Edward Norton's villain is pointless, and scenes with returning actors David Strathairn, Joan Allen and Scott Glenn are completely irrelevant. If they'd excised everything like that, focused it down entirely on Aaron Cross, brought the motorbike chase forward to the hour mark and given the film a genuine climax with Norton, it would have been much better and possibly on level with the earlier films. As it stands it's fun but flawed, certainly the worst of the four but still better than most of the DVD action trash I watch"

That should kill off the Bourne franchise sadly."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","4","26 June 2013"," Although it adapts Greengrass' style very well, its condescending simplicity, motivations and ending simply aren't worth the money.
","It's ironic that the least Bourne-esque film of the series made me suddenly realize the genuine appeal of the original trilogy, which for some reason I didn't understand their significance and acclaim. They are grown up, intelligent action movies for grown ups. Unfortunately, when I saw them, I wasn't grown up. I saw all 3 in the cinema, and not again since besides the odd scene or so from TV. I didn't get Identity, disliked Supremacy and actually quite enjoyed Ultimatum. As far as The Bourne Legacy is concerned, it's really simplified. The entire film is essentially a cat and mouse chase though it feels like there's room for something more. I often enjoyed the simplicity of the plot and the action sequences are excellent and utilize Greengrass' style of everything-too-close-up-but-by-god-it's-rough very well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the point of Bourne is its realism. That's what makes it exciting. There are too many moments where it felt too unrealistic or forced, which is okay for a generic movie but not for Bourne. Fortunately, these were all between the action, and the fight scenes were the quick thrill I wanted. My biggest problems with the film, besides most of the conversations between any characters, was the introduction of genetic enhancement pills, which almost feels like science fiction. They attempt to do it with subtlety, but then that subtlety is ruined by adding a wordless, stock threat character against them for the climax. It doesn't feel like a worthy climax at all. However, I am glad to see a film that doesn't look overadvanced in technology and has the good ol' graininess I've missed and is very well acted by Weisz and Renner.<br/><br/>Despite the big flaws, it is an entertaining film. Unfortunately, all the best action moments were in the trailer and I found myself waiting for them. By what I thought was the beginning of the third act, I was asking myself ""so where are they gonna take it now?"" and then it ended abruptly (cued by Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" of course). However, that question wasn't strong enough for me to actually care about where they're going to take it because they didn't leave any hints as to where it could go. It highlighted just how weak the plot strands are when I expected them to go somewhere with it the whole time. Granted, it's very clear they were just leaving it off there for a sequel, but that immediately skewers the intention of the film from an observed different perspective to a franchise cash grab. Though I do feel like giving the originals a second chance.<br/><br/>6/10"
"jboothmillard","6","1","4","19 December 2012"," The Bourne Legacy
","The first three film are fantastic action thrillers, and part of the reason is because of the great performance by Matt Damon, but when I saw this trailer for this fourth film, based on the book of the same name (that is meant to have Jason Bourne), I was sceptical one without the title character would not work, so I watched to see what I would think, from director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton). Basically the story in this story happen at the same time as the events in The Bourne Ultimatum are going on, where the authorities witness the shooting of Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) and are trying to catch Jason Bourne, but more importantly when the former Treadstone operative hands in the details about Black Ops operations Treadstone and Black Briar to Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to release to the press. When those responsible for creating Treadstone and Black Briar know that the operations have been exposed, they are concerned how other operations they have will be affected, and on one of these other operations, called Outcome, is agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), and he is unaware that they are shutting down all operations all killing all involved. He survives their attacks, and he wants answers as to what is going on from the woman who worked on him when he started at Treadstone, Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), and he also seeks the medication that apparently all subjects need to take to help them increase their senses and determination. When he finds her she has survived an attack with his help as well, she cannot answer all the questions about the program because she was only involved with the first stages, and she does not have any of the medication he seeks, because she confirms he has not needed it for a long time. While the operations people realise that an agent and a doctor have survived and are trying to escape them, Aaron and Marta head for Manila in the Philippines to go to the place the medication pills come from, and after getting some answers they also outrun an assassin in a chase, until they get away on a fishing boat heading for the tropics to live a life off the grid. Also starring Edward Norton as Retired Col. Eric Byer, Stacy Keach as Retired Adm. Mark Turso, Oscar Isaac as Outcome #3, Dennis Boutsikaris as Terrence Ward, Albert Finney as Dr. Albert Hirsch, David Strathairn as Noah Vosen, Scott Glenn as Ezra Kramer, Donna Murphy as Dita Mandy, Corey Stoll as Zev Vendel, Zeljko Ivanek as Dr. Donald Foite, Corey Johnson as Ray Wills and Elizabeth Marvel as Dr. Connie Dowd. Renner gives a good moody performance with ideas of how to get away and a determination to get to the bottom of things, Weisz does pretty well being scared and knowledgeable with doctoring, and the supporting cast members, especially those as the manipulative and scheming heads do well. Jason Bourne is mentioned most of the time throughout the film, it is obvious they have rewritten the story to revolve around a new agent, who did not lose his memory, what I liked about the previous films was the chase sequences and gripping fights and stuff, this film does have those moments, but maybe not enough of them, and obviously it just doesn't feel the same as the others, that is obvious without Bourne, nevertheless it is not such a bad storyline and action thriller. Good!"

","I went to see this film without having seen the previous Bourne movies. I had heard you wouldn't really need to have seen them to understand and enjoy this. Yes, I did understand the film, as it's fairly removed from the other movies, features mostly new characters and a simple plot. <br/><br/>There are some entertaining parts in this movie, like the scene in the manor. Jeremy Renner is always a good action hero, and the acting overall is actually quite good.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy the film? No.<br/><br/>I cannot remember seeing a movie in a theater and feeling both bored to death and physically ill at the same time. The constant shaky-cam and the weird, extreme closeup -fixated cinematography create a strange, almost nauseating mess of images that isn't terribly hard to follow, but most of the time feels completely pointless. Despite being over 2 hours long, the story feels like it cuts off about two thirds into itself, and is still terribly messy. The pacing is all over the place, and it gets an awful long time for the plot to actually get moving. The story moves from A to B to C without any sense of weight or meaning. The final big action scene seems to go on for ever and ever, and when it ends, it ends just as abruptly as the movie. <br/><br/>I'm actually having a hard time writing this review, because I can't recall much of any specific plot points or events, just a blurry haze. All in all, The Bourne Legacy felt like a missed opportunity to take an old action franchise into a new direction. I actually flipped the bird at the silver screen in frustration when the credits rolled. I felt like I had wasted a good 2 hours of my life.<br/><br/>Just your average whiz-bang-crunch-vroom -fest with nothing special or interesting about it."

(that wasn't even answered until half way through the movie!), ""why are they shutting the operation down - because of some video...w-what?"", ""what was the point of the wolves?""(am i looking too deep into that part - I dunno), ""what is the plan 'against' the company now that they've spent the last bloody 2 1/2 hours running?"" - these are just a small proportion of the questions that bombarded me while sitting in the cinema.<br/><br/>Okay so I make it sound like it was a non-conclusive movie (it kinda was) but it wasn't all that bad. It definitely did not lack on any of those impressive, way over the top (american/hollywood) stunt scenes (and my did that motorbike chase go on for ever) - sarcasm too prominent?<br/><br/>From the above, the plot/ progression of the movie was lacking in details. But the actors managed to make it quite bearable. Personally I didn't really like Jeremy Renner in his previous works but I must admit that he actually grew on me. His easy, cool charm and acting style managed to bring some life to the rather empty script/plot. Weisz didn't do that bad a job either. So - she played the science chick to the best of her ability (and quite well too) - but outside the lab she seemed a little clumsy (clearly not an action heroine - motorbike scene... hilarious in all her clumsiness)- but maybe that fits the whole science geek stereotype (?) but she complimented Renner well - you definitely need someone weak to make the impressive big guy look even bigger! =P<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was annoying as it solved nothing really - well okay so they managed to escape, I mean that seemed like the entirety of the plot with, of course,the gun shooting and the crazy motorbike chases where the other guy ( question: was he supposed to be like another crazy drugged up machine/man?) would always come back just when they think that they were free... <br/><br/><ul><li>there was so much happening that the plot kind of got lost in between those shacks and crowded streets.</li></ul><br/><br/>Okay so my review is a bit jumpy but hey, nothing is perfect (am I right Mr Bourne Legacy?)<br/><br/>Finally: <br/><br/>Story: 4 ~ Characters:5 ~ Acting: 7.5 ~ Music: (too caught up in everything else to really pay attention - my bad!) ~ Re-watch value: Low to medium ~ Enjoyment: 6.5 ~ Overall: 6/10"

"lxpatterson","6","1","4","20 August 2012"," sign of the times
","The previous Bourne films with Matt Damon were driven by Jason Bourne's relentless pursuit of his humanity: freedom, redemption and identity. In those films, the CIA was similarly animated by a strong sense of (misguided) nationalism, paternalism and duty. Jason Bourne tread similar ground to the action heroes that preceded him in his fight to escape from the karmic wheel of violence that he seems inevitable drawn into. It is these themes that make his otherwise brutal character sympathetic.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy is made of different stuff. Jeremy Renner's agent is driven by nothing deeper than an animal instinct to survive, whether he is braving the wilds of Alaska or hiding among the sheep-like masses of common humanity. The film also makes it clear that the CIA units that pursue him have identical motivations: political survival, which the film implies is tied to the survival of the individuals involved. Renner's agent knows who he is and what he is capable of, and stops at nothing to keep his CIA grafted abilities because he believes he will not survive otherwise. The effect is a film which has scant humanity for the audience to sympathize with.<br/><br/>My feeling is that political thrillers/actioners are written like a mirror to current events of the time. The prior films are a different beast because they are a product of different times, perhaps a time when the idea of politics as a human endeavor (if not humanistic) was at least believable. As a thriller, the Bourne Legacy, in contrast, is informed by a frighteningly simple belief in realpolitik: power as a means of guaranteeing continued survival. This feeling that as individuals or a nation we are a snarling animal backed into a corner is unappealing, but perhaps a fairly honest assessment of our milieu."

","The Bourne Legacy loosely takes off from the events that took place in The Bourne Ultimatum and continues from there. This time its not Jason Bourne that's the protagonist but another by the name of Aaron Cross.<br/><br/>When news first came that this movie would be a stand-alone of the franchise, I thought this would be better rather than continuing Jason Bourne's story. Despite this, this installment does not live up to the standard of the previous movies. Even though the setting of the movie is good, the storyline isn't as great as the previous movies. The hand-held camera technique which made the previous movies more gripping and realistic is absent. They put a bit too much humour in the movie which undermined the gritty tone of the series. Another major flaw was that the movie ended abruptly giving the impression that the story will continue with another movie. This goes to show that the franchise is now on the road to running its course, their intention was to continue the story rather than make a stand-alone movie, and that Hollywood is now running out of ideas if you also consider this year's reboot of Spider-Man and the remake of Total Recall (which I haven't seen yet).<br/><br/>It is a worthwhile movie, just don't expect the same standard as the previous Bourne movies."

That's unfair because you are comparing Bourne against a non-Bourne character. Of course it's going to be different. Get over it.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner delivers a decent effort here as Aaron Cross. Apparently he has some souped up power. During the story, there is a connection established between Bourne and Cross, but it's somewhat vague. Are they trying to say that Bourne had souped up powers too? No way, that was never Bourne. Which again tells you, forget about what the great Robert Ludlum wrote. These guys can do what they want with Bourne in film now. Just go with it. They change anything - beginnings/endings/origins. See Iron Man for example.<br/><br/>I thought Rachel Weitz was OK, not terrific, but OK. There's one scene in her home where I thought she delivered terrific acting. The person that under-delivered was Edward Norton as the CIA/govt bad guy. I can never picture him as a bad bad guy, so I really think he was miscast. He can't deliver the bad guy vibe like Ed Harris can, or that other guy who plays the bad guy in the X-men films. Norton does not deliver - he does not exude the cut-your-tongue-out badness that his character theoretically has.<br/><br/>I do think, like many reviewers write, that the story lacks punch, but is over 2 hours long, so something failed here. Not much happens, and then the final chase scene goes on pretty long. It's disappointing that the film has good acting, decent length, but lacks power.<br/><br/>This movie won't blow you away, but does give you hope that there could be a sequel with Bourne.

","The Bourne Legacy is pretty much the Halloween III of the Bourne Franchise. Having very little to do with the first 3 Matt Damon / Bourne films, the film attempts to have a similar film along the same timeline as when Jason Bourne was having his adventures, using some of the same actors in the previous movies (but most of them appear to be either cameos or outtakes from previous Bourne movies). Jeremy Renner, who gets my vote as being one of the most unappetizing heroes ever, plays Aaron Cross, a genetically modified killer (!!) who needs pills to keep alive. When the government tries to shut down the program (thanks to yes, a storyline in the original plot line) and tries to kill Renner and a chemist involved in the making of the drug, things of course don't go according to plan, leading to chase after chase. Edward Norton, who seems to be the king of bastard sequels, is here, playing the head of the department trying to eradicate the killers and scientists, he's good in a somewhat throwaway role for him, but really, what can you do? The ending is definitely curious, as it leaves gigantic holes that SHOULD have been filled, not left open for another movie (which there will be, but things are uncertain who will be in that movie). I mean it's all fine and dandy to leave people wanting more, but the way this film ended was sort of like, ""whoops, ran out of time lol"" leaving gigantic questions answered.

It all sounds great on paper, but what's missing? <br/><br/>The first thing you will notice is the distinct lack of Jason Bourne in a film bearing his name. Whilst Jeremy Renner may be a fine supporting actor, his youthful visage lacks a certain darkness that somehow removes him from the extreme violence the role demands. Rachel Weisz seems a little out of her depth here too; her constant whimpering and hammed-up expressions may test your patience. Edward Norton was by far the most promising addition to the cast. Anyone who has seen American History X or Fight Club knows the gravity he can bring to a role. Considering that this film is an original creation in its own right (though based on the books) there was the license here to create a sinister masterpiece, a personification of the unsettling actions and moral ambiguity associated with the intelligence community. Sadly, he is rather under-utilised, serving more as a vassal for exposition; his contributions seem only to enable the next action sequence.<br/><br/>On the whole, however, this film has a lot to offer, and anyone looking for an action – adventure will have plenty to sink their teeth into. The car chases and combat are as exciting as ever, with a tense soundtrack to draw you in. The plot isn't something to dwell on, indeed the dialogue between Renner and Weisz is frequently littered with complete nonsense and embarrassing scientific malapropism, and the cast are forever being blessed with inexplicable revelations whenever the pace of the film threatens to slow down. The film is also a little lengthy too, with the familiar intro of Moby's Extreme Ways coming as somewhat of a relief. The film falls down in many areas, and those wanting to go deeper into the Bourne universe may be disappointed, but overall it is enjoyable enough to stand out against the other releases in the action genre this year."
"ross_kewl","6","1","5","2 September 2012"," Does not live up to the original trilogy
","I love and admire the work of Paul Greengrass in the original Bourne films. So when confronted with this ""Bourne Legacy"", I was disappointed and angry. I did try to find aspects of the film to like, which there were some, but the vast majority, including the plot, was dull and frustrating.<br/><br/>The fundamental platform on which a film is made should be moulded around the plot. After you have this firmly established and perfected this you can go onto looks, action etc...The thing that made the first trilogy so good wasn't the cinematography or the epic car chases just by themselves, but this combined with an intriguing plot. Action scenes on the big screen look great but after you walk out of the cinema you focus on the plot and it was a let down. <br/><br/>From the start, it was flawed, with the original films the audience became invested in Bourne's future and who and what this man really is. Yet with Legacy, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) lacks any mystery about him. Character development falls into the category of plot. The science- fiction that was incorporated into this film was childish and ""unbourne"" like.<br/><br/>Even the action sequences were similar, especially the motorbike chase scene in Manila. This was on par with the motorbike chase in Tangier, Morrocco in Ultimatum. Most of the audience, I presume, would have seen the previous Bourne film, so they don't want to pay more money to see the same thing over again.<br/><br/>To the positives, the Alaskan scenes were memorable and beautiful. The dog fight scene unique. All the Bourne films have looked great because they go to different cities and landscapes. The acting was good as well but their characters were let down by poor writing.<br/><br/>This film was never really engaging but the entire plot was cringeful. I mean seriously, little pills are the driving force behind the plot. Skyfall better be good..."

","I don't think there is one movie watcher that hasn't at least one Bourne movie. The original Bourne trilogy might be the best of its kind thats why it makes it very difficult to make a spin off like they tried to do here. The acting was amazing, Jeremy Renner and Edward Norton have the potinal to make the up coming bourne movies a lot better but in this one they were just blind sided. The script was not well done at all, the story line was spotty throughout the movie it was just not a well done movie but the actors did the best they could with it!<br/><br/>However I don't think it was a complete failure, the directors and producers have to learn from this mistake and use this as a stepping stone to a better upcoming Bourne movie!<br/><br/>Its definitely worth a watch but if you were as big of a original Bourne fan as me, you might find it to be a let down!"
"treeskier802","8","1","5","13 August 2012"," Transition Film?
","I've noticed a lot of poor reviews for The Bourne Legacy and admittedly some of the criticisms are spot on. However much of the negativity is really based on a knit picky critiques. I agree that this movie isn't as good as any of the three films starring Matt Damon. But I think time might be kind to this movie after more of the story is told in future movies.<br/><br/>It seemed to me that The Bourne Legacy was a transition film. It dug deeper into what had been presented in the three previous movies of the franchise, added new characters, and set up future story lines. Hence the story took a little time to develop unlike the other three movies which put the peddle to the metal right from the start.<br/><br/>Renner was great as Aaron Cross. I liked that Cross had a little sense of humor and wasn't a carbon copy of the Jason Bourne character. Bourne barely talks, whereas Cross had dialogue and seemed to have a slightly different skill set to Bourne. He got into the program with and under performing IQ score and needs the meds the program provides as much for confidence as to the actual enhancements they provide.<br/><br/>Wietz was also great in her role. Her character provides a very interesting partner in crime to Renner's Cross.<br/><br/>I found the movie very engaging. The storyline may not be as fascinating as Jason Bourne's where he has to figure out who he is and what the program he is involved in is all about. We know all this from his storyline. The story of Aaron Cross is different, yet I found it a lot of fun because it parallels the timeline of Bourne's. Never in film have I seen a sequel/prequel (not really what this movie is but for lack of a better term) where the timeline runs alongside that of preceding films. If rumor is true that Damon will reprise his role in perhaps the next film to join Cross, then I think The Bourne Legacy has successfully continued the story.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for the film and I really enjoyed it. I'd like to give the franchise a longer leash than a lot of critics have and see what the next film is like and how Legacy fits into the broader scheme of the entire story. I say give this one a go. Rating 8 of 10 stars."

","but I liked it. It's not perfect but it fits in with the other three Bourne movies just fine. I didn't think any of them were perfect, either. In some ways, this one is superior to the others.<br/><br/>Certain conventions used; for example, the explanation of the science could have been done slightly differently although of course it was needed.<br/><br/>Locales selected were brilliant. Scenery in the Alaskan wilderness appeared to be digitally enhanced. If not, cinematographer deserves an Oscar for this movie. Acting and dialog were first-rate except maybe the scene where she is explaining the science to the experiment. She sure makes the thing she loves sound like a J.O.B., there.<br/><br/>I love a chase scene as much as anyone. Parts of this one were great. Without giving away specifics the need to make the greatest chase scene of all times appears to be irresistible to directors. Manila was perfect for it, though.<br/><br/>It's a good piece of work and I am certain no one associated with it has any doubts."

It is important to listen and watch all parts of a movie but this one keep stretching it to a point where it wasn't necessarily. There was too much talking and less action, but when there was action it was kick ass insane. still wish there was more hand to hand combat fighting but this was still great. The ending was good in which it tried to be like Ultimatum. the leading roles were portrayed great and at the end of the day the Bourne Legacy was decent, expected more, but had a good time. definitely go check it out if you are into the Bourne movies/books, Jeremy Renner, and/or Treadstone."

","The Idea of starting a new fresh beginning with The Bourne Movie is a really smart and interesting thing to do. so, they did in this movie, and they failed by giving it to ""Tony Gilroy"" to direct it. I will tell you why, because from what i think Tony's style is kind of slow and not for the thriller action movie style, because as we know the previous ones and specially The Bourne Ultimatum is a breath taking action thriller adventure movie, so if you're gonna continue doing Bourne movies you have to raise the thriller to the next level.<br/><br/>I watched the making of and i found that there was some deleted scenes, and before the movie was released i was expecting a non stop thriller movie, but when i watched it i was disappointed, because they make it too long with some boring and unnecessarily scenes.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner actually did a great job taking the lead as another Bourne, so kind of i was satisfied with his acting, but for Rachel Weisz ,i think she wasn't the one for that role, in other movies i really liked her and she always was perfect for me, but in this movie i...<br/><br/>So, i hope they will understand from what they have mistaken in this movie and get over it and bring us real Bourne movies like what we used to like in the previous ones."

"JasonWarrenIMDB","3","1","7","7 October 2012"," Killing the franchise with shallow characters, a weak plot and a non-existent showdown
","Not again. Not another movie with flat, underdeveloped characters and a plot-line lacking resolution or showdown. 'The Bourne Identity' was a well-made piece of storytelling, packed with believable characters and a driving plot. And here we are, three movies later and one Matt Damon less. Is it the suits without their own esthetic insight who are to blame, overly relying on a known scriptwriter gone mediocre director? Or is it just plain greed? In these days, when a shaky hand-camera only looks cheap and rapid editing looks like a thinly concealed excuse for a badly planned production, quality and attention to the basics of film-making would have made a big difference. And why enter Jason Bourne into this equation? Sure, to reap profit from a successful brand. I get it. But wouldn't it have been enough to stay with the name, and not intercut old material or story lines into this alien, cold-water movie? The story? An agent (Jeremy Renner), pimped by medication and viruses to near superhuman powers is meant to be eliminated as part of a program shutdown for no really conceivable reason. A female lab doctor (Rachel Weisz) is threatened for similar motives. He saves her, they flee to the Philippines, mainly for film-production tax-break purposes, I guess. He gets weaned off medication by voluntarily being infected with a virus. They flee again. The end. The driving plot? Close to none. The antagonist? Edward Norton. The showdown? Non-existent. In fact, the two opponents never even meet. Instead, a constantly changing string of agents chases Bourne's follow-up character. The baddies are never introduced and hardly speak. At the end, the unlikely couple rides into the sunset on a boat and a sequel is set up. Hollywood, if this is the best you can do, please contact me. I can understand you are milking a dead horse. But why don't even full-time critics just say the simple truth: Bad movie, don't watch. It's easy."

The major sin of this movie is that is boring for the 1st hour. I mean like you want to walk out of the movie boring. At one hour into the movie you finally have a fight which by the way is not fought in typical Bourne style. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie is fine, the casting is probably even over kill for many roles ie Ed Norton, and even Rachel Weisz. The plot, pacing, and balance are all wrong. Half the movie is wasted, they could have given us that info in 5 minutes. The next 30 minutes is OK, then the last 20 minutes is one large chase seen. The chase seen is good but too long. They expand on the bad government agency themes and pull in an even larger conspiracy. The Aron Cross character is not well written. It is hard to find any reason to root for this character. He is in general self serving, and fully aware of what is going on. Basically it is like feeling sorry for a wall street banker who's plan to rob the public false apart. <br/><br/>The net is I suggest you skip this movie or wait for to come out on cable or even better yet read the book that is actually a good story."

","Spoilers Galore:<br/><br/>Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) dives under a waterfall in Alaska and retrieves a cylinder tethered to the bottom of the stream. Why? What was in it? We'll never know. He then crosses across mountain tops, occasionally swallowing important blue and green pills.<br/><br/>We can assume he's on some sort of mission. He eventually reaches either a rendezvous point or his final destination. There he meets another operative or contact and they banter back and forth, clearly confusing each other until Cross tucks in for the night and notices the name ""Jason Bourne"", among others, carved into a board above his head.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the CIA, we realize Bourne has exposed treadstone and blackbriar effectively killing those covert programs. ""Colonel"" Byer (Edward Norton) has some kind of big job in intelligence ... big enough to order the elimination of all covert agents associated with these two programs. We find out these agents are referred to a ""outcome assets."" Aha, Cross must be one of these guys!<br/><br/>Back in the Alaskan cabin, Cross is ready to move on. He steps outside into an oncoming blizzard and hears an airplane engine. It's a drone. He and the other spy-like guy are paranoid and not expecting a drone so they decide to split up. Cross runs out into the blizzard just as the drone launches a missile at the cabin. Cross outwits Byer and the killer drone squad and is assumed dead. (This was not at all confusing and one of the better parts of the movie!)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the lab (the one that makes blue and green pills), one scientist goes ""postal"" and murders all but one of his coworkers. The survivor is Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who has previously flirted with Cross when he visited the lab for check-ups. He's hot for her, she only knows him as ""number 5"".<br/><br/>Five minutes or five days later, Cross is in Chicago and talks to someone on a phone, then Marta is attacked at home by CIA assassins. Remarkably, she is saved by Cross! While escaping the massacre at Marta's home, Cross and Marta FINALLY discuss the blue and green pills. One of them makes you smarter and one of them makes you stronger. Marta explains that if you ""attach"" the drug to a virus and inject that into a spy, he won't need the pills to be a super spy anymore. Unbeknownst to Cross, he was already ""viraled out"" on the muscle pill a year earlier! <br/><br/>Cross reveals to Marta that he was not originally one of the smartest ""outcome agents"" in the club and he'd like to retain his enhanced brain power! She's cool with that so they fly off to Manilla to get some brain power drugs. If he doesn't get the drugs soon, he'll die or get sick or go crazy or just get stupid again ... it's not real clear.<br/><br/>The CIA is not stupid. They use every trick in the ""post 911, so it's okay to spy on our own citizens"" book to find Cross and Marta in Manilla but it's too late, Cross is now permanently smart. So smart and strong that he's able to evade another top secret ""super duper spy,"" Larx-03. Larx-03 is relentless and must have read the script because it's impossible for Cross to shake him in the crowded streets and neighborhoods of Manilla. Eventually, during a motorcycle chase, Marta, manages to kick Larx-03 off his bike allowing her and Cross to escape.<br/><br/>Then Joan Allen's ""Landry"" character is seen back in the states being arrested or facing a senate committee or facing the media, honestly is was so out of left field, I could't wrap my head around it! <br/><br/>Cross and Marta are last seen, James Bond style, sailing away from the Philippines on a rickety old fishing boat ... the end ... really, that's it!"

","So Bourne is reborn one more time wow and this time we have Jeremy Renner instead of Matt Damon. As the previous three films were a great success and I would re-watch them again from the beginning except for the fourth one. Here's the reason why I find that rebooting this series is a big mistake. A film this big must have Matt and an excellent script which it wasn't. Instead we have an almost great story that is lacking of plot and pointless direction. Being that I watched the last three previous ones this completely does not add up to the hype from the past. Looking forward it would be great if they really dial back and rethink what they could do better on this film. It is sad that what once what was a great film turned to complete garbage. Overall I would watch it for pointless action and the crazy scene in Manila, with the motor bike down the rails. Other than that I would just simply fall asleep."
"chrisP698","6","1","7","14 August 2012"," Disappointing
","Having loved the previous Bourne films that have been released I went into this with reasonably high expectations, though sadly I left disappointing.Whilst watching this I was consistently reminded how amazing the first three films in this series were, and how no matter how hard they try they cannot live up in this recent addition.<br/><br/>The thing that made the first three films great was the mystery around the character Jason Bourne and his past life, though sadly in this film they choose to focus more on the companies behind these programs, than on developing the character Jeremy Renner portrays. By doing this it stopped me from really engaging in the story and left me not really caring what happened to any characters in the film, which is good because the ending is fairly abrupt and nothing is answered in terms of the Jason Bourne mystery that some may have hoped. Not all the acting is terrible because as always Edward Norton does a very good job portraying the man trying desperately to keep everything under wraps and burn the projects, though I felt he was underused in the grand scheme of things especially towards the ending.<br/><br/>Many people have commented on the fact that the fight/ chase scenes are well done, though even these great scenes just left recollecting scenes from the previous in which they were more intense. The chase scene towards the end of the movie, just served to remind me of the chase scene that was in the ""Bourne Supremacy"", which had a more satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>This isn't an awful movie and there are worse films that you could end up going to see this summer, though there are also better ones, such as ""The Dark Knight rises"". If you want to learn about the companies behind the Bourne films then your questions will be slightly answered here, though don't expect anything as good as we have come to expect from this series."

","The Bourne Legacy - 2012<br/><br/>Directed by Tony Gilroy<br/><br/>Starring Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​When the actions of Jason Bourne spark a fire that threatens to burn down decades of research across a number of secret intelligence agencies, Eric Byer (Edward Norton), the man who built the programs, decides he must sacrifice one of them: Outcome. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), one of Outcome's six agents, and research scientist Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) go on the run when Byer targets them for termination. But Cross proves to be a far deadlier target than Byer realises.<br/><br/>It is an insult to Supremacy and Ultimatum(not a fan of Identity) to call this movie a Bourne movie. Supremacy revolutionised the modern political thriller and Ultimatum revolutionised the modern day action film. What does this film revolutionise? How little companies care about the quality of their film, so long as it makes money. Trust me when I say this, I didn't want to hate this movie, and I am not being overly harsh on it. It is atrocious. With the bleak, bleak exception of one minor, minor idea - I hate everything about this movie. And I mean everything.<br/><br/>The plot. I don't take shame in admitting that I had to google the plot of this film to make that overview up there. I understand what was happening on a basic level, but the motivations and logic behind all of the film's events in either nonexistent, poorly explained or a bit of both. That 50/50 up there is a mutually exclusive even(only one is feasible at any one time) but I think this film found a way to make both realities coexist simultaneously. As stated previously, I liked the concept of the US government dealing with the aftermath of Ultimatum. Here's the problem with that in the film though. This idea(the thing hinted about in the title for God's sake) is mentioned once or twice(in the form of scenes from Ultimatum by the way) and never mentioned again. They gloss over it in a throwaway flashback to something I like. That is cruel. Screw the writers for this movie. Screw you, Tony(Double to you) and Dan Gilroy.<br/><br/>Now the 'performances'. People praise the actors in this movie for doing the best they could with this horrible, horrible script. I don't think they should be praised at all. I disagree that they were competent. Jeremy Renner was pretty mediocre as Aaron Cross and he was basically an invincible Jason Bourne. He was trying too hard to be like Bourne and the writers jacked him up on a mix of steroids and cocaine to do so. I will give Renner credit were credit is due however. I do think Renner would be, with a better director and script, a competent action hero. He clearly has the capability but just was unlucky enough to have Gilroy with him. I see untapped potential for some form of action hero in the future but I can't use the future as credit for something in the past.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz was also pretty mediocre as Dr Marta Sheering and I still don't understand why she was in the movie. Her character was introduced in quite possibly the most stupid way possible and then she just decided to tag along. I don't know what purpose she served to the film and, quite frankly, I don't know if I care.<br/><br/>Edward Norton - you are better than this. Don't do this to yourself. You have great abilities and I can tell you were at least trying but you are above this. Please, don't come back for a sequel(God forbid it). As an 'antagonist', Norton was pretty weak. I placed the noun antagonist in quotation marks because I think it is generous to call him a villain. He wasn't imposing, threatening, skilled, interesting, strangely likable/charismatic. He was just a dull guy behind a computer monitor who became our villain because Edward Norton is a name people know. It's a shame as well - the pieces for a great villain are there, we just had Tony Gilroy in charge.<br/><br/>The cinematography is really poor in this movie. They utilise shaky cam and quick cuts but don't utilise either effectively. So, if you have a 'thing' for shaky cam or quick cuts, firstly get yourself to a doctor, and then watch this film - you'll probably love it. <br/><br/>The action in this movie(all 10 MINUTES of it) was awful. It was poorly handled. Again that is a shame because it is clear Renner is capable of it.<br/><br/>The visual effects in this movie are atrocious. They look so, so, so fake - it hurts my eyes.<br/><br/>Legacy is a boring, uninteresting, dull, pathetic excuse of an 'action' movie. It doesn't deserve to be credited with the Bourne name and I doubt it will leave a legacy of its own. I'll rate this travesty of a 'BOURNE' film 1 'Bourne Wannabes' out of 10! Don't see it. It isn't even funny bad."

The secret meetings in the dark rooms from the original movies were thrilling, here its just constipated looking men being worried.<br/><br/>The action never really gets going until the last fifteen, and although its choreographed well, you're too bored to care about what happens.<br/><br/>It's not a great vehicle for remmer, and in my opinion it's one of the biggest disappointments of the summer, even though I had doubts.<br/><br/>Stick with the original trilogy."

","In its purest form, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that in a little over two hours tells the audience exactly what the trailer conveys—that ""Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg."" In this film, we follow a new agent named Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who is physically and psychologically enhanced. The film follows a familiar storyline to other Bourne movies, in which an agency executive and his/her team of keyboard wizards try their best to find a highly-skilled agent running ""willy nillly"" around the globe. Accredited and well known actor, Edward Norton fits nicely into this role as Eric Byer who's only characteristic is that he cuts straight to the chase in order to avoid all possible collateral damage. Bourne Legacy also takes notes from The Bourne Identity and involves a female partner. The lucky lady in this film is Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who works in a bio-medical super lab in order to help create and maintain the genetics needed to keep agents such as Cross, genetically enhanced. When Byer decides to shut down the genetic program and destroy any active agents, Cross narrowly avoids death and begins to search for Dr. Shearing who he knows will be able to help him find more gene-altering pills in order to find answers and survive the onslaught of trained operatives set on killing him and the doctor. Cross and Shearing travel around the globe to find answers and when they do, all hell breaks loose and both have to fight, gun, and ride their way to safety. Tony Gilroy, an original screenwriter for all three of the previous Bourne films, daringly attempts to write and direct a film that merges a new original story with Bourne's final days in the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" storyline. Unfortunately, the film, in so many ways, becomes an unfortunate mess.<br/><br/>It should be said that I am a massive Bourne trilogy fan. The original three films were great and ended in great fashion. Therefore, when Bourne Legacy was announced, I immediately had my doubts. Perhaps Bourne Legacy's first fatal flaw is that the film is entirely confused on who is more important—our new main character, Cross—or the Treadstone ""messiah"" himself, Jason Bourne. The first half of the film cuts between Cross camping in the mountains for no apparent reason and Byer tossing around policies and theories in which the audience has no idea what he is talking about. The Bourne films have always been known to be confusing and complex involving the CIA, US Senators, etc. yet the Bourne Legacy attempts to replicate the same complexity, however fails in execution. Instead, the story is confusing in the least attractive or interesting way. At times, I couldn't help but cringe a little at how hard Gilroy's story was trying to match its predecessor.<br/><br/>It wasn't until the second half of the movie that Legacy felt anything remotely like a Bourne film. Filled with the same deadly combat we all came to love in the original films, Renner shows that he can match Damon's showmanship in the ""kicking ass"" department, which was a welcome sight. Furthermore, Renner also flaunts his motorcycle driving skills in the film's only chase scene which seems to drag on into eternity. Although, the film's action sequences were impressive and entertaining, it was the little nuances that were completely unnecessary to both Bourne fans and the average movie-goer. Small aspects such as an enemy's ability to survive multiple bullet wounds, Shearing's over the top emotional cries and yelps, and Cross's lack of focus or ""super-agent poise"" was endlessly distracting and took away the little momentum the film had. <br/><br/>Now aside from comparing the film to its Damon predecessors, the acting and writing was sub-par at best. Although the cast featured many experienced actors, only Norton and Renner seemed to bring any actual ability to the stage and the characters they were playing. However, it was certainly the writing that seemed to bring everyone down. There were many emotional one liners that Renner's character spit out that seemed completely out of place in an espionage film. A super-agent is supposed to have composure and poise and yet Renner's script played at the opposite. Yet, perhaps the most painful of all writing and acting was Weisz's role. Although I do understand that the character was in an emotional position after being close to death many times, any genuine emotion from Weisz's character could not be found—even amidst the yelling and crying found too often in the film. In the end, the over the top emotion and mediocre writing felt odd and several times, laughable. <br/><br/>Near the end of the film, Weisz's character asks Cross if they are lost. Despite Cross's actual response, I cannot help but think that ""lost"" is the best way to describe Gilroy's attempt to extend the series further. Although entertaining and a fun cinematic adventure, Bourne Legacy becomes just another action flick that will soon be forgotten by its audience and any hopeful Bourne fans. However, Legacy's biggest flaw is the aforementioned fact that a two hour film was produced to reveal relatively nothing about Bourne, Gilroy's new character, or the popular story arc created in Damon's Bourne trilogy. As an audience, you cannot help but feel like the film takes you around in pointless circles and therefore, lost couldn't be any better of a term to describe the pile of espionage scrap Tony Gilroy found in the bottom of the—already empty— Bourne barrel."

","What a waste of time! And money! All those cars that exploded, motorcycles that were wrecked, devastation that was wrought, and all for nothing! This so-called 'film' is just an expensive computer game for mindless oafs. It has a flimsy pretext for a story to give it some vague semblance of purpose, but that is so confusingly communicated (much of it by the semi-audible mumblings of incompetent actors or sound men who have fallen asleep and been replaced by malfunctioning robots) that it might as well not exist. The script dialogue is vestigial, like the human appendix, and serves little useful purpose. It appears that by invoking the name of 'Bourne', it was hoped that this Big Nothing might make a quick buck before too many people realized how vacuous it really was, and that it is not based on a novel by Robert Ludlum and in fact is just a mindless meander through the void of purposeless violence and chase scenes that provide totally empty thrills. Needless to say, Jason Bourne does not appear in the film at all, and Matt Damon is glimpsed only in some photos. There is a line of dialogue amongst some sinister spy chiefs that says he has been discovered 'at large in Manhattan', but we learn no more, so perhaps there is some other film in production which will tell us about Matt in Manhattan. It is interesting, isn't it, that if you remove five letters from Manhattan you get Matt. This is clearly a code and indicates an international conspiracy at the very least, if not an inter-galactic one. (I want royalties for that idea.) The worried girl in the film is a barely recognisable Rachel Weisz. She spends a lot of time furrowing her brow. As she has little dialogue, she was clearly not challenged by the part. Edward Norton is in there, but which is he? Stacy Keach and even Albert Finney flash into view, but to no effect at all. They must have laughed up their sleeves as they collected their fees, hoping that their friends would never see the film and laugh at them for appearing at all in such a load of tosh. All those grim-faced people with guns. I think the audiences and viewers ought to be the ones to get grim-faced and demand their money back. It is difficult to believe that Tony Gilroy wrote the screenplays for the three real Bourne films and has now written this nonsensical spin off. What a steep decline, or shall I say, how low can you stoop! He did such a good job of scripting the feature film version of STATE OF PLAY (2009, see my review), and he has 'been around'. He also directed this mess, his third directorial effort. OK, so he or his camera crew framed some good shots of boats sailing amongst islands, but how about a story? It seems that Gilroy is only good at adaptations and that as soon as he tries coming up with a story of his own, forget it. Please, Gilroy, don't do this to us again. Stick to interpreting other people's material, don't try and invent stuff."

Gilroy looks lost as a director, not knowing the path he wants to take.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Franka Potente was solid as a couple and as characters. We cared about them and we are crushed in the very moment that Maria dies. We can feel the pain that Bourne is going through and we pray for him to be safe, to succeed.<br/><br/>Here, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz tries to act convincingly, but their characters and the story of the film doesn't add up. There's no mystery, there's no dramatic tension and there's no charisma.<br/><br/>When the action was happening in the final 40 minutes of the film, I didn't give a damn, I was looking at my watch, hoping the movie to end as fast as possible.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities of this picture was Edward Norton, completely underused here, some references to the other movies here and there, the music score, the quick appearances of Joan Allen as Pamela Landy and David Strathairn as Noah Vosen who both remembers us for a few moments in the final scenes that we are seeing a Bourne movie and the Bourne theme ""Extreme Ways"" when the credits roll.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed with the outcome, I still think there was no reason for them to continue after Ultimatum and I'm seriously thinking about abandon the series and stick only with the Liman/Greengrass trilogy if the next movie doesn't improve to return to the crowning glory of the first trilogy.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, give me the Damon trilogy anytime, but this... you'd better left it alone as a failed attempt to continue something that doesn't need to be continued."

","To be honest, I have always liked watching the Jason Bourne movies but I also was starting to get a bit fed up with them, since basically all of them are- and are doing the same thing. I however indeed wished that this movie in some ways was a bit more like the previous Bourne movies.<br/><br/>Thing I have always appreciated the Bourne-series for was that they turned the action genre into something more realistic again. All of the fights and chase scenes are shot in a realistic way and don't feel all that exaggerated. This movie definitely could had used some moments like that, or some more excitement in general.<br/><br/>The way I see this movie is not necessarily as a sequel but more as a reboot to the series, with a different main character this time around. They seem to be hoping to be able to continue the series with Jeremy Renner but they should focus on getting some better writers first.<br/><br/>Because it's a reboot, it mostly feels like a rehash of the previous Bourne movies as well. We have to be introduced to new characters, who yet are going through the exact same things as the ones in the previous movies. Aaron Cross is basically being Jason Bourne, on the run for his superiors, who want to shut down Treadstone again because of a YouTube video(!). And Rachel Weisz is basically playing the Franka Potente character. An 'innocent' bystander who due to circumstances gets involved- and has to team up with the main hero. So even though the movie is mostly doing different things it all still feels very familiar and more of the same, which makes you wonder what the Renner continuation of the series has to offer. Nothing new and nothing good unfortunately.<br/><br/>They start all over again but another problem with the movie is that Aaron Cross just ain't no Jason Bourne. Bourne was likable and you wanted to root for him. This movie doesn't ever give you any good reasons to care about the Jeremy Renner character and his faith. He is not as interesting and he doesn't have as much range as the Bourne character, in terms of depth and emotions.<br/><br/>Also because of this the whole story and movie feel lacking and it doesn't ever seem like it's going anywhere good or interesting with it. It doesn't work out half as well as it potentially still could had done. There is very little variety in the story and you feel that one or two twists could had spiced things up a little bit more but the movie doesn't ever surprises you in any way and is mostly being a very straightforward flick, without any good or clever developments. Perhaps it's true that this is being one of those movies that thought it was being more clever than it truly was. With its many dialog and people constantly scratching their heads and rubbing their eyes in despair, while looking at a bunch of computer screens, it certainly feels that way.<br/><br/>Director Tony Gilroy very obviously tried to mimic director Paul Greengrass, who directed the two previous Bourne movies, his style. So yes, shaky cams, sudden zooms, it's all still very present in this movie. It however in this case feels forced and that distracted from this movie. I even somewhat felt sorry for Tony Gilroy. He tried so hard and desperate but he most definitely just ain't no Paul Greengrass!<br/><br/>Before doing another Bourne movie, they should focus on getting a better and more interesting script first!<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012) is the fourth movie and continuation of the Bourne trilogy into the 2010s. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie isn't as firmly attached to the earlier Bourne movies as you might think at first. It ties in at the beginning to the third movie with some characters we've seen before, but soon after continues off in its own direction without really connecting much to the earlier works. It's more or less a Bourne movie... without Bourne.<br/><br/>Quality-wise, it does feature some similar action elements and chases, and it does get a point for inventive environments and vistas, but ultimately, it does not deliver at the same level as its predecessors. The shaky cam is very prevalent, however, which sometimes can be a bit confusing as it is not as well handled as in The Bourne Ultimatum. The ending can also come across as rather abrupt.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are a big fan of the earlier Bourne movies, The Bourne Legacy is a rather unnecessary spin-off that does not improve on the Bourne universe and thereby feel stale and boring. In that sense, you do not need to see this movie. Otherwise, it's a fairly entertaining but very average action movie.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a bland 6/10.

","The Bourne trilogy was a masterful trio of films, each one featuring a great many spectacular yet plausible action sequences woven together by an engrossing storyline. The Bourne Legacy, co-written and directed by series writer Tony Gilroy, reverses that relationship, trading action for dialogue and vice versa. The first forty-five minutes or so consist mostly of exposition for a plot that tries to say too much in the time it is given. I like to think that I am good at following narratives. However, having not seen any of the previous Bourne films recently, I admit that I knew what was happening, but not why. The whole film feels like an unsolvable jigsaw puzzle; however absorbed you may be in the process of assembling it at first, you gradually realize that some of the pieces don't quite fit together, and you wind up feeling frustrated. All this story needed was a few more connecting threads, and this could been another solid entry in this exemplary series. While the story is a bit weak, the actors are certainly not. Jeremy Renner, though lacking Matt Damon's charm, pulls off his finest performance since The Hurt Locker. With his rugged looks and toughness, he fits his role perfectly, appearing every inch the genetically enhanced action hero he is. Rachel Weisz plays a doctor partially responsible for the genetic manipulations performed on Cross (Renner) and his associates, who require pills to keep themselves enhanced, lest they degrade both mentally and physically. It is this possibility that keeps Cross on the run, due to his need to acquire more of these pills, and the decision by higher-ups to terminate the program employing both him and Dr. Shearing (Weisz) in light of the events of the preceding trilogy. These attempts to tie up the program's loose ends make up the best aspects of the film. The action scenes, particularly those involving Cross beating the hell out of baddies, is incredibly visceral, with pitch-perfect fight choreography and involving, if over-stretched, chase scenes. If there had been more of this sort of thing within the two-and-a-quarter hour runtime, this could have been something special. As it is, this film over-exposes one of the better storylines in Hollywood. Maybe the sequel will clear things up, but in the meantime, it's regrettable that well enough just couldn't be left alone."

","20 August 2012. Aaron Cross as played by Jeremy Renner is apparently no Jason Bourne as played by Matt Damon. With this amazing script that had some of the best dialogue of any espionage movie, the emotional conflict and tension on a real human level, the director let Renner down and maybe Jeremy Renner himself as well as Rachel Weisz's character just don't seem to fit the script's overall characterization. Aaron Cross's portrayal belies the cool and required strong demeanor of the best special ops person - he wears his emotion on his sleeve and doesn't seem to really have any observable enhanced physical or intellectual abilities that were supposedly described in the movie. The ending is a great disappointment as if a balloon were to pop but instead of a loud explosion, there is only a leaky, deflation, not typical of any of the preceding Bourne movies.<br/><br/>There are small problems, such as in the beginning when Cross is shooting at something but the audience doesn't get to see what immediately or why. Later there the encounter with the opposition which is some of the most sloppy work by Renner's character of any of the Bourne movies (though perhaps there was an underlying intent, but it was made evident), and then there's the convenient opposition that seem to be able to somehow track Renner and company somehow even after a nice getaway. The chase scene with the Asian being so lucky in his dumb decision to use a car instead of a motorcycle only adds to the problems with this movie.<br/><br/>What was intriguing and unique in this movie was the real-time parallel between the Bourne Ultimatum and Bourne Legacy though it wasn't quit seamless and Joan Allen's role was very underdeveloped here. There were the creepy parallel's to the real life Aurora, Colorado movie shootings and the pilot attempting to steal a jet in St. George, Utah.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie starts way slow, with some glimpses of some great mental espionage going on, and an excess of repetitive physical action, and a weak ending."

","The Bourne trilogy not only made a stellar contribution to the action genre but effectively established Matt Damon as an unlikely action hero. From it's versatile mix of pulse-pounding thrills and adrenaline-charged action sequences, there is little wonder to why The Bourne trilogy has become a franchise cinema junkies have come to love. But some may ask: was a fourth installment all that necessary? While the franchise has virtually ran it's course required to sustain it as a firmly consistent series, a fourth installment (or perhaps a spin-off) would necessarily be a burden. However, this action thriller goes slightly different direction, taking its focus off the enigmatic Jason Bourne character and bogging down on an all new action hero set. It then all comes down to a plot limited with only narrative connections to the previous films In the process, this involves pulling director Paul Greengrass of the previous two films and the veteran lead Matt Damon out of the picture and substituting Tony Gilroy as director and Jeremy Renner as lead actor. Set shortly after the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum', the film stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an agent of a Black Ops agency known as Operation Outcome who are set to expose the sinister agency known as Operation Treadstone who were pursuing after Jason Bourne in the previous films. When it's successor Company known as Blackbriar operated by Colonol Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton) conspire to eliminate him, Cross goes on the run with biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) to take them down.<br/><br/>It is understandable that moviegoers everywhere were met with skepticism upon learning that Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass would not be making their return. After all, it can be somewhat hard to fully engage in a newly introduced lead character following the departure of a veteran protagonist who was easily more charismatic. Shockingly though, this stand alone sequel carries a surprising amount for an entry veering off in a slightly unfamiliar territory for the franchise. Jeremy Renner boasts a fairly versatile flair as the freshman action hero Aaron Cross as he sets out to face off against the sinister consequences. Predictably so, he doesn't quite pack the same visceral spirit Matt Damon demonstrated in the trilogy. Nonetheless, he shows off an incredible adrenaline-fueled testosterone that gratefully stands out from the somewhat muddled script. Director Tony Gilroy who served as the writer for the previous Bourne films sets up a nice premise during the first half building up firm connections to 'The Bourne Ultimatum' with Jason Bourne only verbally mentioned several times throughout. The only problem is that the story is bit exposition-heavy for nearly half of it's two and a quarter-hour runtime and at times a bit too talky to the point where it falls victim to an occasionally slug pacing. And the fun doesn't quite takeoff until the final half-hour when we reach a climatic action sequence. From there on, that is when we watch Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz on the run as bullets starts flying and cars starts flipping. These two easily catch the eyes in the midst of the large cast including Edward Norton is given very little to do offer than conspiring the plot to kill the lead character.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy may fall shallow to the original Jason Bourne trilogy in terms of direction, it still boasts a surprising amount of entertainment enough to distract viewers from the unfavorable absence of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. In conclusion, it is a slick action thrill ride that works fine even if Tony Gilroy's script and direction suffer in a few areas."

","With Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass apparently done with the world of Jason Bourne (although they both returned this year), franchise screenwriter Tony Gilroy, also on directorial duty here, attempts to expand on the universe further with the fourth entry into the series, The Bourne Legacy. While the first three focused on Bourne's battle with the CIA's top-secret agencies' attempts to hunt him down to save themselves embarrassment and exposure, Legacy unravels the rippling effect the amnesiac's antics has on those at the top-level, as well as the other assassins who were usually a text message away from going toe-to-toe with him.<br/><br/>One of these assassins is Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, who we meet early on alone in the Alaskan wilderness on a training exercise that requires him to take dangerous leaps between snow-laden rocks, ensuring he doesn't become dinner for a pack of wolves, and other harsh survival activities. These early scenes are full of promise, as Cross drops the meds key to his super-humanness and draws out fellow operative (played by Oscar Isaac) in the hope of re-upping on his supplies. They are quick to realise something is wrong when their hut is obliterated by a tooled-up drone. The attack is one of many on operatives trained under the Treadstone, Blackbriar and Operation Outcome programs, as Eric Byer (Edward Norton), an ex-Air Force colonel, is hired to clean up the mess uncovered by Bourne and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine).<br/><br/>Cross's escape and quest to find more magic pills puts him on the trail of biochemist Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a good doctor who manufactures the drugs that enhance his skills and who he has encountered before in the past. A mass murder-suicide at the laboratory leaves her as the sole survivor, and Cross conveniently jumps in at just the right time as she is attacked at her home by agents posing as psychologists. Every occurrence in these films seem to be the handiwork of a tie-wearing, craggy-faced puppet-master at the top of the CIA, and one of the main joys of Jason Bourne's adventures was seeing him take revenge on the men and women working outside of the law, and those responsible for turning him into an emotionless terminator who carries out multiple killings. Legacy's main issue is that Cross's mission to find a fix removes the personal and redemptive elements in favour of a McGuffin that the film spends a lot of time trying to explain.<br/><br/>In the early scenes, Renner demonstrates precisely why he was hired to take over from Damon, delivering a chattier, more human protagonist with even a hint of maliciousness. Renner brings the same unpredictable physicality that won him Oscar nominations for The Hurt Locker (2008) and The Town (2010), and his dialogue with Isaac is by far the best moment of the film. Yet as the film goes on, his personality all but vanishes, choosing instead to have him play the one-dimensional action hero, leaping between buildings and occasionally beating someone to the ground. It's a terrible waste, and his character would have been served better if so much time wasn't invested in scientific gobbledegook explaining why he must get from A to B. There's a couple of reasonably entertaining action scenes here and there and Norton does slimy incredibly well, but the brute nature of Greengrass's aesthetic is sorely missing, and, despite the title, The Bourne Legacy fails to distinguish itself from any other film on the action movie conveyor belt."

","The Bourne Legacy works more as a spin off to the successful Bourne trilogy using events from Supremacy and Ultimatum to inform the developments in this film. The story focuses on Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), a super soldier in a secret CIA training camp up in Alaska. While the CIA tries to clean up its mess through Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), they begin feeding their soldiers in the field poisonous pills. For a brief time, Cross encounters another soldier (Oscar Isaac) and is pursued by drones.<br/><br/>The addition of the U.S.'s preferred means of engagement in flying drones enhances the action to a modern level but somehow, this spin off still falls short. Scott Glenn reprises his role as the CIA official Ezra Kramer scrambling to cover up the damage caused by Jason Bourne. The pacing is a bit off with short scenes of action and convoluted story that tries to recap the first three films and set up the new plot. A new senior official lurking in the shadows Adm Mark Turso (Stacy Keach) heads the cover-up operation. <br/><br/>The scientists behind the program get involved including Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who witnesses an awful mass murder playing off other horrific current events. The movie also pauses to inform us of the backstory through flashbacks, which stalls the fast-paced nature viewers expect from a Bourne film.

","The movie starts off really well, but tends to get worse as it progresses. The cinematography and acting is amazing. The film's plot is not as strong though, and their choice of location was disappointing. Bourne movies seem to me more satisfying when filmed in Europe, or The States; any ""spy"" film shot in in Europe or The States is better due to the value it adds to the film. There seems to be more locations and better landmarks in Europe. The film lacked location as well. Some dialogues were off. I personally believe the movie could've been more detailed and had a better ending. Jeremy Renner's performance was good. Robert Elswit did a great job as the director of photography. The characters were not introduced very well and it would be hard for some people to get locked onto the movie."

","The Bourne Legacy is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's an action packed adventure with some very intense moments that proved that there is still interesting stories to tell in the Bourne universe, Jeremy Renner shines in the lead role and his scenes with Rachel Weisz are certainly the best moments in the movie. It's certainly not as compelling as the previous films, they managed to be an intense thriller, while still taking time out to develop its characters and form a relationship between them, that is not evident as much here, it is mostly just an action thriller that dosen't take enough time outs, Paul Greengrass was great at this and his absence in directing this film won't go unnoticed. Several characters were very underdeveloped, over the the course of the first three Bourne films we learn so much about Matt Damon's character, we don't get as much with Renner in this movie, he starts off as a blank canvas and the audience is intrigued to learn his story, but by the end of the film we could have learned much more about Aaron Cross, I also thought Edward Norton's character could have had more screen time, he's very interesting when he's on screen, and plays an important role for the first half of the movie, but shortly after it's almost like he's completely forgotten about. It has its moments but it certainly isn't as entertaining as the previous Bourne films, still the Bourne Legacy is worth the watch if you ever see it on television and are looking for a good action, but don't go out of your way to see it. <br/><br/>An assassin goes on the run when the CIA decide to eliminate all evidence of his programme. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jeremy Renner Worst Performance: Corey Stoll"

","One of the most intense and exciting spy thrillers in years and my favourite entry of the Bourne series, which is ironic seeing that a new star steps into the main role instead of Damon and turns out that the new addition is the best of them all. Jeremy Renner, my favourite actor, plays outcome agent Aaron Cross who discovers that his life is in danger when Treadstone and Blackbriar are exposed leading to the complete wipeout of the programme he was trained in, which means wiping his life out and any existence. <br/><br/>All the boardroom scenes, the surveillance operations and character interactions genuinely feel like you're peering into a live operation, and the performances enliven these moments. Paul Greengrass' frenetic and gritty camera-work and style is followed up very well by Tony Gilroy who directs Legacy, the same intensity and realism seen in the previous movies is here. Aaron Cross is more confident and cheeky than Jason Bourne, who is more serious but I like the difference here in character and Jeremy Renner superbly replaces Damon. Rachel Weisz is great, playing a darker and more unstable role than compared to her characters in The Mummy or The Brother's Bloom. <br/><br/>There's never a dull scene here which is a mercy, the action comes in short but sharp and fierce, the UAV drone sequence is the highlight for tension and the bike chase echoes back to older Bourne movies, and of course the fighting is absolutely knockout just like the movie."
"Lejink","5","0","1","24 March 2015"," Bourne too late
","Were the producers right to re-boot the Bourne franchise without Matt Damon? Well, everything and everyone else is at the moment, it seems, often while the original is still a recent memory, so I guess I should have been expecting this. By very simply expostulating that Jason Bourne wasn't the only brainwashed super-agent out there trying to find himself, it's really very easy to present another on-the-run rogue operative, this time Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross, returning to hunt and haunt his masters.<br/><br/>However, the almost exact re-running of the plots of the three Damon-led films into one (or so it seemed to me), deflated my expectations somewhat. Renner does well enough in the lead but lacks something of the single-mindedness of purpose which Damon's driven acting style imparts to the role. I also found the plot somewhat laboured and far too much tech-speak employed, especially by Cross's pursuers.<br/><br/>Of course what you expect most from a Bourne film are exciting fight-scenes, daredevil chases and hair-raising car-stunts. These are present but not always correct, Cross's rescue of female scientist Marta (played by Rachel Weisz) in particular lacking edge and while the pair's escape from the Thai police, plus a government-hired assassin let loose just to kill Cross, does better, taking in the obligatory race across the rooftops and a motorbike duel between them (at rush-hour time of course), but again scenes like these only take you back to similar happenings in Bournes 1-3, where I think personally they were done just a little bit better. Edward Norton gets the part of the big bad Government bureaucrat tracking down Cross with unimaginable surveillance systems which would astound even George Orwell, a part he plays with a steely, haughty resolve.<br/><br/>Cross and Marta's apparent escape at the end leaves plenty of scope for a sequel or two and there is the intriguing thought that Bourne and Cross's paths could match in their common purpose, but I fear it might need a development like that to keep the series going. I quite enjoyed this blockbuster but in many ways it did have a sense of déjà-vu about it, although given the central character's identity problems, maybe I shouldn't be complaining."

"jmcd2007","7","0","1","7 December 2014"," A Decent Film Coming From An Outstanding Series
","First off, like many others, I was also surprised to hear that the producers were moving forward with the Bourne series without Damon at the helm. However, unlike the Bond films, which have seen a countless amount of actors take over the same role from each other, the Bourne series takes a very different turn here, although the plot is similar to the previous films. Jeremy Renner, who offers a fine performance here, is introduced as agent Aaron Cross a.k.a. Kenneth James Kitsom, who is a member of the black ops program ""Operation Outcome."" However, once Operation Treadstone and Operation Blackbriar are publicly exposed, thanks to Jason Bourne's actions in the previous installments, Cross finds himself pitted against the very organization that he thought was once on his side. Along the way, he meets biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing, played by Rachel Weisz, who in all honesty, slightly overacts her role at times. Cross and Shearing end up traveling to the Philippines to obtain the ""chems"" (medication) needed for Cross to survive...a part of the film in which I'm still trying to figure out, but is explained in further detail in a deleted scene that should've really remained in the film for that purpose. Granted, there are ""flashbacks"" that show what looks to be a tortured Aaron Cross speaking to some sort of government official or mercenary, but they could've done a better job in explaining that situation more thoroughly, because it left me with more questions than answers there.<br/><br/>Bourne's presence in the film is minimal, as are certain characters from previous films such as Noah Vosen and Pamela Landy. In this film, both Vosen and Landy are in hot water with the government after the Bourne situation and end up testifying over the matter. Moreover, although Damon does not officially star in this film, his character's presence is primarily limited to word of mouth and pictures, as despite revealing earlier on in the film that Bourne has been spotted in New York City, he is never found.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising, if not darkest part of ""The Bourne Legacy"" is the murder-suicide scene, which takes place in Dr. Marta Shearing's biochemist lab. One of Shearing's supposed co-workers, Dr. Donald Foite, abandons his post, opens fire and kills up to five of his co-workers before turning the gun on himself once security arrives. He manages to kill everyone except Dr. Shearing, in which we also learn that he had a possible secret obsession with her, which is why he may have let her live.<br/><br/>The film also features impressive scenery as well, with my personal favorite location being Alaska. In the beginning of the film, Cross was there for a training exercise, where he goes ""off the grid"" to meet up with exiled Outcome operative ""Number Three"" in a log cabin.<br/><br/>Finally, although there is less action in this film when compared to previous installments, it still satisfies. Despite having a 2 hr. 15 min. running time, this film did more than enough in keeping my attention.<br/><br/>For anyone that already misses Damon as Jason Bourne, fear not, for he he is reprising his role as Jason Bourne, with Paul Greengrass returning as director, in 2016 for the fifth film. However, it has also been suggested that Jeremy Renner will be returning as Aaron Cross as well, so the next installment should certainly make for an interesting film."

","Lacking the stylistic visual flair, kinetic action, highly charged atmosphere, sense of urgency, hyperactive camera, cut-throat editing & almost everything that made The Bourne Trilogy an intensely entertaining ride of non-stop thrills, The Bourne Legacy is an uninspiring & unnecessary fourth chapter that's quite inferior to its predecessors and doesn't even have Jason Bourne in it.<br/><br/>Taking place concurrently with the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, the story of The Bourne Legacy concerns Aaron Cross; an assassin-in-training for CIA who goes on the run for his life after the clandestine exposure of their operations in previous movies forces the secret agency to shut down all active operations & terminate every associated member within it with immediate effect.<br/><br/>With Paul Greengrass not returning to direct, it's the screenwriter of The Bourne Trilogy who takes over the directional duties but completely forgets what made the previous films work as Tony Gilroy ends up taking too much time in setting up the premise which took away the spontaneity & urgency for which the Bourne series was known for. Gilroy does show capability as a director but he still has a long way to go.<br/><br/>Those who disliked Greengrass' frenetic shooting style in previous films might be able to sit through this one as camera movements are much more relaxed but then its story nevertheless remains a tedious affair & the lazy editing certainly doesn't help the cause. The action sequences are too less, drama is mostly dull & the film kind of overstays its welcome in the end but at least the climactic action sequence was cool, even if short-lived.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast mainly comprises of Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton with Renner playing Aaron Cross, at which he turned out to be quite brilliant. Both Weisz & Norton are certainly capable of delivering better performances than their contribution in this film. And to be honest, Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is severely missed in this one and only after watching this film can one estimate just how important Damon is to this franchise.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Bourne Legacy marks a massive drop in quality when compared to previous films and even though it doesn't add anything to the legacy of Jason Bourne, it fortunately doesn't end up tarnishing it too. Slow, convoluted & underwhelming, The Bourne Legacy is certainly not a sequel that fans of The Bourn Trilogy deserved. Worth skipping if you'd like to."
"tkubas1","6","0","3","3 September 2013"," Ehh, not so good.
","First things first, let me tell you about my history with the Bourne series. I can't say I'm the biggest fan. I thought the first movie was great and I liked the two sequels. As far as where Legacy would rank, I'd have to say at the bottom. That doesn't mean it's a bad film, just not up to snuff with the whole series.<br/><br/>Let me start with the positive. The film starts with our new hero Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) on some type of survival mission on a snowy mountain. He has to trek through deep snow all the while avoiding wolves that are on his trail. During the first 45 minutes or so I thought this movie had potential to be great. Jeremy Renner was very solid acting wise. He actually had some personality, unlike the stone faced Jason Bourne before him. His character in this movie has to take pills in order to enhance his strength and intelligence. Aaron Cross can jump a little higher and movie a little faster than normally possible. This helps him a lot when he fighting hand to hand, and makes it just a little more interesting to watch. I'd also like to mention an impressive scene in which Cross has to clear a house of hostile enemies to save someone. The hand to hand combat was awesome. Cross uses his enhanced intelligence to outsmart his enemies with ambushes. My favorite part was when he was on the bottom floor and he ran outside and vaulted on to the roof. He then went inside the window into the top floor and outflanked the gunmen. If you're just in the mood for some Bourne style action I would tentatively recommend this movie to you.<br/><br/>Now for the negative. For how much I liked the action oriented scenes at the beginning, the scenes at the end were somewhat rehashed and uninteresting. It seems that the director thought that since this was in the Bourne series it was okay to have Aaron Cross do most of the same stunts. We have a car chase, foot chase, and a motorcycle chase. Although they all looked good and were well executed, I couldn't shake the generic feeling. I think the problem was that they were trying to make Aaron Cross exactly like Bourne. He's not as cool as Bourne though, so I ended up thinking Bourne rip off more than Bourne sequel. Another problem was the acting. Aside from Jeremy Renner I found the cast of characters to be uninspired and boring. Rachel Weisz was all over the place. In the aforementioned house scene she was laughably bad. The rest of the movie her performance was average. I was thoroughly annoyed by Edward Norton's character. In every scene all he does is spit out orders in rapid succession with a scowl on his face. The villains are extremely forgettable. They're basically just nameless government agents.<br/><br/>If you don't expect it to live up the legacy of the other Bourne movies then you might enjoy this one. Unfortunately I don't think that's what they meant with the title."
"dmc101","5","0","3","17 August 2013"," Bourne Dead
","As a stand alone movie, this would have been mediocre at best, however since it stole all of it's premises from the Bourne series, it needed to add to it and do so in a delicate way as to not muddy up the waters. It failed. From the trek across the mountains to the predictable close call at the cabin(when the lead guy has to leave suddenly, you know the place is about to go boom), to the house fire and the chase scenes in Manila, the movie wasn't a side story as much as a copycat. Didn't Jason have almost the same motorcycle event and wasn't there also a field agent after him during that event? At least Jason killed the guy, unlike Renner in this story who needed a woman to do it for him.<br/><br/>Aside from all that, the story didn't really have a point to make, I didn't get any sense of advancement from the film. From the beginning to the end it really didn't matter what happened because I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to Renner.<br/><br/>Of course there were far too many technical issues to get overcome like where Renner kept getting all that hardware throughout the movie, but then it's magic I suppose. At least Bourne had a lockbox somewhere. Also, they showed Damon's face as much as possible to try to lend credence to the film with a sporadic appearance from other actors who were in the Bourne series, but it made the movie more cheesy than interesting.<br/><br/>There's a trend now where terrible movies are made with great actors ""in"" them, but in reality the actor just makes a cameo or two and the rest of the movie is horrible nobody actors. It's just the last dying breaths of Hollywood before Netflix and HBO take over."

","The Bourne Legacy, then, is loads of fun in an efficient, straightforward way to which this franchise is not accustomed. (Some will take the reduction in convoluted spy-thriller antics as a sign of a dumbing-down, which might be true, but if so let's just say the sequel works on its own dumbed-down terms.) It's also, a little sadly, an illustration of the value of Matt Damon. Renner's a decent actor who does what's required of him here, but he doesn't have Damon's extraordinary mix of credibility and unshowy charisma. Picking up the slack a little is Edward Norton, who goes well beyond the call of duty to add nuance and human detail to a completely thankless role. His performance is emblematic of the approach here: apply uncommon craft and intelligence to a simple, crassly commercial conceit. The Bourne Legacy is worth your time to a surprising degree."
"Scarecrow-88","6","0","3","17 May 2013"," The Bourne Legacy
","I'm not sure what it was but this newest Bourne film felt a bit incomplete as the credits rolled. It felt every bit ""tune in next movie for the further adventures of"" instead of a Bourne film that might stand on its own without the necessity of seeing the next one coming down the pike in the future. I guess that was the whole point, but I wasn't satisfied with the whole although the visit to and action in Manila delivered plenty of suspense and roller coaster action. While Treadstone is trying to find and eliminate Jason Bourne, Eric Byer (Ed Norton) is commissioned by Mark Turso (Stacy Keach) to ""clean up"" anything dealing with super soldiers (humans genetically engineered with superior mental and physical abilities), including scientists and those men ""bio-engineered"". One such soldier is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), nearly blown to bits by a drone plane's missiles while ""training"" in the mountains of Canada (?). He discovers a beacon inserted in his leg, removes it, places it in the mouth of a bloodthirsty wolf, and watches as the next missile temporarily allows him to go undetected (Byer and the military personnel behind the drone plane attack believe the wolf was Cross). A scientist (Zeljko Ivanek), important in the genetic breakthrough that made Treadstone and Outcome such successes in the formation of human killing machines of amazing skills and strength, speed and agility, goes on a killing spree, mass shooting every scientist in the laboratory, almost succeeding except for Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who is saved by the security finally rescuing her in the nick of time. Byer will send agents in to execute Marta, but this time Cross comes to her aid, helping to remove the threat to her life. On the lam, Cross needs ""blues"" due to the worsening effects that happen to those like him experimented on; these pills help to retain the mental strength and hold off the psychotic effects that might come if left unabated. Marta believes she can help Cross ""viral out"" and maintain his mental prowess if she can get access to materials found in a lab in Manila. So Cross will try to help her do just that; all of this while Byer and all the tools and manpower available to him through Turso try to find him and Marta. There's an intense chase scene at the end where Cross and Marta attempt to circumvent Byer's plans to put them down one way or another. There's even a Manila ""soldier"" after them, with quite a race within the busy streets and highways of the Philippines as Cross and Marta, on motorcycle, try to evade their pursuers (the police and super soldier). Lots of close calls in tight spaces between vehicles and avoiding traffic all around them. Really cool ""climb"" scenes where Cross scales buildings and walks across rooftops with relative ease as if simian. I thought Weisz was very good (no surprise), put through the ringer, and Renner has a kind face that is unable to contain emotion unlike Damon's Bourne who could often mask the inner emotional struggles within his psyche and keep in check the baggage that existed and haunted him. Still, saying that, this film never quite hit that sweet spot so typical of all three of the previous Bourne films. Cross' back story is hinted at in bits and pieces; we know that Byer was once in charge of him in the Middle East, and that through great agonies suffered, Cross wanted to be part of the super soldier program. But Cross' moral rationale of what his superiors stand and are responsible for is ultimately what pushes him to question even early on Treadstone and Outcome's ultimately agenda and endgame. While there was a strong sense of realism even though Bourne's fighting skills and superb intellect and ability to adjust to any situation quickly were superior, The Bourne Legacy is even more outlandish and far-fetched, using science as the means to create a superhero. This feels the most like a comic book character created in a lab; Aaron Cross might as well have been bitten by a spider or doused with peculiar radiation. This stretches credibility to the max. Like when, all of a sudden, Cross can take out men in a matter of seconds after Marta injects him with a viral cocktail that seems to immediately turn him into a fighting machine. It's awesome to watch, but this bit of sudden violence asks us to accept that science can provide much in quick order. I guess we need to look at this film as a beginning of something ""better"" later, because I never felt The Bourne Legacy quite reached its full potential. This does leave open a Matt Damon return if he felt so inclined."

","As a fan of the Bourne Trilogy (yes I'm standing by it, this film was that disappointing) I thought this film was another excuse just to make bank on the Bourne name before it became stale (Ultimatum was released in 2007 so it pushed the line). So when my father (the man who helped make me a fan of the series) asked me to see this with him, I was concerned about what I was going to see out of respect for him. Of course almost two hours later and they proved my theory to be correct and the list of flaws are endless. First off the plot. <br/><br/>Overall, the story itself wasn't that bad as it tells how the government recovered from the last film. Then we see Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) doing his thing and sadly, it doesn't make a lick of sense. It's obvious who he is but what he's doing and his interactions are poorly written at best. His story line was going in the right direction but like the rest of this film, just when things are going somewhere it falls flat. When he makes progress with his journey, it falls flat. Everything just falls flat. To give it credit, the connection with Rachael Weisz's character even makes sense and heck even how they ran into each other makes sense but unlike the films that precedes this one, it never picks up. <br/><br/>Then comes the action, the action sequences were average at best, none of the scenes were really intense with the exception of Matt Fewer's scene. This is what kept the last films as good as they were, once you saw Damon in action, you know it was for real.<br/><br/>Now the supporting characters, what made the Bourne trilogy so special was that the supporting characters were as well written and performed as Jason Bourne himself. This film like the last three followed the formula to the T. Ed Norton and Stacey Keach performed excellently as the government side of the show (we'll pretend that Norton didn't help give Keach this job due to American History X). Oscar Issacs did a good job as the Clive Owen of the film. Rachael Weisz, however, didn't perform as well as the rest of the crew and either it was from poor writing or just chemistry but it was obvious something was missing. But going back to the plot the characters just never seemed to connect and just when a breakthrough happens, the door closes and some no sense door opens which for me anyway ticked me off.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I don't want to say I'm shocked because of all the turmoil that made this movie happen. With Greengrass never being on board and Damon not being on board without Greeengrass, the signs were evident. Of course not wanting to disappoint a Studio Head, the film was green lighted anyway and it showed with the obviously rushed script. Even with the great performers in this film and the original Bourne director. Disaster couldn't be avoided and the only reason why this is a 7 and not a failure is that this film did go in the right direction and the effort was shown despite the disadvantages from the start."

","When i saw the title of this movie, I was very exited to such an extend that i watched all the first three parts first to maintain the continuity. But was extremely disappointed with the outcome of the movie. According to me it had no great plot or story. After watching the whole movie i just had one thought, why did the whole team even bothered to produce such a film. What was the point, it had no connection with all the previous Bourne Trilogy. Nothing to do with any of its plot or story, and the worst part was that some of the characters were immature, didn't liked there performance, Like others in the previous movies the Agents were looking as agents, but here they look like rookies..<br/><br/>To Sum it up: I will be thrilled if they use this move as a base for creating an actual Bourne 4th of 5th part in which we can see both the agents(Jeremy Renner and Matt Damon) working to gather to expose the projects or the whole CIA team, or some thing like that. Would love to see both of them working to gather.<br/><br/>Thank You for Taking time to read this. Have a Wounder full Day.."

","This movie begins similar to part I. A body underwater, arms spread. Suddenly the person reacts and fetches some object. It's Renner's character, Cross, somewhere in the mountains, running around, dealing with wolves, drawing blood from himself, and taking pills- a green one and a blue one.<br/><br/>Parallel to this we learn that given the events that are taking place in Bourne III, the government is about to be exposed and decide to shut it all down- Treadstone, Blackbriar, everything. In charge of it is Eric Byer, played by Norton. We see other subjects taking pills but their pills are switched to yellow ones that kill them. Also, at the lab that produces these pills, one of the researchers goes crazy and shoots everyone including himself, except for Dr. Marta who survives. She was in charge of dealing with the subjects of the research, including Cross.<br/><br/>These two stories are told in interspersed scenes. So you don't really know what is going on in either of them. The two stories finally merge when Cross makes it to a hut. Some other guy is there but he's rather strange and suspicious. Eventually a drone missile hits the hut but Cross barely makes it out and now he's out of pills. He has a chip implanted so the government knows he's out there and sends more drones after him till he removes the chip.<br/><br/>Now that he's gone dark he goes after the only person who can provide him with pills- Dr. Marta. He makes it in time because the CIA is already there and they don't have good intentions. Now that Cross and Marta join up, she explains what is happening to him. One pill is for his psychological enhancement, the other for his physical. He doesn't know it, but he actually doesn't need the physical one anymore, the enhancement is now permanent, in his genes, transported there by a virus. The psychological enhancement however is still pill-dependent, but could in theory also be made permanent. But to do that they have to travel to the Phillipines where the viruses are.<br/><br/>Sure enough, they go there but now the government has figured out what is going on and they send someone after him, which leads to a chase scene in Manila.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy has a story, it has the big names, but the direction is dismal. To waste an hour of Renner's character running around pointlessly in the wild is just dumb. Even the extended chase scene, first on foot and then on motorcycles is pretty dull. The only exciting stuff is the government trying to find out what is going on and trying to find Cross and Marta. Most disappointing is the complete lack of action. While Bourne could deliver his a super butt kicking in the blink of an eye, Cross doesn't get to to do a whole lot other than shoot and run around. The casting is also a bit problematic. Norton, just doesn't look, let alone, sound the part. He does what he can but he just doesn't fit the role of some secret soulless government big shot. On paper at least, it sounds like Renner would be an ideal Bourne-type character. But he's not into it. He lacks the edge and intensity that he had in The Hurt Locker and that made him such a compelling actor.<br/><br/>The concept of timing the events of this movie around the same time that the end of part III is taking place is pretty interesting. And the science behind this movie is also pretty good. What happens in the lab, in government offices is quite interesting, but then you get the scenes of Cross doing something somewhere that just completely kills the mood, so to speak. The whole Manila adventures is a bit forced. That the government would outsource something as sensitive as these medical experiments to a third world country is a bit of a stretch. But the global international character that the Bourne movies have is a good thing.<br/><br/>Given that the Bond movies have become bad versions of the Bourne movies is a great opportunity for the Bourne movies to get into Bond territory. Unfortunately, with the Bourne Legacy they've taken down things considerably. One can only hope that the next installment will resurrect one of the most exiting action franchises around. Just don't let Gilroy direct it. He sure can write a script, but directing isn't his strength."

","Hmmmm...I think I'm safe to say that this was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking forward to this when it was first announced, despite the slight inkling in the back of my mind that this will suck without the involvement of either Matt Damon or Paul Greengrass; I should've listened to that inkling. Not only does it lack the brains of the previous Bourne movies, it also lacks the brawn. The story is just a rehash of the basic premise of Identity; assassin goes in search of the people who have wronged him while trying to fill-in the gaps in his dodgy memory. Except this time, they added that horrendous twist about Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross and his contemporaries being genetically modified, giving them their enhanced abilities; and they have to take these drugs to maintain these abilities. Aaron Cross needs his meds so he goes in search for them while government types are trying to terminate the program that made him what he is. So basically it's a movie about a drug addict looking for his next score! Renner does his best with what he's been given, while Weisz is unconvincing as the scientist who's trying to help him; the problem here is that they have no chemistry, so whenever they're on-screen together it feels really uncomfortable and awkward. Ed Norton's character is kinda pointless. The pace of the movie is a bit flabby, while the previous movies were lean, taut, concise and tense, with plenty of action to help the flow of the movies; Legacy doesn't have any of that. The action scenes are few and far between, even when there's action, they're really just uninspired retreads of what's gone before. I think I'll suddenly develop amnesia on this one and forget that this travesty ever happened."

","I enjoyed The Bourne Legacy like I enjoyed the numerous appendices in the book, Lord of the Rings. You wouldn't want to watch this movie without first having watched the other three films more than once. You are always aware in the Bourne films that they are operating against a backdrop of other events. Legacy peels back one layer on some of those events. Just like Tolkien provided tons of back story for LOTR that ultimately became their own books, Legacy allows us to follow a parallel story line that amplifies the main story line of the Bourne films. Yes, we never get to know Aaron like we know Jason. Yes, the plot line is slight and the dialog limited. Yes, the motorcycle chase scene is a pale copy of the (fill in your favorite Bourne chase scene.) Yes, we have seen roof top chases before. So what? As a piece of entertainment it held my attention and I would like to see more more back story developed. Now that we know Pam Lundy is in big trouble for her role in Bourne's escape, maybe we can find out more about Aaron as the forces of black ops chase him across the globe. I'd pay $1.50 at Redbox and 2 hours of my time to see what happens next."

","Jeremy Renner has shot to stardom by inking himself to an array of successful franchises from, Mission Impossible to the Avengers. The Bourne series is yet another feather in his fluttering hat. Renner plays an operative who is supposed to be terminated along with the others as a result of the whole Jason Bourne fiasco. Renner however doesn't abide and with the help of Rachel Weisz, a doctor, he sets off on a personal mission to obtain the drugs to prevent a critical withdrawal. <br/><br/>With a heavyweight cast, which includes Ed Norton, Scott Glenn and Stacy Keach, The Bourne Legacy is equipped with all the tools it needs to add to the high octane Bourne Legacy, no pun intended. The story unwinds parallel to the Jason Bourne saga, which is clever and enjoyable for hardcore Bourne fans. There are the expected jaw dropping stunts, fights and chases to satisfy the action junkie in all of us. The story is also more of a stand-alone rather than an open-ended one meaning it's nicely tied up in a ribbon for viewers without the expectation for a sequel. Renner plays his role well but somewhat pales in comparison to Matt Damon and while director, Tony Gilroy certainly does justice to the franchise, The Bourne Legacy is more of a deserving sidekick to the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Action and Bourne fans alike should enjoy Legacy provided they don't go in expecting Jason Bourne."
"PartialMovieViewer","6","0","2","9 February 2013"," Another Good Installment
","So who is the best Bourne anyways – Chamberlain, Damon or Renner – who knows, who cares. This is not Bond – its Jason Bourne. I remember reading, 'The Bourne Identity', when it first came out in paperback. The book was great, but I saw no reason to continue the series after the first show. All three actors did a good job and threw their own personalities into the respective stories. I think the 'Legacy' was no more than a continuation of the original story. Let's see, bad ole government project runs amok and a few bad apples try to cover up their mistakes. Bourne is the only smidgen of goodness left in the entire intelligence community and he will make decades of bad – turn to good – during the final five minutes of the movie. The stories about Jason are pretty much all the same. I mean I expect that from a Bourne Movie, no more, no less. Bottom line, the quality of a Bourne flick can only be measured by how well the obvious is executed. That being said, I liked the movies about Jason Bourne, including this one. Matt Damon was fun to watch, Richard Chamberlain was the first and he did an interesting job and Jeremy Renner did a very good job. If they plan to string this story on for some more episodes, I think Renner is an excellent choice to carry the torch. Good movie"

","It is a bit depressing, seems too many movies nowadays just substitute lots of chase scenes to compensate for lazy scripts. This one fills that bill. The actors are fine, there just isn't a lot to work with.<br/><br/>To start with the definition, LEGACY - "" something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past "" . So, since this is a Bourne legacy, it must pertain to something Jason Bourne ""transmitted."" I suppose that makes sense, of a sort, after Bourne escaped in the last movie, a decision was made to eradicate the remaining 9 in the experimental operative program.<br/><br/>In fact, as the writer/director explains in the extra on the DVD, the first part of this movie (in fictional time) overlaps with the last part of the last Bourne movie, that is why they had a short reference to Jason Bourne escaping.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is the experimental operative, Aaron Cross, that this story focuses on. He is out in the Alaska snowy wilderness in a training exercise when he is being hunted down from Washington by use of a remotely controlled, weaponized drone. But he manages to figure out what is happening in time to escape unharmed. This just intensifies the chase. <br/><br/>The chase is being led by Edward Norton as Retired Col. Eric Byer, USAF. Now I like Norton, but here I never found him believable in that role.<br/><br/>Cross eventually crosses paths with Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing , a principal investigator in the experimental program. They forge a bond and together travel the world attempting to get him reverted to normal.<br/><br/>As I said, there are too many long chase scenes trying to compensate for a mediocre story, and the biggest disappointment to me was the very last one. A super operative has been pressed into action to hunt down Cross, and he does, but they are involved in a motorcycle chase. I was looking forward to some sort of fantastic final hand-to-hand combat, but no ... the super operative simply crashes into a steel post and obliterates himself. It was a good result, for Cross, but a bit anticlimactic."

You either replace the lead actor and continue on or you somehow shift the focus of the movie onto another character. How hard can it be to find a director to replace another when the series is already a guaranteed payday?<br/><br/>Universal Pictures made good decisions all the way around with ""The Bourne Legacy."" Instead of concentrating on the character of Jason Bourne, they altered the center of attention to other agents affected by the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs. Enter Aaron Cross, played by newly established action star Jeremy Renner (""Avengers"").<br/><br/>Instead of just replacing Paul Greengrass with some other random director, they chose to go with someone very familiar with the series. Tony Gilroy co-wrote all the other ""Bourne"" films and stepped in to helm and pen the latest entry. He did an acceptable job balancing these two enormous jobs.<br/><br/>I love a great action movie. I also love a good spy thriller. It makes perfect sense that a movie like ""The Bourne Legacy"" would appeal to me. For the most part it did.

He doesn't lean on a crutch of CGI like so many of these action films do these days. It reminds me of the newer James Bond films. When you see Daniel Craig and Jeremy Renner jump onto the ledge of a building or cliff and slam into it, you know it hurt. You don't look at the scene and go, ""They used a miniature for that or digitally enhanced it.""<br/><br/>""The Bourne Legacy"" does get bogged down at times with plot-pushing dialogue, but you can't really fault filmmakers for wanting to give the audience something with substance.

Its bad film but not too bad, the action is good especially at the chasing scene, when they use motorcycle, its the best part of this film. This film its very difficult to understand, I thought so hard when I watched this movie. Before I watch this movie, I think that this movie is great and I expect very high because the previous film is very good and interesting. But now I disappointed. The worst part of this film is the end part that's not clear for me.<br/><br/>At last, I want to say sorry if I make mistakes in my grammar or vocabulary, because my English is not good. I'm just try. Thanks!"

","In the midst of the turmoil caused by rogue agent Jason Bourne the whole secret intelligence community in the United States is thrown into turmoil. In an attempt to minimise blow-back various shady CIA directors (or whatever other secretive entities they represent) attempt to clean house. Including the updated version of the Blackbriar and Treadstone programmes - Opration Outcome. Enhanced by a mix of drugs and training, which creates super-soldier black ops Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and his like are the next generation, one however that has been signed off for disposal due to the Bourne misgivings. Managing to survive the initial attack Cross is now on course for vengeance, but simultaneously must access the drug mix, else he is destined to change back into the semi-imbecilic farm-boy he was prior to the programme. He therefore seeks the aid of geneticist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who administered him the drugs in an earlier phase of Outcome.<br/><br/>""Bourne Legacy"" took a shot at replicating the appeal of the original trilogy, arguably the best spy action movie franchise ever. Losing Matt Damon was sure to hit hard, but sincerest attempts were made to reinstate vigour with a new front man with a strikingly similar visage: Jeremy Renner. Nonetheless Renner lacks the same magnetic and boyish charm of Damon, making him a more distant hero, thus less instantaneously accessible. Despite best attempts to pump up the support cast with Edward Norton, Albert Finney or Rachel Weisz (all gifted with clichéd one-dimensional characters), the protagonist typecast is key. And Jeremy Renner feels like a sub-par clone of the original. Unfortunately script is additionally at fault, as one of the key appeals of the franchise was Jason Bourne's ability to stoically wriggle out of the most complex oppression.<br/><br/>The intricate real-time getaways fronted by Matt Damon made any plot holes or substandard dialogue secondary, thus making the Bourne trilogy classic irrespective of script frailties. Alex Cross lacks the same sort of calm presence under fire, while the escapes lack the same ingenious collected complexity. Stitching it all together ""Bourne Legacy"" turns out to be a substandard action flick without the unrelenting charm it supposes to re-imagine. Bourne fans basically expect more of the same, but the Gilroy brothers seem incapable of delivering anything outside of standard explosive fare, despite obvious attempts to rehash everything the Paul Greengrass managed so perfectly."

","I'll start by saying I LOVE Rachel Weisz. She completely saved this movie. I'm not a fan of the lead guy, can't remember his name, don't care to.<br/><br/>The whole movie just went on too long and really had no major point to it. The link to The Bourne movies was pretty weak. It may have been better to make this a movie all of its own and condense it down to 85mins. That may have worked.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, if you have nothing to do one evening and you're relatively bored then give it a go. But be warned - by the time the ending comes around you'll wonder what on earth happened."
"eshwarmail","4","0","2","22 December 2012"," It made sure there cannot be further extension to the already elongated yarn
","The first 20 minutes screenplay and acting in an attempt to be intriguing turns out to be rather pretentious, boring and cringe worthy. Only similarity I could find with the Bourne trilogy is the generous use of the words 'Jason Bourne', 'Treadstone' and the end credits soundtrack featuring 'Extreme Ways' but features none of the marquee elements such as the frenetic photography and editing, brutal hand-to-hand combat or the nail biting screenplay. The initial moments between Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner starts out to be exciting but ends up being generic and run-of-the-mill eventually.<br/><br/>Number 5 (Jeremy Renner) is an asset under training of a secretive superspy development program called 'Outcome' similar to 'Treadstone'. All the agents under training are dependent on physical and mental enhancement genetic cell alteration drugs that keep them together who undergo periodic full evaluation based on their blood samples. Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is a senior doctor in a facility that coordinates and research on the enhancement drugs. When an arbitrary incident triggers a paranoia in the top brass on a possibility of media exposure, Eric (Edward Norton) takes charge to suspend these operations which includes termination of all the agents and people associated with it systematically. Number 5 and Marta are survivors of different incidents and together goes off the grid.<br/><br/>Using Bourne as a context might add weight to box office opening but also increases the expectation level which is where this one fails miserably. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are no doubt competent actors, but after an initial burst of an intense scene together they become rather monotonous. Edward Norton as a star definitely adds weight but was missing as an actor. A similar theme has been done in many other movies, some done a lot better and convincingly - so this one hardly has a chance to standout. The bloated runtime, seen it before ending does not help either.<br/><br/>It made sure there cannot be further extension to the already elongated yarn"

","Up to now, I'd only seen ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", which I didn't find to be all that great. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is even lower. I will admit that I liked the stuff about all the connections all over the world, but most of the movie seemed like a series of improbable action sequences (whether involving wolves or motorcycles). The plot itself was too convoluted to make any sense.<br/><br/>Yes, I know. This was never intended to be any sort of intellectual movie, so why complain about the ridiculous action sequences? Well, there are times when the action can get too far out, and this is one of those times. The fact that the movie got made is more evidence that Hollywood is stuck on sequels and remakes. The cast didn't need to waste themselves on this."

","This latest Bourne movie is a fast paced action packed movie with incredible chase scenes and clever situations and escapes. I thought the actors were all decent and convincing in their roles. For those of you that love fast paced action, violence, and fans of the Bourne movie series I suspect you'll find this movie is everything you want and hope for. But for those of us that would like a storyline that actually makes sense and is moderately easy to follow, well then this one fails to deliver on those lines. When watching this I kept telling myself that this will all make sense eventually, that the plot will come clear soon, and that all the pieces will fit. Unfortunately I find those essential elements of movie making were not present in this one. There was a lot to like about this movie, but there was also a lot to dislike. I wish the producers and script writers would of done a better job of plot development, had they done so this movie would rate way better than just mediocre."

","The first three Bourne movies have to be my favorite non-superhero action trilogy. Associating this one with the Bourne name kinda cheapens the franchise for me.<br/><br/>The first 30 mins or so of the movie feels like a we are watching ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego"" only its ""Where in the World is Jason Bourne"". We see traces of him (ie his name etched in wood) but rather then add some sense of mystery or intrigue it only seems to highlight what the movie is lacking...Jason Bourne. <br/><br/>A lot of the same actors are here and I must say its an incredible cast. Edward Norton, Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz are new and really I couldn't ask for better additions. Jeremy Renner I loved in The Hurt Locker and Edward Norton is one of my all time favorite actors. However, it doesn't seem that Tony Gilroy, who has written the screenplays for all the Bourne movies but takes his first crack at directing one here, really know how to coax the best performances out of his actors. Especially at the beginning I couldn't help but feel the ever so subtle sense that I was watching actors act. Even the actors that played the same role in the previous titles seemed just a little more 1 dimensional then before. Jeremy Renner is the exception though. His performance is great and pretty much caries the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot felt a bit contrived as though it was created to milk some more money out of the Bourne name. There are some really cool chase scenes and some good action once the movie gets going. If you just want to see action this movie does it really well. Having been in Manila at the time this movie was being filmed there and being offered the chance to be an extra it was pretty cool to recognize several areas."
"aajohnm","3","0","2","9 December 2012"," Doesn't measure up
","Although not following the Ludlum stories, the Matt Damon Bourne character was believable and empathetic. I wanted him to succeed and take out the bad guys. I didn't feel that connection with this character. Also, isn't he a bit old for the part? One of the best characters in the original trilogy was Pam Landy. Smart, tough, courageous. No one in this movie comes up to that standard. I think this was bad casting all the way around. It shouldn't even be called a Bourne movie - there was just too much class in the Damon character for this one to measure up. I think maybe I'll just go watch the original trilogy again, it's been a while."

","Another film, based (loosely) on the books, but without Jason Bourne (Matt Damon would make this movie, but as they exchanged the director, who was to be the one of the original trilogy, he refused). <br/><br/>Basically the film deals with events that occur parallel to those occurring in The Bourne Ultimatum, where the Program Outcome, on which super-agents are created with chemical and genetic changes are eliminated one by one - the protagonist this time is Aaron Cross, trying to survive, helping a project scientist, persecuted in the files burning. <br/><br/>The film is a little slow in the start, but half an hour from the start , we have more action: the action, though not as engaging as the original movies is very good, but the dense and catchy plot that held the original trilogy is lost in this side-story, that still leaves a hook for more sequences.

The first 30 minutes or so, for example, were very tardy and dull. Flashbacks/dreams are often confusing, difficult to distinguish from the beginning. The ending is too sudden and ""open"".<br/><br/>Edvard Norton, Albert Finney and Rachel Weisz provided an additional value to the movie as well - thanks to actors I gave my 7 points.

","What would you do if the American intelligence community was hunting you? Would you surrender or simply find a dark hole to hide in? Aaron Cross, the main character of the film, doesn't have those options.<br/><br/>While the Central Intelligence Agency is in turmoil after the release of confidential Treadstone documents, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is an agent of Treadstone's successor, Operation Outcome. Cross (Renner) is on a training mission in Alaska and arrives at a remote cabin to rendezvous and restock on medications he's taking for reasons that we're not made aware of. In the cabin, he meets another agent named Number Three (played by Oscar Isaac). Their ultimate supervisor, Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton) decides Outcome and the agents in the program are a liability and send a predator drone to destroy the remote Alaskan cabin while activating kill switches in other operatives stationed around the world. After removing his tracking device, Cross force feeds it to a wolf that had been stalking him for reasons beyond understanding and begins his quest for more medication. Elsewhere, at a pharmaceutical company's headquarters, a gunman murders all of his coworkers, with the exception of Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) and then turns the gun on himself. Shearing is understandably shaken after watching one of her coworkers murder all of the others and goes home. The Agency sends a team to Shearing's home to assess her mental state, and assure themselves that she won't reveal confidential information. At least, that's how they got in the door. Once inside, however, they reveal their true purpose, eliminating one more witness who could testify about Outcome. Their attempt is thwarted by Cross and, next thing you know, he and Shearing are on the run together.<br/><br/>Now, during press interviews for The Bourne Ultimatum, Matt Damon said that, while he might reprise the role of Jason Bourne sometime in the distant future, he and Paul Greengrass might have to call the next one The Bourne Redundancy. After seeing this film, I believe that should've been the title. Renner had already established himself as an action star and Rachel Weisz is capable, as always. That said this movie takes all the loose ends tied off by the previous films, unties them, and leaves even more simply to allow for the possibility of a sequel. Unless and until Greengrass and Damon reunite for a new film, I'll consider Ultimatum the last film in the Bourne series. Skip it."

There is Edward Norton who is looking after the clean up and elimination of any loose end. The stage is set for thrilling chases and action. This is not a sequel to the trilogy in the original sense of the word. The events here are happening at nearly the same time as the Bourne Ultimatum. It takes a while to understand the story and become oriented with it. This has been criticized as an unnecessary sequel. However, if the aim of the director was to entertain then he largely succeeds. Renner is believable. Weisz only gets to be hysterical. Norton looks and acts the part but still was wasted. The action scenes are few but are well choreographed.

","I have not watched this movie yet but I can all really say that this movie will be a disappointment fully. First off the first three bourne movies was great and fantastic. They had a plot all of them and each one started where the other ended. The last one I knew was not the last of the serious because it stated that Bourne was shot but the body was not found. When I heard this movie was coming out way before it was announced I thought wow Jason is back awesome. Then when I found out that it was different then the other movies in the serious I was let down badly. I think that perhaps this movie would be a great hit if given a new name rather then trying to add a new movie to the serious where it does not belong. Anyways I will watch this film today and then decide for my self if this is a hit or just worthless. I will ask that those that write the scripts and all that try and be some what original next time around. We watch to see a movie that is good not worthless."
"medea05","5","0","2","30 November 2012"," Disappointing
","I can't say that I hated this movie - in fact, I gave it a 5 out of ten. It was just really disappointing and did not, in my opinion, live up to the hype.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because I'm a huge fan of the Bourne trilogy (and I don't really care whether or not they have been criticised by the actors in them - I judge films on their own merit). I find those films to be pretty perfect for what they are - tense spy thrillers, in which the action doesn't overshadow the plot. Each film is set and was filmed in locations which are obviously not sound-stages - the use of location work in Geneva, London, Moscow, Berlin, Tunisia, New York really grounds the movies in the real world, contrasting nicely with the almost science fictional premise of brainwashing and identity removal.<br/><br/>But back to the film I'm actually supposed to be reviewing. First off we get introduced to the idea that Aaron Cross is dependent on drugs to turn him into a super-soldier type - and the entire movie hinges on that, on him recovering the drugs, getting other drugs, getting off the drugs, going to the factory where they produce the drugs and so on and so forth. I really felt I was baited-and-switched by the trailers for this movie. None of the trailers gave me the impression that this was going to be such a major plot point - and yes, I know that in the Bourne trilogy the major point was Jason's identity and the agency that made him what he was. But it never felt so reductive as it does in this movie.<br/><br/>As regards the characters and actors . . . eh. Jeremy Renner was good, but then he always is. All the others did their best, but the script wasn't giving them much to work with. And I resent the summary way Pam Landy was gotten rid off. I'm trying to find a way to say that Rachel Weisz was too beautiful for her role without seeming churlish, but she really really was. In the previous movies, the female characters were conventionally attractive (just like most of the male characters) without being stunningly, head-turningly beautiful. This was really too much - coupled with the banal action scenes, this made what could have been a tense thriller into Action Movie Plot No. 15.<br/><br/>Finally, the action scenes. Oh dear. The set piece inside the house was good . . . kind of. It was definitely skirting the edges of over-the- top, but in the same way as the scene in the stairwell in The Bourne Identity. The set-piece on the motorbike, on the other hand, was terrible. Overlong, overdrawn, pointless - the best action, in a movie, is there to serve the plot, not the other way round. It very much reminded me of the motorbike chase scene in Terminator 2, which had a point, that of showing us how versatile and indestructible the T-1000 was. What was the point of this? That the guy chasing him was secretly a Terminator, and Outcome is a branch of Skynet? Come on.<br/><br/>While I love the Bourne movies and re-watch them often, this just made me tired. And bored. I love Jeremy Renner, but even he can't save this movie - I prefer watching him in the limited screen time he has in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol than this. At least in that movie he wasn't a junkie looking for a fix."

","This movie seemed to lack any sense of plot whatsoever. It started in the place it began: nowhere.

I respect the new actors and I realize that Matt Damon is too busy to spend his time on this project. But if he had, it might have been a better movie. The action is intense and will probably keep you at the edge of your seat. But it really doesn't do much in terms of good movie-making. The entire movie is predictable in the way every action movie is predictable. If you like action movies, you may like this film.

"TheMovieSnob247","5","0","3","17 October 2012"," It has the action of the original trilogy, but lacks the soul.
","I'll admit I'm a HUGE fan of the original trilogy, so this review maybe a bit biased (hey, at least I'm honest about it). I'm indifferent with Renner as Bourne, didn't love him, didn't hate him. His performance just didn't resonate with me. However, he did a great job with fight scenes (and this movie has plenty of solid, well choreographed action shots). But at times the action was just too much and over the top. *Slight Spoiler*: (There's a bike chase scene that was just so implausible it had me laughing. I was just waiting for the other agent chasing him to say ""I'll be back"" or ""have you seen this boy?"" ala Terminator. I never felt that way watching the original Bourne films; they never seemed so outlandish).<br/><br/>The film seems less interested in telling you who this agent is and more interested in him kicking ass. Nothing wrong with that per say, but I thought what separated the original Bourne films from other vanilla action movies and the pre-Daniel Craig Bond movies and was that you actually cared about Damon's character; who he was, what happened to him and his quest for the truth. Yes, Damon's Bourne kicked ass, but the character also had some depth. In my opinion this Bourne seems less human; I never really connected to his character or his story and the film suffers greatly because of it.<br/><br/>I found Weisz's character to be a bit annoying and she dragged on too much about the science behind the program. And there was very little chemistry between them, if any. Really, a forgettable performance by both actors who are usually pretty good. All in all an OK time at the movies, but definitely below the bar set by the original trilogy. I wish Hollywood would just leave a good thing alone sometimes.

"Dr_Coulardeau","7","0","4","6 October 2012"," It could have been so much better structured
","This film is in the perfect continuity of the first three in the series by its title which has the same structure as the first three. But I am disappointed in a way.<br/><br/>The action is probably perfect though it is only an escape and not a chase to impose a positive end, only to get away from those who are chasing you. That's weak. For sure we have Manilla and the cars, the motorbikes, the hunt on the roofs and even a long hike in Alaska. I must say that the wolves are superb animals and that it is a shame so many are killed. Though a drone and a missile for one wolf seems slightly expensive.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but unexplained at all. The secret security services of the USA have set up several programs to fight against terrorism, each one of them totally entangled into the others but with one probably slightly more central than the others. A hostile foreign agency that is not identified is trying to get this program and this program has a fair chance to get out because the main people who devised it are not under control. So the decision is taken to destroy the program and to get rid of all those who have been in touch with it, no matter how little.<br/><br/>The worst part is that even the uniformed generals (note the only one that is brought up is black: no allusion to the president that we all know to be powerless) do not know about the situation and it is a handful of bureaucrats of these security agencies that have no public front who take decisions and implement the decisions they take under absolutely no control from whoever you may imagine. The President is not even mentioned. In other words they are, these bureaucrats a state in the sate. The USA have reinvented ,the KGB, the STASI, and those had a public front, even the SS was not completely invisible.<br/><br/>Unluckily this theme has already been explored vastly in the genre over the last fifty years.<br/><br/>It goes slightly further when we learn that this program aimed at producing super human people who did not feel pain, who had an IQ over 200 and who were as strong as aliens. These prototypes were nine and are still six and they have to be eliminated along with all the people who worked on this program. These prototypes were produced by some genetic manipulation of viruses or retroviruses to change the human genome of the individuals who are infected with these genetically modified viruses. But here again that has been used and overused, some could say abused, over the last fifty years in all media imaginable.<br/><br/>To amplify this lack of originality we have to regret the very editing of the film that lines up short sequences that have no relation whatsoever one to the other, no ellipse possible, and that do not make sense for at least a good fourth of the film. This is also quite surprising and disappointing. Jason Bourne had made sure in the previous films that we should know the targets and agents, who is who from the very start and to have a real objective that brought down these security bureaucrats and gave decisional power back to those elected and appointed for that under the strict control of the Senate.<br/><br/>That explains my slight disappointment.

It has appeared to bask under the limelight of earlier films. Some scenes seems impossible like a man riding a bike after being shot on the left shoulder. Seems more like a prequel to Resident Evil. Government conducting clandestine experiments by infecting people with viruses to make super soldiers. Now all that's left is for Tony Gilroy and Paul Anderson to team up.

","The title Legacy is understandable because it truly wants to emulate the original book trilogy storyline and everything it has achieved. at the same time it also hinges the story too much on the book's dynamics when it is actually playing different characters and thus different dynamics in the process. that is perhaps the tragedy of this initial salvo movie that is envisioned to continue the momentum of the Bourne movies and build it into a sustainable franchise like James bond or something.<br/><br/>however i beg to disagree that film is a complete failure. although it lacks the urgency and mystique that the Damon films have, it is mostly so because of the fact that it indeed it is a spin off. almost everybody that watched it is a Jason Bourne fan. Aaron cross is a completely different character whose nuances is definitely applied by the performance of Jeremy Renner and not Damon. whoever is expecting a duplication is utterly misplaced.<br/><br/>yes yes the suspect must be the story. the story struggles to connect this new take to the very successful trilogy. i think it did but far from perfecting it. the Edward Norton character as one critic rightfully pointed out should have been critical to making this story be far better that it was. instead, Norton played a character who tries to be consequential but comes short. if only they had something as edgy as Pamela Landy was in the Bourne trilogy.<br/><br/>so the film was imperfect. i don't know if Robert Loodlum had any hand in developing this story but whoever made this succeeds in laying down some ground work for future films to come out but fails to establish it enough to serve as a credible springboard. The good news is the next film would then have the maximum space it needs to work on a much better plot and more coherent use of characters within a storyline."
"ZChrisJ1995","6","0","4","28 September 2012"," Not really a Bourne film...
","If you're looking for a prime example of an unnecessary sequel, look no further. Though Edward Norton's Byer states that ""Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg"", The Bourne Legacy, instead of going beneath the surface and exploring more of the story, chips away at a completely different iceberg, and in the end has very little to do with the original trilogy of Bourne films.<br/><br/>Brief clips and flashes from The Bourne Ultimatum incorporated in here reveal that due to Jason Bourne's actions, shady government organisations must terminate all evidence of Treadstone and Outcome operations, including test subjects, in order to escape exposure. One such target is Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, who is now meant to be Matt Damon's successor in the franchise. Here most of the similarities between the original films and Legacy cease, and the film starts to go off in its own direction. Cross must now evade assassination and find specific ""chems"", pills that allow him to retain his physical and mental superiority.<br/><br/>Though Renner in recent years has proved himself as a formidable action star through the likes of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Avengers, he is by no means Jason Bourne, and the film consequently is left with an evident Matt Damon-shaped empty space. Likewise, Rachel Weisz's love interest, as opposed to Franka Potente and Julia Stiles, doesn't do much but stand there and scream for the majority of her screen time. This is a shame, as both actors have proved themselves over the years as being quite skilled in their craft, but unfortunately they have been thrown into unsuitable roles. Likewise, whilst Joan Allen and Albert Finney (veterans of the previous films) make appearances, they could have had a much more significant screen presence. Edward Norton, as well, feels significantly underused.<br/><br/>The gritty, 'shaky-cam' cinematography utilised by Paul Greengrass is sorely missed in this film, thereby depriving The Bourne Legacy of its sense of realism, effectively giving it the appearance of just another action movie. Whilst the set-pieces in the previous film's were at least moderately plausible, action scenes in Legacy seem just plain silly. For example, Cross forces a large, vicious wolf to swallow a tracking device before it is annihilated by a military drone. It is also has a hideously anti-climatic ending, especially seeing the amount of plot points and twists that it sets up.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, The Bourne Legacy is not a bad film. The story itself is quite riveting and exhilarating, and some of the action scenes, such as an intense motorbike chase through the streets of Manila, are amongst some of the best I've seen in recent years. The problem is that the Bourne Legacy, though standing by itself as a component action film, doesn't have a significant role or position in the Bourne series. Whilst Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum are a succinct, well-structured and written series of films that are a unique addition to the spy sub-genre, Legacy feels out of place, and in many ways inferior in comparison, not to mention having little to do with the other films. It would have been much better if they retitled the film completely, for instance calling it The Cross Conspiracy, and severed it from The Bourne franchise.<br/><br/>The Bourne Legacy, despite being a decent action/thriller film in its own right, lives in the shadow of its predecessors, and suffers from the absence of Matt Damon. It is a prime example of a studio trying to milk a successful franchise, and though it should be viewed for its interesting storyline and its substantial action, should not be considered a serious addition to the Bourne series.<br/><br/>6/10"
"lethalweapon","4","0","7","7 September 2012"," Not in the same league as Bourne. And works even less as a stand alone movie.
","I wouldn't call it awful... It had a few moments here and there - I especially went 'wow' over a 10 second clip where the hero climbs up to the second floor window to take out an assassin, shot seamlessly and in one shot - and Renner's performance is pretty solid.... but overall, it's kinda ironic that they named the movie 'The Bourne Legacy', cos it kinda disgraces the Legacy of the Bourne trilogy.<br/><br/>The Bourne trilogy was one of the greatest trilogies of all time, in my opinion, and only recently lost out the spot to Nolan's Batman franchise on that count recently. Some people say - don't compare it with the first three movies. But there are two problems with that. First, they ASKED for the comparison when they took on the Bourne name. Secondly, the plot is intricately linked to some events in The Bourne Ultimatum. And by 'intricately linked to', I mean 'casually destroys in a nonchalant manner'.<br/><br/>The action sequences feel different from the rest of the series, and I guess some people would like the departure of the shaky cam effect that become closely linked to the last two installments, but I'm not very impressed by most of the shots.<br/><br/>The plot seems to be a bit lazy, for the most part. The hero, Aaron Cross, is an operative for a black ops program that uses performance enhancing drugs for its operations. The events in The Bourne Ultimatum has forced Edward Norton's character, who is overseeing all clandestine operations, to pull the plug on all agents. Aaron Cross survives, but the rest of the agents across the world are killed off by changing their medication/ missiles or other means. Aaron is the lone survivor (until Hollywood decides to spin off another side story, I suppose). The people after him (FBI? CIA? I lost track somewhere) are also killing off support staff - scientists who are administering/ researching the drugs - called chem in the movie. Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is the lone survivor from the scientists group. A good part of the movie is on Aaron getting Dr. Shearing to a top secret facility that manufactures the drugs so that he can get a permanent solution to enhancing his skill-set.<br/><br/>To counter Cross, they launch an agent/ super-soldier (I know, I know... I know they killed off all agents so as to not take any risks, but this guy is from another program, a deeper, more secretive program that apparently specialize in covert operations where creating a public spectacle is not an issue at all) <br/><br/>There is a conversation in the movie where Cross is asked why he is so desperate to get the performance enhancing drugs. I really really hope I misunderstood that conversation. Cos the way I understood that bit, his poor intellect cost him back when he was in the army, and basically admitted that without the chems, they were both toast. Like I said, I really hope I got that bit wrong. <br/><br/>And I also felt weird about some of the flashback scenes - where Edward Norton's character and Rachel Weisz' character suddenly have a short flashback of their earlier interaction with Cross - at a point in the movie where neither of them had ANY reason or cause to link to Cross at all. These flashbacks happen when neither are aware of Cross's involvement in the events at the time. Also, at another point, we see Cross hallucinating about his initiation into the program - at the same time that Edward Norton is reviewing the tape of this initiation. It's lazy/ incompetent editing at best.<br/><br/>I don't want to give spoilers, but in the end, they unravel some stuff from the Bourne Ultimatum in order to create open threads they can close in the next installment. <br/><br/>When the movie ended, I was thinking 'What? That's it?' There is not even a semblance of closure, no confrontation with the villain of the piece... or even his subordinates. If it were not for the duration, I would have thought this was an intermission, after which they would somehow wrap up the mess into a more tangible form. But no. It's just left there hanging, waiting for the green light to the sequels.<br/><br/>I give it a 4 out of 10. It has it's moments, but a Bourne movie, it is not."
"MarcusJ13","6","0","4","5 September 2012"," Not a lot to tell
","The Bourne Legacy can't seem to decide what it wants to be and once you sort of gather what it wants to be you are quite underwhelmed. Set in the aftermath of Jason Bourne's story, the film picks up with a new agent Aaron Cross who's like Jason Bourne only he's not. The film consists of the usual people looking at large screens, using headsets trying to decipher what's going on while attempting to get the bottom of the Aaron Cross character. At least that is what I gathered from the film. There wasn't really much else to really take into account. Cross, a member of another agency (not Treadstone) requires pills all the time and needs help from Dr Martha Shearing to obtain. Meanwhile there are the computer screens as mentioned. The film's key problem is that it spends a great deal of time on exposition and pseudo attempts to explain what on Earth is going on. The trouble is that it fails. All of the flaws in the film are attributed to writing as I came out thinking 'okay then' and not much else. The acting is at least very good and Renner in particularly tries to bring something to a role that not many probably wanted. That is the film really it didn't really have much of a story to tell which is why it is of course left quite open ended, I say open ended. It is more like the film had stopped and then the obligatory cue Moby. All in all The Bourne Legacy is not bad and would probably be good for a rental as the action is very good and well shot. It just has little else to offer."
"ramielhussein","3","0","4","5 September 2012"," Its Over! REALLY?!
","Its just un-inspiring. I hated it wholeheartedly and when it was over, I was still sitting on my chair waiting for the action to BLOW in my face. Not a Bourne movie. I just think they used the name to make something. Also the new hero is not in line with the JB initials like all spy actors James Bond, Jason Bourne, and the 24 guy .... All in all, its just OK. I am not sure why would anyone want to watch this movie unless you are a Bourne Junkie. Acting was good like everyone said, but still I have just seen some good acting and good story that make a great movie. Just not sure how did this movie get a 7 stars! It's just not fair. I hate it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","3 September 2012"," By the book, mostly
","I was toying with the idea of being really lazy, posting something like this: Ebert wrote ""for at least the first 30 minutes I had no clear idea of why anything was happening"". To this I would just add that the fun really starts when Jeremy Renner meets Rachel Weisz. For the rest of the movie, they run. Finis.<br/><br/>But that is probably too short for IMDb to accept. Besides the good effort all around deserves more. So here it goes.<br/><br/>The movie actually picks up from ""Bourn Ultimatum"" dropped off, an underwater silhouette of a completely motionless body suddenly awakes to action and swims off. But wait, that's not the same shot, as we soon discover that this is not Jason Bourn at the bottom of Hudson River, but a new face training somewhere in an icy lake in Alaska – Aaron Cross (Renner).<br/><br/>The confusing establishing scenes Ebert refers to serve really one purpose – to tell the audience that the authorities have decided to terminate a program that tempers with humans (physically as well as mentally) to create super fighters. The termination means killing various ""subjects"" scattered globally, in various shapes and sizes including an attractive Korean young woman. Aaron Cross is, needless to say, one of these termination targets.<br/><br/>Dr. Marta Shearing (Weisz) is an expert in chemistry who is in the program ""purely for the science"". The rest of the movie, as depicted earlier, of pairing the two in what seems to be a perpetual run, is all by the book.<br/><br/>If I am allowed to back up a little into the Bourne trilogy, the lost of Franka Potente after ""Bourne Identity"" takes away the romance element, reducing ""Bourne Supremacy"" to dry, hollow action. Enhancing Julie Stiles's role in ""Ultimatum"", even if it's the subtlest hint of romance prior and to come, brings life back into this conclusion of the trilogy. The hope of something beyond the trilogy with Damon and Stiles has all but vanished. If there is any romantic spark between Renner and Weisz, it does not surface until the very end. Maybe that is where the hope lies. Can we not have a double-date sequel with these two pairs teamed up to kick some asses in the authorities? How about it, Mr Gilroy?"
"holdingz1","5","0","4","2 September 2012"," At least the scenery in the first 10 minutes is magnificent
","snowy ridge lines, mountain peaks and rushing streams. Nothing is prettier than the opening photography in this movie. I should have left when it shifted south of Alaska. Don't expect the plot to hold together. there are lapses and disconnected characters. I enjoyed the connections in the Jason Bourne trilogy. the crooked, bribe taking agent I understood and Jason going forward stopping him (over 2 movies) was exciting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie loses the thrill of a larger plot. It needed to give a reason to care why the lead is in peril. And the female lead (good acting) is not supported by reason. <br/><br/>I simply did not care about them or the movie."
"okokok1111","7","0","2","2 September 2012"," Not as good as the Originals
","If you've seen the original trilogy and you're hoping that this will be just as good, you'll be disappointed. Unlike the previous movies, this one takes a while for the action to kick in. It takes around half an hour before there was any real fighting whatsoever, which wasn't so bad, but this movie lacked intelligence. In the previous movies we had a good idea that Jason Bourne was a good and fast thinker. For example, the reverse pick-pocket cell phone trick at the beginning of the Ultimatum, or the time when he called the police to arrive at the same time as BlackBriar agents did to get them arrested. Other things such as grabbing clothing during the rooftop chase to vault over the shattered glass, leaving the police behind. This movie had none of that. None of the thinking that would amaze you and say: this guy is fast! Not saying that Aaron Cross wasn't smart or anything, I'm just saying the script didn't include too many exciting points in the movie. The ending was dissatisfying as there was no real victory either. Overall, this movie was okay, but when compared to the Greengrass ones, there's no way it stands a chance."
"joe16vind","8","0","4","1 September 2012"," An Legacy easily forgotten?
","Having seen this film opening weekend, I have read numerous comments/assessments/justifications for why this film exists.<br/><br/>I have never liked the Bourne films- Damon was always this indestructible being who sought to find who he was-anyone with half a brain could have guessed the reasons for his very convenient amnesia. Which brings me to Legacy. I had always known who Jeremy Renner was but this was my first time watching him as the lead.<br/><br/>Didn't Universal trust the actor they hired to be Aaron Cross to carry the film? At every turn, some mention , some picture, some writing, some conversation was about Jason Bourne. Why? Sure I could understand a passing reference to Bourne but geez he usurps the picture.<br/><br/>Weisz seemed ill prepared to converse on virology, genetic engineering, and the concomitant moral ramifications of such. Yes this does exist and certainly would be misused. Where's Marian Cotillard and Kate Winslet when you need them? Once all the implausibilities are stripped away, covert military shenanigans exposed, you are left with a film that could have fared better than its performing. It takes way too long to establish Cross and once he is, one wouldn't really be interested. Yet Renner invokes a quiet intensity, understandable desperation and vulnerability into a man whose been manipulated into becoming something other than who he is. For myself, his work yielded a few scenes when I cared about Aaron Cross and what might become of him. It is because of Renner's efforts that Legacy becomes bearable to watch."

","The Bourne Legacy like the movies before started off very well, introducing you to new characters and re-introducing old ones. <br/><br/>I must admit that the beginning was hard to follow, but as a fan of the series i did understand it this is why i strongly suggest that before seeing this film that you should check out the first 3.<br/><br/>The story basically takes place at the same time as the last movie (The Bourne Ultimatum 2007) as the US government is hunting Jason Bourne, another unstoppable weapon is in training. <br/><br/>The storyline is very good but there is a lot information to process through the film, also the action was very flaky when you finally get to see some.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner gives a strong performance as Aaron Cross "" The new hero"" of the film, with Rachel Weisz who plays Dr Marta Shearing who is in the center of the Cross' interest."
"mkvonbergen","7","0","3","14 August 2012"," Had promise, but failed thanks to poor plotting
","In short: Fun movie, engaging characters, abrupt and unsatisfying ending. Personally, what made the movie disappointing was that it felt like a rough draft: good, but very unpolished and in need of revision. <br/><br/>The good parts: Renner's character is an interesting contrast to Damon's. For a secret spy, he has strong people skills and these, along with his compassion for other people, are on display throughout the movie. For Weisz, her character is slightly underdeveloped but an interesting and spirited person nevertheless. I appreciated how different these two characters were from the original characters; it would have been so easy simply to write a second Bourne into the role. And, as many reviewers have pointed out, Renner and Weisz throw themselves into their roles and flesh the characters out even further. <br/><br/>Moreover, the film raises (and returns to) questions about the ethics of war, of medicine and government interference in an interesting way. Unlike Bourne, Cross remembers his history with the Agency, which makes his character potentially more conflicted than Bourne. Bourne changes quickly around the time of his accident; Cross, more slowly as he gets deeper into his spy work. <br/><br/>The Bad Parts: But, the film fails to live up to its promise thanks to poor pacing. It takes perhaps 30-45 minutes to fully introduce the characters and initiate the conflict between Cross and the agency, then sends the characters running around the world with only a brief explanation of what is at stake or why hunting down Cross is so important. Interrupting these little bursts of action are flashbacks to Cross's earlier decisions and his moral dilemmas, but the movie never ties up these loose thematic ends. And the ending itself comes very abruptly and unexpectedly. So, the entire movie is stop-and-go; it starts some interesting themes and conflicts but never ties them off.<br/><br/>To give you an idea of how the Legacy plot runs, imagine that Identity ends after the Farmhouse scene: Bourne has made a step towards victory, but he's not there yet and ultimately takes the offensive confronts the CIA directly. Without that last scene, Bourne wouldn't win; the ending would be unsatisfying. In Legacy, it's a different ending (of course) but the same feeling: The movie feels incomplete, unfinished. <br/><br/>It's a shame, considering how much was working for this film."
"artyyeo","6","0","6","13 August 2012"," Not impressed
","Close Quarter Battle (CQB): The CQB scenes were too short and few, considering this is a Bourne movie. Camera panned too much and too many unfocused frames. Lots of lots of flickering but not much contents. I'd rank this category a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner: He is fine actor with lots of potential in the hands of an experienced director, like Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan or Daniel Espinosa. I feel for him in this movie, it has barely scraped the surface in terms of utilizing Jeremy's skill-set. Jeremy is very intense and directors need to exploit that. Jeremy is better than Matt Damon for playing this kind of role. It's clear cut. Matt is better for roles with much longer dialogs. And, Jeremy wields his guns significantly more realistic than Matt.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The motor-cycle chase is over-extended and did not contribute much to the movie. After a while, it became just noise and lots of flickering unfocused frames yet again. The visual effects is not effective.<br/><br/>Script: The yelling done by Rachel Weisz at her house was too excessive and again, did not serve much purpose. Some significant editing should be done in this area.<br/><br/>Comparisons: In comparison to other similar movies, such as Body of Lies and Safe House, this movie has not achieved its mark. I'd put the failure fully on the shoulders of the director."
