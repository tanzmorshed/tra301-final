","Insidious: Chapter 2, the sequel to the 2011 hit Insidious and directed by the same guy, James Wan. This is...um...less than the first...but I'm not sure if that makes it good...for me at least.<br/><br/>So, here's the story: Immediately after the events of the first one, the father named Josh, played by Patrick Wilson rescues his son, who possessed a supernatural ability to travel through different worlds. He came across the dark spirit world, inhabited by demons. After Josh gets his son out, it turns out he was possessed by a woman in black. Possessed, Josh kills Elise without anyone noticing. Josh's wife, Renai, played by Rose Byrne, tries to defend her husband that he wasn't responsible. While that's going on, strange activities occurs just like in the first and the scares are placed here and there for the audience to jump.<br/><br/>So what are the problems with this movie? Well first off, Josh being released after being suspected in murder? Shouldn't he be in custody or something? Like being held? If he's a suspect in murder, he shouldn't be around people. I know it's dramatic irony, but this is still weird. Aside from that, there are some things that aren't explained and they make no sense. I won't say anything here, but...needless to say, it's pretty hard to swallow.<br/><br/>The scares...they're a bit step back from the previous film. They're not bad, they're just not as subtle as the first. Also another problem. In the first film, they follow the ""rule of Jaws"" when they don't show the monster until the last third. Here, they show it no time flat. And they jump scares in this movie can be a little too over the top silly and I daresay-- pretty damn cheesy. In fact, that's what James Wan's biggest weakness. His scares are scary, but they are a bit ""in your face"". His other film, The Conjuring, worked so well because not only were there jump scares, but there were a lot of moments when you can just take in the unsettling atmosphere. James Wan does do that in his movies and he did in this, but not as much as The Conjuring did.<br/><br/>With all these problems, does that this movie is bad? ...not necessarily. The good stuff are the performances, the twists and how the plot explains more. But to be honest, the twist raises more questions. Never answered, of course, how the twists play out and that it does answer some questions from the first film is pretty interesting.<br/><br/>So, yeah. It's a mixed bag to say the least. It's not good, but it's not terrible. The first beats the sequel by a lengthy distance, but the good stuff is pretty satisfying. If you want to see it and have a jump scare fest, you won't be disappointed. I probably would see it again if I'm bored, but go ahead and see it and give your own take on it."
"Ramascreen","Null","61","94","12 September 2013"," Scary Fun
","We horror fans have been spoiled this past year, we've had it good  because director James Wan brought us The Conjuring and now Insidious:  Chapter 2, if this film had been any scarier, the world may stop  spinning, it is that scary. It's terrifying but it's also fun because  of that Ghostbuster-esque duo with their mormon missionary type outfit  on, who return to once again provide the humor for this franchise. But  seriously, James Wan has mastered this genre and made it his own. To  me, Wan is like this generation's Dario Argento. Wan and screenwriter  Leigh Whannell prove to be a winning team and they've brought us a  sequel that's just as good or even better than the first film.  Now, I'm going to try to do this review without spoiling details, and  it's going to be hard but I'm going to try to the best of my ability.  INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 takes us back to The Lamberts who went through  basically hell over their son's essence being trapped in this realm  called The Further. Now, what's extremely cool about how Wan and Leigh  crafted this sequel in that they play it in a way that this realm The  Further becomes a connection, a bridge between the first and this  second movie. There would be little instances like a door suddenly  opens by itself in the first film, and this sequel shows you why the  door did that. There are countless sequels out there that try hard to  expand on something while begging audiences to check out the first film  again, but the way that is done in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is clever.  Folks who've seen the first movie would be amused, folks who haven't  seen it would practically beg to watch the first movie after they're  done viewing this sequel, and all of it much thanks to this realm that  Wan and Leigh created, anything can happen in it, you can travel  through time, you can travel through places, ghosts can get you there,  and you can even get trapped in it, it's like a zone or a dimension  that probably Rod Serling himself would wish he had thought of it.  James Wan is a great horror director because he knows exactly what  scares you. That idea that somebody may be there watching when you  can't really see anybody there at all. It's that uneasy feeling that  slowly but surely creeps up on you and then strikes you in a heartbeat  without mercy, it's that old ghostly tale told by some kind of expert  who has gone through the experience years prior, Wan knows exactly  which elements that would not only scare you but would also leave you  scared long after the movie's done. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 offers all  that and a bag of chips, one can even call this movie, INSIDIOUS: The  Origin Of The Bride In Black. While they're dealing with what may or  may not have happened to Patrick Wilson's character, they discover a  certain backstory that explains the motivation for the Bride In Black.  While a certain past or a certain childhood is a dealt with and as they  try to close the chapter on The Lamberts, they open a new way to a  possibility of the team of experts going to another family, because  this is a world where The Further has taken the front seat, it has  become the lead star and the face of this franchise. I think INSIDIOUS:  CHAPTER 2 won't disappoint the fans, and I guarantee you'll have a  jolly good fright at the theaters."

","The Wan hype train is rolling through this film, there for it will make a lot of money just because of The Conjuring. I don't hate James Wan, I just hate the people that d**k ride his films, probably because horror is complete trash now-a-days, and this is the closest thing people see as good horror. But in reality, it's mediocre and nothing special. The Conjuring was a well made film, but it was downright horrible in every other category, including the most important thing, atmosphere/scares. Luckily this film was more of a thriller than it was a horror film, they recycled the exact some scares from the first film. I'll explain.<br/><br/>The plot is alright in the sense that it actually has a thought out story line, even if it is down right stupid at times. All the characters return, even those annoying comic relief paranormal specialists. You can pretty much guess the plot just by watching the trailer, every thing is obvious, except for when they stretch out the BS. There is some time travel nonsense that is just plain ridiculous. Is there infinite realities, is this Bioshock or a ghost movie. It really tries to have this mind bending plot line, but it just had me rolling my eyes. It's about as clever as the swing away twist in Signs, that's pretty bad. The ending should be left as it is, if not, we are looking at the next paranormal activity, the BS will just go on and on, but people will see it. In fact, James Wan could be described as paranormal activity, over hyped, appeals to the masses, even if it completely ruins his films. He makes his films dirt cheap, and wrings in the cash from the general audiences.<br/><br/>The music is still loud as hell, or quiet to the point you can't even hear it. The acting is fine, they get a pass. There is no tension, no good scares or atmosphere. You never feel a sense of urgency, or fear. It is all around horrible as a horror film. But it was pretty entertaining, and just all around fine. You'll roll your eyes more than you'll jump in terror. The story was wrapped up, but that old Hollywood money machine will still be sniffing around this franchise."
"Big_D_Box_Office_Score","7","90","149","12 September 2013"," James Wan continues his streak of solid horror flicks, and improves on Chapter 1.
","Insidious brought us the usual haunting story, with a couple new  elements sprinkled in. Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on ""Astral  Projection"", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the ""Further"" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS."
"puppycupcake","10","120","203","12 September 2013"," If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment
","The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you the back story of the family and why they are going through everything they are going through. They style is very similar, and there is so much originality and style that you just don't see with today's modern horror story flicks. There are plenty of scares, plot twists, surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end. They leave it open for further sequels that are sure to follow. A definite must-see for any horror movie fan."
"MDebs22","9","89","156","12 September 2013"," Lived up to the hype
","All week I was digging around trying to find critics' reviews about this to see what they thought at their early screenings. Well, it wasn't good, and I was feeling let down already. They all basically said the same thing; that the jump and scare moments were plenty, but that's about it. The story is too convoluted and it just isn't as good as the first one. Also, there is too much humor and wit in it, and it takes away from the tension buildup. But would that stop me from seeing it first chance I get Thursday night? As a die-hard of demon movies and of the first Insidious, nothing was going to stop me.<br/><br/>When the movie opened with the original Insidious creepy sound of high-pitched instruments, I was very excited. I sat back and prepared to enjoy the ride. And did I ever. At the conclusion, I immediately knew that this installment was more horrifying than the first one. I'm not saying the story was better, or that it was written, acted, or any other cinema verb you could think of done better, because that's still up for debate. But what I knew for sure was that this was more terrifying than the first one. And that's the whole point of scary movies, right? To be terrified? A handful of the jump and scare moments will stick with you, that's for sure. Patrick Wilson did an amazing job, as he has done in his recent string of scary movies. While the two goofy underlings to Elise do bring humor to the table, I don't think it takes much away from the overall dread and terror. At least not as much as critics are saying it does. What I loved about this movie besides the scares, was that it tied together some things from the first one. I wasn't expecting that. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see it though. You'll probably say something along the lines of what I said when it was happening..""Wow, that was beautifully planned out and executed. Props to the writers there."" The story is more complicated than the first one, but if you can keep up, you'll really appreciate and enjoy it. And the complexity of it will make it a movie worth seeing multiple times in order to catch everything. Be prepared to jump a mile in your seat at some of the parts. Then laugh while your heart rate comes back down. I'm giving this a 9/10. But that is pretty biased because of my love of the first movie. So more realistically, 8/10."
"kluseba","9","57","100","15 September 2013"," It's different but it does live up to the first chapter
","If you happened to like the first chapter, you will also like the second even though there are a few differences between both movies. <br/><br/>First of all, the second chapter kicks off with a more gripping story line and a few good scares while the first part took its time to introduce everybody. As the second movie is based on quite the same characters as the first movie, there is no need to lose precious screening time and the movie doesn't. This movie's pace is definitely faster and quite gripping from the beginning to end.<br/><br/>The second movie also has a more complex story line. While the first movie left us with a few unsolved questions and problems, the second film resolves them all in a quite logical way. In fact, there are multiple story lines here that are though easy to digest and to follow and that all lead to a dramatic ending. We see some scenes that happen in Josh's past, other things that have happened in the first movie or just after, a couple of scenes playing in ""The Further"" and finally the main story line in the now and here. Some scenes show us the past and present family life of Josh, others focus on the works of the ghost busters who try to help them. All in all, the story in here is much more intelligent and profound than in the first film which is something I didn't expect. The characters are even more attaching than before and you are really happy to see some of them again. In addition to this, the few new characters of good or evil character are really great and welcome additions to the plot. That's why this movie is one of the rare really convincing sequels as it lives up to the brilliant first movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a few really good scares of course but overall the first movie was a lot creepier and more disturbing. In fact, you happen to know what is going on if you have seen the first movie and that's why you aren't that shocked or surprised anymore. This being said, you absolutely need to have seen the first film if you want to try out this one because if you don't know the first chapter, you won't fully understand the second.<br/><br/>""Insidious - Chapter 2"" has a few very memorable scenes and maybe even more than the first one. My favourites were the dice play that unveiled the hidden knife, the creepy but not evil mystery man in the first scene in ""The Further"" and the scene with Marilyn and her mother. In some scenes, you can see that the second chapter is not only influenced by its own first part but also by several genre classics. The mystery man recalled me David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" while other scenes reminded me of the evil Bob of ""Twin Peaks"". The ending of the movie has many moments that made me think of the legendary ""The Shining"". I guess these references are more than just good as so is this movie.<br/><br/>In the end, you really should watch this horror film of the year in the movie theatres but I may give you a few advices to end up my review. Just avoid going to the movies at popular screening times such as Friday or Saturday night. I have read and also personally experienced a lot of noisy people who are talking all the time and laughing out loud just to calm down and try not to show how afraid they really are. <br/><br/>Second, you should keep your feet on the ground and not try to eat or drink too much during the movie. Some scenes suddenly get very scary and could lead you to throw away your popcorn and pour some coke on your clothes or those of your neighbour. If your potential girlfriend isn't all that much into horror movies or a Gothic, please don't take her out to witness such a movie. <br/><br/>Third, you shouldn't drink or eat too much before watching this film. The movie has a few uglier scenes than the first one even though they are not disgusting. The thing is that you have a glimpse at a few disturbing things but your vivid imagination might think further and that's where this fantastic movie automatically leads you to a few nastier thoughts. If you have a weak heart, if you are a very nervous person or if you are pregnant, please avoid this movie for your own security.<br/><br/>Anyone else, please enjoy this atmospheric contemporary horror masterpiece."

"btnthx","Null","36","62","12 September 2013"," Things that go bump in the night
","When you are making a horror movie it always helps to have a few things around in the movie in order to help set the mood. Things like creaky old doors, a piano, and preferably an old and creepy looking house. Now these are not absolutes, but they can help for sure. Horror movies are not like other movies, because there are so many possibilities for sequels, just look at the ""Friday the 13th"" series. In 2011 James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought us ""Insidious"", a story about a family that had unwelcome visitors in their house. The supernatural kind. <br/><br/>That family, the Lamberts, have gotten away from their house and the experience they had in it. Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne), and their three children are all safe and move in with Josh's mom. At the beginning of the film you find out this is not Josh's fist experience with a sprit. It seems Josh has a gift where he sees dead people and with the help from Elise (Lin Shaye) he forgets that gift, until he uses it again to save his son from a place the living shouldn't be. That place I imagine is the same place Carol Anne from ""Poltergeist"" was in as well, but instead of talking through a TV, a tin can phone is used to communicate to the other side. Renai senses something is not right about Josh, a sentiment that is shared by Josh's mother as well. So with the help from a man named Carl (Steve Coulter) and two guys who provide the comic relief, they all set out to free Josh and his family from the evil that haunts them. <br/><br/>The story picks up exactly where the first film ended, which makes the chapter 2 a perfect title. There are so many more possible chapters to this story, because let's face it there are a lot of ghosts out there. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is part ghost story and part detective story, as we try to unravel what is following the Lamberts around. Lucky, unlike what he did with ""Saw"" we are still under the direction of James Wan and he keeps us on the same path as the first film. If you are going for jump out of your seat frights, then this is not the film for you. There are some moments that may make you jump a little, thanks to some good camera work, but this movie is more like ""Seven"" than say, ""The Conjuring"". In a genre that seems to be getting everything right at the moment, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" doesn't disappoint. The only thing that could improve, is to have a little less common sense moments, you know those moments where a character does the thing everyone knows they shouldn't. I think it is very fitting to release this film on Friday the 13th, because like that franchise, you hope this one also has a long life making us afraid to sleep with the lights off.<br/><br/>Brian Taylor <br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"
"Pete_198594","1","31","53","18 January 2014"," A truly shockingly awful film..laughable
","I saw the first and thought it was good, this however is simply a prime example of the crass commercialism of the film industry.<br/><br/>Every person involved in the making of this film should hang their heads in shame. Every 30 seconds your TV volume will jump 300 decibels as yet another inane shot of a window breaking, ghost appearing out of somewhere or door slamming will occur.<br/><br/>The script is so clumsy im sure it was written by a 12 year old.<br/><br/>My favourite scene to emphasise just how bad this film was is the bit when the two ghost hunters are in the van and agree that no safety word will be given to whoever his name is as they will know when he will be in trouble. Whoever his name is then has a 3 minute conversation with an evil spirit ( yawn ) but wait the two others only come to his rescue when they hear he has a knife!!! Gadzooks!! Insulting really.<br/><br/>Good luck if you like it, you're keeping talentless morons in swimming pools and wild egos...<br/><br/>As for the actors, their lack of professional integrity surprised me.."
"clearlyconfused","10","71","137","12 September 2013"," HIGHLY entertaining :)
","I loved this movie. Loved it, loved it, loved it. James Wan is one of the best directors of recent times and he makes his stand by offering two awesome horror movies this year. I personally preferred Insidious 2 though, as I appreciated the rich character development and the concept of the Further. There are clear references to The Shining and Psycho but this movie leaves its own mark of disturbing. Of course it's always great to add some light humor in between to dilute the scares (as they REALLY packed a punch in this second installment). So if you're kind of doubting the movie based on its bad rep, don't listen to the negative comments/reviews as this is easily one of the best movies this year. Everyone did a phenomenal job and the end product turned out a lot more satisfying than I expected."
"lauramcgillivray","1","16","26","18 October 2014"," Really bad
","The storyline, script and acting in this film are all so terrible. Allow me to give you an example at one point Rose Byrne's character exclaims ""I can't relax! There's ghosts everywhere..it's like we're already dead!"" her husband responds ""No, it's not! This is nothing like being dead...I know...I have seen it""<br/><br/>I feel like this really summarizes just how bad the film is - even worse than the first one. I do not understand how these films have such a high rating on here. I love horror films but ended up turning this off out of boredom and frustration from having to continually turn the volume up and down when I was deafened by really loud bangs. I feel like there is going to be a third one and I am almost looking forward to it just to see how bad it will get."
"zach-tiefling","2","19","33","2 October 2014"," A wonderful breakdown of modern horror...
","""Insidious – Chapter 2"" takes place right after the events of the first movie. In order to bring the audience up to speed, it opens up with 15 minutes of purposely stilted exposition. But not only those first minutes are a true gem of writing! Dialogues throughout the movie will fascinate every viewer, in how far removed they are from actual human speech and emotion. To emphasize this disconnection from the human condition, all lines are delivered by a group of wooden mannequins cleverly disguised as actors. Although this has been a bold choice by the director, the expression known as 'dull surprise' is always spot on. <br/><br/>The film also raises many questions, it boldly does not answer: Why is a suspected murderer not in custody? Why does a wife and mother, who must know that her husband is possessed by a ghost, does not act on this knowledge? How do the two paranormal investigators know, that a knife was just pulled? And does a knife really make a 'swing' sound, although the one who pulls it just held it behind his back?<br/><br/>This film uses all the horror-film tropes you love and can't get enough of, like: <br/><br/>1) The ghost in the mirror! <br/><br/>2) The false 'standing behind the door' reveal! <br/><br/>3) Baby in danger! <br/><br/>4) Scary children! <br/><br/>5) Scary nursery rhymes!<br/><br/>6) A abandoned hospital/mental institution! <br/><br/>7) Ominous pointing. <br/><br/>8) Ghosts ominous pointing. <br/><br/>9) Ghosts ominous pointing white screaming and/or cackling.<br/><br/>10) The ""...you cannot have seen him, he just died this morning."" Scene! <br/><br/>11) At least five instances of a noisy, scary and inexplicably moving toy! <br/><br/>12) Ghosts wearing antiqued clothes while sitting with their back to the camera! <br/><br/>13) The self-unscrewing screw! <br/><br/>14) Explaining the obvious! <br/><br/>15) The murderous husband bashing through a locked door! (As seen in ""The Shining"") <br/><br/>16) The son disguised as his mother, murdering people! (As seen in ""Psycho"") <br/><br/>17) Dissolving walls! (As seen in ""Silent Hill"") <br/><br/>18) An ending that sets up a third installment!<br/><br/>This movie also takes a break from well-timed, well-placed, non-predicable and terrifying jump-scares. No longer will your heart-rate be raised by a sudden shock, that impairs your movie-experience! No, this film fires so many Jump-scare-'duds' and loud noises at the viewer, that after the first third of its runtime you won't care anymore . <br/><br/>And if you expect the 'loud noises' to match up with the pictures you see on the screen, you will be pleasantly surprised, because ""Insidious - Chapter 2"" breaks new ground! These noises always come a bit too late, which gives you the opportunity to be prepared and not startled by the sudden increase in volume. <br/><br/>Especially noteworthy is the one scene, where the baby-bed is revealed to be empty. A dramatic zoom, a loud noise and then BANG!: The instant reveal, that the baby just had fallen out of the bed. Scenes like this are a well thought out statement, how horror movies are desperately fishing for cheap scares.<br/><br/>But wait there is more! <br/><br/>Like the well-beloved ""weak wrist"" camera-work, when a scene is meant to be truly intense! A blatant and artistic disregard for how tin can telephones are supposed to work! A time-travel story! Time traveling ghosts! Where else, outside of Doctor Who, can you find something like this? <br/><br/>I warn you! This film is a movie you should not watch alone, because all the quips and witty remarks you will inadvertently come up with, would be otherwise lost to the silence. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The Insidious Drinking Game: <br/><br/>""Fake"" Jump-Scare (x1) <br/><br/>Scary Toy (x1)<br/><br/>Jump-Scare Sound-Mismatch (x1)<br/><br/>Tin Can Phones don't work that way (x2) <br/><br/>Drink one each time you think: ""....sure this isn't Christian Slater?"""
"paul-tabet","3","31","60","9 December 2013"," Dreadful
","The only thing really scary about this movie is that people seem to have loved it. Compared to screen gems as The Exorcist, The Entity( with B. Hershey too ), The Omen, Scanners, The Thing, Rec, The Haunting, Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, it has absolutely nothing to offer : no characters, no atmosphere at all ( fumes ARE NOT atmosphere ), very bad storytelling, mediocre acting, a very messy story, and terrible wanna be fun moments that have nothing to do in a movie supposed to scare you. The Conjuring was far better imho, avoid this one at all costs ! I wonder how much people have been paid to review this mess as ""the movie that would stop the earth from spinning were it a bit scarier"". By the way, stop putting à 10/10 from a movie that is ""scary but not a great movie"" ! Movies that deserve a 10/10 should be a handful at most and not some rubbish made to make money on behalf of no brainers under 18 who have seen at most a 100 film in their lives( ""the best horror movie I have ever seen"" ).

","I went into this film with fairly high expectations. They clearly were not high enough. This easily matches, if not surpasses the first instalment. I loved the first film, and this is easily the best horror sequel I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The storyline was fantastic, the slightly ambiguous ending of the first film was brought to light nicely, and a deeper more complex meaning behind the haunting was revealed. The full extent of the main plot line was given in chunks, so that I was always kept guessing, right up until the end.<br/><br/>The actors played their roles well, child acting included. The roles were believable, and the characters were portrayed nicely.<br/><br/>The main thing that makes this film (and the first) so good is that it is actually scary. There is hardly any violence, no blood, but they are some of the most jumpy films that I have seen. The lower budget effects are used simply and to great effect. The low key nature of the scares make them all the more believable.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic horror film, and matching the excellent original, if you haven't seen Insidious, see it so that you can see this! If you have seen Insidious, just see this!"

","After the death of Elise, Renai (Rose Byrne) is interrogated by a police detective about the supernatural events in the house. While the police investigate the house, the Lambert family temporarily moves to the old house of Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey). Renai is haunted by a woman in white and Josh (Patrick Wilson) has a strange behavior at home. Meanwhile Lorraine seeks out Elise's partners Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) expecting to find answers and who killed Elise, and they summon the medium Carl (Steve Coulter) to contact Elise using his dices. The name of the hospital where Lorraine worked appears and they go to the place that is abandoned. They walk to a room that was the ICU and Lorraine recalls an incident with the terminal patient Parker Crane (Tom Fitzpatrick) that committed suicide in the hospital. They find his address, and discloses that the hideous serial- killer ""The Bride in Black"" was Parker indeed. Further, Lorraine believes that her son Josh is trapped in the Further and Parker has possessed his body. Carl, Specs and Tucker go to Lorraine's house and find that Lorraine's assumption is correct. How can they bring Josh back to his body?<br/><br/>""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a good horror movie but inferior to the first ""Insidious"". I am a big fan of ""Insidious"" that is my favorite horror movie of this century but I also do not like sequels or remakes since it is very difficult to repeat a masterpiece. James Wan uses elements from ""The Shinning"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" together with the clichés of haunted house movies to deliver this sequel. Unfortunately it seems that in 2015 is foreseen the release of a third chapter of ""Insidious"". Where was Kali when she vanishes?

","I am a big fan of horror movies especially ones that have a good story and have a couple of genuine horrifying and startling scenes. Insidious is one of those movies. I was very excited when I first saw the trailer of chapter 2 and instantly made up my mind to watch it in the theater. However I was extremely disappointed with the movie. There was not a single scene in the movie that made me jump and the story was completely ridiculous making no sense at all. The direction and acting also seemed to be below par as compared to chapter one. The little comedy that they added only further annoyed me. Overall the movie was way below my expectations and after watching it, it was clear why there were only about fifteen people in the cinema hall. Money and time wasted."

","When I heard that they were making a sequel to this, I was both over-hyped with excitement and very nervous because let's face it, sequels rarely live up to the expectations of the originals. Thankfully though, this one did not disappoint (relative to the extent of other sequels).<br/><br/>It starts off directly where the original left off, which is nice because there is not a huge time gap in-between. Not only do they continue chapter 2 right where the first chapter left off, but the story also goes more in-depth with Josh's past.<br/><br/>Will every hard-core fan of Insidious be impressed by this sequel? Of course not. Insidious: Chapter 2 felt very different from the original. It was mostly because Insidious seemed more unique when it came out, while this chapter is more of the same with a few exceptions (e.g., possession). Without giving any major spoilers away, I will say that the last 30 minutes seemed more of a ""slasher"" movie than a paranormal movie, which may turn some hard-core Insidious fans away.<br/><br/>The scares also seemed forced at times, possibly from trying too hard to make the sequel as good, if not, better than the original, but it was still suspenseful regardless.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10"

"cornflakeboy20","3","11","19","10 December 2013"," Worst theatrical horror movie of 2013
","If you asked your local theater for tickets to the new James Wan directed, Patrick Wilson horror movie, I hope they directed you to The Conjuring. Otherwise, you went to see this completely unoriginal, poorly acted, unintentionally funny mess. James Wan had clearly stretched himself thin with two similarly plotted movies in the same year. Besides the usual haunted house clichés: dolls, Victorians, pianos; and the hallmarks of the bad horror movie (crashingly loud noises where genuine scares should be), this script outright rips off elements of The Shining, Sleepaway Camp and Amityville Horror. And because it is a sequel, it can't even claim to have an original idea of its own. The staging of a climactic scene is so similar to The Shining, I was surprised Patrick Wilson did not do the ""Here's Johnny!"" line. In the last minute, Wan even manages a final rip off by using the exact ghost sound effect from Ju-On/The Grudge. Patrick Wilson is typically neither good nor bad, but he's well beyond his range here. And Danielle Bisutti, as the villainess, is doing an impression of Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest without the fun factor. That's when she's allowed to speak, and not shriek into an echo chamber for one of the movie's many loud jump scares. I have seen virtually every theatrical or direct to video horror movie this year, except The Last Exorcism 2 and Carrie. Either one of them could be worse than this, but I doubt it. The current 6.9 rating astounds me, since so few horror movies ever get above a 6. This is not the one to break that mold."

","Let me start out by saying that I love horror movies. Good ones. But in my opinion that's an unfortunate thing because no other movie genre is as plagued by poor quality garbage as the horror genre. The first Insidious movie was not great, but I definitely felt it was above average and deserving of the near-7 rating is has in IMDb. Very few horror films merit a rating of 7 or higher, and that is particularly true in the case of Chapter 2. Apart from some interesting ties they made between events in this film and events in the first film which made this one interesting at times, it was worse than the first one, not better. The acting by some of the characters was B-quality at best. The dialog was cheesy at times. The plot was mostly unoriginal and boring. As for evil spirits and imagery, there was nothing new introduced at all. No red- faced demon. Just the ghost of a serial killer who became one because his mother made him dress like a girl...gee, we've seen that before about a dozen times. Lazy, lazy storytelling. The rating at the time of this writing is a 7.3. I'd give it a 4 and I expect that it will trend down over time and end up at least a full point below Chapter 1, which as a 6.7 at this time."

Lots of overly loud screams that's not very scary in fact every time we see our friendly ghosts they seem to just scream at our protagonists which fills me with the desire to shout back or assault my television. I don't know why we as the human species are obsessed with crap sequels but in movie history there are a handful of films worth the effort of making more of because them films (which I'm not listing but u know the ones) had a story worth the effort. Now I understand why they do it because the sheeple will watch any old crap if it was OK first time round and sold a few tickets. In conclusion it's a long winded screaming contest with predictable story and bad acting."
"jaguiar313","Null","5","7","13 September 2013"," Insidious sequel is spooky fun.
","Insidious: Chapter 2 starts up almost right after the original Insidious ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert reunited with their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) after his spirit was held prisoner by a demon in an afterlife dimension called 'The Further'. But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way."

"Rickting","3","7","11","18 November 2014"," Things that go ""Ahhhhh!"" in a laughably unscary manner in the night
","Insidious was an ace haunted house film although it did get a bit silly towards the end. The family are back and still getting haunted. James Wan made the excellent The Conjuring and was clearly putting all of his effort into that. So maybe he was too focused on that to actually direct this film at all. The first was excellent; yet this is a laughably awful and heartbreakingly lazy follow up. It had the same cast, same good director and some good trailers. How did this happen? James Wan has a few filmmaking tricks up his sleeve, and there are a couple of good scares. The rest of the time, it's a long, boring slog towards a monumentally convoluted and clichéd conclusion. As toys go beep beep in the night, pianos play by themselves, ghosts shriek, people stand around and explain the plot, fog obscures everything and the ghosts do more shrieking, don loads of white face paint, do their best Captain Jack Sparrow impersonations and go ludicrously over the top I nearly switched it off. And I never turn films off once I've started.<br/><br/>Insidious Chapter 2 is like an F grade film studies exercise where the task was to make the audience jump. The film is composed of jarring jump scares which drain the tension and at times the film is unintentionally hilarious. The script is dreadful: It consists of exposition, jump scares and.... that's it. The acting is awful as well and it is difficult to get behind the haunted family when all you want them to do is head to the nearest acting class. Virtually every aspect of it is lazy, clichéd and underwhelming. Every thing in this film has been seen before and there aren't any surprises. It doesn't even want to be its own movie. It spends a good chunk trying to tie up loose ends from the first film. IC2 is one of the worst horror sequels I've seen. It's probably not one of the worst as I haven't seen that many horror sequels but this is a waste of everyone's time. Rather offensively, a third installment is on the way and this has a 6.6 rating on IMDb. LAME.<br/><br/>2/10"

"nesfilmreviews","4","8","14","17 September 2013"," Predictable jump scares galore.
","The original ""Insidious"" on its own terms works well enough, but its repetitive, unimaginative sequel clearly verifies that director James Wan is overextending in the name of continuing a franchise. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" isn't a total disaster, but it is a disappointment when compared to the first installment, and Wan's most recent success with ""The Conjuring"" (2013). Despite some clever plotting, interweaving the film's second half with events from the original, it simply lacks tension and falls short on scares.<br/><br/>The opening prologue set almost 30 years prior, gives us a shadowy realm called the Further. In this place, the souls of the dead who refuse to accept their fate, and wander around searching for a way to reconnect with the real world. Following the prologue, events pick up right where the first movie ended. Josh (Patrick Wilson) has just rescued son Dalton (Ty Simpkins), whose spirit form had traveled away from his physical body, and is now trapped in a dimension not meant for the living. In their return to the real world, however, the same spectral presence that terrorized Josh as a child -- an old lady wearing a black veil in a wedding dress, has followed him back.<br/><br/>With the present-day Elise (Lin Shaye) found strangled to death, Renai (Rose Byrne) cannot curb her intuition that husband Josh might have had something to do with it. She trusts him and doesn't believe he'd be capable of murder, but when she looks into his eyes she no longer recognizes the man she married. As forensic sends away tests on fingerprints, the Lambert family go to stay with Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), hoping the worst is behind them.<br/><br/>What made the first film creepy and chilling is now all familiar material, and the addition of a back story infused with some artificial conflict isn't nearly enough to compensate for its lack of suspense. The storyline lacks structure leaving the movie noticeably uneven, and the plot ultimately becomes tiresome and convoluted. The ending is your typical, predictable sequel conclusion to keep the franchise going after Wan's exit. Inevitably, ""Insidious 3"" is only a matter of time, and it will continue to stretch a story that doesn't have much else to say."

","Having seen the excellent, instant horror classic The Conjuring a few months ago I was looking forward to seeing James Wan's latest film. With that film, he seemed to tap into all of the classic shots and grades of truly disturbing horror movies, imbuing them with a timeless style that works beautifully. So I hoped for more of the same with Insidious 2.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is just riddled with problems. It's hard to know where to start.<br/><br/>The most atmosphere destroying aspect of the film is the comedy relief duo, including someone who wears glasses named ""Specs. It's difficult to understate how bad these guys are - they have no place in the film and apart from some unsubtle, sometimes slapstick humour, they bring nothing to the table at all. They look like American versions of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, which presumably was who they are supposed to be based on (ala Shaun of the Dead). This genre mashing does not work at all for what is for all intents and purposes a ""proper"" horror movie.<br/><br/>While the film starts off relatively confidently (The old guy's acting leaves a lot to be desired in the first scene, and is the first clue that this is not going to be a great film), things deteriorate quite quickly, and while some scenes and sets are ""just right"", just as many feel very fake and the camera work and grading feels borderline amateur. It's surprising given the quality of Wan's other work but it feels like the producers have insisted on certain scenes/moments being delivered before they are really ready to go.<br/><br/>The whole thing is full of plot holes and although the third act attempts to explain some mysteries from earlier in the film, for the most part there are far more moments that are ignored and make no sense at all.<br/><br/>This is a terrible film. If I was James Wan I'd be embarrassed to have my name attached to it. I've been amazed at how consistently positive reviews have been and can only assume they are partly generated by studio shills as they are so far off the mark with their high praise. It is comically bad in places and certainly not the horror thrill ride Wan delivered in The Conjuring. Avoid."

It seemed seriously scary because there were at least a few movies worth of scares rolled into the one film. Were they really going to have enough left over for another one? Well, of course not! <br/><br/>This sequel does once again have a lot going on in it, but none of it works. There's Patrick Wilson doing his best ""Shining"" bit, a couple of different ghosts that need a back story for some reason, a weird choice to turn one of the spooks from the first film into ""Norman Bates,"" time-travelling? and a couple of bits simply copied and pasted from ""Insidious 1."" There's also a lot of the usual toys rolling around, and loud bangs which lead to nothing, as you'd probably expect from a movie in which a family is terrorised by ghosts.

If you can get past the fact that this family has knowingly moved into an equally haunted house to get over what happened in the first film, you will still be disappointed with the all-over-the-place feel, confusing plot, and lack of scares. I'm sorry to say that its even more un-intentionally hilarious than it is scary. Yes this was a hard one to pull off so perhaps they shouldn't of tried.<br/><br/>Overall, it tries way to hard to be clever, when all I wanted it to be was straight forward scary. Very disappointing.

Where the first one had good scares, this one is just some more of that PG13 Hollywood mainstream horror.<br/><br/>This is basically a lazy continuation of the first, with no real motive or at least a failed attempt at building from the original and recreating a piece that is as challenging and that keeps the same quality formula while expanding on other possible notions of the Insidious realm. It's just leaning on the first, bringing uninteresting, predictable explanations to a film that didn't need any. Parasitic, feeding off the originality of the first without bringing anything itself.<br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing notorious or memorable about it, and most if not all scenes are a letdown.

You can tell they were influenced by movies such as Inception and Cabin in the Woods. It had some ""plot twists"" like Inception and laughs here and there like CITW. This is not a bad thing what-so ever, the only thing is, is that they didn't execute it as well as I'd hope. I wish they stayed original, while still having influences, like the first movie, and as scary as the original. <br/><br/>As you will read in other reviews, this movie was very anti-climatic. To the point that after the ""climax"" you stood their asking yourself ""is it really the end? Or are they going to do some Cabin in the Woods ending where they go ALL OUT and things get CRAZY!"". But they never do.<br/><br/>I also think this movie will be be given more thumbs down then up because it had a lot to live up to. The first movie literally had me crawled up in my chair. It was also so scary I brought my friends to go see it, to see their expressions! This movie had me feeling indifferent and telling my friends to not have high hopes.<br/><br/>Now this movie had some things going for it as well. I thought that the comical parts were hilarious, just were out of their element. I also thought that they gave more screen time to more worthy characters. And lastly, the music was done by the same person who did the first, and that gave the movie the same scary, ominous, uneasy feelings.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that if you liked the first one, this picks up right where the last one ended and it might not be ""worth seeing"" but you could spend your money in worse ways. Just don't expect another ""insidious"" or ""The Conjuring"". Enjoy!"
"luciouslewy","1","9","18","29 April 2014"," Poor, especially in comparison to the first.
","Just another awful sequel to a wonderful movie. Terrible all around and contradicts the first movie. Basically just a thrown together piece of crap. The acting seems poorer too and its the same actors. I just really did not care for it and the first one scared me to death and back. This one felt like a B movie or like it was an independent film. The story is twisted and 100% rewrites the original movies story line, which in my opinion is the main downfall of the movie. I mean come one... the old lady was really a guy in drag???? What the heck are these writers thinking. The first movie had no cracks and was a very kept together plot. This movie strings you back and forth until you has little or no interest to continue watching it."

","This movie is very cheesy and boring. Horrible acting! Boring me to death. Some sort of supposed horror not scary at all kind of funny. Well, I guess most horrors are a lot like this but this is the most pathetic one I've ever watched. Something to do with a mysterious satanic demon. The classic eerie music that is meant to add drama collides with the false attitude of the film making a laughable scene. Everything feels over dramatized and stretched out yet it jumps around in an irrelevant matter. I hope no one will ever view this outrageous nonsense ever again. Police believe the male character murdered this lady who was some sort of exorcist. They blame it on some demon or ghost. The man yells at the female character enraged by her partial decision to blame him for such things also."

A film like Insidious has created its own genre of cult terror. But lets face it, nowadays there seem to be some slacking in the creative minds of writers. The acting was great and while I remained interested in what was going to happen next, I did catch myself yawning a few times at the let down scares following the dramatic build ups. I think if you go into this film expecting to see a great thriller, not horror then you'll be just fine. Otherwise, don't set your standards too high, for what the movie tries to accomplish it passes, terrifying the audience. For what others would expect, horror, it fails."

","In 2010's insidious Acclaimed horror duo James Wan And Leigh Whannell, creators of the SAW franchise unleashed upon us a terrifying take on the haunted house movie. Insidious, told the story of a family plagued by unwanted visitors, The Supernatural Kind. <br/><br/>Fast forward to 2013 and now we have Insidious Chapter 2. The Lambert family have now moved from the house and moved on from all the experiences they had in it. Josh, Renai and their three children are all safe, and safe with Josh's Mom. <br/><br/>The story starts with a young Josh and explains how he has the gift for astral projection, which with the help of Elise, he eventually suppresses this and forgets about his gift. Just when the family think they are safe and their horror has passed them, things begin to go bump in the night. But this time its not little Dalton who's in trouble, its Josh himself. Renai and new character, Carl get help for Josh after they both sense theirs something not quite right about him. They set out to free Josh and the family from the evil that haunts them. Told through a series of story strands its interesting to see the direction the Duo have taken with this and everything builds on top of each other to create an interesting narrative which combines the best of the first film and expands on the story of the first one and the women in black from the photos, its interesting to see the character development portrayed. Combining the best elements from The Shining, Poltergeist and Psycho proves to be a successful formula and nothing seems forced or contrived here. <br/><br/>Tying in perfectly with the first one, I found myself shocked at some of the twists and how it tied perfectly into the first film. If you are expecting edge of your seat scares then this film will disappoint you. The jump scares are effect due to the camera work by James Wan. The ending leaves the door open for a sequel, it will be interesting to see where the series will go now Wan has bowed out from the Horror Genre, if this is his final swan song for the genre then he has done a phenomenal job and can bow out gracefully."

There are hundreds, thousands of movies out there with the same look and feel. It is just so unnecessary to redo that stuff all over again. If you really feel like you have to do a ghost movie, than try to be a bit innovative and present something the audience hasn't seen or doesn't expect.<br/><br/>The audience laughed most of the time, because of the predictable and stupid dialogs.<br/><br/>I am shocked to see, that the same director gets to do Fast and Furious 7, since the last two actually got better I'm afraid that he kills the series.<br/><br/>It's incredible, I mean he did ""Saw"". That really was something. But what came after, shows pretty much Wan is a one hit wonder. He should either take some time out and fuel up with some new ideas, or just leave the scene.

","I have read several stellar reviews of this film, which I rented last night, and have only one question; just what in the HELL were you people watching? The movie had great potential for scares (I watched it at the in-laws home in the dark hills of Carson City,NV with the lights off), and the movie actually had a chance at some story continuity established in the semi-frightening first chapter. That, I'm afraid is where the potential ended, and the hysterical laughter began for me. The antagonist,with her sudden screeching verbal/physical assault on the family was absolutely ridiculous and un-scary. Mrs. Lambert's reaction to viewing the last scene from the first film is completely dry,lame and unbelievable. I am a fan of the horror genre, and will make excuses within my own mind to excuse some substandard acting or events, if the overall effort is in any way ambitious. Here we have yet another(shameless) money grab for the mindless masses that have facilitated the lazy and uninspired garbage that passes for horror films today.

But, we were honestly was shocked and disappointed about everything in this movie, the story didn't add anything new, it's the same as watching a horror movie 20 years ago, so many things didn't make any sense. and the acting was not that good, except for Rose Byrne, she did great as ACTING. but the rest were in a comedy movie by mistake. <br/><br/>we really wanted to be scared and jump off our chairs, but that didn't work at all except for very few scenes.

Josh not compelling at all and Rose Byrns had a wooden constant scared/dull expression on her face throughout the entire film. The shifts back and forth in time were totally confusing and clumsily done. The effects were utterly cheap (I hated that steam-effect....how cheesy like an 80s disco)and the Gothic, powdered face smokey eyed ghosts were a joke. Also this movie was stupid.

He knew how to make a great sequel, starting right where the first one left off. The way he connected all the dots, how he took us to the first chapter was brilliant.

Where did that creativity go for the sequel?<br/><br/>I will say that this movie, if delivered properly, could have been the better film. What we were left with though was a movie that found a way to top its cheesiness every 10 minutes or so. It had comedic humor in places that was slipped into the script but clearly didn't belong. Aside from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, some of the acting just simply wasn't good, feeling forced in some places.

","I was no fan of the first INSIDIOUS, so there wasn't much chance of me enjoying this inferior sequel. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 follows straight on from the events of the first film, with the Lambert family once more finding themselves menaced by the spirits from beyond. POLTERGEIST it ain't.<br/><br/>Instead, this is a convoluted and complicated film, but watching it closely isn't really rewarding, it just allows you to follow the storyline somewhat. This time around, there's a back story that takes place in the 1980s and a side story involving some supporting characters, so it's all fairly complex, but unfortunately it's a case of the 'same old' when it comes to the horror.<br/><br/>You know: wardrobe doors opening on their own, figures seen in the background of bedrooms, characters who seem unable to successfully light their own homes. This seems to be part of a new trend in the genre, but I'm finding it frankly tiresome and, unbelievably, it's made me miss the classic stalk-and-slash scares of old.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the cast is also entirely lacking, particularly Rose Byrne, who has undergone drastic weight loss and seems to have lost her talent alongside. Patrick Wilson gives a cheesy turn and Barbara Hershey, well let's just say THE ENTITY was a long time ago. It doesn't help that the increasingly silly plot elements, such as possession by a serial killer, fail to gel with the storyline overall leaving this a convoluted mess."
"alanclarke714","9","3","5","13 September 2013"," A Worthy Horror Sequel That's Somewhat Different
","With Insidious, James Wan and Leigh Whannell introduced us to the Lambert family, who were being tormented by beings that existed in a realm called The Further. Dalton, one of two sons of Renai and Josh Lambert, can create an astral projection of himself when he sleeps. With the end of the first film, the family thinks it's all over and they can finally settle down. But when more dire and disturbing happenings grip the family, they soon figure out that Josh, who ventured into the Further to save Dalton, is not really Josh, but an evil spirit that will do anything to live again.<br/><br/>James Wan is the master of the horror film. Yes, The Exorcist is a classic, as is Alien and Psycho, but every horror movie James Wan has directed are anywhere from good to phenomenal, especially with his other film this year, The Conjuring, which set the bar for future horror films. Insidious Chapter 2 I would not compare to The Conjuring because, well, it's not based on a true story and it is a sequel. This does not mean, though, it is any less disturbing or frightening. With a few nods to Stephen King's The Shining (Josh looking like a completely insane father out for blood), Insidious Chapter 2 felt like a roller-coaster of intensity. The acting was top-notch, especially newcomer Steve Coulter, who plays Carl, an old friend of Elise. Patrick Wilson was just downright creepy here, being possessed by the Bride in Black. Like the first film, the musical score was unsettling, frightening and memorable (if you saw the first movie, you know the theme well). The production, the set pieces were all fantastic, with the hospital being a very, very haunting addition, adding to the already eerie atmosphere. The script was very good and well-written, with a surprisingly great balance of some witty comedy from Specs and Tucker, and terrifying scares.<br/><br/>Insidious Chapter 2 I would say, is neither better nor worse than the first chapter, because the story is more grounded, acting as more a psychological thriller than a supernatural horror film. But with how the film ends, they can easily make Chapter 3 that can end this horror series before it becomes like Saw and Paranormal Activity; having sequels that get worse and worse as it goes."

Patrick Wilson is predictable in his character, whilst Rose Byrne's character is in a constant state of terror, shock, and unstable irrationality.

A haunting? A murder mystery? Paranormal investigation? Inter-dimensional time travel? It's all of these, which means it has a pretty big identity crisis, coming off as a schizophrenic jumble of half-realized ideas and tried, horror clichés.<br/><br/>The jump scares are again plentiful, but are wasted on horror vets as we've seen all this before. The jarring audio cues are back from the first film, again letting you know via sudden, high-decibel jolts that THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SCARY PART.<br/><br/>The cast reprise their roles from the first film, including the duo of paranormal researchers who provide unnecessary comic relief and tend to suck all the tension out of any scene they are in.<br/><br/>Insidious 2 suffers from too many things going on at once. I found I wanted to know more about Parker and his story than anything else but like many things in the film, it was never explained. There is also another tedious, open-ending to this film, no doubt allowing for a third installment to make more money.<br/><br/>James Wan shows potential as a horror director and I quite enjoyed ""the Conjuring"" but he's not in the same league as classic films such as ""the Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""the Others"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" and I'm not sure he ever will be. I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the high point of both these films for me was the beautiful old homes and sets they shot in.

","There were points in the movie where I was surprised, but never truly frightened.<br/><br/>It's formulaic, it's predictable, and it's just plain not scary.<br/><br/>Most movies use foreshadowing. They want to be clever and make us guess at what's coming. If the director is good at it, you'll either be misdirected for a bigger set-up or get just enough to find little bits and pieces of information that keep it interesting. No movie should let you figure out the plot from the clues unless you're Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>But this movie practically ruins itself! The suspense was never there for me because it was given away by a veritable Reeses pieces trail. The director couldn't have done a worse job if he'd included small cut-scenes where he told you what to expect in the next scene. OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point. <br/><br/>The reasons that I'm giving even giving this movie a 6 out of 10 are. 1. It has some new takes on overdone horror themes. 2. Because halfway through, I made the mental shift to enjoy this as a comedy adventure rather than a horror movie. It made it a lot more enjoyable when I lowered my expectations and shifted genres."

","To be fair, some people will love this film. Its not for everyone and if you were even the slightest bit disappointment in the first I would waste your time. It is mild and a gradual plot.The suspension is variable but is aided by a dramatic score.<br/><br/>The initial back story is a elaborate, but ensures it is not essential to watch the prequel first. The plot is predictable with characters making obvious statements of where the plot is going. It was not needed and would of been more suspenseful without. I thought some of the characters where poorly developed, and their attempts of funny one liners distracted and interrupted the theme.<br/><br/>The climax gave us a glimpse into of the potential of this film with a dramatic fight scene, too little too late unfortunately. The film concluding with foresight into the sequel. Another one to miss I Think."

There's an old bloke with a beard and i have no idea who he is, but he seems to like or work with ""specs"". There's a police interview which I can't even begin to explain, a lot of murders and someone called Parker, who again i have no idea how he fits into all this other than he was a patient at the hospital where the grandma used to work. Parkers mother seems have orchestrated the whole thing, they contact some spirits but i'm not sure if that's Parkers mother or Josh's mother or just some random spirit.<br/><br/>Put it this way, the story, if there was one, is rubbish and could have been told with half the characters they used. I'm not a stupid person, i just didn't care enough about any of the characters. If there were different timelines then that would explain a lot but they keep doing that damn thing where the screen goes black and i'm not sure if they are re-appearing in another time, location, world or whatever. and i didn't care."

","Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) 7 out of 10: A horror ghost movie sequel what could be scarier. Those still terrified after Poltergeist 2 and 3 and Blair Witch 2 I have some good news. Insidious bucks that trend and provides a sequel at the same level or even better than the original movie.<br/><br/>The Good: Patrick Wilson is the key here. Without an actor of his caliber, I am not sure the film would work at all. He is asked to do some hefty lifting, and his George Lutz style characterization would make James Brolin proud.<br/><br/>The film also avoids the inadvertent hilarity that has plagued some of its contemporaries. No-one is naked wearing a goats head in this one.<br/><br/>As an aside, my wife liked this movie. My wife at best tolerates horror movies and often falls asleep in what I suspect is a defense mechanism. But she was engaged and now wants to see Insidious 3.<br/><br/>The Bad: I am not afraid of no ghosts. Why are any the characters scared half the time? There is a lot made of how a children's toy (An obnoxious baby walker that is festooned with lights and noisemakers and was a gift from something evil.) justs makes noises on its own. Well, anyone with kids will tell you those toys will go off on their own on a fairly regular schedule.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the following query, how can ghosts work in a house with cats? I mean I live in a decent sized house. But I also have five cats. If I hear a crashing sound in another room, my first thought is not visitors from another realm it's a feline that is unhappy with the beef mix Friskies offering. If objects are moved around apparently on their own, I assure you I am looking for telltale paw prints not ectoplasm.<br/><br/>While I do like the way, the movie doesn't hand hold I admit I was a bit lost when threads were seeming dropped and new characters appeared out of nowhere. For example, there is a whole plot point about Patrick Wilson being a suspect in Lin Shaye's murder at the end of the last film. A plot point complete with police interrogation and stern police detectives that seems like it is going to play a significant role at the beginning of the movie, only to be quickly dropped and never brought up again. I mean it is a murder charge, not a traffic ticket. They are not going to drop the charges because you claim the voices have left your house.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Oh goody comic relief. The comic relief is so broad I half expected the ghost of Jim Varney to show up and start a routine, hey Vern check this out I am going to vacuum one of these Poultry Goosts. Oh no, there are two of them, and they are both trying to pee on me. Oh no Vern they have crossed the streams.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: I liked this movie. It is a proper horror movie, yet it is one that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Patrick Wilson classes the place up, but there was good acting all the way around. Plus this one avoided the sappiness of the first film for the most part and for that I thankful."

"TheLittleSongbird","5","1","1","18 October 2018"," Love versus evil
","It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.<br/><br/>Although there are people who understandably dislike it, found myself enjoying the first 'Insidious'. It didn't blow me away but it was well made and genuinely scary. So watched 'Insidious: Chapter 2' hoping it would be as good. 'Insidious: Chapter 2' for me was a watchable second entry but comparing it to the first, it is not as good and a disappointment in comparison. There are big drawbacks but there are good things here too.<br/><br/>First and foremost, 'Insidious' llooks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The effects are also suitably eerie. Although a bit too loud in spots, the music is hauntingly atmospheric.<br/><br/>James Wan directs with ease and real engagement and there are some genuine shocks and some creepy scares and dread. The first part is not as restrained as the first part of the first film, but when the film takes more time it is very effective. The acting, with the first film's cast returning, is good, with a particularly strong performance from Patrick Wilson. Did care for the characters, they were not ones that bored or frustrated me. The threat looks good and provides some eeriness.<br/><br/>Regrettably, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' has drawbacks. It does lack tension and suspense and other scares are predictable and felt like throwing in as many horror elements as one can muster regardless of originality. Some of the film is on the dull side, while the second half gets far too camp and histrionic, towards the end things get so over-the-top and senseless that one is laughing rather than feeling scared.<br/><br/>Moreover, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' fails to make sense and gets muddled in the latter stages, with an ending that's rushed, convoluted, silly and clichéd. The first film was derivative, this is even more so with the similarities to 'Psycho' and 'The Shining' being blatant and somehow not feeling like homages. The predictability factor is high and the script is also far worse here, very awkward and corny with some comedy that felt like it just didn't belong.<br/><br/>Concluding, a watchable second entry but underwhelming. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Sherazade","6","1","1","13 January 2014"," The Hunter, Ninja & Bear guys ruined this one...
","part one was much scarier and much more focused, this one was all over the place even though I get why it was. How did I know they would take ""The Exorcist"" approach to explain why that particular ghost singled out Josh to haunt since his childhood? I have to say I am glad this one wasn't as scary as the first because there is only so much the heart can take but that said I wish they would have dialed down the comic relief offered up by Elise's associates; Specs and what's his face? Initially, they were welcomed scene-robbers but their sch-tick got very old very quickly and they ended up settling just for being annoying additional characters. <br/><br/>As we all suspected from the ending of part one, it wasn't Josh who came back into his body after rescuing his son Dalton from ""the further"" and part two pretty much picks up from where part one left off and we get a back-story into the world that Josh's mum had suppressed when he was a child."

","Let me start by saying, this movie doesn't make much sense at all until the finale. Josh's peculiar behaviour throughout the film is not scary, but rather annoying. His denial of their fears, while the theatrics are lame, irritate me greatly. The piano playing by itself, the baby walker going off by itself... lame scares. I looked to enjoy the film and as I write this; the movie plays as a rental in the background. My boyfriend likes it after we watched it in the theater. I fell asleep then, I will do the same once I submit this review. This time, it will be more acceptable. I'm on my own couch rather than the lounge chair of the cineplex and we paid $1.00 for the rental from Red box rather than $30+ for the theatrical experience. I don't feel, this time, I am wasting a night of my life or my hard earned money :) save both and enjoy a true horror film... those produced prior to the 21st century! Good night."

","I was quick pumped to see this film being a big fan of the first, but ended up let down. Unlike the first, the scares are to few and sometimes predictable, and just aren't as fighting as the first's. The story also seemed a little similar and not really that new, which made it all the more unoriginal. I was rather annoyed how long it took for things to get into full swing and makes you look at your watch wondering ""When the hell are thing going to get crazy?"". By the end of the film I wasn't really that surprised how it concluded and that they set us up for a 3rd. In conclusion I think that since the first was so scary, one would expect is 2nd to be as/more scary, and sadly it was less which may be a let down for some fans of the first."
"quincytheodore","6","1","1","30 September 2013"," Lackluster, timid version of the first.
","There is something more frightening than any curse or apparition that resides in movies; it is the blight of terrible sequel, and Insidious: Chapter 2 is haunted by it. Audience would come and expect the same terror from the original, but sadly will only find inferior version of it, a formulaic possession horror flick with little charm and plenty of high pitch noises. To its credit, it does bring some good acting and direction. The script also works as a continuation, but perhaps because the mystery has dwindled; it only manages to be an average horror without the same chill its predecessor has.<br/><br/>Story follows the events of Insidious where Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) returned with his son from the Further, an astral realm. However, an entity is believed to be latching onto him as the clairvoyance Elise Ranier (Lin Shaye) is found dead near him. His family grows restless from the apparent continuous haunting and ultimately tries to solve the problem despite the grim obstacles ahead. The plot is rather bland, there's simply a lack of tension as the terrorizing entity is somewhat predictable and plastic.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson delivers a good performance, he displays more variety of emotions to establish the dread. In some scenes he gives off cold enigmatic feel to puzzle the audience. Returning cast reprise their roles, Ross Bryne as Renai Lambert does a fine job, although her display of motherly concern at the first title was slightly better. The two ghost hunters are back, this time for more comedy relief than anything. There are probably too many humorous scenes, some are unintentional, in this sequel.<br/><br/>Its use of music is cringe-worthy, in fact even with only the sound, it'd be quite terrifying. The scares don't have the same weight though, as they are reduced to simple bursts rather than real frightful ones. James Wan's camera angle is great; he casually makes the viewers think there might be more in scenes than there really are, especially with a hint of contrasting color, shadowy background or some objects in outer peripheral vision.<br/><br/>The movie does poorly when the mystic of its entities is unveiled. Getting into fisticuffs with ghosts diminish the atmosphere since they seem unreal, part of me inadvertently immediately knew it's just make-up and sound effect put together for an illusion. Take away the jarring build up, replace it with mediocre possession scheme, even if the directing is well done, and you'll have a subpar sequel. It still performs its scare tricks decently, so at the very least it'll make you flinch a couple of times."
"spencertuinei11","8","1","1","13 September 2013"," A Balanced Review
","To be brief, Insidious: Chapter 2 is a very stalwart seven in the horror genre, it's largest flaw being that the release date was too early after The Conjuring. Because of this, most critiques are going to be in contrast to The Conjuring; which is considered by most as James Wan's gem, & revere it as a horror classic. Comparing the 2 films will give anyone unrealistic hopes & expectations of the film, as the two's goals are fundamentally different. The Conjuring pays homage to 70's horror; from how it was directed, choice of score, & in great detail in the entirety of the plot, leaving the impression that you've just watched a very thoroughly-planned and well- executed film. Insidious 2, is a modern horror, intended more for audiences who look for very deliberate scares, & at a faster pace. The Conjuring overall is by far a better film, but in all honesty, Insidious 2 delivers better scares. <br/><br/>The film's first act does well to set pace & put viewers back into the seat of the Insidious world, which seemed a difficult hurdle to leap, but was actually tied up well by Wan. Several of the early scares are jump scares with little to no pay-off, but it quickly progresses into the plot- driven scares. One complaint that I do have is that several of the scares are a bit heavy-handed, but if you've seen the first Insidious, then you know the type of scares that I'm talking about. I appreciate that this film takes you into the mythology of certain characters (no spoilers here) and does well to use all of the devices & information given to come to the resolution of the plot. It was written better than what I had expected for this sequel, & I'd have to say I'm pleased with how the main arc came to a conclusion.<br/><br/>It does delve into The Further, which some viewers not experienced with avant-garde theatre might find a bit off-putting, however I found that the scares there was by far the best plot-driven scenes, & gave me the worst chills of the film. <br/><br/>The score was magnificent, & I'm glad that this time around it didn't take precedence in scaring the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, it's no award winner, it's a horror flick, & it does what it does best."

","Check out my reviews on www.themovieboy77.com<br/><br/>Staring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Steve Coulter, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell.<br/><br/>Directed by: James Wan<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 takes place a short time after the incidents in the first film. Josh Lambert gets his son back from ""The Further"", a world full of ghosts and dark forces. Josh, however, starts acting weird and evil forces start to terrorize the family again. This time, there are a lot more twists and turns.<br/><br/>The opening scene explains some more information of Josh's origins with the afterlife when he was a child, and things start to make more sense as the film goes along. The origins of the black veld bride are explained and you start to feel that the family is in danger as they try to solve the mystery to stop the haunting.<br/><br/>The films scares are effective. The film has a ""haunted house"" feel to it, which is an aspect I love about horror movies. There are a few cheap jump scares, but the scares are mostly due to the intensity of the story. The tone of Insidious 2 is different from the first Insidious. The first insidious, while suspenseful, took time to ease you into the story, while Insidious 2 got right in your face from the get-go. The first Insidious was more about the family and the quest to get their son back, Insidious 2 is more about the afterlife and the origins behind the reasoning of the haunting. As things start to unravel, you feel more on the edge of your seat. You really start to feel that everybody is in danger.<br/><br/>The whole movie plays out very well, but I felt the final act to be somewhat disappointing, and at points, comical. It had a bit of a ""Shining"" feel to it. I won't give it away, as the ending is the most important part of the film. Although, the twists were very well done. As you watch the film, you can't help but give a ""oh, that makes sense"" reaction.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson plays a more ""sinister"" Josh Lambert. I'm starting to become a fan of Patrick Wilson, who was also in James Wan's 'The Conjuring'. I enjoy his calming presence to the roles he's played in James Wan's films. He abandons his calming roots, and goes into a more angry character. He brought a lot of suspense to his scenes and, at times, made you hate him a little. I enjoyed the choice to give the afterlife more of a back story, and while some may find the origins a little comical, I find it to be quite haunting. Although, at times, the film seems a little too busy, jumping from story to story, making you feel a little lost as to what is happening.<br/><br/>This is said to be James Wan's last horror film, which gives me a very bittersweet feeling. The guy is a great horror director, but it's great that he wants to branch out and do more things. To me, Insidious 2 is my least favourite from him, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was a great continuation from the original, but after seeing The Conjuring, I know the man is capable of doing more than this. The film, sometimes, relies on cheap jump scares, which takes the affect away from the story being told. I've never felt that was the way James Wan wanted his horror movies to be portrayed. He is a great story telling, and doesn't need to rely on jump scares to be scary. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more from him in different genres.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

"rivertam26","5","4","11","12 September 2013"," disappointing
","James Wan is hot right now. After establishing himself in The Saw Series and than bludgeoning that franchise into the ground he made a huge return with Insidious establishing that he was great at setting a suspenseful mood enhanced with nightmarish imagery. He solidified those talents with this year's genre masterpiece The Conjuring, the scariest movie I've ever seen and an absolute instant classic. With hopes raised so high it's hard for Insidious Chapter 2 to not be a disappointment. I just never thought it would be this big of a disappointment. Following the events of the original movie we once again find ourselves with the Lambert clan as the mystery is enhanced and unraveled concerning the demonic presence that wanted to get into Josh's body. I really loved the first film. The first half is absolutely terrifying in an expected sort of way but when the plot veers into astral projection it lost a lot of people but not me it was so bizarre and twisted I found myself even more freaked out. People who had a huge problem with the film's second half will have an even harder time with this film because it mostly takes place in that bizarre universe. There are some clever goods here not to spoil anything for those intent on suffering through it. But despite the cleverness it's feels overly gimmicky, a lot of it just doesn't make any sense and the attempts at juvenile humor are only partially funny because of their forced absurdity and not that they are breaking any of the film's tension like in the first film. As for that heavy dread induced atmosphere he has become such a master at. it's not existent here we are instead punished with bouts of forced melodrama, insane campiness and one cheap scare after the next (I mean really this baby walker needs to go). Sadly there are some good ideas here. The only summation I could come up with especially with the vastly superior Conjuring and this film coming out so close together is that he spent all of his time executing that first movie and when approached about a sequel to Insidious he said awesome I have a great idea for that flick and than just kinda lost interest. Too sad because what could have been a unique spin on the haunted movie sub genre has instead become a by the numbers unintentional laugh fest. Not to say it's the worst film I've seen this year or the worst horror sequel (the grudge 2) but it's definitely a franchise killer. **.5/5"

At first it didn't make much sense but as the movie continued, different secrets unfolded and it was far easier to understand. The special effects were great as well and there were SO many pop outs!

While I was sitting there on the edge of my seat, waiting for some sort of encounter with the Bride in Black, it ended up bringing nothing to the table. In fact, this exact scene gets revisited later on in the movie.<br/><br/>This film contradicts itself and dumbs down the characters. Remember what the wife saw in the camera at the end of the first one? Good for you because apparently she doesn't. Instead she just accepts her husband as being her husband.<br/><br/>Let's throw in too many unintentionally funny scenes, an all too coincidental look at the history of Josh and the Bride in Black, mixed with cluttered sets and lack of suspense, and what do you have?<br/><br/>Insidious 2."

The Conjuring is superior in the fact that it remains haunting even after you watch it, while Insidious 2 truly adds to the over-arching storyline of the first movie, and allows you to appreciate the two films as a series since they intermingle. <br/><br/>***Very mild spoiler**<br/><br/>Chapter 2 takes you back to the first film and explains some of the scary moments in a way that was quite satisfying.

"Robert_duder","9","2","4","17 September 2013"," Easily met my expectations! Even smarter than the first. Wan and Whanell are Horror Genius'
","The first Insidious was easily one of the creepiest, best horror films I have ever seen. It was a solid 10 and gave me the chills and thrills like few horror movies ever do. I was thrilled to hear about this sequel but also a little cautious because how could they possibly follow up something so great and make it anywhere near as good. Well I can assure you that Insidious Chapter 2 knocks it out of the park. It isn't perfect and it falls short just a slight bit from the original amazing film but in other ways it is superior to the first film. Insidious Chapter 2 takes the story to a whole new level. Whereas the first movie provided a fairly typical possession story, with ghosts and demons and a family being terrorized this film took all of that and added an entire new level, depth, intellect and incredible story that launched Insidious into horror film hall of fame if it already wasn't there. I predict with another film or two (please keep making them!) that Parker Crane will be synonymous with Freddy Kreuger, Jason Voorhees or Jigsaw more recently. I won't go into details about Parker Crane but this film flawlessly combines The Exorcist, Psycho, Friday The 13th and Amityville Horror and the potential behind this franchise could bury all of those.<br/><br/>I do love Patrick Wilson and in the first film I thought he was fantastic at being the doting father and a down to earth man you could relate to and root for. Insidious Chapter 2 gives him an entirely new character arc to sink his teeth into and he nails it. This is equivalent as far as I'm concerned to Ryan Reynolds brilliant turn in the Amityville Horror remake. This was a new level for Wilson and it was terrific. Rose Byrne also returns as his wife. Byrne is good and their chemistry is very good. My issue with her is that she does a lot of crying in this film and very little else. I didn't feel like she was as strong as some of the other cast members and some of the plot holes I noticed this time around had to do with her character. Still Byrne is decent and I'm glad she came back again. Barbara Hershey gets a much more significant part in the sequel. She is very good as Wilson's mother and this time she plays investigator as she goes hunting for the mystery behind the thing haunting her family. Steve Coulter joins the cast as the lead psychic taking over from Lin Shaye (who does return as well in a smaller role.) Coulter is decent but I think it might have been really cool and very effective to have someone significant play the role...a major cameo. Still Coulter is good and plays the part very well. As mentioned Lin Shaye returns in her role and she is as good as she was in the first film, although a smaller part and a very different aspect to her character. The most impressive thing about Shaye's character was the girl that played the younger version of her (Lindsay Seim) who bore a striking resemblance to her and I assume they used Shaye's voice as hers because it was remarkable and a very cool aspect of the film to give it a very authentic feel. Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson also return as Specs and Tucker. They were certainly the comic relief in the first film but done so in an appropriate manner and it was the same in this film. They had a few awkwardly funny moments (in a good way) but less than the first. This time they got a little more depth to their characters and more scenes but the comedy angle was done properly too only serving to just barely break the tension for a fleeting moment.<br/><br/>James Wan returns to direct this instalment and I can pretty honestly say together with his partner Leigh Whannell, these guys dominate the horror genre. They single handedly rule it. The Saw franchise (started by them) gave new life to the horror genre and spawned COUNTLESS copy cats. The Conjuring, Insidious and now its sequel were just terrific paranormal thrillers. They craft very complex stories but impressively so. They built exponentially on the first Insidious and in one film created an incredible amount of lore and back story to build on in future films. While Insidious: Chapter 2 didn't quite give me the creeps like the first film did, it was ten times smarter and therefore incredibly entertaining. That isn't to say there aren't some very creepy moments. There are a few things in the background of scenes that you catch briefly that will send you into chills. No matter how you look at it, this is a very worthy sequel and an absolute must see following the first incredible film. 9/10"

","I am an absolute fan of James Wan's recently filmography, my favorite being Insidious. I had high hopes for this movie, and although not in the way I expected, the movie satisfied my love for the first film and provided me with more to think about for the next three years. The movie had me engaged from start to finish, and uniquely split the movie into edge-of-your seat terror and mind blowing suspense. If you love hardcore scares though, the ""mystery side of the film still gave (and still gives) me chills, so the overall feel may still deprive me of my otherwise consistent sleep. The camera angles and the plot connections to the first movie are simply extraordinary! Although it is not the scare machine that the first is, and although it had no freaky random face behind the main characters head out of nowhere, it still provided me with the mind consuming, parasitic feeling that the fist film did. All and all, I have no disappointment in Insidious: Chapter Two! Bravo James Wan! <br/><br/>*****THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE FILM WITH SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONFUSED*****<br/><br/>Lets just say this to begin. The first movie connects directly to this movie. Like, the first movie writes out the second. When the movie begins, it shows a young Elise (kudos to the actress who plays her, she looks and sounds a lot like the ""old"" Elise) helps out young Lorraine with her son, Josh, who is inflicted with extreme night terrors of an old woman. Then, the movie picks up right into the cold-blooded murder of Elise in our ""present time."" In the movie, we later learn that Josh is truly stranded in the further, the ""old woman,"" truly a serial killer (and a man), Parker Crane is possessing Josh in the physical world and Dalton is picking up on the trouble with his dad. When all the dust clears, the possessed Josh attempts to kill for his corrupt dead mother while the real Josh runs around the Further and alters the events of the first movie while trying to destroy the essence of our ghostly antagonist. Josh finds Elise, who we learn is still secretly helping the men Specs and Tucker (from the first film). Josh and Elise destroy the entity and Josh lives in his own body again, and the Lamberts ride off into the fluffy sunset of unicorns, rainbows and marshmallows. Well, what the hell James Wan!? Oh wait, Wan wouldn't ever provide that kind of disappointment in any movie (with the exception of the Conjuring)... The film ends with the Specs and Tucker duo investigating another possession. While Specs and Tucker stall the home-owners, the dead Elise sneaks into the house and stares into a dark corner of the house to see the entity apparently haunting the family in the home. Although we do not see the entity itself, we see Elise in a state of total peril as she sais, ""oh my GOD!"" as the movie goes into credits and our ears are shot out by the beloved music of the franchise. Que chapter three!"

","I just came back from the late night launch and my throat is killing me from screaming. I went into the film 50/50 because I loved the 1st one and read that this one had a better story but lacked the scares. Well, I agree that the story is more developed and a lot better, along with explaining some events from the 1st film. The scares were jacked up too IMO. Tucker and Specs returned as the comic relief of the film and did a good job in doing so, albeit there were 1-2 moments that didn't involve them that were unintentionally funny, but that didn't spoil the film. <br/><br/>I am really pleased with the acting and creepiness of the storyline, which developed the story and characters and just made it better than the first, along with leaving an opening for a 3rd film.<br/><br/>Creepier, jumpier, scarier, better. 4/5"

","When the first insidious came out I thought it was one of the creepiest movies I had seen in years. Wasn't scary enough to keep me up at night but it was pretty damn creepy. Insidious chapter 2 is a direct sequel to the first film, it picks up right where the first one left off. This time around the horror dream team James Wan And Leigh Whannell really toned down the scares and went for a more story based film. Fans of the first film will enjoy this film. I personally enjoyed this more than the first film because a lot of questions I had about the first film were finally explained. At the same time some of the key points were left out hopefully the third chapter will finally explain. Oh yea there will be a third one duh its a horror movie they never stop at 1 or 2. that's the only reason I couldn't give this movie a higher rating. This movie had very strong performances from the 2 leads Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne which is something you normally don't see in a horror movie. If you're looking for a fun time at the movies you should go see this movie. Packed with a lot of laughs and a couple big scares I recommend this movie to all horror film fans. 8/10<br/><br/>*but if you have not seen the first insidious do not I repeat DO NOT! Go see this movie until you have you will hate the movie because the plot won't make any sense. So if you do choose to go see this movie make sure you watch the first film."

","This review assumes people have already seen the original film; if you haven't seen it yet I'd definitely recommend watching it before watching this or it won't make much sense.<br/><br/>This film follows on shortly after the events of the first film. Josh and Renai Lambert have moved into Josh's mother's home, along with their children, and the police suspect Josh may be involved in the killing of psychic Elise Rainier. They had hoped that the strange events would have stopped but it soon becomes clear that whatever was haunting them has followed the family. Renai contacts Elise's associates, Tucker and Specs, and they start to investigate with the help of Carl, an old colleague of Elise. This leads to a series of creepy locations and the eventual identification of the being haunting the Lambert family.<br/><br/>Horror is a fairly personal genre; a film that will terrify one person may leave another wondering what all the fuss was about. I didn't find it all that scary but it did have its moments. It is refreshing to have modern horror that isn't particularly gory, has no particularly offensive language and no gratuitous sex/nudity... instead it achieves its goals through decent jump scares and a nice creepy atmosphere. The soundtrack impressively adds to this atmosphere. I didn't find it as good as the first film but found it enjoyable enough. The story has some interesting ideas and others that seemed to be inspired by better films... most obviously 'Psycho'. The cast does a solid enough job with the material. Overall a decent enough film if you enjoyed the first."

","The Second chapter for this awesome horror series picks off exactly from the end of the first movie with the death of Elise. This time its Josh who is affected with the image of the woman in black from his childhood. Josh is a suspect for the death of Elise, so they stay with his mother Lorraine whilst police check for evidence. However, shortly after their arrival, the parasites then begin to try and take over Josh's body; as he has been to the Further before.<br/><br/>The second chapter is very similar to the first. However their is more showings of the other characters. There are many scary scenes, and an awful lot of job scares. There is also a change of scenery then the old house, as about half hour of the film shows an abandoned hospital. The thing that i really like here is how the ghost that Josh has been seeing was a patient in the hospital, who use to dress up as the woman to commit murders. I thought that this was a clever idea. <br/><br/>I still feel that chapter 1 was slightly better than the second one. This is because the story was much more simple, and easier to understand than the second one. But again, actors are outstanding, music is awesome and the jump scares are fantastic. This is turning out to be one of my favorite horror series, and i recommend this title."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","0","2 March 2018"," Insidious Chapter 2 continues the eerie creepy atmosphere that it's predecessor delicately crafted.
","It's not often you get a sequel, particularly in horror, that is nearly as good as the original. For me, this sequel did the trick. Continuing straight where the last film left off, the Lambert family are still being terrified and so they attempt to find out who is really haunting them and finish this once and for all. As with any instalment in this franchise, we have jumps scares galore, ghostly spirits in questionable fashion attire and plenty of backhanding (seriously this ghost smacks everyone). The story gets slightly convoluted and confusing for the sake of continuity, doesn't work all the time...to the point where it's paradoxical. Whilst the majority of the scares are predictable and just loud noises, the film took more of a thriller approach rather than a straight up horror flick. In my opinion, this worked better. James Wan knew not to compete with the first instalment and so he took the franchise in a different direction, and it worked. Particularly towards the end where there are moments of real tension. The Lambert family go through a lot, I mean any other family would go ""nope. Nope I'm out of here."" and just keep running away. So the scares, pretty much the same as the first film. Ghostly figures, noises from the baby monitor, piano mysteriously playing and one heck of an annoying child's toy/buggy/pram/whatever the flip it is. Problem is, whenever these scenes occur the actual jump scare is followed by a loud concoction of string instruments and you're actually more scared of that then what's on screen. The musical score is consistently good though, I mean those violins still give me nightmares. All the performances were good once again, always have a soft spot for Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne. James Wan is the king of modern horror, his slow tracking and panning shots are fantastic...add in ghosts hiding in the background and it just heightens the experience. This is a good horror sequel, which is rare for me to say these days."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","0","0","29 November 2017"," Disappointing sequel
","The 105-minute ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is an American horror film from 2013, so this one will have its 5th anniversary next year. The title already gives away that this is a sequel and also what it follows up to. They got basically back all the key players from the first film in terms of cast, but also writer and director James Wan came back, which is no surprise as the first was really a big success and it was also a pretty good movie in my opinion. By the way, the gap between films 1 and 2 was 3 years and 2 years later, the third film followed. A 4th film seems in the making now, so the franchise is still going strong. Or somewhat strong I guess. But now back to this original sequel: I personally liked the first and I was pretty disappointed by how forgettable this one turned out. The atmospheric take was fairly shoddy, the actors are not given any material to shine either. Overall, the story-telling is extremely mediocre. There is not one point where this film is really on failure level, but it's also never above-average and the first was throughout its entirety. A horror films always defines itself through the scare factor and this one is packed with jump scares that honestly are more on the side of waking the audience up again than entertaining or frightening it, even if admittedly some of the creatures used during these jump scare moments didn't look too bad. Byrne's (still) amazing looks cannot make up for the films gigantic weaknesses in so many other areas of production. The series should have ended after this sequel, or even better before it as I am not too hopeful about the next movies being any better as the main cast seems gone. Anyway, what else can you say here. It's probably not an overrated film at all as the reception wasn't on a good level by any definition, but the curiosity about what happens next may turn this into the epitome of an overseen movie (don't mix this up with ""overlooked"") as in the sense of the opposite of underseen if I see how many rated this one here on IMDb, even got above the magical 100k ratings mark. Liking the first is not reason enough to watch this one. Loving maybe. Or just a huge interest in horror films in particular. But the different worlds/spheres scenes at the core of the film's plot are just so difficult to like and appreciate for me. I give this one a thumbs-down. A clear decline in quality is undeniable and you may wanna skip it."
"davispittman","7","0","0","29 November 2017"," Not as strong as #1, but still good
","Insidious Chapter 2 (2013) is not to the quality level of the first movie. I'll just start out by saying that, because it's true that the first is stronger, but that doesn't mean that this sequel isn't still good. This sequel picks up exactly where the first one left off. So make sure and watch the first one first. So if you've seen the first one, then you'll know that the first one ends with the death of Lin Shaye's character, death by Patrick Wilsons character. We don't know how it's possible that this could happen, everything seemed completely fine and then he strangles her to death after she takes his picture for some unknown reason. This movie is all about finding out why he did such a horrible thing and the backstory that goes into all that. The reasoning and backstory is all very interesting and that's what will keep the audiences attention throughout. I loved the acting in this movie, all the previous actors reprise their roles here and they all do well, just as they did previously. The writing isn't quite as solid as the first movie, but the places where the writing in this one gets good is when everything is being explained. Why Patrick Wilsons character, josh, seems almost possessed and how exactly all that happened. There are several scenes that are genuinely scary and will very likely frighten just about anyone, so horror fans will not be disappointed. Overall, this is an entertaining scary installment in the insidious movie franchise. 7/10 for Insidious Chapter 2."

","I'm always afraid when I see a sequel to a movie that made success in the box office. Usually it never lends itself to anything. In this case, however, I think I make an exception. Despite not having even half the strength, impact and suspense of the first film, ""Insidious 2"" is far from a lost case. It maintains the cast, environment and history of the first film, to which he is umbilically linked, following up on his story and creating a kind of temporal paradox. I believe that this paradox, in which certain characters advance and recede in time, is an element that must have made a lot of confusion for some people, but I dealt well with it and even found it interesting. I think it fits the story well. In fact, the way both films intertwine is truly intelligent. Unfortunately, it ends up being a problem for those who did not see the first movie, because it does not understand part of what are watching. I did not really enjoy the way some characters tried to make humour and introduce some comic flashes in the movie. It is not a necessary feature, since this film does not have the tension and density that the first film had to spare. Concerning the performance of the actors there is little to add. What was said for the first film is for this one. So, we can say that this film is a sequel that does honor to the first film and that was cleverly developed, although without the impact achieved in the initial film."

Insidious: Chapter 2 takes place directly after the first, and continues with part of the plots conflict. The movie does take a similar haunting theme, although it is slightly different as the first. I found this movie more engaging as the first, because it makes you think a lot about the unknown pieces of information that would reveal import clues to the mystery part of the movie. I would say the first movie was scarier, but this movie was slightly jumpier. (I might be wrong) But I liked this movie, and if you've watched the first movie, you gotta watch this.

","At its time of release, Insidious was hailed by numerous critics & viewers alike as one of the finest works of contemporary horror, a consensus I didn't agree with at all. For me, it had the ingredients to finish as one of the most effective chillers, not to mention that its first half was a masterwork of tension building but, thanks to the utterly ridiculous & laughable set of events that unfolded in the next half, the entire experience was pretty much ruined.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 suffers from the same issues that plagued its predecessor, in addition to a few more. James Wan once again succeeds in establishing an unnerving atmosphere and employs both camera & sound to good effect but it lacks the freshness of the original, its storyline is predictable, and the surprises are few & far in between, not to mention that its moments of tension don't linger for long unlike before, thus diminishing their impact by an extent.<br/><br/>Picking up right where the first film left off, the story of Insidious: Chapter 2 follows the Lambert family as they relocate to a different house while police investigates everything that transpired at their previous residency. Soon, the family comes to realise that whatever was haunting them back in their old house has followed them to the new place, and with Josh exhibiting strange behaviour, the ladies take it upon themselves to get to the truth of all this & end it for once n all.<br/><br/>Directed by James Wan (best known for Saw & The Conjuring), Insidious: Chapter 2 begins with a prologue that covers the part that was only hinted in the previous chapter while also playing a key role later in the story. Numerous moments tie up with events that were left unexplained in the first chapter but it still doesn't pack a strong punch this time. The tone is darker than the last time and suspense builds up quickly too but the story just isn't engaging enough on an emotional level.<br/><br/>The look n feel of the first film is skilfully duplicated but just like before, all the scenes taking place in purgatory realm are facepalm-inducing. The ghosts look funnier than frightening, and the scares work best only when the poltergeist activities are ongoing. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey & Ty Simpkins return to reprise their previous roles but their performances aren't any better than the last time plus the characters remain just as uninteresting as before.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Insidious: Chapter 2 works in bits n pieces and is able to use its setting & eerie atmosphere to desired effect at times but it is so predictable & lacking in surprises that just sitting through this sequel is a tedious job in itself. The non-linear narrative structure fails to conceal the shortcomings in its plot & characters and the negatives outweighs the positives by a considerable extent this time. Fans of the original may find a few redeemable qualities about this second chapter but for me, Insidious: Chapter 2 is instantly forgettable."

","I recently watched Insidious: Chapter 2, a heart-thumping as well as bone-chilling sequel to Insidious and really loved it. The overall plot is awesome and so is the acting. The first part of the series was not so good, because of too much plot and character building. The sequel has definitely exploded the bombs that were silently set in up in the first movie. There is teeth-chattering suspense throughout the movie and the occasional unforeseen appearances of horror elements can really make people scream their lungs out. The first part was about a father saving his son from a demon by going into ""The Further"" and the movie has a cliffhanger ending. The start of the sequel confirms our suspicions about the absence of the real father. The rest of the movie is about how the family faces the impending horror. I wouldn't want to reveal too much about the ending, but I can surely say this much that it is absolutely not a disappointing ending. Overall, I would give it a rating of 7.5/10."

","Tobe Hooper made the often-cited scariest movie ever made, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. For twelve years, fans demanded more but how could Hooper top what was claimed perfection? A balls to the wall parody of the original was the only way to find new insanity.<br/><br/>Horror tag team Wan and Whannell struck the same success, almost 100 times profit on their budget. Insidious 2 was a no-brainer and although they don't go for broke like Hooper, this sequel possesses the formula of the original with entirely bizarre new life. Constantly teasing those similar moments of cleverness found in the first Saw, Insidious 2 addresses the first and instills new meaning behind some of the scares.<br/><br/>Much like the first, there is an even more apparent mix of warm familiarity and strange originality. Working with classic conventions of haunted houses and possessions, the Insidious films have an old school feeling. Not just reminiscent of the similar Poltergeist but even further back to Méliès and Wiene surreal theatrics of silent horrors. Even if you aren't part of the masses who jump at every piercing stinger of the dilapidated score, there are plenty of kooky visuals that make exploring the afterlife fun.<br/><br/>As for the story, this is where the sequel falls short of the initial success in less is more. If you were critical on that third act turn to more Beetlejuice-esque antics, then this one delivers that in spades. With multiple stories all interweaving through time and worlds, the intense engagement of the first is diminished noticeably. While unabashedly fun, it becomes harder to relate to the continued hauntings of the Lamberts.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is delightfully hammy, genuinely performing as if he were a spirit excited to torment people once again in the living world. Unfortunately, his standout delivery leaves the always wonderful Rose Byrne and the rest of the cast looking clueless as to his not-so- secret condition.<br/><br/>The elegant subtitle of Chapter 2 perfectly encapsulates the film. Very much a straight-forward continuation of the first Insidious, but building on fresh and entertaining elements only introduced late into Chapter 1."

","There exist three types of ""sequels"" in the horror movie industry Sequels in name only, which have absolutely nothing to do with the events of the original. Normal or regular sequels, which refer or build onward on the events of the original but can be enjoyed separately still. And then finally there are sequels, although a minority, which you simply cannot begin to watch without having seen the original because the story lines of both are interwoven. ""Insidious 2"" is such a sequel. Don't you just love it when they are making a sequel in order to clarify and explain the convoluted and twisted plot of the original, only to end up with two utterly complex and confusing movies instead of one! Preferably you should even watch ""chapter I"" and ""chapter II"" back-to-back to fully comprehend everything. I watched them with an interlude of a few years and really had to dig deep in my memories to remember the details of the first film. But hey, let's first state clear that ""Insidious 2"" is an admirable fright-and-jump movie from the talented duo Leigh Wannell and James Wan who already proved that they are masters of horror and easily capable to make the hairs in the back of your neck rise. The Lambert family is still being haunted by ghosts regardless of where they live, and they come to the surface via the spiritual mediums Josh and his oldest son Dalton. Elise, the medium that that helped them to save the life of Dalton in the first film died in the last seance, but it seems as if she's still trying to warn the Lamberts for dangers from the other side, and thus Josh's mother Lorraine seeks the help of her old friend Carl. Meanwhile the police are investigating Elise's death and, since they obviously don't believe in ghosts, they want to frame Josh for murder. The main trumps of ""Insidious 2"" are strong performances (Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey always give their finest performances when directed by James Wan), a very patient but extremely atmospheric and ominous building of suspense, genuinely petrifying shock moments that manage to grab you by the throat even though you can see them coming and a handful of intriguing sub plots. The parallel plot of Parker Crane and his petrifying shrew of a mother, for example, is truly fascinating and re-establishes once again that Wan and Whannell are creative writers."

","Insidious: Chapter 2 is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a mostly impressive cast. As far as sequels go, it holds up very well in comparison to its original, they are both simple horrors that want to do nothing more than thrill, although I actually enjoyed this movie more, mainly because Rosa Byrne and Patrick Wilson get to shine a lot more, adding extra layers to these characters that I found much more effective than the first. It certainly lacks originality from its predecessor, it almost hits every single note the same way, it dosen't try hard enough to be different and really surprise viewers, and anyone who has seen the first movie will know what's coming from start to finish. I would blame the writing for the main weakness of this film, the cast and directing try their very best, but when it comes down to it, it's a poor script, it jumps around a lot, making it unclear where it is really going on several occasions, as well as unnecessarily lingering on certain plot points when the audience is anxious to keep things moving. Fun to watch with friends, but unless you're sensitive to horror, Insidious: Chapter 2 offers little thrills and lacks originality. <br/><br/>Two parents are desperate to prevent the malevolent spirits from haunting their family once again. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Rosa Byrne"
"Demetrius_Stork","9","0","0","29 November 2015"," Best horror sequel I've ever seen
","This movie really exceeded my expectations as far as what sequels to horror movies are capable of. This movie tied in well with the first film, while also developing a really interesting plot of its own. With the full cast returning, Insidious: Chapter 2 works with the same qualities as the first one making it very similar to the same great experience as the first.<br/><br/>The great score from the first one is back, including the same title card that fans of the first will enjoy. This music builds the same great atmosphere that made the first so good. The music cues are used with impeccable timing as well.<br/><br/>I find the scares in this movie to also be really good, arguably as good as the first. Although many seem to disagree with me, I find this movie does a great job of building suspense and paying it off with a quality scare. Many of the scares are similar to the first so if you find the first film scary, you should find this one scary as well.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie, I think, is an improvement on the first one. The kid has definitely improved as an actor from the first and Lin Shaye, who didn't do much for me in the first film, really stepped up in this installment. Rose Byrne is good once again and Specs and Tucker make a much welcome reappearance. I would argue that Specs and Tuckers are even funnier in this installment but that's just my opinion. Patrick Wilson is awesome in this movie as the main character Josh. He really gives an astoundingly good performance that I think people often over look. Certainly no Jack Torrance, but still creepy nonetheless.<br/><br/>The plot in this movie is awesome and I would argue is even more interesting than the first. The way it all comes together in the end is awesome and it really kept me invested throughout the film what was going to happen next. Not that the first film didn't do that either because it definitely did, but I found this one a little more interesting.<br/><br/>The sets in this movie are great too, albeit a little cliché. The hospital scenes and the secret room scene in Parker Crane's house are both really cool.<br/><br/>The villain is my favorite part of the movie because I end up sort of feeling sorry for him in the end, due to the unfortunate situation he's in and the reason for his insanity. The evil mom is great too, she honestly was the scariest part of the movie by far for me. The ghosts of the brides are creepy too and they have a really scary scene in Dalton's bedroom that I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>But like the first one there are a few things that hold this movie back from being 10/10. The first is close to the climax, where the family is under attack. Dalton has to go to sleep to astral project to save his father from the evil mother. While the door to the basement is getting smashed by a psychopathic killer and everyone is screaming, he falls asleep almost instantly. That's just stupid, how does this kid fall asleep so fast? How does he fall asleep at all? But the worst part is that this plot device goes literally nowhere. When Dalton astral projects, he doesn't do anything. Elise is the one that helps Parker Crane's soul go free and Josh is the one to defeat the evil mother. So Dalton has no purpose in this scene, but why? This is uncharacteristically stupid in a movie that is otherwise so good. It's unfortunate because if they had just simply not included this in the movie, the movie wouldn't have suffered at all. So why would James Wan ruin what could have honestly been his Magnum Opus(in my opinion)? Who knows.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie might be better than the first. It's plot is interesting, the acting is great and it's just plain scary. If you liked the first one, go see this movie! You'll have no regrets, I guarantee it."

","I was a fan of the first insidious and it gave me some genuine scares with the Darth maul look alike, but they lost the creepiness effect by showing too much of him. I finally got around to this one and it didn't have nearly the same effect as the first one. This could be due to the fact that it used the same formula and many aspects have already become cliché. In multiple instances, I could predict what was going to happen and when a cheap jump scare was going to occur. Also many of the creepy ghosts almost became funny based off of their attempt to be creepy. There also was the added forced comic relief by the duo, which seemed very out of place."

","Film is very gripping, scary and awesome. This movie is one of the best I have ever watched. I really like films that are talking about ghosts and their interaction in human world. This film describes the way to do astral projection. It is talking about the relationship between human world and world of spirits, and how to enter the spirit world. My favorite scene of this film is when the mother of Parker Crane attacks Cali and her mother. Also, I like the conjuring scene. However, I dislike ending scene, because it seems like the film is not finished yet, and I dislike the ""My name is Parker"" scene, because it seems a bit violent, but I really like this film."

","Director James Wan, the creator of the ""Saw"" Franchise, had quite the summer in 2013. His two films were released about a month apart and both made over $100 million. With ""The Conjuring"" being the biggest hit of the summer and launching yet another horror franchise. ""Insidious Chapter 2"" although not as successful as the original still will see many more Chapters.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of horror sequels ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" has the entire cast back and continues the story of the Lambert family and their battle with the ghosts, spirits, and demons that lurk in the further. The further being a purgatory like place for evil spirits looking return to the land of the living. The first film saw their son Dalton become lost in the further and now it his father Josh (played by Patrick Wilson) who must escape. The sequel definitely has it's inventive and creative good points, but its flaws are a little more visible than they were in the first film.<br/><br/>After the events of the first film, the Lambert family is now living with Josh's mother (Barbara Hershey), hoping the worst is behind them they try to resume their lives. The plot is heavy on back story with Josh's experiences with the Further as an 8 year old boy and the origins of his nemesis the bride in black. Back in the present more strange happenings continue to frighten his wife Renai (Rose Byrne). Josh also has been acting strange and not really himself. After a few scary incidents she contacts the paranormal hunters from the first film Tucker and Specs, one of them played by script writer Leigh Whannel. These two morons almost single handedly destroy the film with there terribly cheesy one liners and hammy acting that stopped any tension as soon as they appear. We find out that the real Josh is trapped in the further, while his earthly body is being taken over by a serial killer named Parker Crane, who also has some pretty shocking ties to the bride in black. The group of ghost hunters and his family have to battle some pretty nasty forces to get him back. The medium Elise (Lin Shaye) is back, but only as a helper in the further, as she was murdered at the end of the first movie. She gave the paranormal hunters the credibility it needed in the original, and is sorely missed here.<br/><br/>In a bit of creative genius while Josh tries to escape the further the filmmakers manage to work in and explain a lot of the noises and scenes from the first film through a different perspective. All while making it relevant to this film and not just used as filler as a lot of other movies do. The creepy scares are still there and its a very accomplished sequel but still not as good as the first. A third film the series is guaranteed with the final scene being ghost Elise, Tucker, and Specs visiting a new family and her staring into a corner of the house, her mouth wide open ""Oh my God"" Indeed."

","Trying to convince themselves the events are over, a family haunted by the spirits of the undead world they traveled to previously are shocked to learn the connection of those events and tries to end them before its' too late.<br/><br/>This one ended up being quite the impressive and wholly enjoyable sequel that's just barely above the outstanding original. The main feat here for this one is the fact of going around and finally giving a lot of explanation to what happened previously but doing so through the exploration of the sequences here as there's a lot of that throughout here. That this one manages to exploit this into explaining the few rather curious takes from the first one, namely the initial appearance in the nursery and entering the house which sets off the alarm that never got explained, are given really chilling explanations here and the further reveal here towards the end of what the demon actually appeared to be and why they were haunting the family cause this one to be much clearer about the history behind it's haunting scenes which gives this a really strong feel. That allows for the new scares in here, from the haunting first encounter in the past where it further reveals more answers while giving off the kind of startling jump that's quite impressive overall, to the sequences in the hospital that brings about the rather intriguing use of the dice-rolling for answers that plays a huge part in how the later scenes are built with their attempts to contact the spirit world and leading into the need for the visit to his childhood home that delivers a series of top-notch scares here from the encounter in the girls' bedroom and the kitchen encounter as well as the utterly thrilling revelation behind the secret wall that's one of the most striking and truly chilling scenes in the movie walking through the room to get to the front. Managing to get a lot of great use out of the startling noises and flash-bang jumps, there's some really strong visual sequences here that give this a different look and feel here than what was a part of the other effort, and these are aided nicely by the visit to the dead-world that worked so well in the first effort. As the fast- paced nature of these scenes works their way throughout here, it makes for some truly enjoyable moments that never really derail or lose focus here, and it's not until the finale when it does seem to struggle somewhat here as this is the film's only real problem area. The finale to this is really sub-par, figuring on a series of bungled, rather routine chases around the house that seem intent to keep going merely because the plot dictates that they keep having others rush to the aid in order to keep her from harm when she clearly should've been and comes off as entirely too sweet and cheery considering their history here. As well, it tends to really work as a way of ensuring that the film continues on rather than come up with anything truly original on its own and that does hamper this one somewhat. These here are all that really hold this one down.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy."
"RomanJamesHoffman","5","0","0","19 July 2015"," Watchable sequel which is preferable to the original
","I wasn't a fan of the first 'Insidious'. In fact, I laughed at some of it and facepalmed through the rest. So, I was understandably reluctant to put myself through another 90 minutes derivative of better horror movies I have already seen ('Amityville', 'Poltergeist' – the originals, of course), and yet, I have to say that I found 'Insidious: Chapter 2' a far superior film. Far from a classic, just short of being goodbut certainly watchable, and even creepy in a couple of places.<br/><br/>The plot follows on from the events of the first 'Insidious' (as indeed the end of the first movie sets up) and has the Lambert family once again troubled by malevolent entities. However, thankfully, this time the comical demon from the first film is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the plot revolves around the father's possession by one of the entities from the ""further"" (the netherworld realm where he astral-travelled in 'Insidious' to save his son) and the team of psychic investigators who, along with his wife and child, set out to save him.<br/><br/>Now, many chastise the movie for being confusing, and surethe flashbacks and references to the first movie along with the shifts from this world to the ""further"" require a bit of effort to piece together. However, this is no bad thing and I found it a refreshing change from the one-dimensional story of the original. In addition, while the painfully predictable jump-scares annoyed the hell out of me, and some of the ghosts just weren't scarythere were a few moments in the movie which gave off a bit of a chill. Maybe this chill-factor won't stand up to a second viewing, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't find some of them quite effective first time around.<br/><br/>A lot of people credit James Wan with re-inventing the horror genre. I have always found this annoyingly over-stated as his movies are largely style over substance and rip-off virtually every other horror you can think of. Horror auteur he certainly is not, but in attempting something a little more ambitious with 'Insidious: Chapter 2' he has made a decent movie and left me curious about the upcoming third instalment."

","As horror films go, this one isn't at all bad, although there is the usual confusion with ghost/dream sequences. A psychic is murdered while trying to exorcise a ghost, apparently by someone or something from the other side. A boy is possessed, or has been possessed, or is he still now that he is a grown man with a family of his own? Part of the confusion is that this is a sequel. It turns out that the culprit is a serial killer who committed suicide by jumping out of a hospital window, and in turn he was under the influence of his mother who insisted on dressing him up as a girl. <br/><br/>There are a couple of parapsychologists/ghost hunters involved, and what appears to be an attempt to inject a bit of comedy into the film, which fails dismally. Its real redeeming feature though is that there are some genuinely scary moments, not in the spook department necessarily, but like that time in ""Jaws"" when the shark turns up unexpectedly."
"starfoxfan86","7","0","0","13 June 2015"," does this stand up to the original or is it a convoluted mess?
","The original insidious is a modern masterpiece in the horror genre. While its technicals can be rooted back to other movies- it is still an impressive work that shouldn't be missed by any horror fan. Now a a sequel would be hard work- but this movie came out a few months after the conjuring- a film even scarier than the first insidious that is just as good if not better. Now I'm not going into the technicals of those films because I want to talk about this film. But it is impossible not to at least get an idea of those films before talking about this. So Insidious chapter 2 actually starts with a flashback to Josh's problems being diagnosed by Elise before it picks up immediately where the original left off. Now the story here is the biggest part of the movie- but I can't go too deep without giving spoilers. But as it is it actually mostly works. A common complaint against this movie is that it's confusing and convoluted- and I am going to admit there are scenes that are like this, but the story as a whole does make sense. The story is for sure on a larger scale than the original but that's not a bad thing. It also follows the only route it could have taken after the ending of the original. Actually in a lot of respects thanks to the story this actually is almost better than the original. But as I said there are still problems and yes they do hold this movie down. There are a few scenes, and events that don't make sense, and since this movie is about finding answers it really hurts when a few important points simply don't get explained. If I can I may do a second review where I go into these details but as of now I don't think I'm ready to explain something like that. Anyways, there is one other problem- and that this film attempts to add comedy through the spec characters. I don't even know why comedy was written into this movie- and it is VERY out of place when it happens (well there is one funny line but it's at the end and isn't even delivered by either spec). I wound up choosing to ignore this part of the movie, but I know other people won't be able to. Now the horror scenes in the movie are on par with the original (there are some jump scare Esq scenes, but the movie doesn't rely on them). Some of the imagery is actually really creepy and fits nicely. Not only that the performances are also really good- especially Patrick Wilson, who really showcases a lot of talent here. Overall this movie mostly works but gets stuck on some roadblocks it could have easily avoided. I feel I can't do this movie's successes and failings without spoiling anything. So I guess the best thing to do is watch this movie for yourself and make your own judgments."

","Going to be BRUTALLY honest. I hated the first film. It was downright ridiculous and since I watched it I have repeatedly brought it up as one of the worst films I have seen ! This is why I have only today watched the second film, because I heard a couple rumors that this one made the first a LOT better ! And that I can agree, BIG TIME ! The story to this one is a lot more see-able, and the whole first film (as well as the rest of the second one) is kind of explained in the first 10 minutes and gives a reason as to why things were a little bit ridiculous before. As the story progresses it links in EXTREMELY well to the first and is actually really gripping to see where it'll take a turn next. The scary factor wasn't GREAT, but it isn't needed to make this film what it is. Highly recommend putting yourself through the first film before you watch this one, as it makes the second chapter sooo much better ! This has really changed my opinion of the, I guess, trilogy. And I will be going to see the third one once it is out on Friday and look forward to seeing what the teaser to the next film means at the end of this one, hopefully not bringing the quality of films down again, I am a little skeptical."

All of them had freaky occurrences with children... yikes! <br/><br/>Insidious Chapter 2 followed the same mold as the first one, which had me shrinking in my chair. Ghosts appearing out of no where, children in peril and sleep being an issue. The spirit that inhabited Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) at the end of Insidious is the antagonist in Chapter 2. It is not satisfied with simply occupying a live body it wants to do a lot more heinous things.<br/><br/>The movie tied together past and present pretty well and kept a cohesive story.

","I had the opportunity to see both movies back to back at the cinema and it was the ultimate horror experience. Chapter 2 is an absolutely terrifying sequel to one of the scariest movies of all time. This sequel is more visceral and twisted than the first movie. <br/><br/>Directly continuing from the first film the Lambert family think the worst is over, but moving into Josh' Mum's home they encounter an even more malevolent and parasitical entity that has killed before and will kill again, and there's something not right with Josh. Once the first film ended with that jaw dropping cliffhanger, I was so eager and excited to find out what would happen next, and the payoff was worth the two year wait. The story in the sequel uses time travel and flashbacks to uncover unanswered questions from before, you understand who and what the old lady is and the past of Lorraine, Josh and Elise. For fans of Insidious every question and open link is connected and cleared, leaving you ready for the scares in store that James Wan has constructed ready to make you scream! <br/><br/>My favourite moment of the whole movie is when Renai is sat on the stairwell clearing her head, then mysteriously Baby Cali's toy moves on it's own into sight, the look on Renai's face clearly says ""Oh not again"". She slowly moves into the living room, paces back and forward and behind her sits a lady in white, singing in a sinister manner. Renai turns and Rose Byrne is undoubtedly the best actress for pulling a terrified expression, I felt that terror and I was petrified as the spirit continues singing, and then disappears and heads into Cali's room where you can hear the spirit smacking and screaming at her, Renai runs upstairs to find the baby is gone, and suddenly appears to be downstairs where Renai is suddenly beaten and screamed at by the most petrifying ghoul I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Chapter 2 covers more locations and travels deeper into the Further where the undead are even more vicious and desperate to enter living vessels, the characters venture so far they uncover the home of the Mother of Death, played by Danielle Bisutti who delivers a horrifying performance which actually scared the living daylights out of me. This is pure horror, the atmosphere and tone are perfect and the whole world of Chapter 2 seems haunted and uneasy, and yet again the finale is absolutely shocking and had me gripped. Elise who is on the other side witnesses something that we all thought was long gone after the events of the first movie, in comes the gasp and close up and then the titles burst in, I want Insidious Chapter 3, I crave more of this franchise!"
"nitzanhavoc","7","0","0","27 April 2015"," Superb exquisite acting! The rest - great, but not as great as the first film...
","I must say that at the time I've heard about this somewhat illogical sequel to the Horror masterpiece that was Insidious - I was very skeptical. The first question that popped into my head was ""why?"". Why would you take the most creative, most original and innovative and absolutely best Supernatural Horror story of this decade and ruin it by adding unnecessary details and an inferior plot? True, Insidious ended with a lot of loose ends and had a very open ending, but what was so wrong with that? Many Horror films end this way, with the audience not receiving complete closure and therefore being forced to assume the worst. It's part of the Horror effect and experience, we've grown to love it!<br/><br/>Having said all that, being a devout Horror fan and perhaps the biggest Insidious fan in my country - I couldn't ignore this sequel, and so I watched it, once to get acquainted, then a second time some months later for this review. The story and plot, as I've expected from the work of the geniuses who created the first chapter, were quite good, which is a big drop compared to the excellent and profound ones of the first chapter. The time overlaps games and how the events of this film helped to explain those of the first one were an excellent addition, definitely one of the features that made this film great! However, the attempt to ""widen"" the story and encompass more characters and events (as many sequels from many different genres try to do) simply felt forced and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The music is the same eerie, creepy and scary track from the first film (or some variation of it), the cinematography occasionally switching to a home camera view is just the way it should have been, and the unnatural beings of the ""Further"" are still absolutely horrifying. Credit for these is all due to the first chapter.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the greatest most impressive feature of this sequel, one in which it has outdone the first chapter: the acting. Acting of these profound levels, which we meet from the very start of the film, is a rare delight in modern Horror. Lindsay Seim played the supporting role of young Elise perfectly! Her body language, her facial expressions, her voice and intonations... It was like she studied Lin Shaye for years! And now, the creme de la creme: Patrick Wilson. At certain times, due to the script and plot, Wilson had to play someone else, and not his character Josh Lambert. He changed his acting, his body language and facial expressions, his voice and intonation, his personality and his character. Not since the film ""Face Off"" have I seen an actor so professionally and profoundly changing his ""game"" and creating a new character from scratch. Wilson has proved yet again that he is one of the best and most underrated actors nowadays. Watching him work is a privilege.<br/><br/>All in all, comparing Insidious: Chapter 2 to the original Insidious, shows an inferior film, lacking in comparison in all fields except for the acting. However, objectively speaking - Horror mastermind James Wan (the Wan and only) has done it yet again! I'm not sure I can recommend this film in clear conscience, as the first film on its own is a masterpiece that needs no further additions. Still, if you're a true fan of the original, or of the excellent Director Wan and Leading Actor Wilson - you have got to watch this."

","First of all, I did not know there was chapter two to the Insidious! But as the director is the one of SAW movies, it does make sense and I believe more chapters are in years to come.<br/><br/>I believe the chapter 2 is better than the first one but only to the middle of the film. For me - at least - the part when story gets 'into the head of Josh' or becomes supernatural, that is when I lose interest in film and thought it was not believable anymore. <br/><br/>I know it is a movie and it is a horror and those things do not exist, but just making them look less possible was a turn off for the movie.<br/><br/>Especially the ghost hunter lady seemed totally out of place and too 'real' for someone dead. Darkness and mist did not work for me to make 'a scary in the head images' All in all, give it 6! Though I was hesitant between 5 and 6 but it is a bit better than to be in the middle."

Like the first movie, it start's off pretty slow (a seemingly regular theme with James Wan movies), but picks up steadily from about the 45 minute mark and does get better.<br/><br/>While there's a decent amount of tension in the movie I didn't feel as creeped out with this film as I did the first. The first movie also relied - and succeeded - more on visuals and scene setting to make you feel very uneasy to scare you rather than using just the ""jump/scare"" tactics. This time around, I feel that it's slightly more the other way around, but in saying that it does have it's moments of making you feel slightly uneasy. Just not as good as the first movie.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 does actually start to get a wee bit confusing with the amount of cross-over's between the real world and the spirit world as well so you do have to pay close attention to what is going on. If you don't then you'll easily get lost as to what's happening. With that said, however, a good few of these scenes actually tie in with certain events and happenings from the first film i.e. a bang on the house's front door in the first film, you see in this film what caused it. This was actually a really good touch to combine events from the first movie into this one and the tie-in's are done pretty well.<br/><br/>Like I say, it's a decent sequel and while it isn't as good as the first one it's still a good movie to watch."

","Summary: Insidious: Chapter 2 delivers a few decent scares in its first act, but unfortunately the rest of the film is a strangely awful comedy. 40/100 (C-)<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is directed by James Wan. It was one of my most anticipated horror films of 2013. Wan impressed me so much with The Conjuring, it was memorable, thrilling and well written. Unfortunately, Insidious: Chapter 2 is exactly the opposite, the script is filled with annoying and unfunny jokes, the direction is lazy, the production is cheap and some situations are extremely surrealistic. The opening scene and the first act are quite enjoyable, but there's a horrible lack of suspense and the scares are not so effective. I just can't believe that Wan directed this one, he forgot the most important thing in a horror film... the suspense! A horror film without suspense is utter crap.<br/><br/>The first act contains two or probably three extremely creepy moments, but seriously, the rest of the film is a stupid comedy, and it's so rare compared to Wan's previous work. Also, it has an intentionally funny script, the dialog was so cheesy and overcooked. Chapter two is a failed amateurish experiment by Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, it's a joke. It is definitely one of the worst films I've seen at the theater so far. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some scenes during the first act, but the rest of the movie is just a strange, awkward comedy, literally. I really don't recommend it, maybe two or three moments are worth watching on YouTube or HBO, don't waste your money in this.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the first Insidious, it was amazing, even though I had some issues with its final act, it was a solid horror flick with a well handled suspense. On the other hand, chapter two lacks of scares and is short on suspense. Well, at least, the performances are still fine, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are awesome as always and the young actors are excellent too. Chapter two boasts an original story and I'm glad that it delivers some fresh ideas to the horror genre, but its execution could have been better and the script could have less unfunny jokes. Moving on, it has a good camera work, Wan gives us some creepy shots, and at times it looks like a James Wan film! But that's not enough.<br/><br/>I'm really concerned about this movie, chapter two is a strange flick, I'm not even sure of what it is, maybe an awful mix of genres, such as: comedy and psychological horror. Whatever, it sucks. As I said above, yeah, the plot of the film is quite original, but it doesn't offer enough scares nor entertainment. I really want my money back, this was a truly awful flick. I don't even recommend it for fans of the first Insidious starving for horror, because chapter two is literally a comedy film, a very bad one. The trailer is amazing and scary, but unfortunately all the scenes in the trailer are the best parts in the movie and that's it. In conclusion, chapter two is well acted but it delivers more laughs than scares. (C-)"

","Most of the time if sequels to popular movies are not drastically changed, the movie will either perform just as well or slightly below. Even if reviews tend to be fairly low, some sequels continue to push onward. The very best example of this kind of feat is Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) franchise. Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) is no different. After surprising and/or scaring many with his first entry, horror director James Wan returns to conclude where viewers ended with Insidious (2010). The fact that Wan and writer Leigh Whannell decided to continue the story from the previous film is definitely a plus. For some fans, they might think it wasn't necessary while others perhaps wanted to know how it went down. The question is, is it done well? Well, it requires more than a one-word response.<br/><br/>Like many other sequels, the continuation does not stray far from where the last entry ended. Ideally, the main cast of actors return to reprise their roles. After finding Elise's (Lin Shaye) strangled body by her husband Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne) begins to suspect that her spouse is not feeling himself. Not long after, Renai begins seeing more ghostly figures roaming around. Plus Dalton (Ty Simpkins), their son who can dream outside his subconscious, can also notice differences in his father's actions. Once Josh's mom (Barbara Hershey) becomes aware, she calls upon Elise's helpers Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) to find out what's wrong. If this were the plot itself, there would be nothing wrong. However, screenwriter Whannell begins to slip. The reason is that Whannell piles in too many variables for the story to actually hold. This results into a story that has promise but is overly complex for no reason.<br/><br/>One unfinished subplot to the story was the police investigating Elise's murder. Initially it starts off like it could go somewhere, however it ends up just going cold and shoots itself in the foot. Apparently the hands that strangled Elise was not Josh's hands. OK so, who's was it? This attacker is revealed later on but not by the police, which brings up the question of why they couldn't accomplish that task. Or why wasn't Josh's handprints on Elise's neck. This is one set of loopholes that doesn't quite add up. Another is that somehow people can still bring physical objects with them into The Further realm. How is that? It's a bit hard to imagine that nonliving objects can dream out of their subconscious too. This flaw also occurred in the first movie, but this time it occurs a little more frequently, thus becoming more obvious. <br/><br/>There's also a slight change in the way the plot is executed. The difference is now the execution will act like a crime scene mystery where people look for clues to get answers. This requires digging through files and searching old records by breaking into abandoned infrastructure. Yet somehow, these significant acts do not have an effect on the characters. Are the police that oblivious? However, these errors mentioned are nothing compared to the next biggest head- scratching component to this movie. Whannell actually brings in the idea of time travel and crossing different dimensions in time. For some reason, it feels like there could've been an easier way to get over this hurtle. The idea here is that somehow The Further realm can now access the memories of other people. This in turn ends up explaining past events that have already happened. It's not that this added trait is bad, but it feels like a lazy way of just solving the problem instead of giving a reasonable answer. Reasonable doesn't have to mean logical because The Further concept itself denies that entirely, but it still should have reasonable laws that define it.<br/><br/>The acting is still good in this installment. All characters are as they were and still have the same amount of charm as they did before. Patrick Wilson also displays his range of acting by showing what he's capable of. The special/practical effects are still noteworthy too. John R. Leonetti maintains steady cinematography and the ghouls continue to look frightening. With regret, the scares are not as strong as before. The way the story plays out, it'll evoke more chills than scares. An actress by the name of Danielle Bisutti plays a ghost and she is perhaps the scariest thing in the film (although she's not the main villain). Joseph Bishara again returns to score the music for the film and again it is effective when it needs to. This counts for either soft tunes or the stings. Bishara has a way of working the strings with no percussion so that they don't sound so typical for like so many other horror film scores. It can still entertain but not as strong of a performance.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that a lot thought did go into making a decent continuation of Insidious (2010). The acting, music, visuals and story are preserved but the screenplay forgets to cover up several of its flaws. Plus it includes methods of deduction that don't quite fit the genre like it should."

","Ending of the movie is surprising and unique. I am mostly referring to the internal struggle of the serial killer unraveling. Motivates you to go back and watch insidious and insidious 2 together. I especially like how time was portrayed in the latter film. The video camera in the film does help to understand what is going on, since time is not shown chronologically, and Josh and his son ""travel"" to a spiritual plane of existence outside of time. At the same time, in retrospect, Wan could of portrayed this sort of ""astral projection"" among Josh and his son, etc. or a similar concept, differently (I saw this film a year ago so I cant say how until I re-watch). If you are in the mood for a ""scary"" film, I would not categorize this as one. Similar to the first film, there are a few moments where you are anticipating a ""jump"" or the unexpected, but not as many. It is a cerebral horror. Even more so a cerebral thriller."

","First of all, before one watches this movie i strongly suggest watching the first movie, since you need to know the characters and family's background to fully understand this movie. In my opinion this was better than the first movie, which usually never is the case. The movie is jam packed with action and more intense than the first one. Maybe not as many jump scares, but the suspension was there and i could feel it. I love how both movies are kinda jammed together to fully get the small details you couldn't figure out while watching part one.

","*Just so you know I have not seen insidious part one yet, but I am planning on it*<br/><br/>I was impressed with this movie. I assumed it would be scary, but I was still expecting a by-the-numbers movie. But ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is more colorful and creative than other films like it. It uses bizarre and colorful images to make the disturbing scenes in the movie seem out of place in real life, making them much more terrifying. There are many quick flashes of scenes or images that will only be explained later (or in some cases, never). The visual effects are outstanding, especial those in the world of the undead from the first film. I also enjoyed the plot of this film. The script contains many clever ""so that's what that was about!"" moments, and the twist are much more complicated and scary than you would expect in a horror sequel. The silly parts I was talking about really mostly happen in one of the first scenes with Lin Shaye's character (SPOILER)when she's played by someone different. There was just something slightly silly about that part, but other than that, the film is SCARY.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is a clever and terrifying horror film."

In the end the threat is in psychopath human form, which isn't scary - especially since the killer has loads of opportunity to kill yet everyone survives in the end. Plus they add some inappropriate ghostbusters type humour, which really drains the tension even as the climax approaches.<br/><br/>The score is good, though not as effective as in the first movie, which opened with an amazing witches' shriek.<br/><br/>And the OMG line at the end - most blatant sequel bait of all time?"

"jtindahouse","8","0","0","19 August 2014"," Some good frights and doesn't stray too far from what made the first good
","James Wan is getting an impressive resume behind him and fast becoming one of my favourite directors. As far as I'm concerned he's yet to make a bad movie and a couple ('Saw' and 'The Conjuring') are masterpieces of the horror genre. Sadly I don't think either 'Insidious' movie has quite reached that level but that's not to say they're not very good horror movies. I will be very interested to see how he handles the jump across to the action genre with his upcoming 'Fast and Furious 7' and hope he returns to horror soon after because he's damn good at it.<br/><br/>'Insidious: Chapter 2' doesn't change much up from the original. It continues the story from pretty much exactly where the first one left off. The opening scene is captivating and brilliantly interlaced with the rest of the film as we learn more and more about what is going on. The scares are plentiful and rarely fail to deliver - some excessively. <br/><br/>Since the success of 'Paranormal Activity' a lot of filmmakers seem to be taking a stab at the ghost/demon based films. The most effective so far have been 'Paranormal Activity' itself and as previously mentioned 'The Conjuring' but the two Insididious movies would have to be a close third. The ending of this one leaves an opening for another sequel which I understand is already confirmed and I say bring it on."

","This movie was terrifying, even scarier than the first one. Let me start by saying I love the insidious series. I saw this movie on opening day, and i wasn't expecting much due to the fact that sequels usually aren't as good as the original. But man, was I surprised. This movie was a thousand times scarier than the original!! It makes the first one look like a kids movies. The imagery was terrifying, and the jump scenes, and the plot. Although, the first one had a better story, this one had the better scares. Some people actually walked out of the theater crying from this movie, i was amazed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, it is very scary. Although i suggest watching the first one first, because you'd understand this one a bit better. I can't wait for the third one. Although it probably won't be as good. They got real lucky with the first two, I don't think they can pull it off again. But i hope it's good."

","So the 100% James wan record continues. Till now I have not disliked a single film of his(well the ones that he directed, so the saw sequels don't count). Only one film of his is left - Death sentence. Which strangely I am not very interested in watching. <br/><br/>Similar to the Conjuring, this movie made me freak out a little bit and I couldn't continue after 50 mins. But then I resumed after some time and I completed the movie. <br/><br/>The 2 movies are quite similar(Insidious and Chapter 2). The first half is absolutely intense and the scares are incredible. And then the second half goes in too deep into ""the further"" and then it becomes less scary and more over the top. So the impact is less in the second half. Here, in fact, the pace is even slower because they want to explain many things that happened in the first film. <br/><br/>I actually liked that because there is so much attention to detail and the writing is pretty good. But yeah the intensity is lesser in the second half in both films, so they don't attain perfection(unlike say, Conjuring). The motive and backstory is maybe not very original and has been rehashed in plenty of films. But the way everything comes together is interesting to watch. <br/><br/>I loved it <br/><br/>8/10"

","Although I watched the first one it had been so long that I didn't remember most of it. I didn't feel like watching it again before viewing this one but I was quickly able to catch up and the memories of the first one came back to me. I will suggest that you have at least seen the first one before this one.<br/><br/>This seems to pick up right where they left off the first one and the scares and jumps begin one after the other. Some of them are cheap for sure but what a horror movie without them? You then realize later in the film that these ""scares"" are actually a warning, at least some of them are.<br/><br/>There is also a bit of comic relief and while that might turn some people off, I enjoyed it because it broke some of the tension and build up. They are very quick and don't last too long as to completely change the course. In fact, in one scene these 2 characters do something that probably no character in a horror movie has done, and that is listen to the ghost who says something about ""getting out of there or she will make me kill you"" after hearing this they immediately, without hesitation, they leave the room. I laughed out loud and you would think I was watching a comedy.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good sequel and I'm glad I watched it. The story, while a bit complicated and hard to believe, kept me interested the entire time. Not many twists and turns, just a flat out good horror film and if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this sequel"
"bowmanblue","5","0","0","11 July 2014"," By the number sequel
","I didn't like this film. However, the main reason I wasn't impressed was due to how much I enjoyed the first 'Insidious' film. I found it - amazingly - quite a refreshing (and above all scary) little horror film. Therefore I was hoping for more of the same from the sequel. And I sure got it.<br/><br/>Insidious 2 felt like the same film. Everything was the same (apart from a lack of so much Darth Maul towards the end). It just seemed like they photocopied the first film's script, added a couple of 'flashback scenes' and turned it out as a new movie.<br/><br/>To be honest, there's nothing wrong with Insidious 2. It has scares, i.e. a few loud noises that make you jump and the ghostly effects are reasonably creepy. However, so was the first film, therefore I was hoping for a little more than simply a 'rehash.' No one can accuse the franchise of straying from the formula. That's 'Chapter 2's' main problem - it's too similar. Now it just feels like a hundred other formulaic horror films that get offloaded straight to DVD.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"toddg-473-289818","9","0","0","23 June 2014"," Excellent sequel that ties well with the first movie
","This is the third movie I have watched that is a collaboration between director James Wan and lead actor Patrick Wilson. The first two were THE CONJURING and the first INSIDIOUS. And while most sequels stink (anyone remember CITY SLICKERS II?), INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is not only is as solid as the first INSIDIOUS, but it uses flashbacks to tie the two movies together.<br/><br/>At the end of the first INSIDIOUS movie, we see Dalton's father Josh cross into the netherworld to retrieve his son, but the door is left open to a sequel at the end of the movie when Elise's character is murdered. The sequel picks up where the first movie leaves off, with the opening scene going back in time to show a young Josh and his first encounters with evil spirits, then the police searching for Elise's murderer, which could possibly be Josh. <br/><br/>At first I was a bit surprised by the actress playing young Elise whose voice was dubbed over by the actress who played the older Elise, but then as the movie progressed, I appreciated the great detail that went in to tying the two movies together. In the first movie, we are given Josh and Renai's viewpoint, as strange noises befall their house and set off alarms. In the sequel, we are shown the actions from the netherworld that cause Josh and Renai to witness these happenings, which I thought was both brilliant and thorough. Kudos to James Wan for paying such close attention to detail in the explanation he gives the audience. <br/><br/>Lastly, seeing a colored up Josh, whose realism is doubted by Renai, and seeing Elise horrified at the very end of the movie, were all good touches to keep the story moving and possibly leave the door open for a third installment. So many sequels do nothing more than retell the first story (THE HANGOVER PART II comes to mind), but the script and unfolding of INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 goes to great lengths to give the audience new information and a deeper understanding as to what haunts the living characters in the story, and why."

","After surviving the traumatic ordeal from the first movie, the Lambert's are hoping for a fresh start. Renai (Byrne) is interrogated by a detective over the supernatural events that took place in the first movie. Renai moves the family into her Mother's (Hershey) house, hoping to leave the past behind. Renai suspects that her husband Josh isn't himself. Renai is haunted by a malignant supernatural force, Josh is battling demons of his own. With the help of Elise's partners, Specs & Tucker, Renai must save her husband before it's too late. <br/><br/>As a fan of the original, I didn't really see the need for a sequel. It ended things too darkly for a sequel to be necessary. That being said, I was still somewhat psyched to see it. Much to my surprise, this sequel was very entertaining in many ways. It stays true to the terrific atmosphere that served the first movie so well. This is old-fashioned suspense at it's finest, and who better than James Wan at the helm? The man is a true visionary, and knows how to make you squirm in your seat. He uses great tactics such as doors slamming, eerie sounds, and some terrific mind games. James always had a trick up his sleeve, and forces you to use your imagination. One thing this sequel has going for it more than the first are the ghosts themselves. The mother of Parker Crane (The Lady in White) (Very well played by Danielle Bisutti) gave me the willies and was one of the reasons I had trouble going to sleep after I watched this movie. James Wan did risk making the ghosts over exposed, but he knows just the right times to use them. I'm not scared easily, but this movie definitely made me uncomfortable to go to sleep after I finished watching it. On the downside of things, this sequel does go the typical sequel route. It has to be bigger and badder, much less subtle than the original. Also, I thought the finale ran a little too long. It tried to throw in too much at once and I felt it lessened the impact a bit. It got a bit too simple and lazy, unrealistically tidy as well. The ending paves way for another sequel. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not sure I like where this series is heading if the ending is any indication. The acting is exceptional. Patrick Wilson's plight is one of the reasons this sequel was as efficient as it was. His character is forced to delve much deeper than the original, having much more to play with. I enjoyed his storyline a lot. I loved how he pulled a Jack Nicholson from the Shining in the finale as well. Rose Byrne is fabulous and a very strong heroine. I was on her side the whole way. Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey don't have as much to do, but shined when they were on screen. <br/><br/>This sequel exceeded my expectations and then some. It isn't quite as good as the first, story isn't strong enough. As far as scares are concerned, this sequel outdoes it. Despite some hiccups here and there, this sequel is well worth the watch. You'll find many things to like if you're a horror fan<br/><br/>7.5/10"

It does work without it, because everything gets sort of explained, but it would be better if you had the knowledge already while watching. The movie sets out and tries to get the viewers it had from part 1 and it does succeed.<br/><br/>The really out there ending from part 1 gets referenced here and kinda mirrored, but what really works is the story and the scares it does deliver because of that. Some people criticized the actors, but I'd argue they are really good. Not because of their names, but because they can and do act in this one. Not as good as Conjuring, but far better than other horror movies (with or without blood ... this one being one of the latter)."

The acting is much better, but the jump scares aren't really there. Kind of odd, really.<br/><br/>The first movie was infamous for having a jump scare per minute. Granted, only a couple of them were scary, but it still kept you on edge whether it was scary or not. However, in this film, there is a lot of build up to a jump scare that will never happen. For me, jump scares can still be effective as long as there is a build up to them, and dang, there were a couple great opportunities in this movie that were never fully utilized.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this movie's plot does fit in with the first film. Questions left unanswered are answered and characters do return. The duo from the first movie are some of the best, especially during a scene where a ghost warns that it will have to kill them if they stay... and guess what? THEY LEAVE!!! They act like smart people who realize when they are in danger.<br/><br/>If there is one little fault in this film (other than the fact that it is nothing but a time-waster) is the fact that there isn't really ever a threat except for one scene. Basically, all of the cast seems fairly safe and invulnerable to danger, unlike the first film where the stakes were higher.<br/><br/>All in all, it wraps up the plot and hints at a sequel.

","Picking up right at the end of the original, the police question Renai (Byrne) about the unusual death of Elise (Lin Shaye) with suspicion towards husband Josh (Wilson). The Lambert family moves into mother Lorraine's house where Josh grew up. As implied at the end of the original, Josh's earthly body is now inhabited by the treacherous spirit of the witch that plagued him as a child and now as an adult. Meanwhile, nerd investigators Specs (Leigh Whannel) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) meet a former colleague of Elise's named Carl (Coulter) who are all called in to help when Lorraine and Renai want answers to Josh's strange behavior. James Wan and Leigh Whannell's story suffers from a common problem that most sequels have, and that is they have to explain more and more that the first one never had to. Chapter 2 expands our knowledge of the further, and it shows us that this is where Josh's spirit is stuck in and eventually Elise's spirit comes to help. We learn an entire back story of the witch which turns out to be serial killer Parker Crane (Tyler Griffin) who was so messed up by his mother (Danielle Bisutti) he became a killer. There are many plot lines at work here, and even though some are quite clever, like showing scenes from the original and getting to see what caused them in this one, something is lost in all the explaining. It seems like Wan and Whannell threw everything on the table to make a story and used everything they came up with. Most of this is spooky and effective but there is so much information to process, the audience is thinking and sorting instead of reacting and experiencing. James Wan's excellent direction create some jump scares and some hair raising moments which makes this sequel a lot of fun, it just doesn't reach the intense scares and jumps the original had. One scene that did match the scare level of the original is a scene with Dalton (Ty Simpkins) waking up and his room full of ghosts is exceptionally frightening. Some of the end stages of Josh's possession are scary and Wilson is very good in these scenes. There is still plenty to like here and the movie is quite scary, but the overflowing storyline distracts from the overall effectiveness. The end scene hints at the series moving forward and possibly the return of the Lipstick demon from the original."

There is something about a child in danger which raises the tension. That's why the best scene is the one with Dalton and the tin cans. When the string gets taut, that's a horror scene that I haven't seen before. It is a beautiful setup as if something is about to be pulled out of the closet. Patrick Wilson is great when he makes the switch. He's just as capable playing either side. The sequel follows logically from the original and works well for the most part.

So overall not a terrible movie but could have easily been better. The first film was by far a better film but this wasn't a terrible sequel.

It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.<br/><br/>Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams ""Haunted."" We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original ""Insidious,"" including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and ""Entity"" star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about ""the other side,"" but at least ""Insidious Chapter 2"" goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.<br/><br/>""Insidious Chapter 2"" is a bit too derivative of ""The Shining"" in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.<br/><br/>And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic ""Carnival of Souls,"" one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby. Now THERE was a groundbreaking film!"
"SugarandIce","6","0","0","15 April 2014"," Interesting, but fails in all other regards.
","The strongest aspect of Insidious Chapter 2 is the storyline, as it unravels to show the ghosts, the plots, etc. Unfortunately, an interesting narrative isn't enough when your horror movie falls painfully short in the actual horror department. There were only two or three scenes that were actually creepy. The acting was also quite strange. The way the scares are presented all look odd. Perhaps some scares would have worked better if executed by a different director using different angles and lighting. My point is, every shot was over saturated in color and filmed at unscary angles. It also lacks proper atmosphere, and thus proper tension. Worst of all, as soon as I saw the main ghost, the movie fell apart for me, as she didn't look particularly scary (the black bride is a bit better). There are also a lot of unintentionally funny moments, mostly due to the odd acting and weird dialogue. <br/><br/>In the end, Insidious Chapter 2 isn't among the worst horror films. Unfortunately, its mysteries and twists aren't enough to carry the film."
"batteredcakes","6","0","0","1 April 2014"," Thought it would be scarier
","I really thought this movie was going to be so much scarier, the commercial made it seem scary as hell and the first movie was pretty scary to me so I gave the second one a shot. This movie had it's creepiness, scares and great suspense but I guess once I found out the truth about the ghost, it didn't seem too scary to me at all. Really good plot and twists though!! So I gave it a 6 for that but took away stars because I expected so much more, even my little sister was barely scared during the movie. The sad part is that the showing of the title and music with it was scarier and creepier than the whole movie (sounds weird but yeah), we even tried to hurry up and turn off the movie at the end! All in all, this was a good movie if you didn't have high expectations like I did. I'd say to go right ahead and watch it. It has it's creepy and scary moments and the suspense was really great, these people really knew how to build up suspense scenes."

","***************WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS****************<br/><br/>Insidious Chapter 2 basically expands on the events following the original Insidious. We basically learn that the ghosts/spirits from the first film are still haunting the Lambert family. Whilst their old house is being investigated, the Lambert family decide to move back to Josh's old house. However, the Lambert family find that simply moving houses doesn't solve the problem and quickly find that the spirits are still among them....<br/><br/>When we think of horror films the first thing we think of is 'scares' and as it's billed as a 'horror film', ironically, this is where Insidious Chapter 2 is actually at its weakest. Sadly, the trademark Wan/Whannell jump scares are apparent throughout. While I admit that Wan's direction is spot on and his camera work is nothing short of incredible. Unfortunately, when you've watched a few of his films you tend to know some of the tricks that he pulls and sadly for me after seeing his first very good film Insidious and after seeing the Conjuring it all becomes a little too familiar. That being said, his direction was still good and when he wasn't focusing on cheap jump scares it was exceptional. In case you weren't aware you were watching a horror film, Wan & Co remind you throughout that you are -the seemingly constant 'tick tocking' of clocks (particularly in the first half - at one point I was wondering if this film was being sponsored by Accurist). The creaking of doors and the loud incidental music are all reminders that we are watching a Horror film. For me, they are clichés which are starting to become tiring. One thing I did enjoy about this film was Whannell's writing and expansion of the story.<br/><br/>It would have been very easy to create a lazy cash in on the first film (think Hangover 2), but Whannell has actually expanded the story from the first film and has also managed to make it an interesting sequel. I'll be honest and admit that I had my doubts at around the 30 minute mark and thought that it would be no different to the first film. How wrong could I be? Essentially, Josh's body and soul have been possessed by an evil spirit which has crossed over into this dimension and has left the real Josh stuck in between this world and the other world. The evil spirit Josh has been given orders to kill all his family by the evil spirit Miriam (who is ultimately manipulating him and the spirit of her son Parker Cane - in a bizarre twist it turns out that she wished that her son was a 'girl' and forces him to dress and act like a 'girl' which explains Parker's reasons for wanting to possess the young Josh as he wants his childhood back now his mother is dead and presumably to try and live as a boy as he had always wanted to).<br/><br/>The film culminates in Josh's young telekinetic son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) choosing to pass between dimensions in order to bring the real Josh (his dad) back into this dimension and also trying to kill the evil spirit of Miriam who is the one that is influencing all of the spirits and causing all this pain. I honestly believe that the writing and thought that have gone into this sequel are the traits that make this a strong sequel. The fact that Wan & Whannell have actually expanded the story rather than giving us a re-hash of the first film make it a very good follow up to the excellent original.<br/><br/>The ending of the film suggests that there will be a third film on the way and, on the face of it, there could be potential for us witnessing the birth of a strong franchise."
"Tehmeh","7","0","0","5 March 2014"," Has big problems, but is still a positive experience.
","I liked ""Insidious"" a lot. I liked the story, the visuals, and the otherworldly touches. It is one of my favorite modern horror films along with ""The Ring"", ""1408"", ""Sinister"" and ""Conjuring"". All of those movies have their share of unwarranted problems, which is a testament to how modern horror pales completely in comparison to the good old days, but I still liked those ones. I mentioned them just to give an idea of my taste, letting people know if my opinion helps them or not.<br/><br/>Since I didn't get a chance to see ""Insidious: chapter 2"" at a theater, I bought it as soon as it was released. Just finished watching it. Although it isn't nearly as solid as the first one and does disappoint in some areas, it's still a pretty good movie. Certainly nothing more, and ""pretty good"" might be stretching it a bit, but it's on the positive side of the scale nonetheless.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 takes place almost right after where ""Insidious"" ended. One might argue that seeing the first one isn't absolutely necessary to understand this movie, but I still recommend seeing it before watching this one.<br/><br/>The story surprised me a little, because at its core it's quite good. There's a new mystery, but also some history about our main characters and clever links to tie it all together, including these two films themselves. Thumbs up for the concept, because Chapter 2 feels like a part of a bigger story, not just a forced sequel - even though this sequel is most likely very, very forced and I think James Wan didn't even try to give it his best. Anyway, I liked the concept and many things are handled quite well.<br/><br/>Soon, it becomes clear that the strong impression doesn't last. This movie takes turns with hits and misses, and it struggles to find its comfort zone. Was this production rushed? Was James Wan too busy with ""Conjuring"" to really give a damn? Was the writer/actor Leigh Whannell too busy playing a funny ghost hunter to finish some parts of the script? I don't know. What I do know is that at times Chapter 2 is shoddy. For every great moment there is a stupid moment. For every interesting and fresh breath there is a cheap scare from the museum of creepy things, sounds and dolls. <br/><br/>The film is just not tight as a whole. Some really basic things are handled in a half-assed manner, straight from the pages of some lazy fanfiction. ""We need that to happen, doesn't matter how much sense it makes"" - moments made me shake my head, especially one (you'll know it when you see it). Horribly spoon-fed exposition and some parts of the dialogue made me cringe too. It seems like they had good material for 50 minutes, and then started adding stuff to it to justify the project.<br/><br/>Those were the problems for me. I'm not even complaining about the often-disliked comic relief, I actually welcomed that element even though it worked better in the first movie. But, even with the problems I mentioned there is some serious quality to this movie. It struggles to keep itself intact, but it's got something going for it. Perhaps it's more of a testament to the lousy state of modern horror than a compliment for this film, but this is still clearly better than your average horror movie. <br/><br/>The cast is the same with a few additions. Everyone does a pretty good job as usual. Danielle Bisutti was the surprising standout for me. <br/><br/>Visually everything looks good. The colors, the sets, the mood/scare effects, makeup, everything looks good. I preferred the slightly more macabre tone from the first one, and the designs aren't all top notch here, but nevertheless this department is a strength of this film and doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>It's a little sad when a sequel with an actually good concept isn't handled carefully, because usually the substance isn't there. In this case it is, but it's an of/off-relationship. When it works it's great, then it's forgotten again. This could've been a little modern horror classic for me. It isn't even close. That said, James Wan's ""Insidious: chapter 2"" is still a positive experience. I usually give horror movies some slack, so take my 7/10 with a grain of salt. If you're normally not into these flicks, don't take this as a recommendation.<br/><br/>I hope (a motivated) James Wan returns for Chapter 3 (edit: he didn't), because otherwise we just might get a series of crappy movies with no resemblance to what originally made them good."

","This film was a major let down and I think five stars is quite generous! Chapter two picks up straight from the end of the first film. Its like the director completely over thought the story - remember the woman who appeared closer and closer in all the photos? Well in this film that woman is actually a man... A man serial killer who wears a black dress. Why? I don't know why.. I think because his mom abused him and made him dress like a girl. There was no point to it. There are also lots of other silly ghosts and the costumes are just awful. I feel like this film killed the terror that you get from the first film. When they go into the farther it just loses the plot. I would not recommend this movie at all."

","After being trapped in the afterlife a father must return to save his family from a serial killing entity or be lost forever.<br/><br/>Opening with an exposition flashback and picking up where part one left off director James Wan delivers another afterlife visual treat. This sequel has its share of shrouded corpses, ghostly figures, an abandoned hospital and dilapidated houses to name a few.<br/><br/>Thankfully this is not some cheap cash-in. What's engaging is that the original cast return including the solid Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne along with Elise Rainier and Barbara Hershey in their supporting roles. Worthy of note is The House of the Devil's (2009) Jocelin Donahue as Hershey's Lorraine younger self. To the casting directors credit the supporting actors who play the younger characters are successfully integrated. Of course for a bit of relief and grounding from Tucker (Angus Sampson)and Leigh Whannell's Specs who also return.<br/><br/>It's stylised make-up of the ghostly faces and cross layering between and afterlife, flashbacks, spiritual time paradoxes are finely executed. While it has its fair share of creepy moments, notably a scene involving a tin can make shift telephone it's debatably not as tension filled as the first instalment. That said, with a few twists and interesting exposition it keeps you on your toes from start to finish.<br/><br/>What makes Chapter 2 shine is that writer Leigh Whannell expands the story building on his and Wan's original concept without changing it too much, it really is a satisfying sequel and incorporates even some of the original's scenes. Both cinematographer John R. Leonetti (Sleepy Hollow) and composer Joseph Bishara also return which again is in keeping with the first, retaining its atmosphere and look.<br/><br/>Granted it's packed with horror clichés but Wan's execution and style gives this an edge over similar types of horrors. Overall, while not reinventing the horror wheel, it's a satisfying follow-up."
"akik1259","5","0","0","16 February 2014"," Meh... not that great
","The first movie ended with Elise dying, presumably killed by Josh, and this one this movie starts off with the ramifications. The good news is that the son is no longer possessed, but the bad news is that Josh now probably is (by a different demon). The family moves into yet another new house, but Rene once again starts seeing spooky images and entities. This time it seems to be Josh who is possessed, as he now starts exhibiting strange behavior. Josh's mother hire Tucker and Specs, the paranormal investigators from the first movie, as well as investigator Carl, to investigate the circumstances of Elises' death. Once again we learn that demons are to blame. <br/><br/>I think to plot from this movie is too similar to the first one. There also aren't as many real scares this time, most of them are just cheap. Also, my biggest complaint of the first movie was that the last act was boring and dragged on too long, and that kind of happens here, but thankfully its shorter this time and the climax is a bit more exciting. The story is just plain confusing at times, like how the humans enter and exit the Further(the spirit world). I also thought Tucker and Specs were really annoying characters.<br/><br/>The good things are that we get more of Joshs' backstory this time to explain how he got possessed. We learn more about the spirit world, too. The scares that do work are really effective, so at least there's that.<br/><br/>Insidious 2 is nice if you are a horror fan, but those who liked the 1st will probably be underwhelmed by this."

","This film was an excellent movie, although it didn't meet up to the standards of the original. I loved this movie but the problem was I just couldn't stand the fact that it was worse than the original. I hated the ending it was unbelievably daft. The jump scares were slightly better than the originals, but they didn't scare me as much as the originals did. I wanted to like the film more than I did, but it would be better if they had a redeeming story line. Continuing the story on from the end of the original was a good idea, but having the Main protagonist being stuck in the 'Further' just wasn't the best of ideas, and then having him escape at the end... It was just a massive let down. I would have much preferred the film going on with the main protagonist in real life and not stuck in 'The Further' for the entire movie. In conclusion this was a good movie, but just not as good as I had hoped for, although I would much rather have the same sought of scares the Original had."

Blatant remark. But if you DIDN'T like the first I think you'll find the second makes up for some of the disappointment.<br/><br/>I went away from the first just a bit bemused. I think it was the fact what you don't see is scarier to me than what you do and this movie seemed to want to show you the demon without living up to any expectations. If you're going to reveal something that's ominously lurking in the shadows it's a brave move and you have to match the fear of when it couldn't be seen... I found the whole thing anti-climactic and I swore off seeing the second before I knew it was going to be made.<br/><br/>The second however has actually entertained me throughout. I cannot lie. It's still not funny where it's supposed to be and they still reveal too much of the shadow lurkers, but it's compensated by a much better story and pace.

","Having seen some bad films from Wan lately, Insidious and The Conjuring I should've expected the streak to continue.<br/><br/>The film continues from the end of first film, Insidious. Elise is dead and Josh's body is now possessed by the entity that was after him and his son. The possessed Josh dupes his family into thinking that he is alright. He is planning to murder all of them soon. However his plans are foiled when his wife visits Elise's colleagues, Specs and Tucker to seek an explanation behind the strange events. They call Carl, who attempts to contact Elise using word-dice. <br/><br/>This film uses the same plot device of limbo-like dimension or realm called the further(Insidious 2011). It appears that when you die, you get access to this dimension, whether you are in heaven or hell, irrespective.<br/><br/>The film shifts between the two planes earthly and the further as the film progresses. The opening and development of the film is boring and if you have an android phone or PSP at hand, your mind will wander and you will start to fiddle with these. This time Wan doesn't torture us in the same level as the first film - He places a mattress on the floor before he trips you.<br/><br/>The sound effects are atrocious as the first film. Guys who are using pacemakers should avoid this movie for their health's sake(or life for that matter. Reason is that at points in the film there are blaring noises or ""loud sound effects"" designed to scare you. Special effects in the film are below standard compared to most Hollywood films released these days.<br/><br/>The cast of this film is the weakness, as none of them really shine out and try to lift this film. Patrick Wilson gives a mediocre performance as does Mary Rose Byrne, an actress who got two Emmy and Golden Globe award nominations for the TV series Damages. Lin Shaye is one of the better actresses in the film and because of her, the film is less of a bore than it should be."

"ASouthernHorrorFan","5","0","0","19 January 2014"," My Review Of ""Insidious Chapter 2""
","James Wan's ""Insidious Chapter 2"" continues the story of the Lambert family's nightmare battle against malevolent supernatural forces. The film picks up right where the first film left off moving the story back to the childhood home of Josh Lambert. Wan does a great job of bridging the two films story arch with seamless quality. My only issue with ""Chapter 2"" is the almost grandiose persona that seems to shadow the nature of this family's tale. At times the context and explanatory content seems a bit forced and over-exaggerated even for a fictional film setting. Even in fantasy and fiction the story needs to carry a bit of believability and realism. You need to think that this could actually happen to someone (given that you believe in hauntings and a supernatural presence in the world). Yet at times ""Insidious Chapter 2"" comes off more like those stories that get bigger the longer they are shared among peers, like going to a ""haunted cemetery"" and a sound becomes a presence, becomes an attack and before long someone became possessed and so onThat is how much of ""Insidious Chapter 2"" came off to me personally. <br/><br/>The effects and suspenseful thrills in the film are pretty effective. At times the shock value aspects worked perfectly with the sound effects to actually make me jump. There some definite creep elements to this film that manage to pull you into the terrifying even though ""Chapter 2"" carries an obvious overproduced quality. Unfortunately there are times when you should fill spooked or the film tries for an intense chilling moment, it all just falls flat. Over all ""Insidious Chapter 2"" works at carrying this nightmare to the next stage and works in creating a sort of mythos for this supernatural concept. It will scare enough for some fun moments, but it doesn't go far enough to allow for replays of the movie that are just as thrilling as watching it for the first time. So really ""Insidious Chapter 2"" is one of those 50/50 films where it is cool if you like it and it is worth owning if ghost stories do it for you but if you choose to skip it then that is just fine too. I am definitely on the fence about this one. I will buy the DVD because I own the first film but not sure if it will be in rotation during my Halloween ghost story binge because it does walk the thin line between hokey and entertaining."

","The Lambert Family moves to a new house to leave behind their terrifying experience with ghosts in the first house, only to learn that the spirits are not done with them and the mystery that connects them to the spirit world so strongly has not yet been solved.<br/><br/>The original Insidious (2010) is one of the scariest films I've ever seen and I highly recommend it. It had cool old-school scares and some creepy violin music, making it a sort of homage to old ghost films. How did the sequel compare?<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, Insidious: Chapter 2 resembles Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. The plots have very similar features (and once you watch this film, you'll know what I'm talking about), and the cinematography in Insidious: Chapter 2 is very similar to The Shining, with all of their tracking shots, it just seems like The Shining with a twist.<br/><br/>But I'm not saying this isn't a fun film. I actually enjoyed myself at this one and I think you are going to enjoy yourself at this one if you're a fan of the original because Chapter 2 definitely panders to the fans. The twist, especially, panders to people having previously viewed Insidious. I don't think it's as easy to enjoy yourself at this having not already seen Insidious, because most of the film relies on you having information based on what happened in the first film.<br/><br/>The story in Insidious: Chapter 2 is pretty ridiculous but the actors really make it work, especially Patrick Wilson. He's a great actor and has given solid performances in everything I've seen him in. Rose Byrne gives an equally great performance as the mom, the sort of Shelley DuVall like character. <br/><br/>The script was where I had most of my problems. There are sometimes one- liners by these two ghost-hunter guys that are trying to be funny but only just take you out of the moment and wrecked all the suspense previously building up. There were clichéd and cheesy moments but for the most part, they didn't take you out of the story.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is a fun film to experience and I did enjoy myself. The performances were stellar and James Wan's reliance on old-school scares hasn't failed him so far. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the original. <br/><br/>I give Insidious: Chapter 2 a B-.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence, and thematic elements<br/><br/>READ MY FULL REVIEW AND MORE AT www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com"

","Review: For someone who doesn't really enjoy the paranormal horrors, I actually liked this movie. It does take some time to get going, but once it does, it is on the edge of your seat stuff. For how much the movie cost to make, it did make a hell of an amount of money so the audiences must have loved it. It's not a gory horror so there isn't loads of blood all over the place, but it does deal with the paranormal which was pretty intense. All of the same characters from the first one, are in this movie which makes the franchise flow great, not like other movies when they get totally different characters. It's great for the scary and mystical factor and I loved the ending. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: It's not very often that you watch a horror which doesn't really have that much blood in it. All of the usual paranormal movies have this video camera look to them, but this movie gives it more of a true to life feel. The ending left an opening for another movie in this franchise, which I would like to see. I just hope that they keep some of the original characters. Anyway, this is definitely one to watch if you are into this type of movie, and even if your not, you still have the family drama aspect.<br/><br/>Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $161million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there paranormal/horror movies and who were fans of the first movie. 6/10"

The law of sequels is that they have to explain, so the parts of the first film that existed in your imagination are going to be put to rest. That's the only real negative. <br/><br/>The acting was solid. They did a good job of taking disparate horror elements to create something new. And they paid homage to film like The Shinning. They also set up the sequel. <br/><br/>If you like haunted house films, you'll enjoy the first half. If you want to know the specifics of what happened in the first film you'll like the second half.

Rest assured, however, that Patrick Wilson plays his part superbly (as does the rest of the cast) and that the big story behind it all itself is indeed worth it."

","Horror films are really difficult I think to provide a sequel towards them because audiences are not like expecting a sequel to many of films of the horror genre because to me they seem like one off sagas and a sequel usually expands the original story too much. Well Insidious was great to me and I really enjoyed how different it was. When I first heard about the sequel I certainly didn't want it to happen. After watching the trailer I felt a bit more optimistic about it but not something I would go out of my way to watch to be honest.<br/><br/>Later on it got and the reviews and ratings came in and 90% of them where positive which shocked me so I thought I will watch it. So when I did I was so shocked on how it was made. It was fantastic and not a lot of horror movies scared me but this has a terrifying sense to it which James Wan does very well with his films. The style is very similar to the first film such as dramatic music in the background to make the jump scenes even worse. The camera work is the same with the bizarre shots used and the lighting specifics. <br/><br/>The second film left my mouth open and I was unsure what actually happened at the very end and this film explains it all. So much detail went into it and it truly explained the origin of the demon that was inside Josh and it blew my mind away from just having the certain ideas in the first film, and then to explain all of them in the second installment. Absolute brilliant. If you are a big horror fan I would recommend this because its truly what horror is about these days and stuff like this will keep the horror genre what it used to be."

","Horror as a genre, often ends up not keeping the promises they make. While there are classics and modern flicks that scares the bejesus outta you, there are also those which doesn't always click. And I can mention a lot more of those than the ones that's actually scary. Then there are of course horror movies that actually work for one and not the other coz, I believe, we all have varied scare-tolerances. I for myself can handle 'gore' like piece of cake but can't stand twitchy supernatural beings. Frankly, the found footage horror movies has ruined the genre to some degree. How many Paranormal Activity sequels can you watch until you get bored of scaring yourself with flying frying pans. When the said genre was imbued with those horror movie dingus, James Wan, went the old school way with 2010′s Insidious. Insidious had everything in store for horror fanatics. It was atmospheric and Wan not resorting to monster closets and cliché's were a welcome change. While the movie did have its flaws, it still stood out among the hosh-posh horror movies. I have fond memories of watching Insidious at the dead of the night with my headphones on and boy, I was freaked outta my wits, at least for the first two acts. Agreed James Wan is a man of many talents, having directed blockbusters in almost every genre as evident from movies like Saw and Insidious to Death Sentence and the upcoming Fast & Furious 7 but when it came to The Conjuring I could agree less with the majority who praised it sky high. The Conjuring was a well directed piece, adorned with brilliant performances but it was anything but scary.<br/><br/>Insidious Chapter 2 starts off where the first left off. The Lambert family was still not completely clear of the malice from part one and without spoiling much its assured that there was plenty much more in store for them. While Insidious was all about astral projections, this ones more about the ones that passed through the portal. Initially it was all but slow, but when it got to the second act it got more interesting at the cost of dropping the atmospheric quality the first had. There was a huge tonal shift. The movie took a fine take at continuing the Insidious myth and seamlessly ties in with the first's story filling whatever gaping holes it had. If you wanna be in sync with whats happening in Chapter 2 you ought watch Chapter one. Watching Insidious is mandatory, nuff said. But scares-wise the movie lacked, almost as much as The Conjuring. And it also had some odd comedy injected. For a story arc that was so serious, the comedy felt distracting. The performances of the cast were splendid, especially of Rose Bryne as Renai Lambert, her helplessness was direly felt. Patrick Wilson's characters were also noteworthy and you'll know why I mentioned 'characters' when you watch it. Lin Shaye's Elise was a remarkable performance as well.<br/><br/>Ending on an ambiguous note, Insidious Chapter 2 leaves a lot of scope for sequels. For one, I really missed the Red-face demon from the first, who was nowhere to be seen or heard in Chapter 2. James Wan made 2 horror movies this year, The Conjuring was a fairly entertaining movie (had it not been so hyped) and in Insidious Chapter 2, he was not reluctant to play with its myth expanding its own universe. I cant wait to see what he's going to do with the now-humdrum Fast & Furious franchise next year."

"MaximumMadness","7","0","0","30 December 2013"," While it's slightly rushed and never quite as creepy as the first film, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is still a fun, suspenseful ride that has a lot of interesting ideas to explore.
","""Insidious: Chapter 2"" was one of the more interesting viewing experiences I've had this year. I am an enormous fan of James Wan's first entry. I found it to be a surprising, eerie, well-made creepfest, and is one of the best supernatural thrillers I've seen in the past 10 years. And I thought Wan outdid himself with the absolutely wonderful ""The Conjuring"", which was an excellent film and a perfect haunted-house thrill ride. So I was wildly excited for Wan's follow-up, ""Insidious: Chapter 2."" Would it rival ""The Conjuring"" as one of Wan's best films? Would it be a good follow up to the original? <br/><br/>The answers to those questions are a respective ""No"" and ""Yes."" It isn't quite able to match the masterful work Wan did in ""The Conjuring"", but I would ague that while not quite as good as the first chapter, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is definitely a worthy follow-up, with some fun scares and some really cool, interesting ideas that it explores.<br/><br/>We pick up right after the first film- the Lambert family has recovered their son Dalton from the spirit world of ""The Further"", but paranormal medium/investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) has been murdered, and father Josh (Patrick Wilson) may or may not now be possessed by the malevolent spirit of the mysterious spectral woman from his past. With a police investigation ongoing, the family is forced to stay with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) for the time being. However, Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) and Dalton (Ty Simpkins) soon begin to once again experience supernatural phenomena, while Elise's former teammates (Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson) work with Carl (Steve Coulter), a former colleague of hers, to unravel the mysteries of what is happening. And all will be forced to confront horrors and dangers if they hope to save Josh and the rest of the family from the dark spirits of The Further.<br/><br/>The cast is a lot of fun for the most part. Wilson has a larger range to cover this time around, and for the most part is successful. (Although admittedly, he goes a bit over-the-top at times) Byrne, Hershey, Simpkins and the other members of the Lambert family all give wonderful performances, even though they tend to be relegated to screaming and running from the supernatural forces much of the time. Whannell and Sampson are a joy as they were before in their more broad comedic roles. And Coulter grounds the film as the investigative character who gives much of the rules and exposition.<br/><br/>Wan's direction is once again top notch, especially for the low-budget nature of the two ""Insidious"" films. He is able to appropriately build mood and tension through wonderful shot compositions and his first class directions. The other facets of the production are also similarly wonderful, including some great, moody production design, and a fantastic score from returning composer Joseph Bishara. (Who sadly doesn't reprise his on-screen role as the Red-Faced Demon from the last film.)<br/><br/>However, it is unfortunately an uneven script with some big pacing issues that brings this film down a few points from the fantastic 9 out of 10 I gave to the original film. The writing isn't bad... in fact the film does have a solid foundation and storyline, and it delves into many new and interesting ideas pertaining to The Further/The Spirit World. It's just highly flawed at times and suffers from having too break-neck a pace during certain segments. Whereas the first film was a much slower and more deliberate piece, that took its time to establish a mood, ""Chapter 2"" rushes, with a pace almost comparable to an action film. And as a result, less time is taken to establish development or atmosphere before the scares start, which did lessen their impact. Some of the scares and story segments also feel slightly contrived, and a few of the more interesting concepts are established but don't go anywhere particularly interesting. However, despite these issues, writer Leigh Whannell (who as mentioned above, also co-stars) is able to craft a satisfactory continuation of the story. I just wish he took his time.<br/><br/>Overall, while it never quite reaches the first film's heights, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is still a spooky, fun ride with some really cool new concepts. And it is definitely a worthy sequel to the stellar original.<br/><br/>I give it a pretty good 7 out of 10. Turn out the lights, lock the doors, and check it out for some creepy fun."
"KineticSeoul","5","0","0","30 December 2013"," Despite few clever part, it falls short
","So this is the sequel that basically concludes the story arc after what went down in the first movie. I guess the director put most of his scare efforts for the movie ""The Conjuring"", because the scare factor isn't as strong this time around. Despite the super creepy violin score from the first ""Insidious"" this one is even less scary than the first one. But what drives this movie is how the story integrates past and present stories together in a clever fashion, in order to make a somewhat interesting connection. Even the investigative work this time around is far more cool, than the first one. Although it does get more cheesy as the movie progresses. Although the mystery added to the creepiness in the first one. This one tries to answer a lot of the questions, the audiences might have had about the first one. And that is what this movie is, when it comes down to it. The revealing of the past secrets and more of why weird things are starting to happen after the conclusion of the first ""Insidious"". This movie did give me goosebumps, but it's riddled with jump scares. Overall, not much effort seemed to have went into this sequel, even when it comes to the production value which seemed quite cheap and fake. The ending is also something that is so generic when it comes to horror movies, that it comes off very bland. It's a alright horror movie, but nothing more.<br/><br/>5.6/10"
"Gordon-11","Null","0","0","29 December 2013"," Scary but disappointing
","This film continues to explore the Lambert family's connections with the world beyond our own.<br/><br/>The first ""Insidious"" was outstanding because it had a simple and straightforward plot, and yet it delivered the scares and thrills. ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" develops from there, but the plot is more complicated. The human world and the further merges, and it could become confusing for some. The addition of a psychopathic character and a grossly perturbed mother may have heightened the thrill, but puts me off because it destroys the simplistic beauty of the first plot.<br/><br/>The scenes leading to yet another sequel is entirely unrelated to the Lamberts and is just so contrived. I am slightly disappointed by ""Insidious: Chapter 2"", even though I was scared by it."

Here's a part of that review:<br/><br/>""There are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of Wan when it comes to film. But he didn't relie on his talents, he used other people talents (like Kubrick's The Shining) to deliver a classic horror film. I'm not comparing Wan with Kubrick, but some of the camera works, some of the angles, are truly brilliant, rarely seen in a horror film. This is a movie you can analyze in many levels... ""<br/><br/>The fact is that I was right. I saw James Wan's obsession with Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (here's the part where I'm not being humble). This chapter 2, confirms it. I loved this film as much as I loved the first part. I would not argue with those who think this film and The Conjuring are the best horror films this year. They are perfect, though I liked most the Insidious series because I have a sick fanatism for this story in particular.<br/><br/>It completed the circle, totally. I hope they won't ruin the third part coming soon. And I beg to Mr. Wan to continue delivering horror movies. This is what suits him.

There's some cheesy dialogue in the first few scenes and there's some plot variations as far as this chapter and what we remember seeing from the first.

It features astral projection and communication with the dead. The afterlife begins with a pit-stop of sorts that seems to be purgatory.

","A satisfying horror sequel from the director of 'Saw'. As a second installment to 'Insidious', it went deeper into the behind story of a character of the movie. Yeah, the first one was told about a boy's special talent astral projection where he can travel to another world in his sleep. I considered that was the movie's advantage but comparing to this, they just implemented the same idea with neglecting the boy. In this movie it describes more about the father's perspective of the story without held back the much required secret for the twist at the end.<br/><br/>It opens with a story that set in 1986 where Josh as a kid is haunted by the souls of dead. Soon the story commence on present time where the Lambert family begins to feel again the presence of evil forces in their house. A team of spiritual medium begins their part to expose and free the family from dark forces. I thought the spiritual medium characters Elise and Carl is imitating the dwarf woman and an Indian characters from 'Poltergeist' movie series. I can say director was a clever, he just put away the usual ingredients of the horror genre and added different flavours like time travel and psychology.<br/><br/>For adults, most of the horror movies won't scary but watching during night will give more effective. So it a such movie you should try at a dark time for your own advantage to extract from it a better entertainment.

To me INSIDIOUS was one of the best horror movies in recent years thanks in large part to how downright creepy and effective it was. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 isn't nearly as successful in the scare department but it has an incredibly interesting structure that makes it worth viewing. I thought the actual story structure was the best thing going for this film as we pretty much have it starting up after the events of the first film. Instead of the story taking weeks or months for the hauntings to start, they happen right off the bat and within the matter of hours once the story continuation starts. I really liked how the story then split off into two with one group of characters dealing with one thing while the other group deals with the investigation as to what's going on. The way director James Wan went back and forth between these two sides was entertaining and certainly grabbed your attention. What didn't work in between these two sides was some extremely bad comic relief, which just stopped the film in its tracks every time it happened. As I said earlier, I really didn't find this film scary at all so compared to the original it falls well short. There were a few good moments where the atmosphere level was quite high but it still fell well short of being a classic. The performances were all extremely good with Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins and Lin Shaye in fine form. Barbara Hershey is also good here.

","The Lambert family returns to dig deeper into their connection to the spirited world. Scares ensue right from the get-go, but are nothing more than an insincere sham to set the tone of a film that has far less substance than its predecessor. The premise, however, is interestingly a mixture of a sequel, a prequel and a parallel (which covers events occurring at the same time as the first film). The film seems to be inadvertently broken into halves, the first of which covers Byrne's character and the second covering Wilson's, creating an overall incoherent horror movie. It actually gets pretty interesting during the second half, but when the first half is so dull, it's a lot to expect your audience to be so gracious and maintain an open-mind the entire film. There also seems to be an effort to make this installment ""the happier one of the series"", and the ham-handed attempt to make as much use of the reprising characters as possible is one of the saddest things a sequel has seen since OCEAN'S THIRTEEN.

But with that said, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a more than worthy successor, as what it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in creativity; while still having an understanding that for a scary movie to work, at the very least, it must be scary.<br/><br/>Side Note: For those who disliked ""Insidious"" on the basis that the ""astral projection"" aspect was ""too convoluted"", you should be aware that director James Wan and company only add another layer of weirdness and campiness and over-the-top-ness to the plot of ""Insidious: Chapter 2""; especially when it takes a grand leap from the horror genre, to heavy science fiction, in the final act.<br/><br/>Excluding ""The Godfather: Part 2"", the worst kind of sequels are the ones whose sole purpose are to explain or extend its predecessor, using a back-story plot line. And while this may not sound like a flaw on paper, during said sequels the effective idea of the original soon becomes muddled, as the plot is stretched beyond its means and begins to fully focus on expanding the original, rather than giving the viewer a fresh story. And while ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" should be considered an extension of its predecessor, and it does look to expand on the original, Wan, with the help of a highly creative script, has essentially created a new story which uses the ""Insidious"" outline as more of a jumping off point, than anything else. <br/><br/>Patrick Wilson (who has certainly become Wan's muse) does good work here, displaying his ability to play a menacing Norman Bates type. And as I alluded to before, Leigh Whannell's script is extremely well constructed (even whilst delving down pathways that are more than a little eccentric) but it's the direction that sells ""Insidious: Chapter 2"". With great camera work throughout, that eerily aggressive score which stands as the signature of a Wan production and moment after moment of either suspense or disturbing images (especially for a PG-13 film) Wan's direction is on point as usual, as he now stands as the best horror director working today. Even if you know the scares are coming, even if you've seen these horror tropes before (as recently as a month ago with ""The Conjuring"") his direction is so effective that it would be extremely difficult not to become lost in the moment and jump out of your seat along with everyone else in the theater. <br/><br/>Final Thought: I understand that horror cynics have been blindly picking this movie apart, even going so far as to lie and say that it wasn't entertaining. And while I won't argue that ""The Conjuring"" was (ever so slightly) structurally the better of the 2013 Wan movies, that doesn't change the fact that I unapologetically enjoyed ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" more so. Therefore, if you are a horror fan, and wish to partake in a scary/entertaining night at the movies, then ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a must see.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","Having avoided the first INSIDIOUS, this is an attempt to review CHAPTER 2, a haunted house horror flick that goes beyond sudden jolts and cheap thrills with a creative, multi-layered storyline<br/><br/>Centering again on the Lambert family, we begin with Patrick Wilson's Josh as a young boy. Like the poor kid in SIXTH SENSE he sees dead people, and, according to wraith expert Ellise, played by Lin Shaye, one has stubbornly latched on, making the ""Why don't they just move out of the house?"" question completely futile...<br/><br/>The scares are effective, and most importantly, so are the chills. The difference being: scares occur for the moment while chills are always present. But what really makes I2 work is the eclectic cast, sharing equal time in a story building mystery along with terror and, thanks to neurotic ghost hunters Specs and Tucker, a few worthy laughs as well.<br/><br/>As Josh goes under a spell from the formidable lead wraith, whose presence is revealed further in, the changeling makes him a dead ringer for Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance in THE SHINING, including a frantic door-bashing scene sans the axe, and Rose Byrne as wife Renai is the perfect Shelley Duvall<br/><br/>Her sheepish aura helps boost Josh's frantic intensity, and the multiple back stories, gliding smoothly to the forefront while a few confusing layers taper off, leads to an ambitious third act when a few characters enter (and/or reenter) a misty spirit world that, although resembling the exterior of Disney's Haunted Mansion, makes for a satisfyingly unpredictable experience..."

","'INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Horror master James Wan reteams with his usual partner in crime Leigh Whannell for this sequel to their 2011 indie spook-fest hit 'INSIDIOUS'. Wan once again directed the film and Whannell wrote the screenplay (as well as co-stars in the movie). Oren Peli (who wrote and directed another low budget scary movie blockbuster 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY') produced the film with Jason Blum (the two also produced the first one together). Stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey all reprise their roles from the first film. Wilson also starred in Wan's recent blockbuster 'THE CONJURING' as well. The film picks up right where the first one left off with the Lambert family still battling ghosts trying to take possession of their bodies. It's not as good as the original but it does deliver what most fans have come to expect from Wan and Whannell. <br/><br/>After a flashback to 1986, when Josh (Wilson) was a child (Garrett Ryan) and he first met paranormal investigators Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) and her friend Carl (Steve Coulter), the movie picks up right where the first one left off. Elise has been murdered and the police think Josh did it. Renai (Byrne) at first defends her husband but then slowly begins to question whether he's still the man she knows and loves. Have evil spirits gotten a hold of him? Only the secrets from his past can explain why the Lambert family is still haunted now. Whannell and Angus Sampson reprise their roles as paranormal investigators investigating the Lamberts' haunting.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of cool scenes and scares but as a whole I found it a lot less involving (than the first film, as well as Wan's other work). It's almost too fast paced; there's way too much going on without ever slowing down to develop the characters and their emotional investment in what's happening around them. For me this made the film a lot less scary and effective. Technically it's a perfect example of the genre though (mood and atmosphere are great) and if you look at the movies as just one continuous film this movie works a lot more efficiently as just the second and third acts of a bigger story. I love Wan and Whannell's style though (and Whannell and Sampson are once again comedic scene-stealers in the film). Breaking the movie down I liked and enjoyed each scene on it's own but in the context of the whole film I just couldn't get into it like I could the first. Not a bad horror film in any way just not quite as good as I was hoping.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llO-AVcYkfI"
"simon-d-cesair","8","0","0","13 September 2013"," I have read so many bad reviews, but it didn't stop me from going! (TINY SPOILERS INCLUDED)
","So I just came home from watching Insidious: Chapter 2, and I have to say I am glad that I have read so many bad reviews, because my expectations were actually at the lowest point, and guess what?! I ended up loving it! Most of the reviews talk about how the two characters Specs and Tucker get more airtime and give the shock moments a comedic twist which is annoying, but I can only recall one moment, which came out of nowhere, and made the whole movie theater laugh out loud. But besides that I think the movie was much darker and scarier than part one, and even though there wasn't any graphic violence I thought it was very disturbing for a PG-13 movie. Insidious didn't make me jump at all, but Chapter 2 had at least three unexpected scares waiting for me. This one guy next to me kept flinching, and nervously played something on his phone to distract himself, it was hilarious!<br/><br/>I love James Wan as a director because you can be sure if he makes a sequel, it will be deeply connected to the previous part(s). Just like in the Saw movies you will be surprised at all the things that happened in part one Insidious, and suddenly make sense because they are explained in Chapter two; on top of that Wan gave the whole storyline a great amount of depth and new twists. The camera work is still excellent, but why wouldn't it be?! The acting performances are well, still not Oscar worthy, but perfect for the storyline. The music and shock moments are more intense this time and definitely more evolved, and Mr. Wan even has a small part in the movie: As a desktop background! :D <br/><br/>What I noticed was the fact that part two begins where part one left off at, but the children look older, about two years, which is the time frame between Insidious and Insidious: Chapter 2. ;) Oh, well. The editing was a little weird this time as well: It felt like some scenes were just randomly put together, one moment it was day time, the next it was in the middle of the night. Also, the grandmother, a.k.a. Josh's mother was up at 2:30 a.m. and walked around like it was early in the evening or morning. Weird. But since the rest of the movie was very satisfying I can overlook those things. HOWEVER, There is one thing I couldn't ignore, which actually messed up my experience a little: I felt like they pulled an ending out of their asses that could be used to make another sequel. But I would much rather see different movies with new ideas than the same old stories. So I hope there is no sequel coming.<br/><br/>This is not a review like I normally write, but I wanted to share my thoughts while they were still fresh! Insidious: Chapter 2 is It's definitely worth a watch, and if your lower your expectations like I did, you might end liking it even more than the original. :D<br/><br/>My Rating: Insidious: 6.5/10 Insidious: Chapter 2: 7.5/10"
"davidchisholm","7","0","0","23 September 2013"," Derivative but Good
","Psycho, Poltergeist, The Shining and Sleepaway Camp. I mentioned these films because Insidious: Chapter 2 heavily borrows elements from each of these classic horror films. That's not to say its a bad thing for this film since it helps in its favour. Yes its derivative but its an entertaining 2hr flick. The film picks up right where the first Insidious left off with the Lambert family supposedly surviving after getting their eldest son back from a supernatural dimension. All seems well until physic Elise (Lin Shaye) is soon murdered by what seems like dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) or by something Josh brought back from the otherworld. After an unbelievably brief police investigation Josh is free of suspicion for now and the family move in with Josh's mother (Barbara Hershey) but soon after more spirits menace the Lambert family once again. Most of the cast from the original return including the two dorky paranormal investigators played by writer Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson as well as a new physic played by Steve Coulter who first investigated Josh's supernatural occurrences as a kid and leads an investigation as who has come back with Josh from the otherworld. Good performances, story, visual and sounds effects and direction. Overall a decent sequel which I found as good if not better than the original which is rare in the horror genre."

","Taking off straight from the first movie, the family are still haunted, but Josh insists to his wife and mother, to ignore The Piano, and that strange woman in White who is sitting there with her back turned to you.<br/><br/>But if you remember the first movie (which you will, because it features heavily in this), you will realise that there is something wrong with Josh, and all is not well in the Lambert household.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie, it was a haunting, dread filled movie. This movie though just isn't scary, its a cattle prod movie, which means it makes you jump, because your body reacts to the loud noises that come with every single mock scare. <br/><br/>And there are very few that do not appear in the trailer. Okay, a woman runs out of the wardrobe, and a man attacks a boy in a hospital, but when your saying to yourself 'why is that boy allowed to be near an IVAC pump', the film isn't doing its job.<br/><br/>The films eerie tone lost me when you discovered that the Bride in Black is actually a man. But then Wan and Whannell do something, they make the film very interesting, and very clever.<br/><br/>The first film is implemented into this very efficiently, and we learn what the banging on the door was, and who that strange grunge ghost was in the first film, making it a pleasure to watch, rather than annoying, waiting for the next big noise.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's not a scary film by any stretch, and these quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.........Bang!! Movies are getting a little tiresome now, but we will get a third movie, because the film basically tells us this at the end.<br/><br/>So when the makers focus on the storey, rather than the scares, its a joy to watch.."

","I didn't really care for the first movie. Other than two scenes that genuinely sent chills down my spine, I felt the movie was a messy, unbalanced affair with grating comedic relief and a third act that screamed, ""Is there a gas leak in my house and I'm hallucinating?"" However, I found I really dug this one.<br/><br/>While it's obvious that the film relies almost completely on the unimaginative and cheap jump scare, the movie proved to be scary than most horror films released thanks to an excellent creepy and unsettling tone that director James Wan crafted.<br/><br/>The film also does a better job at working in the funny elements where they feel like they are assisting the story and the overall entertainment factor rather than working against it. ""Chapter 2"" also ties together the two movies in super creative and unique ways that make the film feel like it should actually be a three hour epic horror film, rather than two separate movies.<br/><br/>While this one isn't the scariest thing I've seen, I still really enjoyed it and found it creepy.<br/><br/>Hey, like this review?

"scott-sw","7","0","0","15 September 2013"," Decent Sequel
","Insidious Chapter 2 is a frightening, fun, although flawed film. It picks up right after the death of Elise (Lin Shay), and about 20 years ago when Josh (Patrick Wilson) was a boy. Yes, Josh brought something back with him. It was the parasite that stalked him as a boy. It is moving on him. It is moving on Dalton (Ty Simpkin). It is moving on the whole family. In the meantime, Elise's friend, Carl (Steve Coulter) is working with Specks and Tucker to unravel what has happened. It leads them to a a very dark secret about the parasite - or the Black Widow. First, the movie provides good suspense, good scares, and surprises without the menacing music, buckets of blood and gore, and NO CGI effects. It's a good old-fashioned ghost story with mystery, intrigue, and fear. I do have a few gripes. The story's pace is slowed by uneven execution. Between stories of Reyne's suspicion, Carl's endeavor with Spec and Tucker, and Dalton's returning clairvoyance, the story loses cohesion. I was interested in Dalton's take on things (since he was mostly in a coma in the first one). However, his story line is relegated to the back seat to focus on Josh. While Josh's story is interesting, it also takes a back seat to the uncovering of the past secrets of the black bride parasite. Finally, many of the same elements are repeated - some of which defy logic and common sense. Still, it has a familiar family we love, and a great mystery. If you liked the first one, you should like this one - but probably not as much as the first one."

"jesse-hitzroth","6","3","8","12 September 2013"," Going back into the further
","Insidious was one of my favourite horror films in the past couple years. It was scary, thrilling and it stuck with me long after. Most horror films can no longer due this to an audience anymore. However horror master James Wan was up for the challenge and made two horror films this year 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious chapter 2'. Many folks will compare these two films and debate which one is scarier. The Conjuring in my opinion was a well made horror film however it lacked the scares. The story was well done and the film did a great job of building tension however it was short on scares. Insidious chapter 2 has the opposite problem, it has the scares and tension however the story just gets ridiculous and weird as it moves fourth.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 is a film that does not need to be made however James Wan felt he needed to continue the story and show us more of this horrible world. The film picks up exactly where Insidious left off. This will not be a friendly film for viewers that have not seen the first one. Chapter 2 flashes back and fourth from the first film and really much like the title this is chapter 2 in the story. Insidious chapter 2 starts off well enough and has many decent scares in the film, however the longer the film goes on the weirder and stranger it gets. James Wan is great with the camera work and scares once again however story telling this time around not so much.<br/><br/>Many people complained about the 3 rd act in the original insidious because of the 'further' and so it should be known that this film centres around the 'further' for the majority of the film. Chapter 2 does a great job of making some connections to the previous film and offers some nice new surprises. However it's a shame the film falters under it's own weight. <br/><br/>While not a great film by any means, it's not awful like some people would have you believe. Basically in my opinion if you liked the first film you will find something to enjoy here possibly. If you didn't like the first chapter then stay the hell away from this one. James Wan said he will not be returning to horror after this film, which is a shame as he is so great at it, so lets hope he is only taking a short break. Insidious does deserve better but honestly as far as sequels go you could do a lot worse. I had fun and even jumped quite a few times, so chapter 2 did it's purpose, however most viewers i feel will poke more fun at it then it deserves. <br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10"

"Slasher_Lover23","6","6","24","13 September 2013"," One of the worst sequels I've seen
","The film starts out with a flashback of Patrick Wilson's character Josh's younger self. It is when Elise is first introduced to Josh and Lorraine and we see how Josh has no recollection of his haunting's as a boy. Flash to the present and it takes place a few hours after the ending of the original film. Josh is a prime suspect in the case of Elise's (Lin Shaye) murder. Though Josh's wife Renai (Rose Byrne) remains confident that Josh is innocent. At this point in time, Josh and Renai, along with their three children are now living with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey). But when the strange occurrences begin to happen again and Josh begins acting strangely, the family must re-enlist the help of Specs and Tucker (Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson), along with Carl (Steve Coulter), an old friend of Elise's, in order to end the nightmare once and for all.<br/><br/>After the great success of the first it apparently seems only natural to make a sequel, and of course throw in a back story. While this may work for some horror sequels, it certainly doesn't work for Insidious: Chapter 2. The film is as atmospheric as it's predecessor, but it definitely does not provide the scares of the first. The scares in the first film worked brilliantly because of how unexpected they are, in the sequel I was able to sense them coming. Not to mention, a lot of the scares seemed like they were stolen from James Wan's recent hit ghost flick The Conjuring, but only tweaked. The acting was well-done, especially by Patrick Wilson's character. As Josh's behavior escalates, Wilson brings a very terrifying performance to go with it, making the viewer as fearful of him as the characters become. Along with Wilson, is Lin Shaye, whose return as Elyse is one of the films very few saving graces. What mostly makes Insidious 2 just so awful is the story. It is nowhere near engaging as the first film's, and it is just flat out boring. It brings nothing new to the table, and it only sends the characters on a wild goose chase to figure things out. When the secrets were revealed, I found myself thinking: ""you better be kidding"". The back story they give to the occurrences is so ridiculous and makes a complete mess of the original's story. Not only that, but the back story of the main ghost is so laughable you can't take it seriously in any shape or form. The film also suffers from way too many unintentional AND intentional laughs.<br/><br/>While Insidious: Chapter 2 is backed by some creepy atmosphere and solid performances by Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye, it doesn't prevent the film from being one of the worst sequels I've ever seen.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10"

","Insidious Chapter 2 is arguably one of the best horror sequels ever made. It keeps the elements that made the original so successful intact, while introducing the audience to new/ different pieces to freshen it up. <br/><br/>While watching the film I could really see how The Conjuring educated Wan in how to set up horror scenes for more effective delivery. Just like there was ""Hide and Clap"" (children's game) in The Conjuring, he introduces ""The Can Telephone"" to set up quite the satisfying scare towards the middle. I really appreciated this prop coming in at the end as well.. His movies have such a creative / playfulness in scare manifestation. His team now has an inexhaustible element to continue to play with. Maybe this will even become his signature style of scare? <br/><br/>This was an effective sequel as well because it deepens and expands the story simultaneously. We get to see what happens seconds later after the first film, while going into Josh's past.. I so enjoyed seeing scenes from the first film reevaluated too.. This is reminiscent of great sequels such as Back to the Future Part Two and Harry Potter 3. <br/><br/>So overall, this is a great film. Wan and his team keeps getting better and better at their craft, developing and playing with new ways to scare, while staying within their signature style. The film in the end comes to a very satisfying conclusion.. <br/><br/>As much as I loved this film, I really hope it ends here. They did such a great job avoiding sequel pitfalls, I'm not sure a third film would be as successful.. <br/><br/>They end it where hope and dread meet. Is there any better place to be?"

But the parents Renai (Rose Bryne) and Josh (Patrick Wilson) are told by a median who has connections to a spiritual world that it's not the house that's haunted, it's their son and his spirit is lost in a spiritual world and they have to find a way to get him back.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 was made in a different style with twists and turns that the audience will not be expecting. <br/><br/>The story of the sequel is the haunted Lambert family move in with Josh's mother at her house where 30 years ago a young Josh was experiencing the same kind of disturbances and hauntings. With new characters and twists in the story, Insidious: Chapter 2 introduces new evil spirits, old ones and a disturbing twist which left me and most of the audience shaking after the movie finished.<br/><br/>Directed by James Wan, who has already made himself an iconic horror movie director with recent success' including the Saw series, Dead Silence and his newest and probably best horror movie The Conjuring, has done it again in this brilliant ghost house masterpiece after the success of the first instalment.<br/><br/>On the opening weekend Insidious: Chapter 2 smashed the box office with $20 million, and after the weekend finished, it saw a budget of $41 million record at the box office.

The ending suggests there will be a 3rd film in the near future and I have absolute faith that this franchise will know when to stop for the sake of quality film production.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson continues his fantastic run of horror film roles in Insidious: Chapter 2. He plays the role of a man struck by an unexplainable dilemma in a superb fashion, even channeling shades of Jack Nicholson's character in The Shining when his possession appears to be in full force. Rose Byrne also plays the role of the mother to a tee once again with a seemingly natural display of a mother who is watching her life be toyed with. <br/><br/>The jumpy moments and scary scenes are in full force and perfect positioning. As a man who is rarely scared by most horror films, and found the first Insidious to be mildly terrifying, I will assure you that this film had me briefly toying with the idea of leaving out of anticipation for a real fright. I'm so glad I stuck firmly to my seat! Despite the real horror elements, there is a good plot and general explanation for why everything takes place in the film. Any questions are tied up and are not merely thrown in whenever is convenient for the director. There are brief comedic moments,featuring the two assistants to the medium in the first film, as well as a cleverly placed reunion scene towards the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>In short, this is a film which went against the stereotype that quality horror movies generally fail to answer with an equally impressive sequel. It has great actors, great special effects and a gripping plot which had me hooked from start to finish. I would strongly support that any fan of high quality, slow-burning horrors/thrillers should ensure they see this movie in cinemas or when it is released on DVD."

","OK first off let me say this movie wasn't all that bad but I was fairly disappointed with this latest installment. Now don't get me wrong it had its moments but I felt like the story was forced. There were points in the movie where I almost thought this was a comedy. The first had some comedic moments but the scares were more effective. What really ruined the movie was the forced ending (i won't spoil it) just expect a third film at some point. Overall insidious chapter 2 is a hit and miss for me. Mainly being that they answered some questions I had from the first while raising new ones for a potentially third installment and the fact that they really expanded on the story, but also the story felt a little forced plus the huge cliffhanger of an ending ruined my experience.

","I really enjoy this film. It fits in so well with ""Insidious"" and I love how they tie in scenes from the first film. The plot in this movie is great because it makes things interesting and twisted while still keeping you in the loop of what's going on. The first film in the ""Insidious"" series makes so much more sense now because ""Insidious Chapter 2"" explains so much. I think the soundtrack for this film is awesome. All of the special effects noises are instrumentals are really loud, intense and gritty. They give this film a unique feel and it captures the horror in the movie perfectly. I think the cinematography and visuals in this movie are very powerful. The color choices are spot on. When in the spirit world, everything is given a subtle bluish-green hue and there is lots of fog, I think this is super cool because it shows the separation from reality in a way that is obvious, but not overdone. And since everything is a very similar color in the spirit realm scenes, the accents of bold colors stand out even more and create a dramatic effect. <br/><br/>My favorite character is Josh Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. At first I didn't honestly like this character because I thought the acting was not very genuine which was odd because Patrick Wilson does an amazing job in the first movie, but soon I realized that this was on purpose. There's something new about this character, something a little off and it makes the film amazing. I think Patrick does an amazing job portraying these subtle changes in personality. I can't say much more about this though because I don't want to spoil the plot.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge fan of the horror/thriller genre, and a sucker for supernatural films. Insidious Chapter 2 definitely gave me the creeps and I admit it did make me jump several times, but it wasn't overly scary. I give Insidious Chapter 2 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13+ because it's an intense film. So be sure to check it out in a theater near you!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST!

"luvdabuff","5","2","6","13 September 2013"," Not as good as the first, but better than most
","Insidious Chapter 2 is no Insidious. After watching the first, (by myself, late at night) I had to watch ""The House Bunny"" before I could go to bed. While Chapter 2 has the requisite jump scares and ghouls in creepy make-up, the eerie foreboding, unsettling visuals and tense atmosphere that pervaded the first film just aren't as effective. Part of the reason is the sense of ""been there done that"" that was perhaps inevitable. Many of the gags from the first film are repeated here and there are really only so many ways for Rose Byrne to walk around a giant empty house looking scared. While still effective to an extent, the ""punch"" is gone (there is, however a nifty retconning of an event from the first film that I enjoyed). Unfortunately,the back half of the film abandons whatever spooky atmosphere it has managed to create, and devolves into a paranormal riff on The Shining (not unlike another Rose Byrne vehicle, ""Sunshine"", a favorite of mine that is almost ruined by the last 20 minutes, when it turns into a slasher film). Having said all that, Insidious Chapter 2 is still better than 95% of sequels out there and certainly almost any sequel in the horror genre. It mostly just suffers in comparison to the first film (I went to a double feature back-to-back screening which exacerbates the problem). It's a little goofier and the writing/plotting isn't as sharp, but it still manages to drum up some effective scares. If you liked the first one, you'll most likely find something to enjoy in Chapter 2."
"Sean_Friel","7","1","2","19 April 2020"," A less scary improvement from the original instalment
","Any plot holes left by Insidious have been brilliantly addressed in the interesting sequel.<br/><br/>The film picks up from where the first one left of. After the Lambert's son is rescued from another realm they mistakenly think they are safe from the evil forces that once haunted them.<br/><br/>The film doesn't provide the same scares that the 2011 title provided but fills the holes that were previous left.<br/><br/>The writing for the film is fascinating. Followers of the last film should be able to enjoy this film as it is far less frustrating.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film Insidious: Chapter 2 may not work as the plots is complex thus you must watch the first film for the second to work.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson's performance as the father of the family Josh must be noted. He more than amends himself for his less than impressive performance in the previous film.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is certainly fun film that will be better appreciated by horror enthusiasts. However, due to less scares casual audiences may disrespected by casual audiences.<br/><br/>Another victory by director James Wan."

My expecteitions were wrong.
The story is so nonsensical, that is actually funny.
But you know, the best aspect of this is not the cinematography like in the first one, it's actually Patrick Wilson. He's so over the top as this poor man's version of Jack Nicholson in The Shining that is a blast watching it, it's comedy gold.

","I watched this film on Netflix because I was looking for something to distract me while spinning on my indoor bike - unfortunately, the movie was neither interesting nor entertaining enough to do so. Pretty much all of the standard tropes showed up: creepy boys dressed up as creepy girls, murderous psycho-mothers, murderous possessed dads (including scenes that looked like discards from ""The Shining""), bumbling para- normal investigators, spooky abandoned hospitals, and lots of murky misty shots of the 'other side'. The last was likely a wise move, considering how ridiculous the chief spook looked (and acted) when fully illuminated. The first ""Insidious"" was reasonably well done and had some memorable moments. This sequel adds nothing to the story and either lacks, or repeats, whatever made the first one worth watching. The last scene seems to set up a franchise revolving around two bumbling ghost busters and their associate 'on the other side'. I'll never know because I won't be watching '3'."

","It is said that the Plains Indians used every part of the buffalo that they hunted. In much the same way, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" (PG-13, 1:45) uses everything at its disposal - and does so VERY effectively.<br/><br/>The follow-up to the equally good 2010 ""Insidious"" takes the Lambert family's story forward from about where the original left off. Unfortunately, there's very little I can tell you about the plot without spoiling the fun. Suffice it to say that it's not all that easy to enter the spirit world and return without being changed by the experience. I can't even tell you everyone who's in this movie without spoiling something. What I can tell you is that Patrick Wilson is back as the dad, Rose Byrne as his wife and Barbara Hershey as his mother. Oh, and James Wan is back as director and Leigh Whannell as writer.<br/><br/>As we watch the film unfold and start to worry more and more about the effect that dad's journey in the last movie had on him.... not much happens, but Wan keeps us engaged with low-tech, old-school scares designed to make you jump in your seat. When things do start happening, the plot seems to be heading in several different directions at the same time, but then something amazing happens. The film weaves together every character, every plot point and even the most minor details so tightly that it would put an Egyptian sheet manufacturer to shame... but would make the Native American buffalo hunters very proud. (Please excuse my mixed metaphors. I couldn't decide which one to use, so I used them both.) ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" does contain some shaky acting, but the film is one of the best constructed and most entertaining horror movies I've seen in a long time. ""A-"""

","I really like how the story very nicely jumps to its core without having to build too long. This is absolutely a great choice to take since the original movie did quite different than other horrors by leaving the audience with a great conflict potential. So in this movie it felt very tense all along this movie knowing that one of the characters is a menace in disguise. The acting overall is still just about the same job as did the original movie. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson did just okay in their performances. It's very clear that the movie relies more on the jump-scares and less on good acting. But still I think this movie is better than the original since it flew right to its core and the overall suspense mood."

So there's no doubt I would enjoy the second installment in the Insidious series.<br/><br/>The story was almost as shocking and nerve wrenching as the first one and can actually be shocking at times. For example, they explain some of the occurrences that happened in the first film that you didn't know were supposed to be explained. My only criticism of the story is that there was such a strong build up, but a bit of a disappointing climax.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was just as eerie and creepy as the first one. (The Further is still creepy as hell) The acting is pretty decent, but the film also does suffer from some of the same issues that the first one did. It was all jump scares.

But now that I'm older and I analyze a bit more, there's really only jump scares which get old after a while.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter Two is almost as good as the first one, but not quite.

"ketgup83","6","1","2","17 December 2013"," Spooky Less !!!
","Nail biting , nerve-breaking and curiosity is part of watching a horror movie. If you have tense moments engaged in any horror , then half of the director's job is done in scaring people. Insidious 2 fails to live up to the expectations raised by the director of The Conjuring and Saw.<br/><br/>The Lambert family has moved to a new house but the ghost of the past is haunting them. The family must seek a way to fight off the evil before something serious happens in the house.<br/><br/>Looking at the trailer of Insidious 2 made me excited about watching the movie, especially the first part had its share of scary moments. As the movie begin, not much justice has been done to spooky moments. The movie gives you tense moments but those are few in number to scare the hell out of you. James Wan is not in form this time. The process to create a haunting scenario is not upto the mark. The story is good but the screenplay is loose. Even the cinematography is ordinary. Performances by Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson is refreshing.<br/><br/>Overall , I felt slight disappointed with spooky-less flick. Average 2.5/5"
"thefadingcam","3","1","2","11 December 2013"," When the mystery is explained, what is there to scare us except the vulgar jump scare?
","Following the commercial success of the first chapter, Insidious: Chapter 2 eventually happened. With a lot of hype and anticipation, Insidious 2 arrived. Unfortunately, not with the quality standard of the first. The movie starts well, in an intriguing and mysterious way, but it doesn't take much time to understand what we are going to watch. It tries to be a direct sequel (what audiences normally wants), and thus we are presented with a squeezed new story that intertwines with the one of the first chapter, and kind of explains it, losing all the mystery. Mystery lost, Insidious 2 main weapon is the jump scare, the sudden loud sound effect, the ugly faces. When you understand whats in the dark, what could there be left to scare you? Barbra Hershey is forcefully presented on an almost main role on a plot that is filled with holes. By the end we have a full bag of unimaginative clichés and crappy fantasy, losing all the credibility this Insidious' 2 horror could have. It's a shame, because James Wan knows how to scare you, like he already proved this year with The Conjuring. Visit us on thefadingcam blog on blogspot.

"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","10 December 2013"," Partitions in space
","We understand that the supernatural, what we call the supernatural anyway and identify as ghosts, has something to do with mind and conjured vision, this is why in so many of the films tools to that effect are central in the action: hypnosis, seance, memory, dreams and so forth. And yet the apparitions, insofar as we are faced with horror films, have to be understood in space itself, they can never be 'just a dream'.<br/><br/>So for me two things are of importance.<br/><br/>The handling of apparitions. Both this and the first film are very good in this regard, they have that concentration to a space already tense, charged, with the anticipation of something in it. We have all that staring into darkness, behind a door, in a dark corner of the room, inside a closet. Always effective when accompanied with the usual cues, this sets up in us the anticipation of presence. <br/><br/>So simply as a horror film this counts as a success in my book and if you're looking for this spatial intensity it can reward.<br/><br/>The other thing is the understanding of mind that subtends this space. This is let's say the ground from which the main action springs, and yet it can limit an otherwise fine film as much as a literal appearance of god can narrow a film on spiritual belief and transcendence.<br/><br/>In both films we have a literal ghost dimension that souls coldly roam and our protagonist must traverse in order to defeat the evil spirit in its realm. We're shown here two levels, reality and spirit realm and a causal connection between the two. What happens in one literally has power to control the other. This oft encountered notion seems to rest on a misunderstanding of the subconscious as an actual 'zone' somewhere in the mind instead of much more likely the level of attentive consciousness I bring to mind.<br/><br/>In this respect we have lots of mumbo jumbo here, topped by even a folding of time from the spirit realm!<br/><br/>We have sadly no real masters working in this field, I say this as a lifelong fan of horror who'd like to see some innovative work. Talented filmmakers of space, Reygadas or Malick these days, Cassavetes earlier, likely find nothing of real value in the scare to go through the effort of preparing the space for it. But until someone with vision tries the subject, small films like this are all we have and almost enough to satisfy."
"paul_haakonsen","5","1","2","7 December 2013"," Things tend to happen when it gets dark...
","Continuing where the first movie left off, part two is actually a brisk step up in pace and intensity. Whereas I wasn't particularly impressed with the first movie, I found part two to be somewhat more fulfilling. It is far from perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>It should be pointed out that you should watch part one prior to watching this movie to fully grasp the concept of the movie and understand what is going on.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really scary, but it does build up some nice enough scenes. And it was really a nice touch on director James Wan's part with the way that he tied the events in the movie together in a great continuous flow, and giving you a satisfactory explanation to things that initially leaves you in the dark - literally.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of being scary, then ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is an improvement from the first movie. But personally I enjoy something more spooky, scary and disturbing from a movie in this genre.<br/><br/>The people in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles, and it is nice to see people returning to the characters from the 2010 movie.<br/><br/>As for the ending of the movie, well... It was a cliffhanger, sure. And knowing that a third installment to the series in the works, it has aroused some interest in just what it was that spooked departed Elise that much.<br/><br/>""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a definite must-watch if you enjoyed the first movie.<br/><br/>But given the lack of scares and actually any scary spirits, then I am rating the movie a mere 5 out of 10 stars. Will I watch the third movie when it is out? Sure, because I want to see what spooked Elise..."
"zactac","8","1","2","17 October 2013"," Great sequel, even if it doesn't completely live up to the first one.
","While the first ""Insidious"" took a much more chilling and slow way to get the scares, the sequel is a tad bit different in that sense. Don't get me wrong, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is great horror movie fare. I just feel it could've been scarier.<br/><br/>The sequel keeps the promise of it's title (something many movies in our time fail to even do). The movie starts off right at the end of the first one and it continues the story of the Lambert family. Things seem to be calm now, life is finally back to normal for them. However, things get weird when the noises start up again along with some violent outbursts from some unfriendly guests. Yet this isn't even the worst of their problems. One certain family member seems to be losing his mind as he mutters to himself while acting completely out of character. Is something wrong with dad? <br/><br/>One of the few things I had mixed feelings about in the first movie was the place called ""The Further."" It was definitely something of a new element compared to other recent haunted house movies, however, I just felt they didn't expand on the idea as much as they could've in the original. Happily though, they fix that in this movie. ""The Further"" is made as a much bigger part in this movie and the potential it has was finally used. You get to see some very interesting things (makeshift breadcrumbs for being lost, finding a world among the dead never seen before, and even answering questions you never realized you had). All in all, I was very happy with the much better use of ""The Further."" <br/><br/>Also the acting was fantastic. The actors were definitely pushed to take their characters to new places. The father becoming insane (almost ""Shining"" like), the wife becoming a fighter, and the son (comatose for most of the first movie) becoming the kind of ""man of the house"" while his father is losing it. So having great acting was definitely a nice plus. After all, how many horror movies can say they had actors who could hold your attention without any sex scenes? <br/><br/>Sadly, there are some negatives. Maybe I'm just biased in favor of the original in this circumstance but I feel this movie was not as chilling as the first one. The first movie was very chilling so the standards were already high but I can't help but feel disappointed. However, there were some nice scare scenes that you would not see coming as well as an intense climax that will take your breath away.<br/><br/>Over all, this is a very fine addition to the inevitable franchise that is to come. Usually sequels to horror movies are terrible but this one actually did very well. It might not have been as scary as the first but it made up for that with great acting, nicely written script, nice atmosphere and intense climax. Enjoy this movie while it lasts (after all, it won't be long before we have ""Insidious: Book 4 Chapter 6"" along with ""Paranormal Activity 20"")."

","This is a good movie. The story is somewhat muddled but that is more than made up for by the acting and the characters. The idea of someone actually being someone else is not new, but in this movie it is given a new twist, with good results. The star of this movie is Barbara Hershey whose presence improves this movie a lot. Malevolent spirits in a alternate universe interacting with the living to cause mayhem can come off as hokey, but in this movie it works. The connection between the here and there is established and is made to seem believable. Children are most vulnerable to manipulation, but there are heroes too, which balances out the story. Elise is a hero, in both worlds. Patrick Wilson gives a strong performance as a man possessed for decades. What is real and not real becomes blurred as behavior becomes more erratic and violent and those around you can only wonder and become concerned - and frightened. How would you feel if one day you discovered that your spouse was possessed by an evil spirit?"

","The first felt like a complete film - the dynamics between the main couple were interesting, there was a tension that gave depth and emotion to the horror element. The performances and atmosphere were properly attended to and it all worked.<br/><br/>In the sequel, the performances, characters and emotional depth are discarded in favour of over-cooking the narrative. It plays out like a TV movie (shot on DV) of something like American Horror Story, where story elements, jump moments and historical causes fly thick and fast.<br/><br/>There are too many references to other haunted house films and clichés, The Shining and Psycho. Those latter references (which are extremely blatant) make you wish you were watching a ""real"" film of that calibre, and only serve to highlight how amateur feeling this whole thing is. <br/><br/>Leigh Whannels script, whilst over excited does have some nice touches (as well as clunkers), but James Wan's direction felt totally uninspired and rushed this time around."
"YourRatingSystem","7","1","2","15 September 2013"," What I Saw
","I'm not too familiar with James Wan and my memory of the first installment of Insidious is a bit hazy, considering that I've only watched it once because I found it funny when they decided to bring Darth Maul into the movie and use Tiny Tim music to set the tone of the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 is a lot better than what I had expected it to be. However, I felt like they recycled some of their 'jump scare' methods from the first film. Also, what made it annoying was the sound effects from the violin being played every five seconds as they try to force in as many jump scares as they can, making it seem forced and unneeded. <br/><br/>They added comedic relief within the movie, which I applaud them for trying something different (but not unheard of). However, it felt like it didn't fit into the movie as well as I hoped it would be. As much as I enjoyed the comedic side, I would've valued it more if they somehow planned it more efficiently or played around with it a little bit more so that it wouldn't be as inconsistent with the tone of the film (which I understand is hard to incorporate, especially within a thriller/horror film).<br/><br/>Insidious does well to add elements of action, making it consistent compared to most thriller/horror films. Overall, if you haven't, watch the first film before watching Chapter 2 because it picks up where the first film ended. It is a great sequel which I would highly recommend if you want to have a good thriller experience."
"CowherPowerForever","7","1","2","14 September 2013"," Good But Not Great
","From Director James Wan comes a sequel to Insidious that on the surface could have been something just as good as the first film but falls short. I went into the theater expecting a film on par or better than part one of Insidious however I left feeling empty in that regard. However after taking time to think about the film while it is not as good as part one it is still a good film and better than most horror films that are released today.<br/><br/>James Wan is without a doubt my favorite horror genre director today. He brought us Saw, Insidious part one, lesser known films but still great such as Dead Silence and Death Sentence, as well as The Conjuring which was released just under two months ago. He knows how to make a great film. With each new film he makes we get to see why he is such a great director. But this film is missing something. Surprisingly this is his first sequel that he ever directed. He has only written sequels in the past. And I would have to say this is his worst written sequel to date. Leigh Whannell also wrote this film and again this outing has to be his least interesting outing to date. But Whannell in my opinion just like Wan is the best at what he does in the horror genre today and that is write.<br/><br/>The writing from writer Leigh Whannell and James Wan overall is not awful it is just not as good as previous works by these two men. Sequels aren't as easy to make and these two strive to make quality films all the time. However this film tries too hard and the outcome is not that good.<br/><br/>The music in this film is amazing and it just feels like a classic horror film where you remember the music for ages. Wan and Whannell brought us Saw and that film has one of the all time classic scores ever. I wouldn't call the score in Insidious classic just yet but it is indeed memorable.<br/><br/>The acting with the cast similar to part one is overall very good. Patrick Wilson pulls off some amazing work in this film. My only complaint in this department is Rose Byrne who doesn't seem she can act her way out of a paper bag let alone big screen movies.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a step down from Insidious part one but still one of the better overall horror films considering the trashed that is released nowadays. If you are a fan of the first film don't set high expectations for the film and you will leave the theater enjoying this movie. Final rating 6.5/10"
"Halorz","8","1","2","13 September 2013"," James Wan Does It Again!
","James Wan picks up from the last installment and certainly does not disappoint. This film really does live up to the hype. After watching it, I was so glad that I recently watched ""Insidious Chapter I"". I do agree that you can watch the film without seeing the first part however I think if you do, you will appreciate part II even more. <br/><br/>James Wan's intricate woven plot proves that horror films don't need to be linear with some blood and gore to be scary. James Wan's direction for ""The Conjuring"" and ""Insidious I"" was spot on. It is no different this time around. Insidious Chapter II deals with many sub layers like time travel but Wan seamlessly pulls it off. He seems to have mastered the use of lighting which creates this creepy yet thrilling atmosphere. The pacing of the film is perfect and personally I think an improvement from last time. I like the way Wan creates suspense with no music just silence. It isn't too obvious when the scares are going to happen. That sense of not knowing is the reason why I enjoyed it. Also if Wan does go for a big scare, it will be a ""BIG"" scare. <br/><br/>Insidious II has good acting, good suspense and definitely some good scares. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne on top form once again. Definitely go and see ""Insidious chapter II"". It certainly is one of the better horror films in recent years. You will not be disappointed!"

","Really surprised be, but I found this movie was leaps, and bounds better than the first one. There is a real story here that has been fully fleshed out, and worked out. Some really funny moment hidden in there also. The actors no longer look as thought they are lost in an adlibed improv session gone wrong. The spirits finally make sense in what they want, and who is truly malicious, or not. The camera work is good, but the only real drawback, and place were this movie is not filled out. You get great scenes in ll clear high end, and well edited film, and every time there is action, or quick close-ups needed, then you get what looks like a home HD cam being used, and this really is noticeable throughout the movie. Over all though I really Enjoyed this sequel much better than the original, and now look forward to the next chapter. Even if you didn't like the first movie at all, I suggest that you give chapter 2 a chance, You too may see that there is more here than was originally on offer."

","Me and a couple pals were excited to go see a midnight showing of insidious chapter 2. The movie started out slow, and ended slow. The storyline was great, perfectly continuing were the first one left off and with a different theme all together. Now the devil is back in the real world, and wants too kill. It was rather boring, not very scary. Me and my friends walked out of the theater very disappointed. I had a friend tag along who hadn't seen the first one, and it made absolutely no sense to him. that isn't necessarily a huge deal but it would have been nice if they kind of explained everything again somehow. like a journal of the boys mother or father explaining everything that happened. The acting was nothing special.<br/><br/>then we get to the worst part, the end. The lady who is trying to kill them dies and they all think they are safe. Elise is in the spirit world and everything starts melting away, shes going to a better place. but then she looks to her left, screams, then it cuts to credits. It was stupid in all honesty, so now we will have to wait another two years to see the third one just to be angered once again."
"goodmourning","9","1","3","27 September 2013"," Pure horrific gold.
","First off I am a huge James Wan fan, I love everything he has directed; Saw, Dead Silence, Death Sentence, Insidious, The Conjuring, and now Insidious: Chapter 2. He blows me away one film at a film. He truly is saving the modern mainstream horror industry. Insidious: Chapter 2 begins right where its predecessor ends, immediate thrill and immediate scares. This film answers all of the unanswered questions from the first; the thing is I didn't even realize that I HAD unanswered questions from the first. What I appreciate the most about both Insidious films is that James hates fake scares, when something is scraping at your window no it is not ""the wind"" but it is exactly what your instincts tell you, something you should be running away from! His ghostly characters will literally sit on the couch for minutes at a time; they're so out there and so realistic, which is a rare find. The character development is astounding, we experience Patrick Wilson's character Josh go from loving family man to soulless and frightening evil in literal seconds. Even if you are not a fan of Insidious, I do suggest you still go see its sequel because it might just make you appreciate the first one a heck of a lot more. Insidious: Chapter 2 is pure unique cinematic horror gold."
"arkvoodle85","7","1","3","24 September 2013"," Surprisingly not a letdown
","I think this is the first horror movie I've seen in theatres since Sinister, so it was nice to get the authentic, terrifying experience that you can only get at the cinema. My favourite part was how the girls sitting behind me talked nervously throughout the whole film, screamed at the scary parts, and then at the end, said it wasn't that scary. Some people. Insidious 2 picks up right after the horrific events of the first film. Dalton's astral projection days seem to be behind him, the Lambert family is safe and everything is honky dory...Well almost everything While the police are investigating Elise Rainier's death, the Lamberts are forced to move into Josh's childhood home (you know, that place where he was haunted by that black witch for years and years). In the new house, things are fine for about ten minutes, then Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh's mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) start seeing and hearing things again. Dalton, who we were all hoping would just go the F*** to sleep like a normal kid, starts seeing dead people again. They are all extremely freaked. Worse still, there is something a little off about Josh (Patrick Wilson).<br/><br/>Luckily Elise's old friend Carl (Steve Coulter) arrives help investigate the cause of the hauntings this time around. He wears a trench coat, boasts a distractingly fake looking beard, and sports a pair of vicious sexual offender bifocal glasses, but other than that he's pretty cool. Things take a terrifying turn as Carl, Lorraine, Specs and Tucker (Elise's loyal assistants) delve further into the case of the Bride in Black, who has been following Josh since he was a child. Can they uncover the unsettling truth about this malevolent spirit before it tears the Lambert family apart?<br/><br/>While not quite as terrifying as the first of the franchise, Insidious 2 offers its fair share of scares, and is by no means a letdown. I feel like Whannell really outdid himself writing this script. It ties in beautifully with the first movie and features a very creepy backstory detailing the origin of the antagonist, The Bride in Black. The subplot, in which Lorraine, Carl, Specs and Tucker investigate the origin of the Bride in Black is very suspenseful and intense. These scenes offer tons of scares and are just plain disturbing. The scenes taking place in the Further are also suspenseful, and resolve some questions left over from the first film. Josh's transformation throughout the film is simply terrifying. Wilson turns in a strong performance portraying what turns out to be a rather complicated character. Similar to its predecessor, Insidious 2 contains a few boarder line cheesy scenes in the latter half of the film, but nothing as extreme as Darth Goatfeet from Insidious. There were also a couple pieces of dialogue in this film that could be summed up as silly too, but they made me laugh so I can't fault the writer for that. <br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations for this film because honestly I didn't see the need for a sequel. Hollywood has a notorious track record for beating the dead horse and churning out sequels like sixteen year old chicks pop out kids. I was wrong. This movie was about as good as an unplanned sequel to a horror movie can be. Again I applaud Whannell's storytelling and ability to make this sequel a relevant part of modern horror. I know that I will be buying this movie when it comes out on DVD, it's a necessary piece of any horror collection."
"user-543-975655","8","1","3","22 September 2013"," A Very Well Made Sequel
","I know I probably should have reviewed the first Insidious first, but I saw this one more recently and was compelled to review this one first. This movie was a great sequel to the first Insidious horror, and was a good use of my time. The 106 minutes flew by while I was watching. The events in the first film that weren't really explained that much were all explained in depth in the second installation. The 2nd chapter was also very scary, and full of jump scenes, and they were well made, don't get me wrong, but they were less surprising and less plentiful than the first. However, this movie was an above averagely scary PG-13, meaning most movies that are this scary are almost always rated R, which is another reason you could go see it. Also, this is a movie that you could go see with the kids, if they don't get scared that easily, because there is no nudity, which I like, and there are also no usages of F***, which I also like. However, if you go see it with kids under 12 or around there, they will probably have nightmares for the rest of the week. I was scared throughout the whole movie, because I knew something was coming but I never knew what. I saw it with my Dad, and he doesn't get scared that easily, and he was scared a lot of times too, so you know by that that the movie's scary. Aside from the scariness, the acting was as good, if not better than the first. It has the ""Carrie"" relationship, I call it. This means that if Josh Lambert was Carrie, and the new remake of Carrie is coming out this year or next, and Chloe Grace-Moretz is playing the new Carrie, previously played by Sissy Spacek, and since Patrick Wilson plays Josh, If they make a remake of Insidious, Chloe Grace-Moretz might not pull off the role of Carrie, but I don't know because as of right now the movie hasn't come out yet but I want to see it, the person who plays Josh will probably not pull off the role. Long sentence to make a short point, but I couldn't shorten it. He did a memorable and irreplaceable job as Josh Lambert. Also, the movie was very similar to the first, production wise and film wise. There were the same actors, the same producer, the same writer, the same composer, and some of the same entities, which made it even more realistic. The extra characters that were added in just made the film better. But never mind that, I'll talk about James Wan's interesting directing style. Instead of the fulfilling sense of dread, he uses the instant scene change style, which you don't see that much nowadays. In today's horrors, thew directors like to do a slo mo intro to the ghost most of the time, but James Wan holds nothing back. If he wants you to be scared, you'll be scared, for almost sure. This was how it was in the original film, which was also scary. By the way, the writers of the movie know where to put in specks of comedy. I give this movie and the first movie an 8 because it was very scary and realistic. GO SEE IT!"
"zardoz-13","10","1","3","22 September 2013"," Behind the Red Door
","Ever since Oren Peli parlayed ""Paranormal Activity"" into a mega-successful franchise, horror movies shunning all traces of blood, gore, and mutilation have been the rage. The satantically-oriented ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise, for example, is embarking on its fifth installment. Peli's spooky success has rubbed off on writer & director James Wan. Wan made a name of himself with the original ""Saw,"" the guts-and-gore, torture-yourself franchise about a serial killer who inspires reprobates as awful as him to end their lives in a blaze of pain. After the millions of dollars that ""Saw"" yielded, Wan left the remaining five ""Saw"" sequels in other hands. He made ""Death Silence"" and ""Death Sentence."" Neither exerted the impact of ""Saw,"" and the young Malaysian director languished until Peli came along with ""Insidious."" Wan and his long-time ""Saw"" collaborator Leigh Whannell teamed up again, and ""Insidious"" used demoniac possession to scare up a mite more than $54 million on a $1.5 million budget. After a week in general release, ""Insidious Chapter 2"" has sold enough tickets to surpass the original's life-time haul. Between the two ""Insidious"" movies, Wan created another hair-raising hit with ""The Conjuring."" This white-knuckled ghost story has earned approximately $271 million worldwide. ""The Conjuring"" and the two ""Insidious"" epics exemplify a new breed of horror movie. They shun the blood, gore, and mutilation of hell-raisers such as the blood-sodden ""Evil Dead"" remake. Indeed, Wan's ""Insidious"" outings aren't designed to make you gag as hideous events unfold before your eyes. Like Peli, Wan has given spooky sagas a new lease on life. Scares are served up in the form of surprises. Goose bumps cover your forearms. Something mysterious lunges at you when you are least prepared for it. A creepy character appears out of nowhere and your blood runs cold because you were caught off guard. You may see some vile characters lurking in the background, but these ghouls won't make you empty your stomach into your lap. Virtually all the frightening stuff in the ""Insidious"" franchise encourages you to use your imagination. You wind up scaring yourself because of what you didn't see rather than being frightened by prosthetic effects.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""Insidious,"" you're going to be lost in ""Insidious: Chapter Two."" Director James Wan's superior sequel resumes where his original ended and provides more thrills and chills. Predictably, the unlucky Lambert family encounters more of the unknown that lies on the other side described simply as 'the Further.' This 'Further' is a Purgatory of sorts where the tortured souls of the dead wander without a hope. Basically, demons want to appropriate your physical body in the ""Insidious"" movies. They struggle to oust you from your flesh so they can occupy your skin. Some people are gifted with the ability to project themselves into an astral dimension while their bodies rest in an apparent coma. Imagine what might occur if you went to sleep and left the door to your house or apartment standing wide open? Young Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) has been able to project himself onto an astral plane. During one outing in the other world, Dalton got lost while his body lay in a coma for all practical purposes. Renai (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson of ""Watchmen"") are at a loss to explain their son's predicament. Initially, they believed that their house was haunted so they moved but Dalton's condition didn't improve. Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey of ""Beaches"") ushers in an old friend, Elise Reiner (Lin Shaye of ""Snakes on a Plane""), who specializes in paranormal investigation. Two assistants, Specs (Leigh Whannell of ""Saw"") and Tucker (Angus Sampson of ""Razor Eaters""), who sketch, record, and photograph things for Elise, accompany her to the Lambert residence. Elise relieves everybody when she informs them that Dalton is not comatose. We learn that Josh wandered on the astral plane, too, during his youth. Elise puts Josh into a trance and he confronts demons in the Further that resemble a cross-between demonic clowns and ""Star Wars"" villains. Eventually, Josh succeeds in bringing his son back to life. Unfortunately, while Josh has been acting like a responsible parent, a demon has entered his body and controls him. Just as ""Insidious"" appears to end happily ever after, Josh strangles Elise while Renai, Lorraine, and Dalton sit in the next room without a clue about what is happening. As ""Insidious: Chapter Two"" opens, the Lamberts have moved in with Lorraine, and the police have launched an investigation into Elise's murder. The sequel takes us into Josh's past when he met Elise for the first time as a youth haunted by the apparition of a woman in a veil. Lorraine discovered this phenomenon after she snapped several pictures of her son and noticed a mysterious lady in the background. The history of that elusive dame that has tormented Josh constitutes the bulk of scenarist Leigh Whannell's screenplay.<br/><br/>Essentially, like its predecessor, ""Insidious: Chapter Two"" is spooky version of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sagas with demons that are far less aggressive than Freddie Kruger with his razor-sharp claws. Nevertheless, Wan and company rely less in depicting events in a way that sickened audiences in the ""Nightmare"" franchise. People sitting and standing in rows with white sheets draped over them will make your goose bumps rise. Just as the original had things that lunged out at you, ""Insidious: Chapter Two"" never misses a chance to startle you with its revelations. Unlike many horror movies, the ""Insidious"" franchise doesn't deploy false alarms as a part of their scare strategy. Some horror movies go to outlandish lengths to set up a scary situation and then disappoint when they didn't pay off with a scream what they set up with dread. The woman that haunted Josh in ""Insidious"" comes after him with everything that she can muster in ""Insidious: Chapter Two."" Predictably, the ending serves to anticipate Chapter Three."
"carlocross","9","1","3","18 September 2013"," Mind-bogglingly SCARY!
","Inspite of the attempt to explain why certain events happened, Insidious: Chapter 2 still left me with so many questions and made me want to watch the first installment again. James Wan once again did it! He surprised us with a well-preserved story line but lacks strong effective scares (character definition). Just as same with his word-of-mouth movie hit this year ""The Conjuring"", it is a legit horror flick with a little intriguing and confusing twist. I like Insidious: Chapter 2 though because I've seen how the movie had developed its characters and the fact that he was able to cleverly interlinked the movie (but in a messy way). I also like how comical Specs and Tucker could get to balance the vibe. But Wilson (Josh Lambert) is his favorite, so be it! Overall, the movie did not disappoint nor impress me, but took me on a horror ride between what's real and who's not."
"rachelbryan28","8","1","3","17 September 2013"," Even Better Than The First!
","I really, really enjoyed this film. I went to see the first one at the cinema when it came out, and enjoyed it, however, I did think that the last part of the film became a little unbelievable and far-fetched. I still sat at the cinema with a scarf over my eyes and my fingers in my ears, as it was still very scary and the storyline was good. In the second one, I do think part of the storyline is a little predictable (Josh not really being Josh), however the outcome of the story and the other things happening in the story are not predictable. I was sat on the edge of my seat the whole way through the film, (I did not have a scarf with me this time) but I sat with my fingers in my ears at the very loud bits as it is the noise that makes me jump. I could still hear what was going on though, and I must say that I think the soundtrack is great! The way they build up tension and suspense is very good as well, and even if you know that something is coming, it will still scare the living daylights out of you! The only criticism I have, is that I do not feel that the scenes from the past eg. 1986, were done very well. The acting was good however I still felt like we were watching a scene from the present time, as that is what it looked like. I didn't feel that the characters looked like they belonged in a different generation or that they were dressed from a different generation. I found the film a little confusing at times, but it all pieced together at the end. I would warn people, if you are easily disturbed then it is probably not the sort of film for you, but I really enjoyed it and was scared silly!"
"readjacksonporter","9","1","3","16 September 2013"," A Sequel Better than its Predecessor
","I thoroughly enjoyed Insidious. The idea was interesting enough to keep me captivated, and it was just the right amount of frightening to be remembered. When I found out they were making a sequel, I was nothing short of excited. They had some more story to tell. I understood that. So yeah, I was pretty excited. <br/><br/>Friday night, the movie's been out for about 24 hours. I've heard some negative reviews and some okay reviews, but I never take those to heart. I go in with an open mind and low expectations so I'm always surprised. I've spent over 100 dollars on movie tickets for various friends, a few jump in at the last minute, and I suddenly have a group of 13 people coming to this movie with me. We're all sitting on the same row, perfect seats thanks to pre-seating features. I sit next to my girl and my good buddy and the movie begins. <br/><br/>The first one, might I add, was jumpy, but not terrifying. <br/><br/>This movie was absolutely terrifying. Now I've heard others say it's not at all, but it scared me pretty badly. I screamed out loud three times, jumped out of my seat once, and you know, screamed some more. <br/><br/>I also found myself at two points during the movie on my feet cheering for a character. The theater joined me. I hadn't seen any crowd this into a film since the Harry Potters. <br/><br/>The first Insidious, I'll give it a 7 for an okay story, a thrill watch, and a memorable cast. But this one gets a nine, because it's terrifying and the story is so good. <br/><br/>The story is SO good. It explains stuff you didn't even think would be explained from the first one. It loops them together so it's more one giant film than two separate ones. I didn't want this movie to end. The thrill of it was incredible, and the story blew my mind. <br/><br/>Also, I give those people in the theater with me a 10/10. They were awesome. <br/><br/>If you were a fan of the first one, you'll thoroughly enjoy this, and you won't be disappointed. If you weren't a fan of the first one, I suggest you give this one a try. It's brilliant. Bloody brilliant. <br/><br/>-Jackson"

","The development of the characters and story-line in Chapter 2 is quite refreshing, enabling the audience to connect key moments in the first film to the second. With James Wan's fantastic use of light and movement in the film, Chapter 2 provides some fantastic scares. Coupled with the remarkable, yet old-school score that creates a hair-raising atmosphere, overall Wan has provided a strong sequel in Chapter 2. <br/><br/>The performances provided by Wilson and Rose Byrne, truly detail the breakdown of their character's relationship; with each revelation and incident, their relationship's deterioration is illustrated by inconsistently good dialogue.<br/><br/>Though the film occasionally succumbs to weak humour, overall Chapter 2 is a strong sequel that adds depth to both the characters and story- line. Worth a watch. <br/><br/>P.S. Hats off to the make-up crew; their work on Patrick Wilson's gradually decaying face is fantastic!"
"spiderswitchbladescarlet","9","1","3","15 September 2013"," Insidious As It Sounds
","I love horror movies. It's not much of a secret. However, it's not every day (and I see a new one just about every day) that I can say I saw a movie that truly struck me as being terrifying. I look at film from a more objective standpoint; it's hard for me to ""live"" in a film for its duration, to really see the film through a character's eyes. However, I try to look at what a more ""traditional"" audience member may see, and with this film, ""Insidious: Chapter 2,"" the sights range from comical to the true stuff that nightmares are made of. To give one a quick clue as to the minds behind this film, it was worked by ""Paranormal Activity"" mastermind Oren Peli, and was directed by Asian-Australian horror sicko, James Wan, who is best known for his work on ""Saw I"" and, more recently, ""The Conjuring."" The film starts within minutes of where the first film (2011's ""Insidious"") left off, and carries on further to explain the (extremely bizarre, and unexpected) story of the old woman who haunts father-protagonist Josh. I am limited as to what I can say without providing spoilers, but I will say that this storyline is one of the main focal points of the film, and that the story also involves a young boy and his mother.<br/><br/>That being said, I absolutely must take a moment to talk about this boy's mother. Once again, limiting my ""spoilers"" is difficult for this film, but his mother is, in the trailers for the film, the woman in the white dress seen sitting on a couch. This character, played by the excellent Danielle Bisutti (known for occasional appearances on Grey's Anatomy and NCIS), could easily make the case for this movie receiving an R rating, rather than its standing PG-13. Her sequences were obviously crafted to be the focal scare-point of the film, as her quick and well-concocted appearances, laced with the Insidious-signature dissonant (and screechingly loud, intended to cause actual discomfort) orchestral strings, are most effective at driving home the point of the movie, which is all-out psychological, sensory-overloading, mostly non-violent terror. The few gory/violent scenes can be quite intense.<br/><br/>My last topic of review on this film is its rating, which I honestly believe is inaccurate. The film is rated PG-13 for ""intense scenes of terror, graphic gore, and language."" NowI've seen over 200 horror movies, from box office smashes to high school film projects, and films from today, and dating back as far as 1922, and I am 100 percent certain that some of the horror scenes presented here are in, if not beyond, the league of The Exorcist, which is often found at the top of ""scariest film"" lists everywhere. The gore is not ""brutal"" in the sense of the torture-fest ""Saw"" series, but it does include several blood-heavy moments, as well as one scene of a spiritually-possessed man injuring his wife, which may be too shocking for some viewers.<br/><br/>Overall, this writer would give the movie a resounding 9.5/10. The movie accomplishes its purpose effectively, and goes far, far beyond the scope of today's horror films. With the box office horror hit ""The Conjuring"" under his belt, along with the new terror of ""Insidious: Chapter 2,"" it can safely be said that director James Wan is THE horror director to watch in the coming seasons.<br/><br/>Did you see Insidious: Chapter 2 this weekend?

","James Wan does it again. He continues the saga of the family that is being haunted by a demonic entity, and this time there are plenty of surprises, and some genuine spooky moments.<br/><br/>For starters, Patrick Wilson takes the spotlight in one of the simultaneous stories and does pretty well, as the man with more than one connection to the after world. The big question is whether he is any help at all this time around. Before you can see, ""there she goes again"", we are taken on a ride in and out of the after world, the past, and the present is turning out scarier and scarier.<br/><br/>It is always a ton of fun to see professionals like Barbara Hershey take on roles where she is in danger since she's such a powerful presence, and this time she must confront a spirit that's hurting a couple of generations in her family. She enlists the help of three professionals who might need every resource at their disposal to deal with the evil presence.<br/><br/>One of the best parts in part I was the steady hand of the director, as the impending sense of doom took over and had us on the edge of our seats. This time, we are already in the middle of the mess, and it takes more to upset us, but the story is interesting, and things seem to head for absolute tragedy unless something happens, or someone comes to the rescue.<br/><br/>Let's just say the audience will most likely be pleased with the experience, and we are more than ready for the follow up."

","Insidious: Chapter 2 pulls it off. Going into the movie theatre, I thought Insidious 2 was going be either awful or really good! Part 2 movies tend to be one extreme or the other in quality. Insidious 2 was well acted and directed. Wilson has another strong role, but Wilson was a supporting role in part 2. Wan's directing is a slow burn style horror movie. Wan's story starts off where Insidious left the viewer hanging. There is a movie flash back which creates the mystery of why the bad events happened? Regrettably, the story becomes bogged down with typical scares, and becomes just another horror movie! Thankfully, the last third of Chapter 2 picks up. The last third of Insidious 2 melds the first movie and the second installment into the story's conclusion. A memorable and exciting 20 minutes save Insidious 2. Eight out of ten!"
"ipperz12","8","1","3","15 September 2013"," Refreshingly Good Horror Sequel
","We all know the score, a brand new original horror idea is a big hit and they capitalize on this with a shoddy poorly-written badly-acted remake with a only marginal relation to the first film... Or so we thought! Insidious: Chapter 2 completely breaks this trend, making it without doubt one of the best horror sequels in recent memory - especially for one which was unplanned! So lets focus on the good: for many the only real problem with the first was the predictable ending that left us wanting more. Whereas, although leaving us with the possibility of a third instalment, was somewhat more conclusive. Secondly, which is very unique for a horror sequel, is that it is acted by all of the original cast, which is a huge bonus for many! Added to that, the colour imagery (red lighting on the baby's crib, blackened setting for the world of the dead) and old-school horror soundtrack all added to the overall feel. Furthermore, what Insidious does well is integrate moments of suspense and full on horror into what is a detailed and well-thought-out creepy story, instead of just having someone shout out ""boo!"" every 5 minutes to make up for a lack of story. Now the few small gripes that I had: First off the child-acting can be pretty poor at times, but hey that's usually the case in most films. Secondly, a well-known theme of the Insidious franchise is that when a dead soul enters a living body, the body becomes weak and begins to die. However, without spoiling anything, there are a few scenes where one of these dying bodies manages to fight off several fully-grown men and take various blows to the head with weaponry, without so much as falling down. But hey, again it's just a small detail and certainly not the first film to exaggerate the capabilities of the human body. So yeah, overall a very good horror film in its own right, but it acts even better as a sequel to an already well-established horror film. Definitely worth a watch."

","This movie was a huge surprise for me. I didn't believe that they could have made a successful sequel out of Insidious, but this movie was surprisingly very good. Throughout the whole film there was a sense of dread and it was very well played out. There's something about the way that the film was shot that gave it a creepier tone. There were some parts in this movie that made me jump more than I ever have in a horror movie. James Wan is an absolute master in the horror genre now. After seeing the Conjuring and this movie, he is proving himself to be the new name for a horror movie director. The acting was very good and the story was more surprising and creepy than the first Insidious. There were also several parts that were really funny. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror. You won't be disappointed!!"

","This is my first review and I am here to encourage everybody to go see this movie. I got scared few times, and I never get scared. I never got scared during Insidious or The Conjuring. Not scared like this anyways. At one part especially I had goosebumps that lasted for over a minute and I was thinking to myself ""That has never happened to me before"".You might not love it as much as me, but there is no way you can walk out of the theater and be disappointed. At the very least you would still be like ""Worth a watch!"" I had a great time throughout the whole movie. You would think that the sequel wouldn't be good as the original, especially since the original was so good. But I actually thought it was better. It was funnier and scarier."

","Insidious 2 (or any James Wan film) is like a little pill, it doesn't really affect you once you watch it. Sure it makes you jump and squeal a bit a increases your heart rate while watching it. But after a while, when you're all alone, you can't help but convince yourself that there is no such thing as ghosts. Yet you still get that feeling like someone is watching you and then all the images that you saw from the movie just pops up in your head. Yeah, that's what Insidious did to me. There were plenty of scenes that will really startle and scare you and James Wan did not hold back. The story wasn't entirely the best one, but it was well projected (Helpful Hint: Watch the first one before you watch this one). I saw it just recently and the theater was packed, it did not disappoint the audience for sure. Scary scary indeed."

Along with the whole cinema (which was jam pact let me tell you!!!) applauding & wolf whistling in the cinema at overpowering points of the film! It was just a great atmosphere! They screamed & roared at the top of their voices in the cinema when the intense jump scares took place! Epic!!! Their was couples around me, with the girls cuddling up to their boyfriends! Hah!<br/><br/>You must watch this film! If you've seen the first Insidious! Then see this epic sequel!

","I hate going to the movies. HATE. It is overpriced and I don't like crowds and my boyfriend is usually making me watch some superhero crap I have no interest in. That being said, horror is my bag and I think Insidious (1) is the best horror movie that has been made in recent years, so I had been eagerly awaiting Chapter 2 for months. We went on opening night and it was sold out. Went to a second theater and it was sold out. Went the next day and a group of annoying teenagers ruined the entire opening and would not shut up, so we left and the theater gave us some free passes. Finally,yesterday, the 4th time we attempted this movie, we watched it in a nearly empty theater. OH MY GOD!! Worth the wait and worth the 3 failed attempts and annoyance. I will not say that it was better than the first one, but it is just as good and I found it to be scarier. SPOILER: The red face guy is not in it. That was my only disappointment. Everything else made up for that though. I loved how it tied into the last one and I am AMPED about the next one. (I don't know if that's confirmed to be happening, but it certainly seems like they are intending to continue. Fingers crossed for red guy.)I am so impressed by these two movies. It has everything a genre nerd would love: references to a long list of other titles like Poltergeist, The Shining, Amityville etc, a little humor thrown in, a conscious omitting of tropes and stereotypes while still using some familiar, much loved themes...I could go on forever. The use of red as light and color alone could inspire a college thesis if I were still in art school. I loved it. I went to the movies 4 times to see it for the love of god! That is unheard of for me. AMAZING"

","Insidious 1 was an amazing movie. It set a high bar for Insidious Chapter 2. The sequel is one of those rare movies better than its proceeder. This movie picks off right from where the first one ended. Instead of focusing solely on the Lamberts though, it brings in a mythological tale about ""The Bride In Black."" It also ventures into The Further, so those who thought The Further ruined the first Insidious, won't like the sequel. But it shows anything can happen in the Further. Though this one isn't as scary as the first one, the plot was a lot better with many plot twist that made this film to never get boring. But there still are the old jump scares from the first one. Their is also nice camera work, as Wan proves himself good with the camera. All in all, this movie was spectacular. Watch it like right now!"
"hightackle1977","5","1","5","9 November 2013"," It's not that good is it?
","WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Not a great fan of this kind of movie. The people in the movie don't act anything like how a normal mentally healthy person would act. For example, at one point a person with a fair bit of supernatural experience reaches into a dark wardrobe (cliche to the max) when she knows there is a nasty ghostie in there. Was she hoping to shake hands with it? Just dumb. There are many such instances in the film and too many to ignore. The people just seem to accept that violent ghosts that steal children and knock they themselves senseless are in the house far too easily. Sometimes they protest but come on, there's ghosts all over the shop and they are not nice, as if you would just maintain normal sleeping arrangements after your son had been taken, your daughter taken from her crib, your supernatural guru strangled by god knows who, you see ghosts in the form of strange ladies screaming at you as they punch you and your husband is acting a little odd and suspicious. <br/><br/>Also it relies heavily on highly predictable jump scares. You know they are coming but the loud noise and sudden shock still makes you jump. Its not clever.<br/><br/>The ghost world is really silly. Its pitch black but don't worry, the main characters are well lit for some reason. No wonder the ghosties can see them, with their spooky lanterns that seem standard issue in the ghost universe. Must be a ghost union thing. Oh and there is mist everywhere...ooooohhh spooky mist. Not sure why there is mist but maybe they have other sorts of precipitation too and it's mere coincidence that on this day it was a bit misty in the afterlife.<br/><br/>The idea is good and the serial killer that hates his mother for forcing him to pretend he was a girl is creepy but handled poorly. The mother is so over the top see looks like an evil queen from a Disney animation.<br/><br/>Not a great film."
"Samiam3","5","1","5","14 September 2013"," Insidious and aggravating
","I'll give James Wan and Leigh Whannell credit for one achievement in Insidious: Chapter 2; if nothing else, at least they didn't mail it in. <br/><br/>When it comes to plotting, some follow ups are pure repeats of their predecessors, but for Insidious, Wan and Whannell have managed to build upon some of the makings of the first instalment. In doing so, they have shed a little bit of light into the darker and unexplained portions of the Lambert family's story, and elect to give it the conclusion that the characters deserve; a noble development in a genre where the audience is often un concerned about what becomes of protagonists. Here, unfortunately is where the success of Chapter 2 ends.<br/><br/>The second Insidious is one of those films where you can't immediately decide whether it features too much story material, or too little. There is a lot going on in this film, but none of it ever seems to have a focal point. It is a dense film, chaotic and rushed, it features too many figures (both living and dead), flirts occasionally with the dangers of triple timelines and gives its characters almost no breathing room. The film is more concerned with their back stories than it is with their present ones, leading me to think that Insidious: Chapter 2 may have actually worked better as a two hour feature. The climax is especially hectic, and disorienting because of it's pacing and choppy editing. <br/><br/>If this wasn't enough, Insidious: Chapter 2 is further crippled by its lack of genuine suspense. The movie is far less scary than it is borderline humorous. Even if Wan has once again respectably avoided copious bloodshed, There is no subtly in either the direction or the script, creating 'boo' moments that might cause laughter.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2, is a sequel that appeals because it promises to build upon its set up, rather than repeat it. Only occasionally does it fulfil this promise. I won't say it was an unnecessary sequel, but there is simply no way it should have been this disappointing."

","INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 continues the story, picking up immediately after the events of the first film. With Elise (Lin Shaye) gone, it's up to her assistants, Tucker and specs (Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell), joined by Elise's first helper, Carl (Steve Coulter) to help the Lamberts (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) and the kids. Of course, after what happened, Josh is under suspicion, and the spirit world is still very much at work. Director James Wan and Writer Whannell beat the sequel jinx by keeping things creepy, and upping the ante without becoming absurd. They've once again pushed to the limit of the PG-13 rating, thereby making an effective ghost story for adults. It's great to see Barbara Hershey back -w/ a bigger part- as Lorraine, as well as Jocelin Donahue from HOUSE OF THE DEVIL as young Lorraine..."

"r96sk","7","0","1","14 May 2020"," A step down, but it is still a more than solid effort
","'Insidious: Chapter 2' keeps the level of the film series so far to a suitable level, though it is some way off its predecessor.<br/><br/>The film, as you'd probably expect, relies heavily on the 2010 production, with quite a few reused scenes from it - even some from early in this one, too. It is with good reason, as it splices fairly well into what occurs here. I think they do try a little too hard with it in parts, though all in all it comes out decently.<br/><br/>They sideline Rose Byrne for a lot of this, which is disappointing given she's arguably the best at acting of those involved. I assume it's down to scheduling conflicts with other commitments, if so it's nice she still appears.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned, Patrick Wilson takes centre stage - not to great appraisal unfortunately. I find his performance quite inferior, at least compared to the one he gives in 'Insidious'. None of the others stand out, though I do appreciate them retaining the same onscreen people.<br/><br/>This is certainly a step down, but it is still a more than solid effort."

","I haven't yet seen the last key but so far this is the best one yet. If there's anything I love In a horror film it's a good explanation for everything that happens. This film in a sense works backwards by giving you a lot of questions in the first half and slowly answering them in the second half and I love that. Some people complain that there are too many jumpscares which I can understand but at the same time I don't think there are too many for the films own good. There is still a story. The acting is 10/10 and the plot is 10/10. It follows perfectly from the first film by exploring the fathers point of view. Examples like when the piano is playing a known tune to the wife and we learn later that it was actually the father doing this from the further is what keeps me hooked. The little twist and turns throughout this film are insane and the story of the black bride does not disappoint either. Whether you enjoy the scares, acting or plot this film masters all three"

","I believe that part of what made the first Insidious such a talking point was that noone saw it coming. Like Paranormal Activity before it, it came out with a minimalist advertising campaign that only showed enough to get people interested. However, standards have changed since then, and on the heels of the director's The Conjuring comes Insidious: Chapter 2, charged with the unenviable task of shouldering the weight of its predecessors. The main fault of the first Insidious film was that it got more unbelievable and less scary as it went on, culminating in a kinda ridiculous final act taking place in purgatory as imagined by overexcited horror buffs. Chapter 2 is at least more consistent in its quality and believability, with no jarring shifts like the one described above. However, what is has in consistency and story, it lacks in scares. While there are certainly some chilling moments, they are nowhere near as frequent as they were inthe first film. This is somewhat disappointing, because James Wan is certainly capable of packing a higher number of scares into the same length of time. And with more subtlety."

"schroeder-gustavo","3","0","1","14 June 2015"," Gets way too convoluted and complicated
","One of the main reasons I really liked the original Insidious was the overall simplicity of it. Basically it was a low budget haunted house movie that had a creepy atmosphere through great makeup and practical setups. The story was pretty simple and executed greatly. And now we get this mess of a movie. Insidious two takes the two things I didn't like about the first one and makes them even worse. The first thing, the unnecessary, predictable jump scares that add nothing to the plot and are simply just annoying as hell are many in this movie. Things like raising the volume when a baby cart starts moving is just flat out annoying. And that is just one of the 10 examples I have in my head right now of stupid jump scares. The other thing: I thought the original Insidious was flawed cause the main idea of the movie was kinda borrowed from Poltergeist..In Insidious: Chapter Two, the ending feels like a lamer version of The Shining. The clichéd dialogue and rushed scenes add nothing good to the story either. I hated the subplot in this movie: Instead of focusing on the family like they did in the original, they shift focus to this other thing in which the mother of Patrick Wilson's character tries to find out what is going on with the ghosts and trying to communicate with Elise, who died in the first one. Wan clearly tries to give the Insidious story some more depth, but all this does is over complicate things. There are some cool parts in this movie, though and I can't really complain about Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who were great in this one. The scene where Rose Byrne's character sees the woman in white singing ""Row your boat"" and then disappears just to hear her on the baby monitor finishing the song...""merrily merrily merrily..."" was just awesome. But in the end Insidious: Chapter 2 is bigger, but definitely not better."

","How a movie like this are rated as PG-13 by the MPAA I will never understand!!!<br/><br/>Have you played with an Ouija (commonly pronounced as Wee- Gee) board? The grisly creative minds of SAW; James Wan (Director/Writer) and Leigh Whannel (Writer) pens down a rather similar school of thought when Carl (Steve Coulter) uses a bag of dice to communicate with the realm of the spirits in search of Elise (Lin Shaye). INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 picks up exactly where the first movie left off. The fact that the plot continues without losing its sense of interest and delivering even greater jolts and thrills simply earns this movie a spot on the ""A list of must watch horror-movies"". As the first movie wrapped up Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) was left behind in the spirit world where he walked into save his son Dalton (Ty Simpkins). Something did return back to Josh's body but it was not him, instead it is something darker and more deadly than anything the Lambert family has ever experienced in decades. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is his desperate and fervent effort to leave the dimly lit spirit world and reunite with his wife and kids. <br/><br/>James Wan & Leigh Whannel, that's 2 for 2 for the year 2013. Whilst the secret to their success is as simple as having two of the most ingenious minds in the industry do they have what it takes to keep the dice rolling (pun well intended!). Certain answers the audience did not get to observable questions such as ""How did it all begin?"" the only possible answer that I can think of is maybe they are saving it for the 3rd movie. In an entirely singular angle the logic behind the plain and simple plot is what keeps fear in the movie flowing. Wan and Whannel do not use up on screen time for rationalization, instead every single revelation of facts is done via the interference of the spirits. This sells well into the intensity of INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2. Scenes such as Elise returning, the young Josh and the dice are 3 examples of how the writers revealed information without wasting time over Tiffin. As a fan of the genre something that could have been different in the production are the camera angles the horror flick has been shot with. I could not but help note more than a handful of similarities amongst INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 vs. THE CONJURING. This does not work against it at anytime; it is just a personal preference.<br/><br/>You will appreciate the detailed effort the crew makes in the revelation of reasons behind the occurrence. The flashbacks, the spirits and the reality of them are uncanny and are assured to scare your eyeballs out of its sockets if watched during the night. One of my personal favorites is the scene where Renai (Rose Byrne) is confronted by Mother for the first time. Two things about that scene is one can never predict it and Byrnes acting is so convincing that the scare will linger for a good 5 minutes as you will try hard to slow your heart rate down. This is what good horror movies should be made of and I am glad directors and actors of this caliber still exist. Let me not spoil this any further for you. Let me let you decide and maybe you can tell me what the experience was like for you.<br/><br/>The obvious question; what is the better movie? INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 or THE CONJURING. My answer is simple fighting an enemy you cannot fully see is always scarier. To figure out what movie it is, I guess you must watch them both.<br/><br/>TITLE: INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 DIRECTED BY: JAMES WAN STARRING: PATRICK Wilson, ROSE BYRNE, BARBRA HERSHEY,LIN SHAYE,TY SIMPKINS, LEIGH WHANNEL, ANGUS SAMPSON & STEVE COULTER RATED: PG 13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 106 MINUTES"

Especially the sequence with Carl's dice's and Marilyn's poster.<br/><br/>The background score is almost similar to the first installment and it could have been better. Performances are up to the mark and Rose Byrne still doesn't surprise. The duo of Specks and Tucker return to give you funny one liners, but that's all they do. The movie is all about Patrick Wilson and he does justice to the role given to him.<br/><br/>This will surely be a bumpy ride for all you scare-hungry people. Give it a try."
"benighted2005","7","0","1","9 December 2013"," Sequel to the best horror film I have seen
","The Insidious Series has something not a lot of horror films have had and that is a creative curiosity arousing storyline. The first Insidious was one of the most riveting films I have seen. It shook the very foundation of my understanding of my senses and truly showed me what my body is to do and how it is to react to FEAR. Maybe I have never known Fear the way i did after watching Insidious. <br/><br/>Insidious 2 takes off from where the first one left but the overall effect is short of being called overwhelming. Yes, it is definitely scary and more or less in the same prose but I couldn't help feel this isn't James Wan at his best. <br/><br/>Having said that, the rating on IMDb is perfect right now for the film. It is still many notches more scary than anything else I have seen released recently.<br/><br/>The Conjuring and Insidious remain his best films with this at third. <br/><br/>James Wan has opened up the horror genre for me the way Walking Dead opened up the zombie genre. So this is what the world has come to :)"

","""Insidious"" was a great idea - a clever, even original, premise hamstrung by its abject non-subtlety.<br/><br/>""Insidious: Chapter 2"" shares the flaws of its forerunner: doors opening and closing, screws unscrewing, lights failing, bangs banging and virtually corporeal ghosts able to communicate with living people as easily and fluently as you and I could chat using instant messaging.<br/><br/>James Wan and Leigh Whannell clearly have some creepy stories to tell and much to contribute to the genre, but until they're willing to pull their punches a bit and accept that less is so often more (especially in horror), their films will continue to fall short of being genuine horror classics."
"maatmouse-1","8","0","2","1 December 2013"," Darker and deeper than before
","Having seen the first movie and been scared out of my wits over it, I have come to the conclusion that James Wan is probably one of only a few directors who can actually do what horror movies are meant to do and scare people. Except he doesn't use loads of gore and torture to achieve this aim. <br/><br/>Insidious 2 literally begins where Insidious ended. Dalton Lambert is back with his family after coming back from the Further. Unfortunately, he appears to have brought back with him whatever plagued Josh Lambert's childhood i.e. The Old Lady. Insidious 2 deals with her and her attempted slow possession of Josh. <br/><br/>The Lambert family move back to Josh's mother's house which is quite old. No sooner do they move and settle in, than strange things happen again. A piano plays randomly late at night, the baby of the family cries for no apparent reason, toys are thrown around rooms and an angry ghost in the form of a violent, white dressed woman starts physically abusing Renai Lambert. <br/><br/>Renai is at a loss. She discusses what is going on with Josh's mum and decides to delve deeper. For this, they need help. They turn to the 2 helpers of the previous film who filmed Elise the psychic.Both of these men turn to Elise and appeal to her from the Other Side for help. Elise directs them to Carl, a talented psychic who communicates with the dead via scrabble letters in which the dead spell out what they want to him. <br/><br/>The film then takes a dark journey back to Josh's past and to the ghost lady plaguing the family. It turns out the ghost lady was involved with another of Lorraine Lambert's patients and Lorraine, 2 helpers and Carl go through dark, disused hospitals to find out the truth which is more unpleasant than they realise. <br/><br/>Added to that, is the knowledge that Josh is slowly being taken over by the Old Lady from the previous film. He changes very slowly but its quite recognisable how much he is being taken over and chilling. Carl realises early on that he has to enter the Further to find the real Josh and try and help him. What follows is pretty much part of the first film shot from a different side. Carl meets Josh who is trapped in the Further while the Old Lady is taking over his physical body. He follows Josh around in the Further and encounters Ellise who helps them. This part of the film is pretty terrifying as we discover the reasons why the door would open for no reason and why creepy characters are wandering around the house. <br/><br/>In the normal world, however, Renai is dealing with a husband who seems to be out to kill her. This part of the film is probably the most harrowing, especially for women who've suffered domestic violence. Renai, however, is not a passive victim and fights back quite strongly to the extent of locking herself down in the basement with Dalton whilst Josh does his very best to imitate Jack Nicholson's character from The Shining. <br/><br/>However, it is Dalton who saves the day. He calls Josh back from the Further after entering it to find his dad and brings both his father and Carl back. Ellise bids them farewell. All appears to be well in the Lambert's world finally but Ellise's spirit returns to help her 2 former assistants. She goes to the house of a young woman troubled by something and finds something there so horrifying its going to cause even more trouble.<br/><br/>Fans of the first movie will note that the Red faced Demon of the first is not in evidence here. If you're expecting him, prepare to be disappointed. It does look as if there will be another movie however, and he's likely to turn up in that. This film is pretty frightening but it is more 'jumpy' shocks than anything else. The trip into the Further that Josh, Dalton and Carl make is chilling and grim stuff. Lorraine and friends trip around the derelict mental hospital where she worked is grim enough and ghosts abound everywhere. This is not a film to watch alone or if you're easily afraid."

","For obvious reasons, Insidious: Chapter 2 is not really a silly cash grab, it definitely got some intention behind it and in addition, a whole bunch of things to extend. So, if you're expecting a complete terrifying experience in the vein of its prequel, this may not entertain you.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* The movie opens in the year 1986, where the young Josh is under some kinda uncanny observation and after few bizarre manifestations Elise asserts that Josh is able to see things and people which belong to another astral world and later hypnotizes him to forget everything. <br/><br/>Returning back to the present situation where chapter one had originally barred, Reine (Rose Bryne) still experiences some kinda peculiar sounds and evil spirits wandering around. Josh (Patrick Wilson) is obviously been possessed by something and turns into an adversary to his own family.<br/><br/>What I really liked about the movie? perceptibly the story and the intent in extending the movie which I didn't really felt stupid while watching, clearly it was unnecessary but it dealt with something new and novel and did a great job in narrating the scenes which are co-related to it's prequel.<br/><br/>In line with my issues about the movie, the overall plot was mystifying, it tried to answer many questions which made the movie a little unclear. And the terrifying factor was a bit let down, the demons were not that petrifying when compared with the dude in red paint in chapter one.<br/><br/>Indeed, credits to James Wan and Leigh Whannel for shaping up the sequel really well, the sound effects and the set designs were really well used and I should really appreciate James Wan for making the movie with decent budget and with genuine scares which didn't seek for any CGI help.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Insidious: Chapter 2 is a well extended sequel with few creepy jump scares. I've definitely got few issues with it, but it didn't bother me because of it's intent. I certainly recommend you to go check it out only in theatres, if you're totally aware of what happened in the prequel. <br/><br/>My Rating - 3/5<br/><br/>Vedict-- Wasn't that scary! But a very well extended sequel"
"trashgang","8","0","1","1 November 2013"," better than the original one
","To be honest, I didn't liked the first one and I only rated it a 5 out of ten. But this was shown as a preview at a horror Halloween night so I had to watch it but I must say that this flick was over just before you know it. <br/><br/>Again directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (both of Saw fame) and produced by Oren Peli (of Paranormal Activity fame) they have learned from the first one and the critics about it.<br/><br/>Before the opening credits you have in fact a prequel of the story of the original Insidious. If you haven't seen the original one don't worry because after the credits in a few minutes all is explained about the first flick, done that this ghost story delivers the creeps until the end. It's done by using almost no extra lighting and doing some shots in POV. It even had a eighties feeling by using a lot of wide angle shots. It's even explained who the ghost was in the first entry of this franchise. We do have ghosts again of course but this time they added a special effect to see the difference of the world of ghosts and the real world, smoke and echo warned you of the ghost world and it worked. Again, it never was scary but this time the ghosts were shown in another kind of movement and also they added some funny situations with the two investigators of the paranormal world. It's also a clear view that Oren Peli did had his influence on part of the directing. At times Insidious 2 did had an paranormal feeling. <br/><br/>A funny scary horror that will have you watch the screen full of anger from the first minute until the end. And we all know by now that part 3 is on the way. Who is the girl in the wheelchair and was that a creature towards the end? Who can tell, yes, Wan and Whannell did it again, an ew franchise.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5"

","The unfortunate Lambert family continue to experience difficulties imposed on them by assorted malevolent entities from the netherworld, and we learn some backstory about what went on in the past.<br/><br/>In many ways this is a Ronseal film - it does exactly what it says on the tin - albeit the story does have a bit more meat on its bones than one might expect for a sequel which, like this one, simply seeks to extend what made its predecessor successful. It doesn't make a whole load of sense though.<br/><br/>But it is mildly creepy throughout, has a number of ""made you jump"" moments, features a returning cast, gives Patrick Wilson the chance to chew some scenery, and the two comic sidekicks are quite good fun. I could have done without quite so much creeping about - there is MASSES of it - and it isn't going to satisfy hard horror fans (little blood, goriness, grossness, bad language) but it is not bad of its sort."

","I am not a huge horror movie buff although I can appreciate them. I have seen Insidious part 1 and liked it, but this one has so much more back story and explained much that I was curious about from the first chapter.<br/><br/>There were some edge of your seat style scary moments in the film and even small bits of humor. I am most impressed with Lin Shaye's performance and was happy to see her role re-prised.

","Insidious 2 has a more complex story than its prequel. You have to watch Insidious 1 first, because it will make you easier to understand this movie. James Wan as director, added a bit of the background story, so Insidious 2 is not only a scary movie. He also put new characters, making the red yarn so it become a continuation of Insidious 1. It's very interesting and worth for thumbs up.<br/><br/>Some scary tricks look fresh and not repeat from previous horror films. James Wan uses some properties such as stroller and dice. The effort to create an atmosphere and setting to support the story but still look fresh also arguably successful, such as a bedroom with a rocking horse, a hospital and an elevator. James Wan did a lot of exploration and don't want to just get stuck in the house, a good effort."
"phd_travel","7","0","2","18 October 2013"," A decent follow up but it's no Conjuring
","It helps to re-watch the first Insidious in case you can't remember it that well because chapter 2 goes back and explains and expands the story and background of the first one. It's pretty grand compared to the first chapter. Quite a few spooky places and lots of ghosts. Surprising laugh out loud hilarity too about the evil ghost! I know it is unfair since they are different movies, I can't help comparing it to the Conjuring which I watched a few months ago and found much scarier and more believable because of the straightforward story. This one just seemed a little contrived and silly compared to it.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is the Amityville type possessed daddy here and he is okay. Rose Byrne is good at acting frightened. The scary part was watching her being tossed around - she looked so thin she could have snapped.<br/><br/>Overall for fans of the first Insidious you get your money's worth."
"DeathWillBeARelief","7","0","1","17 October 2013"," Not As Scary As The First
","I found this movie to be sort of boring and not all that scary as it's predecessor. The movie picks up right where the first one ended, and that was cool. It also went into the past to show what happened when Josh was little and why his mother and Elise had his ability blocked. The movie did tie into the first one with certain events that happened in the first one being explained why it happened. One memorable scene was when the door to the Lambert home opened by itself and why the demon didn't try to posses or take the Lambert baby. I honestly thought that they could have done so much more with this movie. I feel like they are grooming this to take over the ""SAW"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" spot, but if what they showed in chapter 2 is going to be what they are gonna do with the whole series, I will not waste my time on watching these movies. One great thing about this movie though is that Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye both gave beyond amazing performances."
"3xHCCH","7","0","1","15 October 2013"," MUST Watch Part 1 First To Better Appreciate This Sequel
","This is one of those sequels that really require you to watch the first one in order to enjoy it adequately. I watched the first ""Insidious"" when it was released three years ago, and honestly I do not recall much about it. In fact, I did not really like the film that much back then. <br/><br/>I read a lot of bad reviews about ""Insidious 2"". I did not feel compelled to watch it. However I noted that three weeks after its local release, there are still a lot of theaters showing ""Insidious 2"". I felt I must have misjudged it since there are still a lot of people watching it up to now.<br/><br/>So I decided to watch the first ""Insidious"" again before watching ""Insidious 2"". I must say, on second watching I thought the first ""Insidious"" was actually the excellent horror movie that it was touted to be back then. I must have watched it when I was not in the mood or something, hence my lukewarm reaction at first. I liked it a lot better this time on re-watching. <br/><br/>Then, I went on to watch ""Insidious 2"" right away. Lo and behold, I now think this second chapter is actually a very good sequel after all. And this franchise is actually worth all the hype it has.<br/><br/>""Insidious 2"" actually starts with a flashback to when young Lorraine was consulting young Elise about young Josh's bad dreams. We already know this fact from Part 1. Then after the creepy opening credits, the story picks up from how the story ended in 1, the aftermath of Elise's murder and the possession of Josh by the Bride in Black. Now that Elise is dead, how can the Lambert family get rid of this pesky and increasingly malevolent spirit from tormenting their family?<br/><br/>The story will go as you may probably predict already, but there are several twists and turns that will still keep you at the edge of your seats and make you jump. I particularly like the fact that spirits in The Further could do time travel and affect events from the past. Of course, like all time travel devices, there will be plot questions that may arise. However, in this case, I thought this gave it a unique aspect that was very interesting. Ghost hunters Specs and Tucker are still here in Part 2 to provide welcome comic relief, and that was good.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Insidious 2,"" though now lacking the freshness of ideas from the first ""Insidious,"" still manages to give us the jumps and scares we crave for in watching films like this. It will also give us a lot of haunting and disturbing images and moments. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye and Ty Simpkins all reprise their roles creditably, with additional richer dimensions. <br/><br/>James Wan, just fresh from his success with ""The Conjuring"" earlier this year, comes up with another winner horror film. Now I understand why ""Insidious 2"" has a longer-than-expected shelf life in theaters. I am recommending this for horror film fans, but definitely re-familiarize yourself with the first ""Insidious"" film first."
"aaronjbong","6","0","1","4 October 2013"," Ominously Fun
","James Wan is on a hot streak this summer. After the success of July's ""The Conjuring"", he returns to deliver more thrills in ""Insidious: Chapter 2"", the sequel to the horrifying ""Insidious"". It may not compare to ""The Conjuring"", but ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is also definitely a thrilling experience. <br/><br/>The main characters from the first film are back and the story picks up directly from the end of the first film. The Lambert family are back and the target of hauntings again. Patric Wilson is back as the head of the family, Josh Lambert and Rose Byrne is back as Renai Lambert. The kids are also back and even Specs and Tuckrr are back. The only new members are the new ghosts. <br/><br/>The story is similar to the first one, about astral projections. This time, it's the dad. They move to Lorraine's (Josh's mother) home to stay and strange occurrences still happen; the piano playing by itself, the baby's toy turning on by itself. Then they connect it to a mysterious person and it gets creepy. <br/><br/>The film is quite interesting. The flashbacks and background stories are intriguing and creepy. But what made the movie succeed was its shocks. The movie is skillful in producing scares and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The music was well-done too and provided quite the tension. The performances were also not too shabby and well-done. <br/><br/>However, what I felt was that kind of got repetitive towards the end. It was definitely formulaic and therefore, in the end, it got kind of annoying. In the end, the conclusion was nothing surprising and therefore played out normally. The last scene was quite expected and it's not surprising that the third installment is in the works right now. <br/><br/>But overall, ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is quite a fun experience and it delivers quite enough shocks to satisfy horror fans. It may not surpass the freshness of the first film but ""Chapter 2"" is quite satisfying. <br/><br/>Rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Not a huge accomplishment, but ""Insidious: Chapter 2"" is a fun horror flick with an adequate amount of scares and is quite creepy."
"kerryhill123","6","0","1","2 October 2013"," Slight regurgitation of the first movie
","if you asked me to write a summary of the plot for Insidious chapter 2, I would definitely struggle, this film was understandable but difficult to explain.<br/><br/>Insidious chapter 2, directed by James Wan, follows on from the first Insidious movie, it follows the same family and is written following straight after the first movie. Insidious 2 revolves round the father of Dalton Lambert, the boy who was 'possessed' in essence in the first film. This follows his father,Josh, who we see murder Elise. This film allows us to find out the mysteries of the first movie in greater detail and understand it better as well as give us a good story, in this sense, it was a good film. <br/><br/>I don't think this movie was quite as scary as the first one, and it came across like a regurgitation of the first Insidious. Most of the 'scares' were caused by the sounds, which I must congratulate, Insidious has possibly the most disturbing soundtrack. None of the content was actually that terrifying, yes, it was quite menacing and creepy, but wasn't going to leave me with sleepless nights. <br/><br/>The overall mise-en-scene of the film was very good, the acting was good, the editing was not under done or over done. It had some good twists and turns which were interesting and kept me engaged throughout, so it wasn't a bad film. <br/><br/>The use of time in the film was confusing and the script was complex making this film extremely hard to explain the plot. <br/><br/>A favourite scene, was definitely where Josh throws the kettle at Renai's head, knocking her out. I can't imagine this should of been as funny as it was, but I am guilty of laughing out loud in the cinema at this part. <br/><br/>The ending has left me thinking that we will almost certainly see an 'Insidious 3' which I have a feeling will be a major let down, as many 3rd installments in horror franchises are. <br/><br/>give it a watch by all means, it has equally good and bad points. It was a very average film, and didn't top the first one. Both Insidious films are pretty much on an equal level."

I like how they explore Josh's past and how they connect this film to the happenings on the first one. Exploring the ghost's past was also good. I only complain about one thing---It lacked the cheap-but-effective-way of scaring you that made the first one awesome. There is no WTF moments on this film. Still, it's a watchable film and good for those people who are still hungry for more after watching the first film. Plus, there's a hint for a next chapter before the credits roll."
"ferguson-6","6","0","1","22 September 2013"," The Further
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a perfect example of why it's acceptable for writing standards to be lowered for horror films. This isn't science fiction or history. We are in the theatre for one simple reason ... we want to be frightened (to jump in our seats). Two years after the first Insidious, director and co-writer James Wan, screenwriter Leigh Whannell and producer Oren Peli, re-team for this sequel. It's also just a few months after Mr. Wan's very successful and well-made The Conjuring.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first one because there was a nice story that borrowed a bit from Poltergeist and some other horror classics. In a rare treat, Wan and Whannel actually tie in the sequel to the story from the first. Sure, some of it is a stretch with all of the parallel dimensions and multiple entities, but for the most part, it works and provides some nice thrills and chills.<br/><br/>An especially nice surprise is the creative return of Lin Shaye as Elise, who stole all her scenes in the first entry. While the voice over of her ""younger"" scenes was distracting, her screen presence helps hold the final act together. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins and Barbara Hershey are back as the family Lambert ... and this time we get more backstory on why the family seems unable to escape the demons.<br/><br/>Wan, Whannell and Peli have done a very nice job of rejuvenating the horror genre, while still including the traditional fun of active closets, abandoned hospitals, creaky doors and musty basements. A certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but if you are looking for some scary fun, you could do much worse than the two Insidious films."
"jboothmillard","5","0","3","20 September 2013"," Insidious: Chapter 2
","I did not realise there was going to a sequel to the film I found absolutely terrifying in the cinema until I see the trailer on TV, I was definitely curious to see what would happen next in the story, from the returning makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity, and returning director James Wan (Saw). Basically the film opens in 1986 to see Young Lorraine Lambert (Jocelin Donahue) being visited by medium Young Elise Rainier (Lindsay Seim), called by her fellow medium friend Young Carl (Hank Harris), to investigate and perhaps eliminate a haunting in Lorraine's son, Young Josh Lambert (Garrett Ryan). She hypnotises him and attempts to find Josh's friend, the elderly woman in the black wedding dress and veil, seen in photographs, and after an encounter with the nasty spirit Carl, Elise and Lorraine agree that Josh should be made to forget his abilities to dream and leave his body and go to further places. Twenty five years later the story continues from where it left off, Elise (Lin Shaye) was killed by Josh (Patrick Wilson) who was possessed by the spirit of the old woman, and his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) is being questioned by police, and after refusing to believe he is a killer she and the family move in with Lorraine (Barbara Hershey). Soon enough after the move Renai notices strange things happening in the house, she believes that Josh is still possessed by the spirit of the old woman, he assures her things will be fine, then of course she sees another woman in a white dress and is knocked unconscious tending to her baby. Meanwhile Lorraine, who knows something is still going on as well, visits Elise's colleagues Specs (Saw's Leigh Whannell, also writing) and Tucker (Angus Sampson), and they recruit the help of the medium from the past, Carl (Steve Coulter), and he uses his method of lettered dice to contact Elise from the other side. Through these they do contact her and are led to the ""Our Lady of Angels"" hospital, where Lorraine used to work, and exploring the closed down and decayed hospital Lorraine recounts the story of a former elderly patient named Parker Crane, who committed suicide jumping from the roof. They next break into the house of Parker, and they find the black wedding dress and veil and newspapers referring to ""The Dark Bride"" who murdered many people while dressed as a woman, they realise that the elderly woman spirit is in fact Parker, and worse, it was in fact the spirit of Parker's Mother (Danielle Bisutti) talking through the dice, not Elise. Renai recovers, but when Lorraine returns home she insists that she and the kids, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), Foster (Andrew Astor) and the baby must get away from Josh, and she explains about ""The Dark Bride"" and that Josh may still be trapped somewhere on the other side, the Further. Carl confronts Josh himself, while Specs and Tucker are listening from their van, but possessed ultimately he is stronger than the three of them, and next to be ambushed are Renai and Lorraine, while his mother is locked in the closet he attempts to strangle his wife, but the children stop him and the three of them barricade themselves in the basement. Dalton knows that he could use his ability to travel out of his body into the Further to try and find his father, so while the possessed Josh tries to hammer his way to catch his family the boy finds Carl, and together they try and find Elise, and they realise they are all in the previous Lambert home. In the Further, Josh, Carl and Elise head for the Crane house, they witness the traumatic past of Parker being abused by his mother to convince him he is a girl, the mother tries to torment the visitors of this vision, but Elise saves them all by defeating the mother. The three escape the house and find Josh, Dalton helps them find the way back into real time by following the string of his tin can telephone, and returning to the real world all wake up in their own bodies, including Josh who is back to normal., they are all relieved. Josh and Dalton are hypnotised to forget their ability to travel within the dream and spirit worlds and everything that has happened, the end sees Specs and Tucker knocking another door to help someone, and while the girl Allison is in comatose Elise walks in to speak to her, but then she hears something and turns around to exclaim ""Oh my god!"", so the story should continue again. Also starring Tyler Griffin as Young Parker and Michael Beach as Detective Sendal. There is still some resemblance to Poltergeist and partly Paranormal Activity, and the haunted house element obviously still resonates (even though it is the people who are haunted, not quite the house), it is a shame that in the cinema this is not as terrifying as the first film, but the screechy violin music still chills, and it is a good enough supernatural horror thriller sequel. Worth watching!"
"jafar-iqbal","7","0","1","14 September 2013"," The sequel is better than the original
","I've become quite disillusioned by American horror movies. The glory days of your Evil Deads and Halloweens is long gone – the horror cinema we tend to see nowadays likes to rely more on cheap shocks than sustained terror. And in the off chance that a film comes along that is actually very scary (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity), it is buried into the ground after becoming a lacklustre franchise (see: Saw and Paranormal Activity). It looks like Insidious might be adding itself to the latter.<br/><br/>Insidious: Chapter 2 picks up where the first one left off (so you might want to watch that first). It's the day after the night before, and everyone's a little bit shaken up. Husband Josh (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) think all their troubles are behind them, but all the hauntings and demons they thought they'd gotten rid of are still around. To uncover the issue, they have to go all the way back to Josh's childhood for answers.<br/><br/>The problem with the first Insidious was that it was ridiculously disjointed. It was a fantastic first half of genuine terror and suspense, and an absurd second half of weirdly painted 'demons' and hokey plot points. Thankfully, writer Leigh Whannell sorts things out and we have a film with much more structure and narrative. Because it kicks off the day after the first one, we're thrust into it immediately. There's no need for the slow-burn set-up this time, which I think is both an advantage and a detriment.<br/><br/>The advantage is that we go into fifth gear right from the start, so you always remain engaged. The detriment is that, sadly, Chapter 2 just isn't as scary as the first one. Yes, there are still those shocks when things appear suddenly; and they still generate a gasp, but it's just not as consistent. Chapter 2 isn't really about wanting to make you scared; I'd argue that it's really just about trying to make sense of the whole story. There is nothing wrong with that, and I think it's all explained quite competently, but that need to explain everything means the horror suffers.<br/><br/>One other place where the second one trumps the first is the cast. Okay, so it's more or less the same cast as the second, but they're used much better here. Rose Byrne is as strong here as she is in the first, there's neither a drop or increase in quality. The quality increase comes from Patrick Wilson. I didn't really like him much in the first one, but he has more to work with here and does a good job. However, the best decision the filmmakers made was to make more use of Specs and Tucker. The double act are fantastic in their short stint in the first film, and are deservedly given more airtime in the sequel. Once again, they make the most of it.<br/><br/>What bothered me most about Insidious: Chapter 2, though, is the ending. I won't tell you how the film develops, because it's impossible to do so without spoiling anything. However, I don't think it's really a spoiler to tell you that there will be a third film. Because, come on, they're all franchises now. And it's a shame, because it's inevitable that the quality level will drop with each new sequel that is made.<br/><br/>But, let's not look to the future, and remain in the present. You should watch this accomplished horror movie, which is perhaps a bit short of spooks but is strong in character development and story progression. I would recommend that you watch the first one, because it's pretty crucial to the story, but this is definitely the stronger of the two outings."

","There is a vicious cycle when it comes to scary movies. The original is released, it becomes an instant classic with a large fanbase. But most of the time, the filmmakers do not leave the original alone. Instead, the director brings along a new form of terror: a sequel. About 99.99% of the time, the sequel never lives up to the original. So, going into James Wan's Insidious: Chapter 2, the burning question on the viewers' mind is this: Can it top the original? Insidious, Wan's 2011 movie that slowly gathered a cult following, was one of the more effective scary movies in recent history. Wan hit another slam-dunk back in July with The Conjuring, an even better movie (and very successful and even critically acclaimed) which is among the years best. So, there is a lot of hype to live up to. Did he do it? <br/><br/>The sequel takes place directly after the events of the original. The Lambert family is trying to move on with their lives and recover from what they just went through. But of course, since this is a sequel to a scary movie, the recovering does not long. The wife Renai (the always terrific Rose Bryne) starts to notice strange occurrences again, including the behavior of her husband Josh (Patrick Wilson, the most overlooked actor in Hollywood), who she does not really trust due to the events of the previous film.<br/><br/>Warning: Do not see this movie without seeing the original. It is not worth it. For confusion sake, just sit down and watch the original. The sequel will not be completely confusing, but either way the original is worth seeing.<br/><br/>It is always nice to see good acting in a scary movie. Like in the original, Wilson and Byrne nail it. The statement about Wilson being the most overlooked actor in Hollywood is true. This guy is great in Hard Candy, Little Children, Lakeview Terrace, among others, and he is still not a household name. Neither is the gorgeous Byrne, who is known for FX's Damages and Bridesmaids. These two are in top form here. Everyone is good, and it is nice to have almost everyone from the original (even Lin Shaye's deceased character Elise).<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, Insidious: Chapter 2 is not quite as good as the original. For Wan, this is a step down from the original Insidious and The Conjuring. Jumping out of your skin is guaranteed, but yet the movie needed something more chilling. It needs more of Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" or that freaky demon that had a close resembelence to Darth Maul.<br/><br/>It is a good movie, but some of it is uneven. Not all of it quite adds up. Also, the twist, while good, is out there, even for this movie. Insidious: Chapter 2, though flawed, is a consistently entertaining movie that is worth seeing. It works, just not as well as the original. But Insidious: Chapter 3, if it happens, is pushing it.<br/><br/>B"

","This movie was hilarious, the bearded dude was a boss. Anyways if you have the movie I would definitely watch this preferably at night. I mostly enjoyed the movie due to the comedy, (I don't know if thats a good thing or bad thing) but there were parts where I did jump. Lots of people didn't like the fact that it was funny, but I did. They mixed it up well with comedy and horror, and created a better sequel than the first. <br/><br/>The story was amazing though, it summed up all the questions we had after the first of this series. All in all the movie isn't a must watch but if you have the money and you want to watch a movie, I would prefer this."

","I saw ""Insidious: Chapter 2"", starring Patrick Wilson-The Conjuring, Watchmen; Rose Byrne-X-Men First Class, Damages-t.v.; Barbara Hershey-Black Swan, Falling Down and Steve Coulter-The Conjuring, The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to the 2010 horror movie directed by James Wan-he directs this one, too, plus he also directed The Conjuring and the original Saw. In the first Insidious, Patrick and his wife Rose had problems with a demon using their son to enter our world. This one continues where it left off and the demon decides to use someone else as his vehicle to Earth. Barbara returns as Patrick's mother and Steve is their new guide to the spirit world and the burgeoning new field of astral projection; if you remember in the ending of the last one, the lady psychic died trying to save Patrick's son, using astral projection. This movie does go into the past history of the demon and what actually motivates him. I liked how they would show scenes from different perspectives; for instance, later in the movie, an earlier scene will be shown with different details highlighted, showing you what is really going on. I also liked how they relied more on actual actors in make-up, instead of CGI effects. If you liked the first one, you will probably like this one. Although there are some good scares, it's not as scary as the first one but the story more than makes up for it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and sequences of terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD."

","I'm back and busier than ever, but that doesn't mean I don't have time for a quick movie review. Hello Robbie K back with another movie review this time on the latest horror movie sequel Insidious 2. As many of us know, the world of sequels is usually lacking, especially when it comes to the horror genre. Usually the scares and creepiness that we loved in the first movie has grown old and stale, often warped into a stupid, cheesy piece of work that is more humorous than scary. So when a sequel to a great movie like Insidious was announced I cringed at the possible trash that could come out, though with director James Wan returning to project I had some hope that we would get something good. What is the verdict? Read on to find out. <br/><br/>Insidious 2 starts as a miniature prequel, reintroducing the world we fell in love with and warming up the audience to the creepiness and scares that await. Jump back to the present where we continue the tale that we left off, again helping us get reacquainted with our old friends the Lamberts, who are trying to move on from the past terror. Not one night after moving in do the ghosts start their antics again, working to scare the heck out of the audience. Wan and crew once again put their imagination to work, and succeed in bringing both scary and creepiness together into a beautiful balance. Like its predecessor, Insidious 2 uses the setting as a pallet for the imagination to paint on, often using subtle sounds, unique camera angles, and that ivory-laced music to raise the hair on your neck. A slight glance of a passing silhouette, something moving in the shadows, or a light fixture licking come together to set the mood before the jump factor comes out of no where, making many audience members screaming. While these effects have grown stale for me, I still appreciate the work the team has put together, and how well edited it is to make a film that will make many scream, which may provide some laughs as well. Make no mistake my friends, Insidious 2 will provide the scares you've been craving since the Conjuring. <br/><br/>If you've read my reviews, then you must know that scare factor isn't the only thing I look for in a movie. For this reviewer, story is also important and Insidious 2 has a great plot indeed. As mentioned before, continuing a horror story is hard to do, but Wan meets the challenge again, this time managing to tweak the story to explain some things that were left unanswered. Who is old woman? What happened at the end to Josh? How about some of those scenes that were so vague in the first one? All of them are answered, and so cleverly integrated into the first one that many fans will gasp at, or perhaps scratch their head in confusion. Insidious 2 has the ability and twist to make you say, ""What are you kidding me?"" as another piece of the puzzle is revealed. While I was able to predict the movie, just from how many things I've seen, the surprises this movie have are a fresh approach that I've waited for someone to show me. The tale has some mystery to it, having all of the characters, both new and old, working to uncover the truth behind the hauntings. Throwing in the suspense, use of shadow, and all the other factors I mentioned before results in a tale that has you wondering what Wan has in store next. <br/><br/>Insidious 2 also has other aspects that made it a strong horror movie sequel. For one thing the comedic relief from characters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson), two geeks who join the crew in hopes of living up to their mentor Elyse's noble legacy. While they do help provide some suspense, this dynamic duo had me in stitches with their casual dialog timed perfectly to relieve the stress. Unlike other movies, I felt their comedy wasn't too stretched or overacted, which made it even better. Aside from the comic relief, the acting for the crew was good, all characters having an equal spread across the film so that everyone got adequate time with the cast. The lovely Rose Byrne did a nice job as always, but this movie her character was a little bit stupider and over exaggerated so I can't say she was my favorite. Patrick Wilson captures the creepy intensity of a possessed victim, though his screaming and actions during the climax are a bit laughable, especially when you realize what movie they are referencing. The rest of the cast did a great job too, but I'm running out of room so let's move on to one last thing. <br/><br/>The makeup and design of the ghosts is incredible, the evil ghost (Danielle Bisutti) is pale, creepy, and gloriously brought to life. It was quite welcoming to see a ghost that was creepy, and not one that looked like a luchador pedophile (Red Demon). However, the biggest props go to the makeup transformation of Josh (Wilson) whose progress is incredibly detailed and sculpted to represent the thing he is decaying into. I can't say too much more though, but those who value the art of make up will hopefully appreciate the work put into this movie. <br/><br/>So if you haven't guessed yet, Insidious 2 is a sequel worth checking out. It's got scares, story, and laugh, all brilliantly captured and edited to make one great film. Don't let the fear of crappy sequels stop you from seeing it, and make sure to bring a friend who jumps so you can get extra entertainment. <br/><br/>I give this movie<br/><br/>Horror: 10/10 Movie Overall: 9.0"
