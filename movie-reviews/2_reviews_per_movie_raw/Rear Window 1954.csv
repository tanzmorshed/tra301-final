","I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?"
"dxia","10","328","389","8 April 2004"," Our Obsession with Voyeurism
","After viewing 'Rear Window' again, I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window,' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies, we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.<br/><br/>When watching 'Rear Window,' it is better to imagine Alfred Hitchcock sitting in that wheelchair rather than Jimmy Stewart. When the camera is using longshots to watch the neighborhood, it is really Hitchcock watching, not Stewart. Hitchcock's love of voyeurism is at the center of this movie, along with his fascination with crime and his adoration of the Madonna ideal.<br/><br/>In many of Hitchcock's movies, 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' 'Psycho,' 'The Birds,' etc, the blonde actresses are objects. Notice how rarely they get close with the male leads. In 'Vertigo,' Stewart's character falls in love with the image of Madeleine; in 'Psycho,' we see the voyeur in Hitchcock peeking out of Norman Bates at Marion; and in 'Rear Window,' Jeff would rather stare out of his window than to hold the beautiful Lisa by his side. For Hitchcock, these women are ideals that should be admired rather than touched.<br/><br/>However, the story of 'Rear Window' isn't about the image of women, as it is in 'Vertigo.' 'Rear Window' focuses more on seduction of crime, not in committing it but in the act of discovering it. At one point in the story, Jeff's friend convinces him that there was no murder, and Jeff is disappointed, not because someone wasn't dead but because he could no longer indulge into his fantasy that someone was. Think how popular crime shows are on television, and noir films at the movies. People do not want to commit crimes; they want to see other people commit them.<br/><br/>'Rear Window' is one of the most retrospective movies I've ever seen. In a span of two hours, it examines some of the most recurrent themes in film. When we watch 'Rear Window,' it is really us watching someone watch someone else. And all the while, Hitchcock is sitting on the balcony and seeing our reaction. It is an act of voyeurism layered on top of itself, and it allows us to examine our own behavior as we are spellbound in Hitchcock's world. The only thing that I feel is missing in the movie is a scene of Jeff using his binoculars and seeing himself in a mirror. Why did Hitchcock leave it out? Maybe because it would have been too obvious what he was doing. Or maybe he was afraid that the audience would see themselves in the reflection of the lens."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","100","122","10 April 2001"," Another Hitchcock masterpiece
","Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?<br/><br/>Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo' (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.<br/><br/>The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.<br/><br/>This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense."
"Snow Leopard","Null","133","171","20 June 2001"," A Deep & Entertaining Classic
","One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, ""Rear Window"" is a deep and entertaining classic with many strengths, and a little bit of everything.  A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot, and there are numerous sub-plots, some humorous and some moving, all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities, and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of film-making that (like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies) is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings, since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot, as good as that story is in itself.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes or so, we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury, forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend, who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning, and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful, no-nonsense nurse who constantly sheds some light - sometimes unwanted - on what is happening between them.  The action and suspense that occur later serves in large part as a catalyst that resolves some of the important issues between the two.<br/><br/>After we get to know the characters and their world, things start to happen, as Stewart becomes engrossed in some of the things he has seen.  The ethical and moral concerns of meddling in others' affairs become intertwined with more urgent questions about what may have happened in those other apartments, and from then on the tension builds steadily.  It leads up to a riveting climactic sequence filled with suspense, and made even more meaningful by our awareness of its deeper significance to the main characters.<br/><br/>There is much more that could be said, but you should see this for yourself. It is a classic that will be enjoyed not only by thriller fans, but by anyone who appreciates carefully crafted movies with a lot of depth."

","Finally, I watched ""Rear Window"" by famous Alfred Hitchcock. First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it's #14 on top of that! I mean, it's gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I'm a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie ""Rear Window"", I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he's just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn't even try, but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.'s heart.<br/><br/>I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won't tell, you'll just have to trust me, it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. ""Rear Window"" is a true classic and I'm extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews, and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys, I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let's keep this classic alive! <br/><br/>10/10"
"dtb","10","141","203","24 November 2004"," Reading from Top to Bottom...Hitchcock's Sophisticated Masterpiece
","Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed."

","Ah it's a movie that's in IMDB's Top 20, and it has good reason to be. For starter's let's look at the simple premise - James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment, with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly), his officer friend Wendell, and his nurse, Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe (from his rear apartment window) and it is one of these - a Raymond Burr - who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.<br/><br/>One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this - he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses, and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see (but never, thankfully, anything more than that - this is how you do suspense!). The set design is wonderful - the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries - an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows (yeah, they don't care much for curtains). There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home, despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice, differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives - there's a mini soap-opera contained in the movie, all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.<br/><br/>Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here, with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick one-dimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role - he was born to it - and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face, managing to effuse her character with both grace (*groan*) and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good (she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious). What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments (and with whom we never actually interact with) have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.<br/><br/>I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work, so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and, in my opinion, this is the best piece of work he's done (that I've seen). It's virtually flawless and you're never let down (or bored). Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar (although he did have tough competition that year with `On the Waterfront').<br/><br/>`Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting, script, and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence. Regarded as a classic, and deservedly so. 9.1/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","57","83","15 January 2004"," In the mid-fifties, Hitchcock brought remarkable suspense by reverting to the logic of a silent film (with an observer behind the lens as the hero)
","Many reviewers and critics have commented on Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the voyeur in Rear Window (the mere thought of a voyeur in a suspense film conjures up images from other classic Hitchcock films), and I felt that voyeuristic bug as well.  But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time- this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silent-film chills.  As L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances) is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment, the audience views right along-side him.  So, for more or less 50 percent of the film, the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism, as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.  <br/><br/>As the thrills build in the second hour of the film there is considerably more dialog than the first hour.  This could, and occasionally does, present a challenge for the audience member that could either be accepted & payed off or resented- can one sit back and just watch things unfold as in a film from the 20's?  Personally, the experience of seeing these events unfold and increase was near electrifying.  Along with Stewart's performance, which ranges from amusing to terrified, compelling to frightened (i.e. Hitch's 'everyday man'), there's Grace Kelly as Lisa, who carries her own beauty & inner conflicts, and Raymond Burr as Thorvold, who could have things going a little better with his wife.  <br/><br/>If we empathize with Jeff, it's because we become as much apart of his mind-set/POV as he already is, and that's the ticket to the film's true success.  Not only is there a magnetic kind of skill to which Hitchcock (and cinematographer Robert Burks) presents us with the apartments' supporting and minor characters and how their fates are played out against the enclosed backdrop, but the psychology of Jeff becomes parallel, or against, to the audience's.  This is the story of one man's temptation and compulsion to be involved with those he can see (much like movie-goers have with any given film), and how perception of the realities around him become ours.  Rear Window may have become dated for some movie-goers, particularly since the theme has been played on by other movies and TV shows (like The Simpsons for example).  Yet there is a certain effectiveness to it all, even in the earlier scenes, that holds an edge over imitators.  A+"

","Having watched it for the second time recently, I was struck by how razor-sharp the film's script actually was.

Of course, the film's framing and camerawork is legendary (for good reason) and Grace Kelly has a luminous screen presence.

","""Rear Window"" comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...<br/><br/>Hitchcock demonstrates in ""Rear Window"" that he is a great voyeur, that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur, forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...<br/><br/>Speaking of technical challenge, ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...<br/><br/>Hitchcock forces limitations on himself, as he did in ""Lifeboat"" when he shot entirely on a restricted set, in only one boat... And in ""Rope"" (his first Technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...<br/><br/>Having restricted his movements, Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it, and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call ""pure cinema.""<br/><br/>Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see close-ups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...<br/><br/>Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds, occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels, yet hides its own complexity... Stewart, tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her, though he himself does not seem to realize it...<br/><br/>All the while, the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives The tormented middle-aged bachelor, composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer ""Miss Torso"" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and, most important, the hysterical ""nagging wife"" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband, a jewelry salesman...<br/><br/>One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...<br/><br/>The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of ""Rear Window,"" a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...<br/><br/>Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fiancée (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists, eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the ""too perfect, too talented, too sophisticated,"" Grace Kelly...<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is visually very strong... Hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... He manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... He has the film synchronized in his mind... Shooting and editing are, for him, a simple mechanical phase... The creativity has all taken place before...<br/><br/>The first shot of ""Rear Window"" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...<br/><br/>Hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... Like Stewart, we are restricted in movements, paralyzed inside the apartment, immobile, trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all aboutnot surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy, lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And, of course, all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...<br/><br/>Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession, an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...<br/><br/>When you see the film, feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... And don't forget to catch Alfred Hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance, this time repairing a clock... Enjoy!"

","This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal. In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escape–I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.<br/><br/>James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals. Bored beyond belief, he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors. Meanwhile there is his girlfriend, none other than Grace Kelly playing a ""too perfect"" socialite intent on winning his heart and soul. Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out, that they are essentially incompatible, she a socialite, who always goes first class, he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accommodations. Naturally the audience (me!) finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.<br/><br/>Raymond Burr (long TV's Perry Mason) in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald, seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night. Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on. There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly, but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window: the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts, the ardor of the newlyweds, the angst of the songwriter, the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty, the pampered dog in a basket, and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife. Hitchcock's America at midcentury. Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution: Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man. The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work. Dancing beauty's man (looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform) returns. The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties, etc. Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch, which is why, I think, he is so beloved. In the final scene Grace Kelly, finding her man asleep, puts down the adventure book she is reading (for his benefit) and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions. One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially, marital reality.<br/><br/>There is some tension and some mystery, but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena, and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic. You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting. See it for Thelma Ritter, the sadonic character actress of many films, most notably this and All About Eve (1950).<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn't trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in it,--it's a work of art."

","I  first saw Rear Window about 4 years ago in a video/film program that I was attending. At that time I was simply blown away by it.<br/><br/>For starters, I was simply impressed w/ the set. The fact that you can see out of Jeffries' apartment window, across the courtyard and into the other tenant's apartments to see their goings on is incredible. The music used is a musician tenant  creating a piece. The fact that it ebbs and flows w/ the action, until the very end when you actualy hear the finished piece committed to vinyl is really cool.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that you only see what Jeffries sees and therefore have to try and guess what actually happened.<br/><br/>While the movie, in a way is actualy about nothing, yet it is about voyeurism and to a lesser degree about love between two apparently different people. However, that is a side line to the actual plot.<br/><br/>for Hitchock, this film uses suspense, rather than gross thriller, such as Psycho or the Birds did to draw you into the film. I've seen it many times and always get something out of it every time. I own a non restored copy on tape and watch it at least twice a year-or more.<br/><br/>It's simply one of the best movies ever made that I've seen and one of my all time favorites. A near perfect movie if I say so myself.<br/><br/>Hitchcock realy paid attention to detail in this movie. The fact that you see ""miss Lonely Hearts"" actions, Even Lars Thorwald's action is incredible. The attention to detail is simply incredible."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I just don't like Hitchcock. I admit that he `delivered value' in his day, but as I review his films today, I find them trite, badly dated. The style of acting he used now looks `actorly.' His camera framing is well considered but unimaginative by today's standards. The stories are not engaging (to me).<br/><br/>But this film really is a classic. Not because of the acting or the dialog, but because it was so cleverly conceived. And because the execution is so purely cinematic.<br/><br/>The first problem a writer/director faces is what stance the camera takes. Is it a fairly static `audience' as if you were watching a play? Is it godlike in always seeing things from the best perspective, though sometimes humanly impossible? Is it a character? Or does it follow a character sometime showing their point of view, sometimes their reaction? Does it act?<br/><br/>Do we admit the camera exists -- by introducing jiggle, or showing operator's functions like focusing, developing? Do we dissolve the camera's perspective by juggling time or perspectives? Do we try a `100 simultaneous cameras' approach?<br/><br/>Hitchcock usually uses the static theatrical approach -- way too much for modern tastes. He punctuates this by sometimes doing a character focused shot, and sometimes a spectacular-for-the-time godshot -- as in the `Psycho' shower scene.<br/><br/>But this film is more purely conceived for the camera. There are no godshots. Nearly all the camerawork is from Jeff's eye, or of Jeff's apartment, with a few notable exceptions. What is novel is why this works -- the set and entire story were composed backwards. That is, instead of having some slice of life that the camera discovers, this reality exists as if it were created by the camera before the action starts. Everything that is required to motivate the world is comprehensible from that apartment -- the entire physics of this world is based on its center.<br/><br/>In other words, Hitchcock's achievement here is not how he accommodates the camera to the world, but the world to the camera.<br/><br/>Pure genius."

","Alfred Hitchcock awesome intrigue/comedy in which a magazine photographer seeks diversion in watching his neighbors , often with a telephoto lens and binoculars , discovering a possible murder . Thrilling flick with funny moments , nice acting , adequate settings and funny dialogue . The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses . It involves a bewildered as well as hapless wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) because of a broken leg who spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder his spouse and dismembered the body . The photographer soon enlists the help of his high society fashion-consultant sweetheart named Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his visiting nurse called Stella (Thelma Ritter) and a Detective (Wendell Corey) to investigate the weird deeds .<br/><br/>This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was one of the main Alfred Hitchcock films made for Paramount . In fact , at the time the set was the largest indoor set built at Paramount Studios . The entire picture was shot on one set, which required months of planning and construction . The film was shot quickly on the heels of Dial M for murder (1954), November 27 1953-February 26 1954 . Alfred Hitchcock's movies have become famous for a number of elements and special iconography : vertiginous height , blonde bombshells , voyeurism , long non-dialogue sequences , a matter of mistaken identity etc . This charming as well as inventive mystery movie has these particularities ; furthermore contains a fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The first part of this production is slow and artificial ; however , the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed . Interesting and intriguing screenplay adapted by John Michael Hayes based on a story by Cornell Woolrich . Screenwriter John Michael Hayes based Lisa on his own wife, who'd been a professional fashion model when they married . The original story by Cornell Woolrich had no love story and no additional neighbors for L.B. Jeffries to spy on, and those elements were created by Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks and he also was known for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an engaging as well as fun script . Very good acting by the great James Stewart as as a photographer who soon becomes convinced that one neighbor has killed his wife and Grace Kelly as gorgeous and elegant girlfriend , both of them make a marvelous duo . Grace Kelly made three of her eleven films with Hitchcock; this film, as well as Catch to a thief (1955) and Dial M for murder (1954), but Rear window film was thought of as the best . Excellent support cast such as Thelma Ritter , Wendell Corey , Kathryn Grant , Frank Cady and Raymond Burr . And of course , Hitch cameo , about a half hour into the film, winding the clock in the songwriter's apartment. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks , Alfred's ordinary cameraman , showing nice images from studio . The film negative was considerably damaged as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s , nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded out. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged, preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration . Rousing as well as atmospheric score by the classic composer Franz Waxman .<br/><br/>The motion picture was stunningly directed by maestro of thriller Alfred Hitchcock . The film was unavailable for decades because its rights were bought back by Alfred Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the infamous ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"" among film buffs, and were re-released in theatres around 1984 after a 30-year absence. The others are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), The rope (1948), trouble with Harry (1955), and Vértigo (1958). This essential and fundamental Hitchcock will keep fascinated and thrilling right up until the edge-of-your-seat climax . And the American Film Institute ranked this as the #48 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked #3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Mystery"" in June 2008."

Towards the end of the movie some really bad primal CGI is used and the tension didn't hold out like I had hoped.

There are in effect multiple plots extending beyond the suspected murder. Each apartment holding it's own narrative and inviting the viewer into the private lives of the block. We care about all the characters in these sub plots, holding both humour and tragedy in their confined spaces. The developing relationship between the two excellent leads is the icing on the cake.

"EUyeshima","10","11","17","5 March 2006"," Voyeurism, Murder, Stewart and Kelly Make for a Hitch High
","It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's ""Rear Window"" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"". But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script. Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in ""Vertigo"" but still likable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character. Robert Burks' probing camera-work makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark film-making style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work."
"uroshnor54","1","35","67","25 February 2014"," Terrible Ending
","I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one disappointed by the ending. <br/><br/>If this movie had ended with L. B. Jefferies realizing that Lars Thorwald was innocent, it would have been great. But no, it turns out that Thorwald actually did kill his wife. If ever there was a movie that needed a twist ending, it was Rear Window. <br/><br/>And I'll admit that I thought the camera never leaving the room seemed gimmicky. And didn't people use blinds in New York in the 1950s? And if Jefferies has no problem seeing his neighbors, why doesn't any one of them see him, especially with that huge camera lens he's holding. (Well, Thorwald sees him in the end, but why did it take him that long? Jefferies had his camera lens pointed at his room for more than half the movie.)<br/><br/>And even after I accepted the fact that the twist ending I had hoped for wasn't going to happen, I couldn't get past how stupid the climax was. Really? The villain is stopped by camera flashbulbs? That's something I'd expect to work only in a cartoon.<br/><br/>I've seen two other Hitchcock movies and I didn't like them either. Vertigo was just boring. The villain in that movie just came up with the most convoluted plan to get rid of his wife. And North by Northwest wasn't that great either. Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger (the first three James Bond movies) were all more exciting and all of them had a lower budget than North by Northwest. But Rear Window is definitely the worst of the three."

","Alfred Hitchcock......Oh dear, I'm going to upset a lot of people here. But he doesn't quite do it for me. So far I've sat through the 39 steps, North by northwest, Rear window and Psycho and so far only the latter has really entertained me. The premise of the film is great one....A guy laid up in bed, believes he witnesses a murder from his bedroom window, and goes about proving it. I like the idea, but Stewart's inkling and further surmises are so fat outweighed by the evidence brought to his bedside, that he'd be registered mentally ill if he'd continued with his allegations in real life...He is of course proved right! It reminds me a lot of 12 angry men, of which I have the exact same criticism. WHERE'S YOUR GODDAM EVIDENCE!!!!<br/><br/>So what is my problem with Hithcock? Well I guess I'm of an age where thrillers have been made as being a lot more gritty...see Se7en, French connection and I suppose I'm basing my reaction to any other thriller upon what I've been brought up with. To me, there is a whole heap of plot-holes and lack of realism, that I just feel the audience of the day must have been very naive. But that isn't the case as films such as 'M' and Casablanca to name but two have proved.<br/><br/>OK, so I understand that a film doesn't have to be realistic to be entertaining....Was the Wizard of Oz realistic...I don't think so, and to be fair I did find this film relatively entertaining, but I kept thinking it was supposed to be a thriller and those annoyances kept annoying me!!!!<br/><br/>Maybe, one day I will get it...Maybe one day I'll be watching this again and saying to my grandkids how great a film it is.....But I think it'll more likely be se7en or 'M'!

","As far as I know, this is a huge favorite with older folks. Kids of today would be bored to death with this famous Alfred Hitchcock film. <br/><br/>I went on a bit of a roller-coaster ride myself regarding how I viewed this movie. When I first saw it on the big screen as a kid, I was fascinated and almost terrified at the end. Years later, watching it twice within five years on VHS, I found it boring with Grace Kelly's dialog annoyingly corny and dated. Recently I viewed it again - a fourth try - and absolutely loved it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Hitchcock film.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's still dated quite a bit, and, in future viewings, I might fast-forward through a couple of talky parts with Kelly or Thelma Ritter. I would prefer to stick with the focus of the story, namely Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment. That storyline is entertaining and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart is usually fun to listen to, anyway. Kelly is there for looks.<br/><br/>Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the apartments keeping their blinds open all the time, and Stewart keeping his door unlocked all the time as well, and people entering without bothering to knock first? True, it was more trusting and safer world back then, but it couldn't have been THAT transparent and trusting. Give me a break! <br/><br/>Yet, credibility aside, it's so involving and fun to watch that who cares if doesn't make a lot of sense?"

"jimkis-1","2","48","99","18 June 2008"," Tepid stuff indeed.
","I'm glad to see I'm not the only person who thought this movie was a stinker. How Hitchcock maintained his title of ""master of suspense"" after making this is beyond my comprehension. There is NO suspense in the movie. Jeffries suspects his neighbor is a killer, and, golly-gee-willikers, his neighbor IS a killer. Wow, what a twist. I haven't been so underwhelmed since I saw ""The Burbs"" (which is a far better movie and much more entertaining), and ""Disturbia"" at least delivers some true action.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is so tepid you wonder if audiences of 1954 did not have a pulse. If they found this suspenseful, they must have been hypnotized.<br/><br/>Aside from the boring, uneventful plot, there are other serious issues with this movie. Stewart's relationship with Grace Kelly is totally unbelievable. He is 20 years older than she is. He should be flirting with someone his own age  namely Thelma Ritter who was about the same age as he. But Hollywood  even today  is always pairing old dudes with young women, as if that happens every day in real life. (Grace seems to have made a career of slobbering on old men  Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, etc. What did people see in her anyhow?)<br/><br/>If Stewart really is a rough-and-tumble photojournalist, you'd think he'd have a better physique. His nude chest is embarrassing to look at  the only thing more embarrassing is when he locks lips with Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>One also wonders if Stewart's character was an idiot. He can't occupy himself any other way than spying on his neighbors? He doesn't know how to read? He doesn't have a TV? He can't listen to the radio? He IS in a wheelchair; I thought the reason for a wheelchair was so the person could be mobile; he is not bedridden.<br/><br/>This movie might have had some success if it had been shot in black-and-white. Then there could have been a ""noir"" thing going. But there is so much talk, talk, and more talk that I doubt even that could save it.<br/><br/>Critics have also made a big deal of the ""voyeurism"" theme of this film, as if that is truly shocking somehow. Again, maybe that was a big deal in 1954, but in our day and age it is just yet another tired example of motion picture psychobabble.<br/><br/>I admire Jimmy Stewart in Westerns  he was generally good in them. But every movie he made for Hitchock was embarrassing (yes, I include that turkey ""Vertigo"" in the group); while this one is not quite as bad as ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" it comes close. I hope I never have to sit through this again as long as I live!"
"DesertBeagler","5","9","14","20 February 2016"," Overrated Suspense Flick
","Rear Window is certainly well shot and the suspense is there. However, the mystery isn't. It's very predictable. That's fine, but unfortunately Stewart isn't a very convincing actor. Coming off of ""Vertigo"", I was thankful he was portraying a photographer (Jeff). Well, this is supposed to be a ""tough"" photographer who wears boots, treks through jungles and eats grizzly tribal foods in foreign lands. He doesn't look or act ""tough"" in any way.<br/><br/>There was a scene near the beginning of the film where Jeff was supposed to doze off, not being able to stay awake and watch out his window any longer. It looked more like he was having a stroke than falling asleep. If a Hollywood actor can't convincingly fall asleep, that's a problem.<br/><br/>The film is filled with just downright unrealistic events.<br/><br/>To go through some of the more extreme examples: At the end of the film after Jeff falls from the window, the policeman pokes his head out to report a full confession with multiple details. This was 10 seconds after they pulled the killer off of Jeff. All that in 10 seconds? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Prior to that, Jeff was hanging only by his fingers/hands on the ledge. He has a big, strong looking man pushing on him but somehow his fingers have superman strength (yes, that is a 1998 Rear Window remake jab at Christopher Reeve). Of course, it's only when the police stop the killer that he falls.<br/><br/>The scene prior to this with his camera flashes was the dumbest killer/victim scene I've ever seen. Basically, the killer is standing at one end of the room and Jeff in his wheelchair at the other. He puts a bulb in his flash and sets it off, temporarily blinding the killer. The camera focuses close in on him rubbing his eyes, stopping him in his tracks then recovering. He takes one more step, and this whole process repeats about 4 or 5 times until he finally reaches him. Of course, it's at this point that the police coincidentally show up and he's able to scream for help. It's comical.<br/><br/>Earlier in the film, Jeff's girlfriend is being strangled/attacked. He and his nurse just watch. He squirms like a pansy and says ""Oh gee, what do we do?"" Oh gee, golly whiz, what do you do? Well for one, if someone's life is in serious danger, you don't do nothing. You could scream. Yes, screaming out and saying ""HEY A**HOLE, I CALLED THE POLICE! WE SEE YOU ATTACKING HER!"" would actually be a rational thing to do. But, the police magically show up literally 15 seconds after he calls them and save the day.<br/><br/>The problem is all of these unrealistic scenes were unnecessary. They could have easily been replaced with realistic alternatives. Great movies don't require the viewer to throw rationality out the window (no pun intended). For that reason, I feel the film is quite overrated. I also think the Freud analysis of the movie some people have like ""it's a take on society's obsession with voyeurism"" is complete nonsense. No, it's actually not. It's actually a crime-suspense film about a nosy, bored neighbor stumbling upon a murder - not a message to viewers about society's inner perversions."
"toberwino","4","22","41","15 February 2011"," Did I miss something?
","I had heard a lot about this film so was really looking forward to seeing it. I watched it in the company of my wife and her sister and at the end all three of us felt the same about it as my review below. I found it a huge disappointment - it trundled along at a slow pace and I kept waiting for something to happen which would be thrilling or suspenseful etc - typically Hitchcock. I am still waiting. I kept wondering, if someone is a professional photographer with a massive telephoto lens at his disposal, why did he not take any photographs. Isn't that what voyeurs do? Also, could someone tell me the purpose of the back massages - I am no masseuse but there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to them. This movie was a horrible waste of my time."
"johnclark-1","5","17","31","28 June 2009"," But did you believe it?
","Never saw the whole thing through until tonight, on TCM. And I must say, I again got impatient with Hitchcock's penchant for manipulating reality, as if it didn't matter, in setting up his character conflicts towards suspenseful endings. It's all to do with believing what you see. One should not take for granted any audiences, all of whom are familiar with real life.<br/><br/>The film begins with a long long establishing panning shot of the location and ends up in tight close-up of our hero at the window, which was fine, but why was the camera movement so shaky? Surely smooth pans were achievable back in 1954, weren't they?<br/><br/>Then silly little things annoyed me. Like, did New Yorkers ever leave their front doors unlocked? When I lived there in the early sixties, we installed police locks, because regular locks were deemed too easy for intruders to break in. And what was with the SLR camera and its huge long lens that Stewart kept peering through? He wasn't taking pictures, he seemed to be using it as a telescope in preference to his powerful binoculars.<br/><br/>Dramatic writing skill consists largely of giving information necessary to the plot in well disguised ways. When we first meet Grace Kelly, the method used to reveal her character's name was by her pointing out bits of furniture after herself - embarrassing. And one could not believe her sudden conversion from scorn to belief in Stewart's suspicions, nor her journey to dig up the murderer's garden while wearing the long flowing ""new look"" fashion, nor her break-in climbing ladders to get into his apartment.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that paying attention to real-life situations to serve the setting up of dramatic conflict has always been a challenge for film-makers, and if done successfully can only serve to make the finished product much more acceptable - suspension of disbelief being key. Hitchcock too often reveals a contempt for this, preferring to manipulate the small details of real life, in order to serve what he sees as his higher purpose."
"awm-77697","6","4","5","15 February 2018"," Rear window movie review
","Rear window is such a unique and interesting movie. It is one that almost stands alone in its plot and camera angles and things of that sort. During the first twenty to thirty minutes of this movie it was almost extremely boring and I kept constantly asking myself the same question over and over again, which is ""are they really going to keep the camera in this one room for the whole movie?"" I kept on telling myself that the camera would probably move sometime soon and they would change scenery sometime soon, but that time just never came. Throughout the film it took sometime for me to actually accept the new movie style that Hitchcock portrays in this film. 
 During this film I went through almost 3 different stages of interest. The first stage consisted mostly of confusion and trying to figure out what was going on as they were introducing the different characters and scenarios. It was a very new movie feel for me so it took time to get used to. The second phase for me was unfortunately boredom, as I couldn't really engage into what was being played out in the different apartments. It wasn't until the end of the movie, about the time when the dog is found dead with its neck snapped that I really started to enjoy and became engaged in the film. The ending was very engaging and was extremely well done. It created an excellent sense of tension and suspense that I think engages every single viewer. During the whole process of watching the movie I can't really say I enjoyed it at all but once I looked back on it and realized the different cinematic elements and styles I came to appreciate it and understand it more.
 I definitely have a strong bias here because I was born into a generation of such great quality cameras and such good editing and animation. For this reason it can be really hard for me to engage in older movies of this style. Nonetheless this movie was very interesting to look back on and see how Hitchcock portrayed the characters in such an interesting way. It was so different and cool to basically see people as non-actors but just as every day people. You really get a sense of this when the movie is portraying someone in their everyday life without them supposedly knowing that they are being watched. You see the pureness of every shot. This film really enacts a different feeling in the viewer, as it is something were really not used to seeing.
 Overall I cant really say that I enjoyed this movie to much as I found it slightly boring and un-engaging. There are many great cinematic elements that make it very different and interesting. The whole stationary camera sense was just two different for me and I was able to really appreciate and enjoy the movie very much."

","Rear Window is particularly interesting for two things. The first, is the excellent direction and staging, Hitchcock's trademark. The second is the innovative concept of the confined, voyeuristic story.<br/><br/>Because let's face it, the script didn't match the expectation. The plot is a lot too predictable from start to finish. One tries to establish theories, collect hypothetical clues, when ultimately there is no surprise at all because everything that Jefferies imagines turns out to be the exact truth. Where are the misleads for examples, one of the basic thriller elements ? In these conditions, the outcome is a real deception because of its predictability.<br/><br/>Add the fact that there are overlong passages such as some voyeuristic scenes or well written yet pointless dialogues, and you get a pseudo thriller, little dynamic, with no suspense or tension, that stands out more because of its form that its content."

","I don't know what the people find so interesting about the movie.. First of all, everybody's lives are taking place with 'open windows'.. This is very unlikely in a neighborhood. Assuming this is the plot of the movie and watching it, you will not be surprised if you fall asleep. The movie progresses very slowly and I almost slept away once. Had to play the movie again and force myself to watch it during day time.<br/><br/>There is no twist in the movie. No turns, no thrill or no suspense..

","When the issue is a fifty year old ""classic"" that others rave over, the easiest thing in the world is to go along with the crowd, and proclaim the film a ""masterpiece"". You've got lots of protective cover.<br/><br/>But I, for one, do not like this film, and I don't mind saying so. First, the film's theme is unethical. Many people equate Jefferies' voyeurism to an audience watching a movie. Such a comparison ostensibly makes the voyeuristic theme harmless. But filmmakers make movies specifically to be watched. By contrast, most people at home value their privacy, and would not like some neighbor from across the street spying on them through binoculars. In this film, Hitchcock gets away with it because the guy doing the spying is played by a famous, and beloved, actor named James Stewart.<br/><br/>The second problem is the film's contrived plot. The timing of Thorwald's activities with Jefferies' spying is way too coincidental, for my taste. And without Thorwald's activities, you don't have a story. Further, Thorwald conveniently leaves his windows open to view, behavior that is not believable. For that matter, how believable is it that any of those neighbors would leave their windows open to view, in such a tight, claustrophobic setting? And without those open windows, you don't have a story.<br/><br/>My third objection is the film's lack of suspense and lack of plot twists. I do not consider this film to be a thriller at all. It's more of a social commentary on nosy neighbors.<br/><br/>Most viewers would pounce on a film whose theme is unethical, or would jump all over a film that has obvious contrivances, or lacks suspense or plot twists. In the case of ""Rear Window"", however, viewers ignore the film's flaws, because the film has Hitchcock's name attached to it. And so, we have a double standard. The standards are fairly low for films directed by Hitchcock. A much tougher set of standards apply to films made by other directors."

","Though I've enjoyed a couple other Hitchcock movies, this one is incredibly boring for 95+ percent of the viewing time. There are whole chunks of time wasted as the main characters debate about marriage and relationships that I thought we're going to somehow pay off but never do. What some people think is genius--the confinement of the action to Jimmy Stewart's apartment--is actually a severe handicap, as no energy is generated by interesting new locations or discoveries of place. The stagnant setting just intensifies the story's infectious feeling of malaise. There also should have been more of a mystery to it, to keep you guessing and interested. Instead, you pretty much know Thorvald is guilty right from the beginning, so there's not twist or surprise to help make things exciting. Again--extremely boring, the kiss of death for a ""thriller."" Skip this and watch North by Northwest instead."

","****MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS**** <br/><br/>This movie could have been about a 9 but they built it all up to the most stupid and predictable ending ever!<br/><br/>Where was the twist? <br/><br/>What was the message? Just because you are paranoid doesn't mean your neighbors aren't trying to kill you...? Really disappointing. <br/><br/>Hitchcock had it primed to deliver a powerful ending with Stewart's paranoia either destroying his own life (getting his girlfriend jailed, his best friend fired, and losing his own mind) and/or destroying his neighbor's life for no reason (getting him arrested for murder even though his wife was still alive, or killing him/suicide out of fear).<br/><br/>The era this film was made demanded a much more wholesome ending. As a result we were forced to accept that despite all logic and evidence to the contrary, the paranoid crackpot murder theory of a shut-in depressed photographer was dead right from the beginning.<br/><br/>This film should be remade with a much more intelligent and thought provoking ending."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","5","9","15","8 April 2013"," I really wanted to like this film...
","I watched the film all the way through and largely enjoyed it, but there was no suspense or tension for me, instead being somewhat predictable. I read the synopsis about a murder taking place in a neighbour's apartment and that is exactly what happened.<br/><br/>Perhaps the main reason this film failed up to live up to my extremely high expectations was watching it the day after Sidney Lumet's incredible '12 Angry Men' starring Henry Fonda. It's not in the same league.<br/><br/>The main disappointments for me were the plot holes and general non-believability, such as the argument with the detective friend, leading to a stormy exit and a quip along the lines of 'don't bother me again, if you're looking for future help use the yellow pages', followed by a phone call to the aforementioned detective's house, answered by the maid, the message being passed on, accepted as being credible even though he didn't believe the story after several face to face conversations, but instead believing a message passed on by the maid, proceeded by a hurried return to the apartment of the wheelchair-ridden voyeur to go through the whole thing all over again, effectively rubbishing any previous convictions held by the detective or those investigated by the police department.<br/><br/>Another gaping issue is the improbability of a man spending day after day spying on others, sometimes with reflective binoculars and zoom lenses, but not being observed by anyone else. No-one looks at the camera once, except for the murderer at the end of the movie. Society is such that people are more concerned with getting on with their own lives than worrying about others. Not even a paranoid murderer sitting in the dark, lights off, smoking cigarettes, is concerned about a man sitting at his window day and night looking in his direction.<br/><br/>Further improbability is Grace Kelly in the murderer's apartment when she suddenly gets caught, resulting in a physical struggle, followed by our observing 'hero' calling the police, then followed by a pair of cops arriving almost immediately at the upstairs apartment and preventing the murderer from wrestling the intruder onto the couch.<br/><br/>People go out leaving their doors on the latch, a question of personal preference, but having ladders conveniently spanning the exterior of buildings, leading up to the apartment in focus with windows wide open, enabling a half-competent cat burglar in an enormous $1000 dollar frock to slip inside unobserved. Just a little too far fetched for me.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, the acting was nice, the coming together of two different worlds into a love story was interesting, the beauty of Grace Kelly absolutely divine, but the plot holes were really distracting and the level of suspense mostly absent.<br/><br/>I've now got 'Vertigo' and 'North by Northwest' to watch on my list of Hitchcock films, so I've mentally dampened my expectations to avoid disappointment. Just remember never to watch this film after the fantastic '12 Angry Men' from 1957."

","Brilliant. Legendary. Perfect. There are not enough adjectives to describe properly ""Rear Window"". Along with ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" this is probably one of his best 3 movies.<br/><br/>After his period in Warner Bros., where he directed masterpieces like ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""Dial M For Murder"", it seemed as if the master could not top what he had previously achieved. But he did. In fact, when Hitchcock directed ""Rear Window"", his first movie at Paramount, he was beginning with the right foot what would become his most brilliant period.<br/><br/>The well-known plot stars Hitchcock's favorite Jimmy Stewart as photographer L. B. Jeffries, who is almost caged in his apartment during his recovery from an accident he had while working. To kill the time, he becomes obsessed with what happens to his neighbors outside, to the point that he is convinced that one of them committed a murder. Grace Kelly plays his beautiful girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter plays his nurse.<br/><br/>Hitchcock makes us parters in crime during Jeffreis voyeuristic adventures, as we are silent witness of the misfortunes of the neighborhood. Lisa, his girlfriend, has a difficult relationship with Jeffreis, there is definitely love there, but he is reluctant to include her in his life because he considers her ""too perfect"". Jeffreis voyeurism is probably, his escape to his problems as he prefers to watch the others.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is brilliant. The camera is our eyes and it flows smoothly; and even when the movie takes place almost entirely in Jeffreis apartment, it never becomes tiresome or boring. This is also possible to the ingenious script and the brilliant performance of the three lead characters.<br/><br/>Beautiful Grace Kelly is outstanding as the lovely girlfriend who turns into an adventurous spy as she gets interested in his boyfriend's new hobby. Jimmy Stewart gives once again his classic performance of the ""regular guy"" that Hitchcock enjoyed so much; although in my opinion, is Thelma Ritter who gives the movie that charming quality, as her witty comments are delivered with that dark humor that Hitchcock loved so much.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is without any doubt, a perfect movie. Hitchcock has walked a long way, but all his previous work was practice when compared to the movies to come; his work would reach it's peak in the famous three: ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Psycho"". At this time, he is already considered a master.<br/><br/>10/10. Masterpiece."
"FilmOtaku","8","7","11","8 March 2004"," Hitchock Classic
","Rear Window is considered one of Hitchcock's classics, and is probably Jimmy Stewart's most famous Hitchcock Role.  Stewart plays an adventure-seeking photographer who is laid up for seven weeks in his apartment with a broken leg.  During this time, he has become vicariously involved with his neighbors; looking out his rear windows and following their lives.  As the final week of his incapacity begins, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors has killed his wife, and pretty soon his girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and nurse (Thelma Ritter) realize that he may be right.<br/><br/>I seem to get more out of Rear Window the older I get  there are subtleties to the relationship, and to the lives of the other apartment dwellers that I catch as an adult, and didn't when I was younger.  One thing that has remained a constant however is the methodical pacing and the slow tension that builds up to outright terror.  I get just as tense and nervous during the last ten minutes of the film as a 30 year old as I did when I first saw the film at age 10.  It is only as I got older that I realized the helplessness of Stewart's character, and how important that element was to the plot along with its contribution to the uneasiness of the film.<br/><br/>I've heard more than once that people have been bored during this film  of course, that is an opinion and cannot be judged, but I find it hard to relate to that, as I believe that even without the elements of suspense, Rear Window still makes a great story and film:  Which is just one of the many reasons it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films to this day.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","This movie was decent but had a dry plot that was quite uneventful. If you like movies filled with action or an intelligent storyline than this movie is not for you. Throughout the entire film Jim Stewart moves within a 10 foot radius and the set not exceeding a 50 foot radius. However this movie does contain some suspenseful moments but often end abruptly and without explanation. The storyline is unlikely and far-fetched and some of the actions taken out by the main characters are ridiculous, an example being when Stewarts girlfriend sneaks into the culprits apartment by hopping a fire escape into a two story window. All in all this movie contained some moments that were worth watching, but for the most part i thought it was mediocre at best."

","Another director I loved, Steven spielberg, said of Hitchcock: ""Hitchcock was a trailblazer in the suspense and horror genre... Rear window is one of the masterpieces of Hitchcock's suspense films. He created an atmosphere of terror and suspense, and vividly explored the voyeuristic psychology hidden in everyone's heart. It can be seen that the short, fat old Englishman has been regarded as a role model by today's big directors.<br/><br/>The view of the rear window is very small, as the title suggests, and most of the time the camera is pointing out of that window. Actually Hitchcock became particularly gifted master I think there are two aspects, one is the grasp of human nature of peep is the instinct of a man, like gossip, the only difference lies in the strength of desire, a lot of people instinct to spy out from the window of the neighbor's house, and was found in nature will instinctively, because of the sense is too strong, when jeffery hiding behind the curtains moviegoers will also produce the snake on the rigid cold shiver.

","This is a great movie with profound and moral paradoxes. The premise of the film is the existence of a criminal act. So the movie seems to tell viewers that voyeurism is immoral, but it is precisely because of this immoral behavior that it prevents the crime itself and thus creates a sense of justice. Hitchcock used his films to explain this human natural desire. He used his movie to make us understand: peeping is universal in everyone's heart. However, excessive peeping goes beyond the boundaries of morality and even law. From this perspective, the restraint of civilization has caused the depression of humanity to a certain extent. We need to comply with both constraints and instincts, and there is a certain conflict between the two. As an external window, it also plays a media role for the observer to observe the inner heart of the person. Interestingly, the observer's peeping behavior is also a manifestation of human nature."

"KGJR_","10","2","2","19 March 2020"," My favourite Hitchcock
","I love this film. I love the cinematography, the plot, the characters, and the interactions between characters. Doyle is so thoroughly annoying; despite the fact that they almost never speak, Miss Torso, the pianist, and Miss Lonelyheart feel just as real and round as characters like Lisa, Jeff, or Stella (I appreciate the blunt delivery of her thoughts). When considering the villain (Thorwald) does not speak for most of the film, I am impressed by how much can be conveyed through body language. Plus, when Thorwald confronts Jimmy Stewart at Jeff's apartment and the defenestration scene is preceded with Jeff defending himself via camera flashes, I could not help but chuckle at how perfectly silly this ending was.<br/><br/>This was the first Hitchcock film I ever watched and remains my favourite to this day.<br/><br/>An interesting choice about which I am not quite sure how I feel is the ending, however. Lisa is an amazing woman. She is fearless, smart, quick on her feet, and elegant. This is true from the beginning, though. I don't think Lisa changes all that much from the first scene she is on stage till the last. What evolves is Jeff's perception of Lisa. At the beginning, Jeff sees Lisa as fragile. On multiple occasions, he brings up socioeconomic status and seems to associate Lisa's love of expensive clothes with her supposed inability to handle the harshness of the real world Jeff is used to in his line of work; it's easy to discern that he is relatively more sensitive about money.<br/><br/>The last scene starts with Miss Lonelyheart at the pianist's apartment as the pianist puts on a record. I don't remember all of the lyrics, but it's essentially a slow, romantic piece about a woman called Lisa. As the music continues, the camera pans, and we eventually see Jeff facing away from the window. He appears to be dreaming. The camera then pans right as we see Lisa next to him, reading ""Beyond the High Himalayas"" until she is convinced Jeff is no longer awake. She then puts the book down and picks up an issue of Bazaar.<br/><br/>This is the first time Lisa is not wearing a dress or a skirt, but rather trousers and an overall more practical-looking attire. It's implied that she is now more in tune with Jeff because she is tougher because...trousers and book about geography? My issue with this ending is that it implies certain preferences, like Lisa's choice of fashion and reading habits inherently make it impossible for her to not be fragile. On the contrary, I would argue that her continued interest proves that her overall kickass nature does not have anything to do with what she is wearing. I don't think certain interests automatically (dis)qualify a person from having certain personality traits. I also don't think a relationship where one party puts on a facade to appease the other is healthy or could last long and remain an enjoyable relationship for both."

","Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most important auteurs and every motion picture release with his name attached was a big event. The sharp-detailed director had two movies released in 1954. The first was the thrilling, perhaps a bit minor Dial M for Murder. His second film is the subject of this review, Rear Window. Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best, if not the best thrillers he has ever made. The story is simple enough, but the film envelopes you in a world of nonstop tension. I was biting my nails from start to finish, and that is habit that rarely comes out. Good job, Mr. Hitchcock! <br/><br/>The story, written by John Michael Hayes seems quite simple, but I love the complexity that is given to the film. Just like Hitchcock's other 1954 feature, most of the film takes place in one location-the apartment of James Stewart's character, L.B Jeffries. The one set based off Greenwich Village in New York City, that Hitchcock built on the set of Paramount studios is very elaborate and it really works well with the film. Did you know that he even created a drainage system that would allow the water used as rain to drain? One thing that Hitchcock excels at in each film of his is his excellent sense of detail. <br/><br/>L.B Jeffries aka Jeff (James Stewart) is confined to his apartment after his breaking his leg. He has two women coming to his apartment to take care him: his wisecracking nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his beautiful longtime girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who works as a fashion model. To save him from boredom, Jeff decides to spy on his neighbors with his binocular. There is Miss Lonely Hearts who cooks fancy dinners for imaginary guests and there is Miss Torso who entertains various males just to name some of the people he sees. One rainy night, he notices a neighbor named Thorwald (Raymond Burr) leaving a with a trunk three times and that his nagging and invalid wife is no longer present. That leaves Jeff suspicious of his neighbor and he believes a murder took place. Along with Stella, Lisa, and his police lieutenant friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), Jeff begins to put the pieces together to find the truth. <br/><br/>When there is only location, you need great direction and great acting to make up for that closed location. We already know Hitchcock directed the hell out of the film, and he earned an Academy Award nomination. What about the acting? I can happily report that the acting is phenomenal. James Stewart really crushes it here, considering his character is immobilized the entire time. Pre-war, Jimmy Stewart was known for his comedies, westerns, and taking nice guy roles in general. After WW2 ended, he began taking more complex and darker roles. Hitchcock exploited that side of him not only with this film, but in 1958's Vertigo as well. He does well with the coldness of his character. Grace Kelly, who appeared in Dial M for Murder, does well here. She is cool and elegant and is more than just the beautiful blonde. She also does some unexpecting stuff such as sneaking in the apartment of the suspect-and that scene is dripping with tension, I promise! <br/><br/>There is a lot that goes behind Hitchcock's head. One idea he prominently displays here is the idea of voyeurism. The basic definition of voyeurism is taking pleasure in watching someone unobserved. The term can be used in a sexual way, or it could be used in a way that watching someone else's pain relieves the watcher of his/her pain. Also, what about us viewers of the movie? Are we not taking pleasure or interest in watching the pain or emotions of these characters? Voyeurism is the central theme at play here. There are also themes that can be discussed regarding impotence of male figures and how women are just not supposed to be seen as beautiful, but how they can be regarded as puzzles or even threats. For such a simple story, there can be much to think about!<br/><br/>Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. It really thrills you from start to finish and I am not talking about any of those cheap thrills. The characters are built up so well that by the time we get to the payoff in the end, do we really care about that payoff? I mean that in a positive way! With only one set location, the use of diegetic (natural) sound outside the main titles, this really is a thriller to behold. I can't be sure if this is my favorite Hitchcock film as there are so many masterpieces, but this is up there!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

"mge-29659","9","2","2","14 February 2018"," A Technical Marvel
","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a fantastic example of his ingenuity and vision when creating films. While of course this movie has a great story with meaningful dialogue, the way Hitchcock tells the story is what truly is impressive. The movie starts with a panning shot around the main character's apartment, which reveals that he is a photographer who has broken his leg and is now wheelchair bound. Because of this the entire movie is shot from the perspective of the apartment. The camera never leaves. As a result, many important film techniques were necessary to create a complex story with multiple characters only looking from one spot. 
 Hitchcock is restricted to using only a few camera angles because the entire movie is shot from in perspective, for example eye-level for shots in the apartment, and then long shots and a few close-ups for things outside the apartment. But even with so few types of camera angles, Hitchcock uses the camera angles to advance the story. For example, every shot from the apartment is a long shot in the beginning, the same way anyone in the apartment would see. These long shots show the basis of what is happening in the scene, but it is difficult to see the details from this angle. but when the main character grabs a pair of binoculars to investigate further, a close is used, showing the viewer exactly what the character would see, and giving them the same amount of detail.
 Another technical piece of film that Hitchcock incorporates into the story is the use of light and dark. Early in the film the main character is spying on his suspicious neighbor, and he realizes he can be seen through his window, so he backs into his unlit apartment to stay hidden. This action of hiding in the dark is repeated throughout the film, until the neighbor eventually notices him and make's it to the apartment. Since the main character is crippled, he obviously can't fight. So, he uses the light and dark to his advantage. He turns all the lights off and uses flash bulbs to blind his attacker. Hitchcock uses light and dark as a weapon for the main character, as it's the only way he can defend himself with his condition.
 While Hitchcock uses camera tricks to create suspense and intrigue in the film, he mostly uses mise en scene to carefully create every scene and put everything exactly where it should be to perfectly tell the story. Many of the ""mysteries"" created in the film are crated purely out of the perspective of the main characters. For example, the suspicious neighbor is yelling at his wife, but the shade is down in their window, so neither the characters or the viewers know what's really going on. Or when the neighbor moves his wife's purse form the bedroom to another room, a wall perfectly blocks the neighbor from the main characters point of view. Every object in each scene, and every wall or blockage of something is carefully planned out by Hitchcock to create a sense of suspense and mystery, while just sitting in one spot, away from all the action.
 Hitchcock's Rear Window is truly a test of his creativity when directing a film. To be able to tell an interesting and well written story from the perspective of one person who doesn't move the whole movie really shows how good of a director Alfred Hitchcock is. He perfectly incorporates many technical pieces of film such as specific camera angles, right, and placement of subjects within a scene for giving the viewer a similar perspective to the main character, and creating an interesting and well-developed world just from the view of one rear window"
"pjnezamis","9","2","2","6 February 2018"," A Window Worth Staring Through
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window tells the story of magazine photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) as he recovers from an accident that left him confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. Jeffries finds himself with little to do except sit in his apartment and look out through his window into the courtyard. From here he begins to casually spy on the day to day activities of his neighbors through their open windows. The plot thickens when he begins to suspect on of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) of killing his wife. Jeffries convinces his insurance company nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelley), and detective friend Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of his suspicions and together they work to find out what happened to Mrs. Thorwald. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's genius shines in this film as he decides to leave the camera (and so the audience) trapped in the apartment alongside Jeffries. The plot is viewed through Jeffries point of view, nearly every shot of the view from his window is accompanied by a shot of him reacting to what he and the audience just saw. The movie is a study into the compulsive voyeurism and natural curiosity of humans. The audience shares in Jeffries's compulsive curiosity to find out where Mrs. Thorwald had disappeared too. And just like how Jeffries eagerly watches Thorwald searching for another piece to the mystery the audience watches too, awaiting the next development with the same zeal. The limited camera also helps to create a wonderful sense of suspense throughout the whole film. Until the final moments of the film here is enough conflicting evidence that Thorwald could be either a murderer or an innocent salesman, creating a tense climax with a superbly suspenseful build up. <br/><br/>The entire set itself is so well built and tells such a story by itself that it almost feels like a character. Each other apartment Jeffries can see is visually distinct and looks like a real lived in place, and each of their inhabitants seem to have full lives despite only having small glimpses into them. There seems to be a whole other set of movies playing for Jeffries outside his window, Miss Lonelyhearts's hopeless quest for a companion, the newlyweds' transition from the honeymoon phase to the nagging relationship of a long married couple, or the songwriter's fight to get his music produced. Each of these small cursory stories is still told with such elegance and technique on the periphery of the main story that it feels as tho Jeffries could have found interest in watching any one of the windows, not just the one hiding a murder. It's quite an accomplishment that in its 2hr run time Hitchcock managed to build a completely believable little world to tell his story in. <br/><br/>On top of all the masterful film making the acting within Rear Window is extraordinarily good. James Stewart's plays Jeffries with such subtlety and depth, especially all the wordless reaction shots in which he seems to say more with just a raised eyebrow or furrowed brow than lesser actors would with a monoloque. On top of this Grace Kelly bring a great performance to the table as well, playing Lisa with elegance that gives way to a childlike recklessness and eagerness once she becomes invested in the mystery. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey bring a lot to the stage with their supporting performances as well. Even the actors who pay the neighbors, rarely getting a word of dialogue or any real character development still give off the sense of being fully realized real people incredibly well. <br/><br/>All in all Rear Window is a masterpiece of a movie that combined the immaculate filmmaking of Hitchcock with a truly captivating plot all centered around an incredibly well thought out and executed gimmick. Who ever thought that a rear apartment window could be all you needed for such a great film?"

"MovieAddict2016","10","15","30","5 August 2004"," One of my all-time favorites that could justifiably be named Hitchcock's second best (with PSYCHO being number one).
","For most of its duration, not a single shot in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" takes place outside the small, lonely apartment of L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart). Every exterior pan originates through the eyes of the injured photographer, whose broken leg has him restrained to a wheelchair, living off of the meals of his caretaker, Stella (Thelma Ritter).<br/><br/>When his fiancée, Lisa (Grace Kelly), stands outside the window, we see her  but we're still in the room. The camera does not position itself on the sidewalk, or above the flowerbed next to her, or in the window of another room  it stays put.<br/><br/>What Hitchcock does here is nothing short of brilliant  the movie turns us into unconscious voyeurs as we are forced to take on the perspective of the protagonist, and participate in his constant eavesdropping.<br/><br/>This technique of isolation and confinement forms a sort of disturbing effect that smothers the viewer on a subconscious level  we can feel it, but can't necessarily put a finger on what, exactly, it is.<br/><br/>The movie is also particularly risqué for its time  50 years later it's the sort of film that would probably receive a PG rating (and, in fact, after being restored and re-released in 2000, it did). There is no foul language, no sex, no nudity, no violence (per se), and no drug content. But there are many insinuations  e.g. the mental image Hitchcock forms in his viewers' minds, of the man next door murdering his wife; the innuendo involving Lisa's overnight stay at Jeffries' (and her dress that sparks the interest of a private detective); the newlywed couple next door (""No comment,"" Jeffries tells Lisa); Miss Torso, the ballerina who lives across the street and the amount of time Jeffries spends watching her dance and change out of clothes. <br/><br/>Jeffries has injured his leg after trying to take a daring photograph -- now he doesn't have a television or any other means of entertainment, so he amuses himself by studying the lives of others. Sound familiar? With ""Reality TV"" shows such as ""Survivor,"" ""Big Brother"" and ""Fear Factor,"" America's growing fascination with voyeuristic programming is becoming rather startling. Although the 1987 action picture ""The Running Man"" (and its source manuscript by Stephen King) is often credited with accurately depicting this odd form of entertainment, ""Rear Window""  to a certain degree  predicted it much earlier. 34 years earlier, to be exact.<br/><br/>One night while studying the rooms across the street, Jeffries notices a strange man carrying a briefcase in and out of a darkened room. The man's disabled wife (who demands his constant care) is nowhere to be seen. The next day, she is gone, apparently on a train; but Jeffries notices Thorvald (Raymond Burr), the mysterious man, cleaning a sharp knife in the kitchen sink.<br/><br/>Could he have committed murder? Jeffries believes so, and convinces Lisa and Stella, too. They begin to piece together a number of clues  a disheveled flower bed, a purse, fake letters  that lead to one conclusion: Murder. The problem is that no one else believes them.<br/><br/>A movie such as ""Rear Window"" would never work nowadays. The main character would entertain himself with technology  not voyeurism. The windows would not be left open for fear of burglary. Police would be more willing to believe such a ""far-fetched"" story, and the private detective probably wouldn't shrug off Jeffries like he does in the film.<br/><br/>This is evidenced by the poor remake starring Christopher Reeves, made for television  it didn't make any sense because it was set in this day and age, featuring an outdated concept. It almost seemed silly, and was vastly inferior.<br/><br/>But it works in the 1950s, and as a film, ""Rear Window' still holds up beautifully today  despite its dated premise (or, at least, execution), the other elements of the story keep it interesting. We are willing to suspend our disbelief because it is so great. And because ""back then"" the story's progression seems more natural than it ever would today.<br/><br/>The performances are flawless  James Stewart is completely convincing as Jeffries, a man controlled by his own impulses. Likewise Hitchcock's typical blonde love interest, Grace Kelly, is marvelous  beautiful and likable, willing to do anything for Jeffries, which includes breaking into Thorvald's room while he's out and about (which results in one of the most nerve-jangling suspense sequences of all time). And Raymond Burr is utterly petrifying as Thorvald, who is almost always seen from a distance, with his odd white hair and continually narrowed eyes that just scream murder.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is often considered by most critics to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece. For my money, ""Psycho"" (1960) is his best  but ""Rear Window"" may very well be number two. With a career comprised of some truly amazing motion pictures (""The 39 Steps,"" ""The Lady Vanishes,"" ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" ""Strangers on a Train,"" ""Vertigo,"" etc.), it will always be hard to choose Hitchcock's ""best"" movie  but in terms of narrative, and film-making, and acting, ""Rear Window"" could justifiably be called one of his all-time greatest. And, all considered, that's not a compliment to be taken very lightly."

","I love Hitchcocks' movies--he was undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our time--but what's the big deal about this movie.  It's well-directed (obviously) and the acting is good, but the story is predictable, the dialogue dull (except for a few of Thelma Ritter's wisecracks) and it's just plain boring!  Also I can't seriously accept the fact that someone as beautiful and classy as Grace Kelly would fall in love with Stewart.  He's old enough to be her father!  So, I don't see why everybody loves this film, and I consider it one of Hitchcocks' lesser works."

","Hitchcock buffs often point out that his serious movies are laced with laughs and this one has a terrific laugh toward the end. Murder suspect Raymond Burr has been lured out of his apartment in order that Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter can dig up the flowerbed. Frustrated to find nothing Kelly enters his apartment in search of evidence. Stewart, watching from across the courtyard, sees Burr returning and unable to warn Kelly rings the police - after first looking up the number - explains that a man is assaulting a woman (not true, though he IS about to) and - wait for it - the police ARRIVE inside five minutes. I mean is this funny or not. I seem to be saying the same thing over and over; namely that Hitchcock is vastly overrated. Why then do I watch his films. Well you might ask. The short answer is that I know a lot of people, some of them are even friends, who have, in my opinion, fallen for the hype, because by now the myth is self-perpetuating, and keep pressing dvds on me in the hope of converting me. They're something akin to those well-meaning folks who can't see an unattached person without attempted matchmaking. So far I'm holding out. Whilst I acknowledge a competent filmmaker that's as far as it goes. On the other hand any director would have his work cut out to coax even a mediocre, let alone a bad performance out of Jimmy Stewart just as any director would have his work cut out to elicit anything resembling acting from Grace Kelly. So now we have a stand-off. On the plus side we have Thelma Ritter, who enhances anything she appears in but then he spoils it again by casting ex-Forestry Commission employee Wendell Corey. Not as bad as To Catch A Thief but then what is."

","While the predictable plot, agonizingly slow pace, and excessive dialog weighed heavily against this so-called ""classic"", apparently Hitchcock was feeding the baseless flames of McCarthyism with this film. I bet a million housewives left the film thinking ""I bet I'm right about my neighbor..."" or ""as a good citizen, I should keep an eye on mine"". Blatantly, Hitchcock was glorifying voyeurism and exploiting contemporary fears.<br/><br/>The only reason I can figure why this movie has such extremely high ratings is that people are (still) really afraid of what their neighbors might be up to (greatly renewed post-9/11), are proud voyeurs themselves, or are simply lobotomized."

Photographer James Stewart, laid up with a broken leg, gets to know the neighbors in his housing complex--by watching them all day out his back window (it's a sticky hot summer and everyone has their lashes up). This Alfred Hitchcock thriller gets off on the wrong foot by introducing Stewart's love-interest, Grace Kelly, rather clumsily. Kelly is supposed to look out of place in Stewart's rumpled apartment, with her designer dresses and Park Ave. manner, and we're meant to see that they are possibly an inappropriate match; however, Kelly's character wounds too easily, and the argument that ensues between she and Stewart isn't convincing. Luckily, she's allowed to warm up soon after, and she's wonderful when teamed with Thelma Ritter as Stewart's sharp little nursemaid. Ritter, in one of her best roles, keeps score on all that's going on and soon all three are involved in some mysterious doings happening across the courtyard. Dandy yarn has one of the most satisfying wrap-ups for a Hitchcock picture, and three fine actors who really get into these roles.

"upquist","5","6","10","21 December 2014"," Disenchanted with Hitchcock
","I watched ""Rear Window"" again last night. Seeing it again only serves to confirm this growing sense I've had for quite a while. It's the feeling that, actually, for all his innovation, Hitchcock, by today's standards was a sloppy, inattentive, rigid and formulaic director. His movies cause me more annoyance than anything else.<br/><br/>The egregious and prolific cinematic ""goofs"" in this movie are beautifully itemized elsewhere on this site. It was the same sort of embarrassing inattentiveness in ""North by Northwest"", ""The Birds"" and many other Hitchcock movies. He would miss little details from scene to scene which are much less frequent in movies directed by today's top-tier counterparts. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's well-known abhorrence for outdoor shots resulted in the creation of painfully artificial indoor sets - to the point of looking rank amateur. <br/><br/>I'm sure he thought his camera angles at critical moments of his movies contributed to the dramatic intensity of the scene: the camera looking down into the shower in ""Psycho"", the camera looking down again at Stewart as he is approached by Raymond Burr - it gets repeated in several movies. By today's standards, frankly, the shots are rigid, routine, predictable and boring. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's principal actors are interesting which, I suppose, is why he used them again and again. But many of the other relatively minor characters in his movies are wooden, silent, under-developed and under-utilized to the point of being quite dispensable. They are nothing more than interchangeable props: the two thugs in ""North by Northwest"" for example or the honeymooners in ""Rear Window"" illustrate my point. <br/><br/>Nope, I've made-up my mind on this: compared to a Spielberg or Ron Howard, Hitchcock, for all of the praise he has received comes across to me as a so-so director who really didn't have the eye for detail and precision required of directors today and expected by their more technically sophisticated audiences."
"PudgyPandaMan","8","6","10","8 October 2008"," Classic Hitchcock Suspense!
","I have always been a huge fan of Hitchcok, after 1st seeing Dial M for Murder. Rear Window was probably the 2nd film of his I ever saw. I have since seen it probably 5-7 times and it never fails to keep my interest or cause me to see some new detail I missed before. I think that is the true measure of a Classic or Masterpiece, and this one certainly delivers! There are so many things going on in this movie, but most reviewers have touched on all of these so I won't add to them. But the plot is so superb in its layers of conflict, and studies in personalities of Stewart, Kelly, and all the neighbors. It is probably the best film for observing human nature at its many forms.<br/><br/>I never realized how massive the set was until I dug a little further. They actually constructed the massive building in one sound stage. All the apartments in Burr's building had running water and electricity and could actually be lived in. Talk about realism and going the extra mile - but Hitchcock was all about that. All along I had assumed they had pieced the different scenes together to look like one building. At the time, it was the largest indoor set ever built by Paramount. While some may find the action a little slow as everything is filmed from the viewpoint of Stewart's apartment window, I find it amazing that the movie still creates such tension and suspense in spite of this.<br/><br/>I think it is interesting that Spielberg is facing a lawsuit for his movie Disturbia which claims that it is basically a re-working of Rear Window. Why would anyone even attempt another telling of Hitchcock's perfectly done masterpiece, and especially without permission (even if your last name IS Spielberg)?"
"bob the moo","Null","6","10","28 March 2005"," Classy, gentle excitement with nice subtexts within the enjoyably tense main story
","Jeff Jeffries is an adventure photographer for a major newspaper who, thanks to an attempt to get an action shot during a motor race, has found himself in a plaster cast spending his days and nights in a wheelchair. His only visitors are his carer Stella and his beautiful, but pressurising girlfriend Lisa and the majority of his time is spend staring out the window into the courtyard area of his apartment complex. It is during one typically hot night that he spots something funny going on inside one of the apartments opposite his  the woman of the house seems to be gone and the man is acting suspiciously; from the confines of his chair, Jeff keeps watch, with the case becoming increasingly clear to him and his friends.<br/><br/>Despite having themes in common with many Hitchcock films, this stands out as being one of a couple of his movies that are accessible and entertaining to a wider audience. Using voyeurism as its central theme, the film takes us into a fairly straightforward mystery that is well told but also laced with subtexts and other windows to stare through. To me this makes it a better film because there is much that intrigued me about the characters and the neighbourhood while also providing me with an engaging mystery. Modern audiences who have seen this film copied and referenced countless times will doubtless struggle to see what the fuss is about and perhaps they are right as the story doesn't have the twists and turns that are considered the norm now in a lot of thrillers; but it is still strong enough to keep the interest. The voyeuristic nature of the characters is interesting  with them changing throughout the film; meanwhile the many lives on display in the other flats provide other things to be interested in as well.<br/><br/>Of course a massive part of it working is the cast. Stewart plays his usual ""aw-shucks"" personae to good effect but crosses it with a certain lack of ethnics and a less than wholesome character who spends his nights with a young girl who he doesn't want to commit to and an unhealthy habit of staring at his neighbours. Kelly is sexually innocent and seductive with it  unlike Hitchcock I tend to find blonde princesses all a bit dull and obvious but she worked here. Stealing most of her scenes is sterling support from Thelma Ritter, not that different a performance from some of her others but still very well timed and blessed with some really great lines. Burr is rather stiff but at a distance it doesn't really matter and he does well enough. The various other neighbours each works well with their mini-stories that barely exist within the film but do add to the layered effect of the film.<br/><br/>Overall the film is classy and the rich colours and ordinary setting are nicely in contrast with the action of all the main characters. The mystery is well delivered and engages in a gently dramatic fashion while the starry cast are impressive and interesting throughout. For my money not as pound-for-pound entertaining as North by Northwest but still one of Hitchcock's more widely accessible films if not quite one of his best."

","Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt the king of suspense. I have been a fan of his for many years, so I knew I had to see this movie. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS ********<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart is great as LB Jefferies, the cranky photographer who's wheelchair bound in his apartment with a broken leg. To pass the time, he begins playing Peeping Tom on his neighbors. Good thing there are some interesting characters around. There's the gorgeous ballerina, who loves prancing around in her undergarments, the party hardy pianist, the couple that sleeps on their fire escape (I love when it rains on them) and the volatile salesman with a bed stricken wife. Things get even more interesting when Jefferies starts to think the salesman has murdered his wife. He's going in and out of his place on a cold, rainy night, and the wife is no longer in bed, where did she go? <br/><br/>Jefferies asks for the assistance of friend and former Air Force buddy Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey), who unfortunately, thinks he's crazy. Not to worry. Even though he won't fully commit to her, Jefferies is able to enlist his beautiful, sociable, and all around perfect girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) to do his dirty work. Being the fearless type, she's willing to take more risks than Jefferies imagines, a move that almost gets her killed and lands her in jail. Of course, Jefferies soon puts his own life at risk, which leads to the one action sequence in the movie (which is kind of cheesy and dated).<br/><br/>One thing that was unique about Rear Window is that the whole film was shot in the same location, from Stewart's apartment. Hitchcock, not only good with suspense, is also able to do some fascinating camera work. Those shots of Stewart holding his camera are innovative and show how talented he was. I have to say, I don't think movies like this could be made anymore, for it isn't action packed. The mood slowly builds up until you have the final confrontation. No high speed chases, explosions, anything of that nature, just old fashioned suspense. The acting by Stewart and Kelly is wonderful and they had a great on screen relationship, even if Stewart's character is oblivious to the idea of love (how could you be if you had a woman like Grace Kelly)?<br/><br/>If you're a person that loves blood and guts, plot twists, fast paced action, then do not see this movie. Many from Generation X and Y (which I am a part of) would be bored by this flick, but if you appreciate good film making and suspense, go see it, and you'll understand why Hitchcock gets so many accolades to this very day."
"cariart","Null","6","10","16 August 2003"," Hitchcock's Classy Voyeurism Thriller...
","One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and respect to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive! 'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is arguably the most fun to watch, because of the appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>Stewart is a photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on his neighbors through binoculars. Virtuous Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away with this!<br/><br/>Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it, particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career).<br/><br/>The film takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart (""Previews of Coming Attractions"", she purrs). All this leads up to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist ending that is pure Hitchcock magic. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen 'Rear Window', run, do not walk to your video store, and rent it! You'll quickly discover why it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular films!"
"HenryHextonEsq","10","6","10","5 February 2001"," An original, intruiging work... brilliantly cinematic
","Yes, Rear Window is probably the film that has finally made me accept Hitchcock's genius. I loved ""Vertigo"", appreciated ""Psycho"", was irritated by ""Spellbound"", was partial to ""Strangers on a Train"", was intruiged by ""The Wrong Man"" and fairly enjoyed ""North By Northwest""... ""Rear Window"" is probably his finest work that I have yet seen... open, as it is, to many, varied interpretations.<br/><br/>While ""Vertigo"" had a more domineering score, photography and general artifice, ""Rear Window"" has a greater impact for me. While ""Vertigo"" was gripping, this one was positively electrifying in that department. The fact that Hitchcock managed such a multi-faceted, intruiging effort with the original conceit he adopted - to make a film from one set, and one single vantage-point - is astounding. I've not heard of the novel it was based on, but this is one hell of a script. All of the characters, and that's partially including the ones viewed by Stewart's L.B. Jeffries, are fully fleshed out and flawed. I found Thelma Ritter's performance amusing, and believable, providing the Bel Geddes (in ""Vertigo"")-type role early on, and then developing interestingly. Grace Kelly's Lisa is a fascinating character, more than you'd initially suspect. Undeniably beautiful, but also frustrated, passionate, devious and desperate in equal part. While Jeffries, or perhaps his accident (a typically important little detail that Hitchcock uses brilliantly, like Stewart's vertigo in ""Vertigo""), starts the whole voyeuristic business, Ritter and to an interesting extent, Kelly collaborate with his fancies. Stewart's role is a great one, that of a deeply flawed, and disturbingly obsessed voyeur. It is sure that, at least with the films he made for Hitchcock, Stewart fulfilled all of his promise as an actor. From the wonderfully casual early scenes, to his gradual obsession with a particular house, his acting is brilliant in conveying the character's less-than-positive traits. It seems absurd at first that he be resistive at all to Kelly, but gradually their relationship is made complex, with perhaps Kelly's motivations in the film's later stages intruiging to consider, if she is or not as ""perfect"" as Stewart earlier claims. There is twist after twist in characterisation, theme and plot, with the final 15 minutes particularly striking in this regard. The conclusion is brilliantly ironic. Audience expectation and sympathies are toyed with exceptionally by Hitchcock at every turn. The themes are manifold, with voyeurism the guiding one. Themes are linked with character, and are effectively tackled; Wendell Corey's character pretty much emphasising the voyeuristic theme with a pertinent quote that I can't exactly recall. <br/><br/>The direction is superb, as you would expect from Hitchcock (its his fascinating, complex use of narrative, character and theme that eleveates this work above so many of his other films), engendering many different moods, but none untainted by corruption in some way. The photography is impressive, giving the restricting settings a pungeancy. Hitchcock and his photographers always tending, at least with ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"", to capture colour in a more vivid, expressive and importantly, atmospheric light than most in the history of colour film. Perhaps pivotal in my view is the brilliant use of music, distant, from the houses Stewart spies on, especially the haunting piano tunes (referred to yearningly by Kelly's character) from one home. This adds contrast and depth to many scenes, both within and without of Stewart's flat.<br/><br/>It seems a waste that there are so few films that try, and succeed, in capturing this film's mood and devices. In many ways, I felt David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" to capture some of its suspenseful brilliance. Terence Young's 1967 film, ""Wait Until Dark"" was very nearly as tense and exciting, and also well worth checking out if you love ""Rear Window"". No doubts are there, that ""Rear Window"" is one of the ""classics"" more than deserving of its status. Rating:- *****/*****"

","I saw this last night on AMC and was blown away by the plot, the characterization, the setting, and of course, the suspense. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, some of my favorites being ""North by Northwest,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Lifeboat,"" and now this. <br/><br/>L.B. Jefferies, known as Jeff by his friends, is wheelchair-bound in his Manhattan apartment, dealing with a broken leg. With nothing else to do but look out the window, he takes to watching the lives of his neighbors around the center courtyard: the struggling musician, Miss Torso, the dancer, the eccentric couple with the curious dog, the newlyweds, Miss Lonelyheart, and of course, the Thorwalds, right across the way. Lars Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife become Jeff's focal characters to observe...until Mrs. Thorwald disappears, and Lars becomes progressively suspicious. He quickly involves his uptown girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) who opts to do some investigation, and then involves his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Helpless in his apartment, he works through them and the moderate help from his friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), a detective. Questions continue to arise, and Jeff, Lisa, Stella, and Doyle seem to be coming to a conclusion. Yet, this is Hitchcock, and our team of protagonists aren't close to just solving the case and moving on. Oh no, the last twenty minutes or so prove to unbearably suspenseful as Lisa investigates the Thornwald's apartment while it's unoccupied, and Jeff and Stella watch helplessly as Lars comes home....<br/><br/>This truly is an amazing film. James Stewart and Grace Kelly give amazing performances, and Thelma Ritter is wonderful as the witty nurse. The vignettes on the lives of each of Jeff's neighbors are all quite interesting, and I found Miss Lonelyheart's story in particular to be absolutely wonderful. I also loved how Jeff was helpless, while the two women were off doing what one would think to be the man's role in the movie. Lisa, particular, is quite an innovative character. First of all, she's very funny. I love when Jeff is telling her the rough aspects of a traveling photographers life, and how when he asks her something in the way if she had ever been 5000 feet up, struggling to stay warm in twenty below zero weather, and she replies, ""Well, when I get a few minutes after lunch...."" She also takes that role of the elegant uptown girl and admits her sophistication and perfection, like when Jeff comments on how she never wears the same dress twice, and Lisa notes light-heartedly, ""Only because it's expected of her [me]."" And then, when she takes all those risks to uncover the truth in the end. Not only could I not sit still, I was so scared (which is rare for me with most horror movies) but I was amazed at how she proved that she wasn't afraid to risk anything. Now, that's one hell of a heroine, and perhaps the greatest Hitchcock woman ever.<br/><br/>I also loved Stella. She had some of the greatest lines in the movie, and I love when she's commenting to Lisa and Jeff on the probable gory details of Lars's act. She was definitely memorable with all her witty lines, and had me laughing many times.<br/><br/>And of course, James Stewart gave a great performance, conveying that feeling of helplessness, and near claustrophobia being in that apartment, unable to do anything, and just as he's safe in his apartment watching everyone, he goes through hell trying to figure out what to do when Lars comes home while Lisa is still at his apartment. <br/><br/>The movie is enthralling from the amazing opening to the wonderful epilogue, and the title music totally sets the scene for some fun. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is an amazing film."

","It's a sad fact that when one watches a lot of old classic movies they come away slightly dissatisfied, either because aspects of the film haven't aged well, or because the movie has since been copied so many times that you can recite the plot in your sleep.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is one of few filmmakers from the Golden Age of Hollywood to whom this does not apply. His films simply do not seem to age. Sure, if you want to be picky you can probably find little things that no longer seem realistic, but the thing is that his movies are so overwhelmingly involving that you don't tend to notice or want to engage in such nitpicking.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is one of his masterpieces, and he made a few. It is extraordinary to me how many movies attempt to be suspenseful, and aren't. Hitchcock was called ""The Master"" for a reason. He was a master: of stage direction, sets, dialogue, subtle use of close-up, and, perhaps above all, of suspense.<br/><br/>You probably already know what ""Rear Window"" is about, even if you haven't seen it. The Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart, certainly one of the greatest actors the silver screen ever held, stars as a photojournalist who is laid out with a broken leg and spies on his neighbours across from him to pass the time. He comes to believe that one of his neighbours has murdered his wife, and at first his naive girlfriend and nurse don't believe him, but then they come around and become involved in the theory as well, to their own peril.<br/><br/>It is, simply put, a masterpiece. In this day and age, the device of a movie that never leaves a room would be an advertising gimmick to draw in customers. Here, you don't even notice it - it's a surprise to realise you never left Stewart's side. And it's climax is more than just suspenseful - it's almost unbearable.<br/><br/>If you are a film lover, you owe it to yourself to watch ""Rear Window""."
"axg-83361","10","3","4","14 February 2018"," A Review on Rear Window
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, features a shocking neighborhood murder, only to be uncovered by a peeping wheelchair-bound photographer, L.B Jefferies, and his cover girl girlfriend Lisa Fremont. How we know such details from each character is due to Hitchcock's panning and fantastic sense of mise en scène. At the opening of the film, what is first seen is the window the main character L.B. Jefferies spends his days looking out of. From there, the camera's motion moves as if it were to float about the neighborhood, catching the neighbors, sleeping Jefferies, his shattered camera and a magazine with his girlfriend on it. Without getting too into it, Hitchcock had already planted important information into the viewer's mind without having to achieve the same thing through an extensive amount of dialogue. Very aware of what and how people and objects are placed, he knew precisely what he was doing. 
One of the first things the viewer learns about the photographer is that he seems unhappy to be in a relationship with a 'perfect woman', he finds him and Lisa to be incompatible due the fact that the two come from different worlds. Each neighbor featured in a way relates to Jeffries's relationship situation or relationships in general. For example, there was a moment where the shot was focused on Miss Lonelyhearts raising her glass to nobody, and Jefferies did the same. This could because 
Not to mention the most obvious aspect of the film, the one vantage point. Hitchcock creatively chose to limit the motion of the camera to the motion of the main character. Doing this, it is impressive how he envisioned and conveyed what he wanted using other camera techniques. For example, he used close ups on several neighbors to shift the focus onto them. In addition, there were several closeups of both Jeffries and Lisa individually and together. The proximity in these shots along with the eye leveled position of the camera play a role in how intimate the viewer gets to the character, including their feelings and emotions. This, I believe creates a more intense feeling when suspense is reached towards the end of the film.
The use of light is also intriguing. Its symbol of clarity and when not present, obscurity. Having this in mind, it is important to mention that whenever the characters had to hide from the gaze of Mr.Thorwald, they would retreat into the darkness. In addition, whenever Lisa came over to talk to Jeffries about the potential murder, she would turn the lights on, begging for him to stop scaring her and talking nonsense. However, when she began to believe him, she stood in the darkness alongside him. Lights were also turned off when Mr. Thorwald found Lisa with his wife's jewelry, right before he attacked her. Not to mention that light was also used to fend away the big angry Thorwald from strangling Jefferies sooner. Besides that, where the film stands in the beginning, is drastically different to what it becomes later in the film. A man with relationship problems quickly turns to a gang attempting to catch a neighborhood murderer. However, this change is not remotely noticed, which makes it important to note. 
The suspense portrayed was incredible. The unsafe and dangerous measures that Lisa went through to invade the Thorwald apartment was only the beginning of a very hair-raising, intense ending. There were very sudden moments in between cuts where Lisa would be shown and the terrifying responses from Jefferies and Stella would also be shown right after. Meaning that there were moments where we couldn't see when Thorwald was coming or not. The film was an overall great thriller to experience."

","My years-long quest to see everything Alfred Hitchcock has ever made finally lead me, albeit far too late, to Rear Window. Hitchcock's 1954 feature starring Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly has been revered and countlessly referenced in the 62 years since its release. The film in which a wheelchair bound photographer with nothing better to do than look out the window of his New York apartment at his various neighbors becomes convinced that one of them has committed a murder. Bringing together a brilliant display of the various lives that make up a neighborhood and how each human effects the other, Rear Window was a long overdue treat.<br/><br/>After injuring himself on a photo shoot, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is wheelchair-bound with a broken leg. Since Jeff is single, for the most part abhorring the idea of marriage, the only interaction he enjoys throughout his long days are the visits of his caretaker, an occasional guest, and his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). In order to help the time pass as he recovers, Jeff has taken a liking to watching his neighbors from his large apartment window. Living varied lives, each with their own schedules and idiosyncrasies, Jeff becomes entranced learning more about their lives behind his binoculars. Among his watching, Jeff notices a traveling salesman with a bed-ridden wife at home. He watches him take care of his wife and begins to learn his schedule. One day, Jeff notices that salesman's wife has disappeared and his schedule has drastically changed. The collection of oddities has Jeff convinced that his neighbor has killed his wife. Jeff is so convinced that he shares this belief with his girlfriend and caretaker, who initially dismiss him, then go on to help him. With no proof, the threesome hatches a plan to implicate the neighbor with murder by entering his apartment, even if it costs them their lives.<br/><br/>Now I understand why I like the film Disturbia so much. I saw the 2007 version of Rear Window first, and was stunned that I liked it so much, being as I am no fan of Shia LaBeouf's; after seeing Rear Window, however, I can appreciate my liking of Disturbia more as it is basically a remake of the Hitchcock classic. I was initially disappointed to see that Rear Window was a color film, for some reason I thought I remembered that it was in black and white, but I got over it quickly when I first saw Jimmy Stewart; really, is he in anything that's not completely splendid? I really enjoy watching films by British directors, as I love the emphasis on dialogue within the films. Rear Window, had a wonderful emphasis on dialogue and the three principles delivered the lines quite well. There was a great deal of fun effects throughout this film, including the fun way Hitch filmed through the lenses of Jeff's camera and binoculars. Rear Window is a fantastic example of a distinction Hitch himself was sure to make; he made suspense pictures, not mysteries. It really doesn't matter to the film whether or not the man actually killed his wife, what is paramount, however, is the quest endured by the actors to find out whether or not Jeff's neighbor is a murderer. Another gripping suspense from the ultimate master in the genre, it is easy to see why Rear Window is the classic it has become."
"erikegelkraut","9","3","4","3 October 2016"," Excellent Cinematography
","Throughout the film, the director gives excellent shots to portray the characters emotions through visual means rather than speaking it aloud. As well as this you get a glimpse into several people whose homes are arranged behind his. Actor James Stewart gives a compelling performance as well. Showing both emotion and feeling through his being stuck in a cast and missing out on his normal adventurous lifestyle.<br/><br/>While some scenes lack in interest and absurdly long focus on the dancer whose main character choice is bending over, this does show how his inability to live how he enjoys puts him in a state of boredom and often lust for the outdoors, and of course companionship. <br/><br/>That paired with a script that is fit perfectly to the theme I'd say this film is worth the watch for any movie lover. I give Rear Window a nine out of ten rating."
"Sophoclaw","5","3","4","26 July 2015"," It didn't work for me, the suspense was missing.
","I am aware that many people like this film a lot, and after many years it has indeed become a classic, and that's why I saw it for the first time yesterday. And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is: that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better: guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbour killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of the crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him!?. But I have to admit, typically Hitchcock, delivers a proffesional job because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are absolutely right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy almost before the film has started. And I intuitively guessed it and killed all the suspense. I liked ""Vertigo"" even if some scenes are a little bit slow and long and I liked ""Psycho"", that's a masterpiece. But ""Rear Window"" it's too obvious."
"schappe1","10","4","6","10 February 2019"," A World of Its Own
","It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABUTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched. The result is not just Hitchcock's greatest film but one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>The marvelous detail of this film is just amazing. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are legends of the cinema and Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are actor's actors. But the real star is the set, a world unto itself. And the photography of that set, all that was needed to allow us to see into the rooms clearly- it's amazing stuff, (the lighting needed was so hot it set off the sprinkler system). But even better than that is the sound. It's not all just flat on the soundtrack, like actors in a dubbing session. Like good radio drama, it recognizes that people who are some distance away sound different. The voices coming from across the courtyard are just perfectly done and do more than even the camerawork to ""put you there"".<br/><br/>The musical score for this film is not a film score at all- it's the music of these people, also heard across the courtyard. We hear the composer composing his song. We don't hear him doing it in five minutes, as we have heard in all the musicals. Instead it evolves over time. The dramatic piano cords he plays underscore the drama to come. We also hear some opera music that does the same. Everyone seems to have their own music-everyone except Thorwald, the murderer. And what a brilliant touch it is to make the murder a pathetic man, instead of some brilliant mastermind. In the end, he is one of us, as well, in a twisted way.<br/><br/>I can't think of another movie that creates a world so vivid for the audience to live in. ROPE was strictly about the action in the apartment. The view out the window is just a painted backdrop. Maybe a better comparison could me made to DEAD END, but as good as that film it's not really the same. Our perspective changes too much. Perhaps my favorite scene in REAR WINDOW is the one moment, (seconds, really), the perspective does change. It's when Jeffries is struggling with Thorwald and everyone in the apartment house looks in the direction of his apartment for a change. Now there's a twist!"
"coleboggan","10","4","6","13 February 2018"," The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen
","I think that Alfred Hitchcock's rear window is a fantastic movie. I'd go as far as to say that it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There are a few main aspects of the film that I would like to point out that sold me on this wonderful film: the framing and filming techniques, suspense building, and pacing of the film were all perfect, and made for an interesting, thrilling, and over-all exciting display of some of theater's finest filming techniques that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.
 First, the framing of the film was excellent. Upon first hearing the premise, that the entire movie takes place from one man's room, you might be hesitant. Such a boring, consistent setting couldn't possibly make for an interesting film. But within the first few minutes of starting, you find very quickly that these first impressions were very wrong. The film manages to build a complex, active, and very real world using just the room of main character, photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, and the view from his window. By cutting from shots of his apartment to the surrounding complex outside, the movie manages to make you think there's more to this film than just Jeff's living room. On top of this, the framing techniques used keep the film exciting. To start, you never see more than Jeff can through his window; this allows you to really connect with the characters, and theorize about the events going on at the same time as they do. We'll talk more about this under pacing, but the film always gives you just enough information to make you wonder what's really going on. Using what's not shown in frame as much as what is, Hitchcock manages to keep you glued to the screen throughout the movie.
 This lasting interest is brought about just as much through the pacing and suspense of the film. While Jeff is looking out his window one day, he notices some suspicious behavior from one of his neighbors, and begins to think he has witnessed a murder. As the film continues, the evidence of this is given to you in bits and pieces. You only see half the story, and half to piece the puzzle together yourself, along with the main characters, who slowly start to believe Jeff's theories about his neighbor's actions. However, with every bit of evidence towards the crime, Jeff's detective friend strikes it down with a completely logical explanation, leading Jeff, and the audience along with him, to believe that he might be delusional. Every plot point in the film is spaced beautifully, so that every time you think you've figured it out, some new idea or suspicious act comes up and throws you completely off. As Jeff slowly convinces more people that he's witnessed a murder, there are always others who outright deny his ideas.
 Another point related to pacing is the building of suspense. The movie manages to subtly build suspense as the movie progresses, resulting in a thrilling conclusion. One method it uses to do this is by confining our hero. Due to an accident at a race track, Jeff is confined to the wheelchair in his room with a broken leg. He is unable to leave his room, which is what results in him watching his neighbors through his rear window. The suspense continues to build as he watches helplessly as the events before him unfold. There's nothing he can do but watch it happen and try to make a convincing argument. 
 With all of these filming concepts combined, Alfred Hitchcock was able to produce one of the best thrillers of all time, certainly the best I've ever seen. It was intense, interesting, and kept me theorizing until the last second. With a great cast and exceptional production value, I would easily recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic with an exciting plot and interesting premise that will keep you engaged and entertained."
"prasad-mapatuna","5","10","20","23 November 2009"," Quite puzzled as to how it got in to IMDb top 20
","This movie being in IMDb top 20 puzzles me somewhat. I have seen most of the IMDb top 20 movies and they lived up to my expectations or exceeded expectations apart from perhaps The Dark Knight, Star Wars, and Lord of the ring. Those movies are up there understandably due the votes of the huge fan base. But how did Rear Window got up there? Due to the fan base of Hitchcock? Probably... and may be also due to the fact this is a pioneering movie of its genre. I can try and agree with reasons given by reviewers who has given very high rating for this movie. However, the whole package is bit disappointing, specially when you put this movie in current context. I cannot agree that this is a timeless classic. Anyway, you have to put my rating of 5 in context as well. I am rating it for the entertainment value forgetting about the fact that Hitchcock did this movie in 1954 and he was a pioneer of the genre."
"drebin73","10","7","13","22 February 2006"," Hitchcocks Best, Cinemas Best
","This is the greatest movie of all time. I believe that Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest actors ever and that Grace Kelly is one of the best actresses of the era. Rear Window takes place in a small apartment complex in the village. Jimmy Stewart plays famous photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies who after an accident is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. He has nothing to do but stare out of the window and look at the neighbors. He plays this role very well. When Jeff thinks he has witnessed a murder from the apartment across the way he gets help from his high society girl friend Lisa played by Grace Kelly and his comical nurse Stella played by Thelma Ritter and his detective friend Lt. Doyle played by Wendell Corey. When you carefully watch the movie you can see that there is a great amount of humor throughout the whole film as well as a whole crap-load of suspense. Thelma Ritter is the more obvious comic relief of the film with funny one liners: "" When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway. "" One thing that this movie tackles is the subject of voyeurism the act of watching someone without there knowledge and not for sexual gratification. This is what most movies are anyway, we are in a way spying on the people in the movie and become interested in their lives.This movie just focuses on it specifically. One thing that it is interesting is how the camera never leaves Jeff's apartment. We can see conversations between the neighbors but we can not hear what they are saying so we have to figure out what is going on by their body language. The whole movie is a bunch of reaction shots from Stewart. Jeff sees something, then we see him react to it. Another thing in this movie is the relation ship between Jeff and Lisa ""Jeff: She wants me to marry her. Stella: That's normal. Jeff: I don't want to. Stella: That's abnormal."" Jeff feels that her lifestyle would not be the kind that she would want to be apart of seeing that he travels all over the world to photograph things like war and other things of that nature"" Raymond Burr stars as the suspected murderer Lars Thorwald. This movie is the greatest movie and I can't do it justice by telling you about it like this. This one just needs to be seen by everybody. 11 out of 10"
"bkoganbing","9","7","13","30 December 2005"," Enforced Idleness
","Alfred Hitchcock's second film with James Stewart is the story of Stewart's enforced idleness due to a broken leg. He's an active man, a news photographer, who constantly pushes himself into dangerous situations to get a picture and got a broken leg incidentally. Idleness for him is sure torture.<br/><br/>Fortunately or unfortunately as things turn out he has a Greenwich Village apartment with a Rear Window that allows him to look on the neighbors across the courtyard. It's like watching about 15 different soap operas at once. And with his photographic equipment including a zoom telephoto lens, Stewart gets himself involved with the various soap opera plots.<br/><br/>Stewart also has a girl friend in Grace Kelly who is playing a part that is really no stretch for her, a Park Avenue chic and rich woman who's really had quite a life of comfort. Stewart doesn't think she's ready for his kind of life and they have a running quarrel.<br/><br/>That is until Stewart puts some conclusions together from observing one of the apartments and he thinks that salesman Raymond Burr has killed his wife. Although he can't convince his detective friend Wendell Corey, he does slowly convince Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter his nurse of the validity of his conclusions.<br/><br/>Everyone here does a creditable job, but I think the best performance comes from Raymond Burr. Burr, who played a lot of villains on the screen, usually plays them tough and mean. Hitchcock did a superb job in getting a performance of a really frightened man. Seeing the story of Burr and his wife through Stewart's eyes, it's the story of two very ordinary people apparently mismatched. Up until the last 15 minutes of Rear Window, we see Burr at a distance like the rest of Stewart's soap operas. When we do see him up close we find a very ordinary, but frightened man. It's his very ordinariness that makes Burr so frightening. The audience sees themselves in him, could we commit murder if sufficiently pushed hard enough?<br/><br/>I suppose if James Stewart had a broken leg in 2005 and was laid up that way, he'd be busy on his personal computer and wouldn't have time to be looking across the courtyard. Televisions were still a luxury item in 2005. My grandparents still didn't have one at that date. Today Stewart could get all the afternoon soap opera action he wanted.<br/><br/>A remake of Rear Window was done in 1998 with Christopher Reeve. Of course the difference is that Reeve was a paraplegic and dealing with a real and permanent situation on film and in his life. It was a whole new kind of Rear Window.<br/><br/>Rear Window has all the elements one expects from Hitchcock, thrilling plot, witty and sophisticated dialog and a wry conclusion to it all. A very enjoyable film."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","7","13","20 November 2004"," One of the greatest Hitchcock films, but not his best
","While Psycho is still my favorite Hitchcock film, this comes very, very close to that. Having only seen the made-for-TV remake starring Christopher Reeves, I was quite excited to see this, as it's referred to by many as one of the(if not the) greatest Hitchcock thriller. Now, while I still prefer Psycho over this, I must say that it's a very well-done and effective mystery-thriller, and most of the second half had me almost biting my nails from suspense. The plot is very good, and its theme appeals to some of the most base instincts, including the tiny little voyeur that we all have. The pace is great, I was never bored during any point of the movie. The acting is great, Stewart and Kelly give excellent performances. The characters are all well-written, credible, and, as they almost always are under Hitchcock's direction; very human. The cinematography is excellent; most of the camera angles are from inside the main character's apartment, which creates a very effective and scary feeling of claustrophobia and adds to the suspense. The mystery keeps you guessing throughout the movie, but the ending seemed a little like a letdown... there's no definite answer to the mystery. Then again, maybe that was Hitchcock's intention... to any true mystery, there is no real answer. And Hitchcock probably wanted to have each viewer make up an answer for him- or herself. The film has some great suspense, and a few of the scenes will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The ending was very close to being anticlimactic, but it managed to make up for it by having one of the most thrilling and nail-biting endings in a Hitchcock film ever. The main reason I rate Psycho higher than this on a personal scale is that the theme works better there... the killer is more easily understandable, while here he's just... well, sloppy and arrogant, half of the time. That was my one complaint while watching the movie, and it won't bring down my rating, not even a notch, because I'm positive it was the way Hitchcock intended it to be. His characters are always human, and what is more human than failing? I recommend this film to any fan of thriller, mystery and/or Hitchcock. You won't be disappointed. Great film. 10/10"
"aaronclawrence","6","9","18","27 August 2005"," Technically strong, great performances, but bland story and very weak ending
","I was disappointed with this movie. For reference, I really liked Vertigo which delivered a really interesting story with great characters and direction.<br/><br/>In Rear Window, the characters are well defined and sharply delivered. My only quibble here is that it was virtually impossible to see why Lisa was interested in Jeff (other than some cliché about opposites attracting).<br/><br/>I understand that it was a nice study of various human behaviours and foibles, but that is not enough to make a great movie; it needs a plot, and the plot here was meandering and ultimately clichéd.<br/><br/>I was very entertained for the first half of the movie, especially with the interplay between the two leads; then I got tired of following the increasingly silly murder clues. Unfortunately it finishes with a completely unrealistic and overacted ""confrontation"", with some crude overused visual effects (long before CGI!), and worse, it confirms that the fairly dull and obvious conclusion that was reached very early on was in fact correct.<br/><br/>My reaction at the end was: Oh. Is that it? I wouldn't say the movie is boring, though it is rarely exciting and moves slowly.<br/><br/>I realise I am in the minority of IMDb voters (although oddly there is a little clump of less-than-glowing reviews at the very end of the review list on IMDb). But I do think that those who rate this as near movie perfection are probably over-emphasising Hitchcock's undoubted directorial skills and ignoring weaknesses in the story and delivery."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","10","21","16 September 2008"," Overrated
","Some films show their age, and others do not. Despite its reputation as a classic of great film-making, Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window, unfortunately, shows its age far too much. No, it's certainly not a bad film, by any standard, and is a pretty good one, but it's not one of Hitchcock's best, much less a great film, nor deserving of any place in the Top 100 Films lists of the last few years. Technically, it deserves many plaudits, but what really fails is the screenplay, written originally by John Michael Hayes for a radio play, and adapted from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. Yes, one can suspend disbelief from night till day comes, but the whole idea that a man would murder his wife and cut up her body all in front of an open window is sheerly implausible, even back in the 1950s New York milieu the film takes place in. Even one of the film's characters, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) comments on that fact, but it's not with irony, which only highlights the film's greatest failing- its implausibility.<br/><br/>Now, there are genres where the suspension of disbelief is absolutely essential. For example, one of my favorite films from childhood, the original Planet Of The Apes (1968) requires a great suspension of disbelief, far more so than Rear Window does. After all, the Charlton Heston character, Colonel Taylor, a veteran trained astronaut and scientist, goes throughout the whole film not recognizing the sun and moon, the constellations, the unlikely evolutionary odds that humans and apes could evolve anywhere but Earth, and that the apes speak English, no less! It's not until he sees the wreck of the Statue Of Liberty that he realizes he's back on our world. I was four or five when I first saw the film, and knew it was Earth a minute or two after the astronauts arrived on the Planet Of The Apes. Perhaps too closely studying books on geology and science destroys a youthful ability to suspend disbelief, but the rest of the film was so brilliantly satirical that the implausibilities were minor solecisms. In short, there is no story unless we accept these liberties with common sense, including the fact that the astronauts could be frozen in suspended animation for two eons. It's an all or none proposition- accept, or walk out of the theater. Genres that depend on the implausible- like sci fi and horror, demand such of their audience, and once given it's foolish to quibble over things like time travel, faster than light speed, aliens, modern dinosaurs, ghosts, atomic age mutants, or the like.The plot is well known. While not a great film overall, Rear Window is a technically great film. The camera work by cinematographer Robert Burks is first rate, and the film goes over many standard Hitchcock themes such as voyeurism- especially apt in this cyberworld of 24/7 voyeurism, marriage as a horror, and challenging technical restrictions, as in Lifeboat and Rope. There are many small moments in the film that work for effect- such as pure mise-en-scene shots of Jeff or the neighbors doing minor things unrelated to the main tale. And, there is some comedy, such as after Jeff is tossed out the window, and Thorwald is arrested, Stella comments to the cops, 'I don't want any part of it', when asked about assisting in the search for Anna Thorwald's body. Still, none of the many pluses of the film are enough to lift the film up from a good, solid period piece, for Rear Window's reputation is based largely upon its claim to being a slice of 'realism'. It's not. It's far closer to melodrama with its reliance on coincidences and implausibilities- not to mention the very sexism of the premise that a woman is so predictable that even her murder can be deduced by small deviances from that predictability, to propel the main action along. And melodrama, while it can often be great fun, is almost never great art. Rear Window is vastly overrated, and no exception that proves the rule. It is the rule, and that's a fact no amount of suspended disbelief can alter."

","The night is dark, quiet. But at peace? No. Jimmy Stewart, playing a gritty photographer, sleeps in his wheel-chair, the victim of some car racing accident, the result of his attempting to obtain an extraordinary picture. Now he's fettered by a cast as the result of this daring attempt. A shadow moves over his sleeping body. Is it malevolent? A rival come to enact revenge? Or the grim reaper come to take Stewart's soul? NO! It is none other than the 1950's goddess of cinema, Grace Kelly replete with white gown, scarf and gloves. She moves over the drowsy photographer and plants a kiss on his lips. The shadow is not a monster at all but an angel from Hollywood Heaven. Stewart has died and gone to eternal Paradise where he will love and worship Princess Grace for eternity! But for most of the movie he doesn't quite realize that Kelly is a beautiful gift, even beautifully wrapped!<br/><br/>There are films, both old and new, which boast a ""cast of thousands"" and shot in 5 different continents. Well, there are few feature-length films that were shot only on one sound state. And maybe none that I know of whose primary shots are essentially a handful of camera angles from a single vantage point on that one sound stage. Yet this is what Hitchcock does to tell a very compelling story. And the viewpoint is a laid-up photographer played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart who has nothing better to do than watch people through his rear window.<br/><br/>The focus is Stewart's suspicion of criminal acts by one of his neighbors who he can see across the way with either his binoculars or his camera with zoom lens. His suspicion is aroused through his habit of innocently spying on the the inhabitants of the buildings on his block. What's interesting is the amount of mileage Hitchcock attains from telling a story from this peculiar vantage point in the form of other sub-stories. There is the woman on the bottom-floor of the apartment across the way who can't seem to find the right man, dubbed ""Miss Lonely Heart"". There is another younger woman, a dancer, who can't seem to keep men away from her. She is named ""Miss Torso."" A songwriter and/or composer lives in another apartment. A newlywed couple move in to another apartment. As the story unfolds, the other stories unfold as well in different ways. And in addition to the main story, most of the other stories have some sort of resolution by the end of the film.<br/><br/>This cinematic concept is one of the most innovative techniques ever backed by a major film studio. Stewart is perfectly cast as the husky photographer turned amateur sleuth. Grace Kelly who only seems to get better with each viewing, plays Stewart's desperate girlfriend who is involved in the fashion industry on Madison Avenue. The characters seem made for each other like Dracula and sunlight. She loves the glitz and glamorous life of the sophisticated fashion crowd on Madison Avenue while he seems more at home crawling in the mud of another country to get the photograph of a lifetime. Thelma Ritter keeps Stewart in check as the reluctant nurse who tries to get him to take the plunge with Kelly and also gets caught up in the mystery. And Raymond Burr plays the man across the way to whom Stewart focuses his attention. His unsmiling haunting expressions are enough to portray his secretive character.<br/><br/>This is an absolute masterpiece of film-making. The dialog is fun, witty, sarcastic, with constant innuendos about love and marriage. Kelly plays the ""straight-man"" while Stewart get's away with lines that he'd be lynched for today by women's groups. The only thing that doesn't make sense: why is Stewart so reluctant to tie the knot with Kelly? Grace Kelly was probably the Cary Grant of actresses in the 1950's with millions of males looking on with absolute jealousy of her leading men. (I'm sure many men's heart went bust when she became Princess Grace) Of course, Stewart sees her as ""too perfect"", ""too beautiful"", and ""too smart"" for him. Ironically, the more he pushes her away the more she wants to come back to him. Which does point to one of the strangest foibles of the human psyche: when someone can't quite have something that he or she wants, the more he or she wants it!"
"etsm92","10","6","11","2 April 2006"," One of the best Hitchcock films ever besides Vertigo!
","Rear Window/1954/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: James Stewart Grace Kelly Raymond Burr<br/><br/>Excellent! Another well-written, thriller brought to you by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. I had seen this many times before this review but I have never had the chance to review the classic. But since I have time to spare, why not? Why is it Hitchcock is so good at making films and even his mediocre ones become famous a month or two after they come out in theaters? Why (?) because he was always on track making his films with witty dialogue by hiring perfect screenwriters (this one at most). But he's not a director that sits in his chair and eats, gets fat and just moves his hand around and says, ""You are here, and you are there!"" No! He plans out the scene in his brain while the actors/actresses rehearse and get ready. Normally before shooting (even the first scene) begins, he has already made the movie himself, planned it out with all his tricks, twists, and turns. When they start shooting, he gets it done fast since he has already planned it out. His camera moves, twists, humorous and factual dialogue, everything! He's a perfect director and this (""Rear Window"") is one of his best films he made (besides ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Rebecca"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Saboteur"", ""Rope"", ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""Psycho"", ""To Catch a Thief"", ""Dial ""M"" for Murder"", ""Torn Curtain"", ""Frenzy"", ""Topaz"", ""Family Plot"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The 39 Steps"", ""Notorious"", ""Suspicion"", and many, many more)! You notice I didn't mention ""Marnie"" or ""Jamaica Inn"" because they were two of his more mediocre ones. Pretty much all his films were big hits and only a few flunked! Not bad, not bad at all! Hitchcock had a big sense of humor and therefore all his films have at least one scene of humorous dialogue or humorous action, adventure, or whatever scenes. But mainly his humor comes from the mouths of the actors. Like in ""Rear Window"" there was a scene where one of (the main character) L.B. Jefferies's (James Stewart's) buddies comes over to the house and browses around for this salesman (named Mr. Lars Thorwald who is played by Raymond Burr) that is so-called ""a murderer"" (by Jefferies) (very Hitchcockian) and that he killed his own wife! The thing is Jefferies's buddy wasn't looking over at the so-called ""murderer's"" apartment window but yet looking at an attractive woman in a window on the other side of him named Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy). He watched for a while and smirked until Jefferies (Stewart) asks him out of the blue, ""How's your wife?"" And the buddy (named Thomas Doyle played by Wendell Corey) said, ""Oh, she's fine."" He looked away. See, witty humorous dialogue. Not only does Jefferies's buddy look at Miss Torso but also so does Jefferies himself. Even though he already has someone he's kinda in love with named Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) he still looks at other woman and admires them. AND there is a very funny character named Stella (Thelma Ritter) who takes care of Jefferies while he has his cast on (caused by a car crashing into him) and is in his wheelchair spying out at all the people on the other side of him. Stella definitely is a character and really shows how the dialogue is funny in a Hitchcock film. It's great! You have to respect Al and his films because he worked so hard not just to bring you a film, but a great film and to entertain the movie watchers. The films that come out now are definitely making more money but are not as good and wit (more violence, blood, sex, vulgarity). But at least the films that are literally good are still around and can be restored if not good qualities, which are the versions I have of ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"". They are both restored and in much better condition. This is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces staring famous actors and actresses (at the time) and has a great ending (not as much of a twist as ""Vertigo"" and other Hitchcock classics), middle, and beginning. This film has the most creative set ever seen in a Hitchcock film: an apartment courtyard and that's it! You mainly see Jefferies peeking out his apartment window into others (as a window shopper) and seeing what he sees and the camera is never in a different apartment room. Never! As I just said the ending was perfect. Well the reason why is because of the suspense and if he'll die from this fight with the so-called murderer that breaks in to his apartment room. But yet how hard is it to fight with a wheelchair? Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock."

","They don't make movies this way anymore.  Consider how deceptively simple the plot is-A photographer, confined to a wheelchair until his broken leg heals, is spying on his neighbors in an apartment complex and thinks that he is the only witness to a murder.  The movie often seems simple, too-The camera shots are pretty much only what the lead character can see, meaning that you see everyone in the complex from outside their windows.  Yet this movie never needs the heart-pounding airplane chase of North by Northwest to build a powerful momentum that hooks you in and never lets you go.<br/><br/>I must be fortunate-I saw this when it was re-released into theaters recently.  Twice.  I loved it so much the first time that I had to see it again.  I've seen the last hour on TV twice since.  Even when presented with only that last hour, I still couldn't stop watching until the ending credits rolled.  Yes, they don't make movies like this anymore.<br/><br/>The leading players are well-chosen.  You've got James Stewart as the wheelchair-bound photographer and Grace Kelly as his rich, fashionable girlfriend who is head-over-heels for him.  Theirs is not the only love story-several people in the complex have their own romances to deal with, in particular, the tragic Miss Lonelyheart, who sets dinner for two every night, even though she never has company.  The characters we see from a distance are surprisingly well-developed, and live such natural lives, such as a woman who lives on the top floor of the building across from the photographer.  She puts her dog in a basket everyday and lowers him down to the ground so that he can play.  Such simple traits are also very human.<br/><br/>Then there is the gripping story.  You're never given any more information than our protagonist has.  Stewart is forced to prove that Mrs. Anna Thorwald was murdered by her husband, Lars, and keeps trying to convince his detective friend (played by Wendall Corey) of her murder.  In the meantime, he's also trying to work out his own lovelife, and often what he sees in the windows reflect his mood, particularly a speech delivered by the woman with the dog about how neighbors should treat each other(another example of Hitchcock's masterful use of subtlety).<br/><br/>It's these subtle details and deceptive simplicity that make this movie so fantastic.  You just don't see movies like this now-everything must now be explicitly stated to the audience.  Hitchcock does not play that game-he expects his audience to be intelligent enough to understand the meaning of every scene and to know what is going on without the characters explaining even the most minute details.  This movie should be required viewing for everyone that loves movies."
"theowinthrop","10","5","9","18 September 2007"," Looking at Urban Life ... through binoculars and voyeurism
","Some of Alfred Hitchcock's films date badly, or are flawed by script points he chose to ignore as ""Maguffins"", or just are not his cup of tea. But REAR WINDOW is one great movie - a film that just never stops fascinating it's audiences as much as the world of that Greenwich Village enclave fascinates L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart). <br/><br/>Hitchcock built a meticulous set of apartment flats with a common courtyard. Although extensive it is, in fact, claustrophobic, with the seemingly separate lives of the residents running into each other more frequently than one expects (witness Raymond Burr's growling at a neighbor as he is working on his garden patch and she tries to give him some advice). The fact that it is supposed to be in the middle of a heat wave (this is in the pre-air-conditioned apartment days) adds to the feelings of closing in - even if the audience actually feels no heat from the set. At least five separate stories are going on that we are invited into during the course of the film, besides the main one of the fate of Mrs. Anna Thorwald (Irene Winston).<br/><br/>Jeff has been a widely respected and awarded photographer around the world, and he is nursing a broken leg (from his photographing a careening racing car). His only contacts with the outside world are his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) who is a supermodel of the period (c. 1954). Stuck with nothing to do Jeff starts looking out his window at his neighbors. They include a ballet dancer, a newlywed couple, a struggling pianist composer, a lonely woman seeking companionship, a couple with a dog, and a sculptor. Also there is Mr. Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a salesman, and his wife Anna.<br/><br/>Voyeurism is intoxicating, because (as long as you are unobserved) you can imagine what is actually going on - illustrated by the newlyweds pulling down the blinds of their window, and Steward struggling for words to explain to Kelly about what the couple behind the blinds are doing. But it becomes a matter that we are increasingly urgent as Jeff is aware of what is going on in the lives of those people. In particular the Thorwalds, who are always arguing. <br/><br/>One night he hears a woman scream, and wonders who it could be. Then he notices Thorwald acting very methodically (and atypically) in leaving his apartment with his salesman bag at late hours of the night. He slowly concentrates on Thorwald and his movements in his apartment - and the fact that the hitherto bedridden wife is missing. Both Stella and Lisa dismiss this, until they both are unconsciously drawn into watching some of Thorwald's activities themselves, and they start realizing there is something a bit odd.<br/><br/>Jeff calls in a war friend of his, Police Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) and he to is rather dismissive, but checks into the story. And he finds that everything on the surface seems explicable. But despite occasionally making Stewart and Kelly ashamed of themselves, sooner or later some other business by Thorwald or near his abode reawakens suspicions.<br/><br/>The conclusion is memorable for giving Thorwald an opportunity to confront his main prosecutor and demand an ethics answer that just can't be simply answered.<br/><br/>Hitchcock appears to have used elements of the Crippen murder for the story - based by the way on a short story by the gifted noir writer Cornell Woolrich. The cast is splendid, not only giving a bravura performance to Steward, but giving Kelly a chance to stretch her acting when in danger, and giving Ritter another one of her wise, wizened women roles. Burr had his best recalled moments on film here - if not his best performance (I still favor his avenging D.A. in A PLACE IN THE SUN). Corey too is the voice of reason and common sense - until the last moments of the film when Stewart finally jars him.<br/><br/>One of the finest thrillers ever constructed and filmed by a master director"
"arih27","1","26","74","20 March 2004"," Not so much!
","Um, Where do I start?  There wasn't enough evidence to accuse the neighbor of murder...there was way too much dialogue....the plot line was a little shaky and very boring.  I would have to say that this movie is a huge disappointment for me.  Could there be any more talking, please? (note the sarcasm) A movie is supposed to depict story through imagery and finite dialogue, I seriously fell asleep after the droning on and on and on and....on.  After the first 30-45 minutes, I couldn't stay awake, I actually had to fast forward through a large portion in the middle.  And where does Jeffries get off suspecting his neighbor?  That was not believable in the least.  Uh, if I were to spy on any of my neighbors, which is a little, no a lot, weird in the first place, I wouldn't be so bold as to jump to the conclusion that he murdered his wife based on his going in and out of his apartment in the rain at odd hours and carrying a saw and knife around the house.  I got the impression that the neighbor's wife was so ill that she was taken to her family's home out of town via the train due to the husband's incapability of caring for her any longer.  In other words, he moved her home to mom and dad because he couldn't take on the responsibility anymore.  And if you are as ill as she seemed to be, why would you need your purse or jewelry of all things?  Not going anywhere anyway.  I didn't get that the neighbor was a killer or a threat.  I understand that Jeffries thought so, but when anyone is that bored and lonely with nothing else to do but sit near a window and neighbor watch, your imagination gets the best of you.  Needless to say when it was all said and done, I was very displeased, but had a good nap."
"Coventry","4","4","7","7 February 2018"," I spy, with my little eye, the most overrated Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
","This is likely to go down as the least popular user-comment in history, but then so be it. I believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that ""Rear Window"" is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely can't fathom why it's such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that it's rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the film's strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police can't just go invading someone's private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isn't any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies' arrogant persona, and of course it doesn't help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters aren't omnipresent, like in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of ""Rear Window"" lies in the fact that it's a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost. <br/><br/>""Read Window"" along with ""Vertigo"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" made me realize that can't get into Hitch's espionage or 'wrong-man-condemned' thrillers, and that I find his more polished thrillers extremely boring, unrealistic and overrated. I'm primarily a horror fanatic, and thus love the nasty Hitchcock films the most, like ""Psycho"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Rope"" and ""Frenzy""."

","What makes Rear Window a masterpiece? Well, it's got one of the best directors of all time, one of the most likable leads, one of the most beautiful ladies... but even these first-rate ingredients don't always result in greatness, so there must be more. I would say it's about *richness*: there is a lot going on beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Still, the surface itself is flawless. The mystery plot about Jeff (James Stewart), photographer with a broken leg who spies a murderous neighbor, can't be improved upon. The script is a masterclass in visual storytelling, set-ups and pay-offs; see how Jeff's profession provides the reason of his condition, a tool to investigate the case and a defense during the climax. <br/><br/>Even potentially slow moments crackle. The back-story between Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) is delivered with acerbic wit in a conversation with nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter). The ""why don't they just go to the police"" moment, which Hitchcock usually dreaded (he famously told Truffaut his characters don't go to the police because ""it's dull""), flows by thanks to the quirky banter between Jeff and his detective friend Doyle (Wendell Corey).<br/><br/>Beneath this, there are several layers of subtext. The first is about marriage. Lisa wants to marry Jeff, but he is reluctant, regarding her as too snobbish and sophisticated. Everything Jeff sees from his window is about relationships (or lack thereof): the attractive ballerina with her suitors; the older, lonely woman; the bachelor struggling with his work; the newlyweds who spend all their time in bed; the mature couple with a dog as surrogate son. And, of course, Thorwald (Raymond Burr) killing his wife, which acts as a double catalyst: at first, it taps into Jeff's unconscious fears about failed relationships; then, it becomes a reason of bonding between him and Lisa, as she proves surprisingly good at boys' games. How does she finally entice Jeff? She sneaks into Thorwald's apartment and retrieves a piece of evidence... a wedding ring.<br/><br/>Rear Window is known to be about voyeurism, but I would say it's also about *spectatorship*. Stuck in his chair, Jeff follows from his window the unfolding events, much like us viewers staring at the screen. He is unable to interact directly with the ""outside world"", so he sends others (Stella, Doyle, but mostly Lisa) to do the dirty work; however, he is nearly powerless to defend them... and himself, when threat creeps into his own secluded universe. <br/><br/>10/10 for one of cinema's greatest classics."
"Red-Barracuda","10","4","7","29 July 2011"," A multi-layered voyeuristic masterpiece
","Rear Window is about an immobilised man Jeff who is restricted to his apartment and spies on his neighbours through boredom. He is sure he witnesses a neighbour called Thorwald murder his wife across the courtyard and is thereafter determined to prove he is right. He enrols the help of his girlfriend Lisa to help him solve the puzzle.<br/><br/>Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest critical and commercial successes of the 50's. Starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly (introduced with a glorious dream-like slow-motion kiss), it followed the template of his earlier films such as The 39 Steps where it combined suspense, comedy and romance. It is also one of his most purely cinematic movies. The story is told by imagery whenever possible such as the opening pan where we see all the neighbours, then the bandaged Jeff and the contents of his apartment – in this brief bit of camera work we learn much about Jeff's situation without a word being spoken. The camera POV almost never leave's Jeff's apartment. We observe the people across the courtyard but we only faintly hear them at best. The film relies on an optically subjective narrative, where we see what Jeff sees, and we see how he reacts. The issue of voyeurism presents the film's moral dilemma. Is it right to spy on your neighbours? Obviously Jeff uncovers a murder so his actions seem ultimately justified but there is an underlying darkness to his motives. It could be reasonably argued that Jeff subconsciously wants Thorwald to have murdered his wife so that he has an exciting murder-mystery to solve that will alleviate the daily boredom of recovering from his broken leg.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a film about looking. It reflects the cinematic experience itself. Jeff passively watches other lives unfold from a fixed position in a similar way to how we the audience watch movies. The neighbours could almost be said to represent different genres of film – the musician (the musical), Miss Lonelyhearts (the melodrama), the elderly couple with the dog (domestic comedy), Miss Torso (soft-core erotica), the newlyweds (social realism), the Thorwalds (murder-mystery). At the very least, his neighbours over the courtyard represent a microcosm of the society of a big city. Moreover, the scenes from the other apartments offer alternative possibilities to Jeff's own bachelor life – loneliness (Miss Lonelyhearts), the restrictions of marriage (the newlyweds) and, at a horrific extreme, domestic homicide (the Thorwalds). The roles that the immobile Jeff and the active Lisa are reversed over the court with Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife. Much of the romantic thread of the film concerns Jeff's reluctance to commit to Lisa, and unmistakable parallels can be drawn between them and the Thorwalds. <br/><br/>Rear Window in other words is a multi-layered masterpiece. An experimental visual exercise, a romantic drama, an examination of the cinema watching experience; and of course a witty, supremely acted and immaculately directed thriller. Much more than meets the eye!"

"ackstasis","9","4","7","6 July 2007"," ""A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window""
","There can be absolutely no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most gifted film directors ever to work in Hollywood, and 'Rear Window' is one film that demonstrates most exhaustively his enormous talents. I must admit that, on my first viewing of the film, I was quite new to his work, and, whilst I thought it was a solid achievement, it didn't strike me as being anything particularly special. How wrong I was! With subsequent viewings of 'Rear Window,' include one in a cinema, I was able to better appreciate its intricacies: the flawless performances, the 100 minutes of subtle, wonderfully-executed suspense, the shades of delightfully-dark humour, the manner in which Hitchcock places the viewer inside Jeff's tiny apartment. Released in 1954, 'Rear Window' was the second of four Hitchcock films to star James Stewart (the others being 'Rope,' 'Vertigo' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'), and the second of three to feature one of Hollywood's greatest beauties, Grace Kelly ('Dial M for Murder,' 'To Catch a Thief').<br/><br/>On the surface, the plot to 'Rear Window' is deceptively straightforward. The screenplay was written by four-time Hitchcock collaborator John Michael Hayes, and based loosely on the short story 'It Had to be Murder,' by Cornell Woolrich. Confined to his apartment with a broken leg, successful adventure photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Stewart) passes the tedious days and weeks by peering through the window at his neighbours, watching and learning their daily activities and rituals. When he is not being a voyeur, Jeff is distracted by visits from an embittered insurance company nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, glamorous socialite girlfriend, Lisa (Kelly). Jeff's ""peeping tom"" activities become considerably more serious than simply a means of passing the time, and he is soon immersed in the triumphs and failures of his neighbours. On one particular night, Jeff notices a man in the apartment across the courtyard (Raymond Burr) acting in a suspicious manner, and, despite the doubt of his friends, he begins to suspect that this man has committed an absolutely heinous crime.<br/><br/>The sheer genius of 'Rear Window' is not just how well-executed this storyline is, but how Hitchcock ties it together with numerous other narratives, making all of the strings equally-interesting to watch. Each of the apartments visible from Jeff's window acts like a different world  a separate movie  and the combination of all of these creates a rich tapestry of lifestyles, and a range of human relationships that mirror that of Jeff and Lisa. For example, there is hard-working salesmen Lars Thorwald, who arrives home each day to the incessant nagging of his invalid wife (Irene Winston); the woman in the floor below, dubbed ""Miss Lonelyheart"" (Judith Evelyn), is a hopeless romantic who, in her depression, is addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills; a young music writer (Ross Bagdasarian) struggles to make an income; a sexy young dancer, ""Miss Torso"" (Georgine Darcy), practises her dance moves and battles various suitors; two newly-weds frequently culminate their marriage with the blinds drawn, though, by the end of the film, the wife has begun the nagging that is arguably characteristic of the gender!<br/><br/>Despite obviously being in love with Lisa, Jeff is apprehensive of approaching marriage, fearing that his gritty, adventurous, globe-trotting lifestyle will not be compatible with Lisa's love of socialising and high-fashion (she is never caught wearing the same expensive dress twice). At first, we notice Jeff using the lives of those in the other apartments to distract from the troubles in his own, and he often uses the examples before him to support the decisions that he must make in his own life. As the film progresses, Lisa reveals a daring, audacious streak in trying to solve the mystery, and Jeff realises that, when love is concerned, small compromises can and should be made in order to make a fateful relationship work. As the film closes, we notice Lisa lying on a bed in common, unglamorous clothing, reading the book, ""Beyond the High Himalayas,"" no doubt in preparation for the couple's next adventure. However, though some compromises have been made, Lisa still remains her own women, suddenly casting aside Jeff's reading material and raising her own ""Harper's Bazaar"" magazine to her face.<br/><br/>Of course, despite the multitude of little narratives that comprise the film, the most significant  and, indeed, the one we remember best  is that of Lars Thorwald and his missing wife, Anna. After witnessing the former acting suspiciously during a stormy night, Jeff suspects that the over-worked and under-appreciated Thorwald has brutally murdered his wife, decapitated her body into several pieces and carried out the remains in a suitcase. Though Jeff's police detective ex-War buddy, Thomas J, Doyle (Wendell Corey), believes Jeff's story to be fantastic, Stella and Lisa soon come to accept the theory as fact, helping an immobile Jeff to solve the mystery. That we never fully understand the motivations of the murderer, having to be content with brief glimpses from afar, is crucial to Hitchcock's storytelling, and, by making the audience complicit in his characters' voyeurism, we feel as though our safety is being placed in jeopardy. The entire film possesses a very subtle air of unrelenting suspense, but the final ten minutes or so are among the most thrilling in cinema history."

","Hitchcock takes all the ingenuity of previous films like Rope and Lifeboat, and translates them to Rear Window, one of his true masterpieces. Taking place in one apartment where the viewer is forced to see what Jimmy Stewart's character sees, we are the voyeuristic witness to all the goings-ons of his neighbours. Frequently we look into their homes and become a passive viewer of their lives, wondering why they do what they do, what they will do next, and whether anyone can see us. Not only is it a technological treat, it is a pinnacle of tension and suspense, complemented by the twisting plot, excellent dialogue, and marvellous performances from all.<br/><br/>Stewart plays LB Jefferies, or Jeff, a well travelled photographer who hates the idea of settling down, of being trapped in the same place for any length of time. Ironically he has broken his leg, and is forced to stay in a wheelchair, in his apartment for a few months. Through his boredom, and his window, he watches his neighbours and the daily actions, giving them nicknames because of their behaviour. There is Miss Torso, an amorous young dancer, the newly-weds who like to keep themselves to themselves, Miss Lonely Hearts who spends her days planning how to catch the attention of men, and spends her nights failing. There is a tormented pianist whose music fills the air, and couple and their annoying dog. Lastly there is Lars Thorwald and his wife who are often arguing. Lisa is Jeff's girlfriend, a socialite who wants the opposite of Jeff- marriage, new dresses, and a place in high society. Their nurse Stella also visits to add some humour and spark. Jeff becomes suspicious when Thorwald's wife disappears, and at night he sees Thorwald acting strangely; taking small packages wrapped in paper from his flat, going back and forwards. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife, and with Stella and Lisa begins to try to prove what they believe to a detective friend. They search for a body, for evidence that Miss Thorwald is alive etc, and soon we too are captivated, wondering if she is dead, or if it is all just a mistake.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of Rear Window must rank among the most suspenseful in movie history, and its influence can still be seen today even in modern horror movies such as Ringu. The voyeuristic qualities are impressive and effective, and we are truly brought into the room with Stewart. There is excitement, comedy, romance, mystery, all the trademarks of Hitchcock, all flawlessly shown. Kelly is beautiful and feisty, her entrance memorable, her character strong, and in the end we see that although she will succumb slightly to Jeff's needs, she will remain independent. Stewart is wonderful, giving yet another landmark performance conveying paranoia, annoyance and helplessness like few other actors can. Burr is frightening as Thorwald, and Ritter is extremely good as Thelma, adding much needed relief from the tension with tongue in cheek humour. Each of the neighbours is distinct and we come to understand them. Full of cynicism about people, love, romance and relationships, though not harsh, Rear Window is one of the great films of the 50's, and is still highly watchable and entertaining today.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","I'm quite frustrated having watched this one. I'll get to that later...<br/><br/>Rear Window is about Jeffries, a photographer for a magazine in a kind of half-way house (Or maybe it's his own place) after an accident broke his leg. With nothing to do all day he stares out the window onto the courtyard and watches his neighbours' various lives. However, after a while one of them seems to go missing and her husband seems suspicious in his behaviour, so Jeffries decides he must have killed her. The rest of the movie sees Jeffries bringing his girlfriend and nurse in on the paranoia, as well as a detective friend he has.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific, no 2 ways about it. Superb, witty dialogue which exudes intelligence handled charismatically by all players. They truly suck us into their world, as the incredibly claustrophobic direction does. The cinematography is amazingly effective given the movie is set in one room, and makes the viewer as involved in the story as any movie I've seen. Hitchcock does a fine job here.<br/><br/>Moreover the plot itself is utterly gripping, and, not surprisingly, suspenseful, and all 3 factors combine to give it all a level of charm which really smarts.<br/><br/>SPOILER>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br/><br/>The film just 'ends'.

"ilovedolby","Null","4","7","1 June 2003"," A Classic!!!
","Rarely does a motion picture come along that is so genuinely intense that it sends cold chills down one's spine. This was a knack that late director Alfred Hitchcock immersed his films in-particularly, `Rear Window.' Starring the late, great Jimmy Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly, `Rear Window' is a spine tingling film that leaves the audience guessing and one the edge of their seat. 	L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (Steward) sits in his apartment, stuck in a wheel chair with a broken leg after photographing a car accident. He's been there for nearly seven weeks and all he does is watch out his apartment's back window at the other tenants in their apartments across his backyard. All seems normal until one night he hears a scream and notices that in one apartment, a woman who was sick in bed is no longer there. And her husband, a salesman, has been leaving the house late at night. Jeff suspects the man has killed his wife, but can't prove it. Jeff's story seems contrived and silly to his nurse, a close friend, and his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly). But clues soon turn up that will leave these characters forever changed.<br/><br/>	Hitchcock masterfully directs this classic from 1954. The one astounding aspect of `Rear Window' is that it all takes place inside Jeff's apartment. The camera never leaves the room, except to occasionally pan around the exterior of the backyard. Also, Hitchcock sets up interesting characters in each of the apartments. There are the newlyweds, a woman who is an artist, a woman who is a dancer, a man struggling with writing music that will sell, and another woman who is so distraught from lonliness that Jeff refers to her as Miss Lonely Heart.' 	The performances of `Rear Window' are some of best ever captured on celluloid. Naturally, Stewart can't touch a film without turning it to gold with his down-to-earth appeal. Kelly lights up the screen with her beauty and intriguing nature. Thelma Ritter is witty and engaging as Jeff's nurse, Stella, who provides her own insight into the relationship of Jeff and Lisa, but also into the possible murder. Wendell Corey plays Thomas Doyle, Jeff's friend who is an investigator. He gives his own explanation for the disappearance of the man's wife-she could have gone to visit family, or left him. And lastly, Raymond Burr plays Lars Thorwald, the man whose wife goes missing. Burr is terrifying in his portrayal as the strange salesman. <br/><br/>	All in all, `Rear Window' proudly takes its place among the top 100 movies of all time from the American Film Institute (AFI). It's certainly one of the best movies ever made not so much because it has the ability to terrify its audience, but because of the brilliance in the filmmaking by arguably the greatest director of all time, Hitchcock. `Rear Window' is available for rental at local video stores. ****"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","4","7","2 April 2001"," One of Hitchcock's best. Nearly as great as Psycho.
","Rear Window is Alfred Hitchcock's comment on the voyeuristic quality of society (`We've become a race of peeping toms'). It is the story of a man bound to a wheelchair by a broken leg who sees what he believes to be a murder being covered up in an apartment across the courtyard from him.<br/><br/>
James Stewart delivers an excellent performance as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, the magazine photographer who is bound to a wheelchair and who finds himself spying on his neighbors, at first out of boredom but very soon out of strong suspicion. This is a very talky thriller and is limited entirely to what is seen from Jeff's large apartment window. The fact that the entire two-hour film takes place in such a small setting is a strong statement about Hitchcock's tremendous skills as a director. He makes the film interesting in countless ways, such as his excellent, meaningful use of shadows, the very thorough character development, his interesting use of symbolism (such as Jeff's difficulty in reaching itches underneath his cast), not to mention the amazingly effective suspense, a Hitchcock trademark.<br/><br/>
Just before Jeff notices some suspicious events occurring across the courtyard, he is constantly complaining about not being able to find any interesting work as a photographer, and it is ironic that he soon finds something interesting right outside his own window, and while he is confined to a wheelchair, no less. The fascinating crime story of the man across the courtyard having murdered his wife is made even creepier by the fact that it is all deducted from behavior that Jeff sees out his window, and we don't even find out for sure if he is right or not until the film's exciting climax. Hitchcock fans are also likely to notice a line of dialogue that may have foreshadowed some of the events that were to later take place in Psycho, such as the insurance company nurse's speculation that the killer must have cut up his wife's body in the bathtub (`That's the only place he could have washed away the blood'). <br/><br/>Another thing that sets Rear Window aside from other thrillers (including its own 1998 re-make which, incidentally, was far superior to the 1998 re-make of Psycho), was the way that it had several stories going on at the same time, which is one of the ways that it was able to remain so interesting. Jeff is an injured photographer, he is unsatisfied with his work, he is having a dilemma about marrying his sweetheart because he feels she is too perfect for him (the flimsiest excuse on the planet, of course, but he actually makes it make a little bit of sense), and then he comes across these events across the courtyard from his apartment that make him think that there has been a murder over there, and the murderer (Raymond Burr) is trying to cover it up. <br/><br/>Some of the things that happen in this film are not perfect, or seem uncharacteristic of Hitchcock, but the film as a whole is still spectacularly effective. For example, as a Hitchcock scholar, I found it strange that the killer strangled the dog and left it in the middle of the courtyard for all to see (and for Jeff to make revealing conclusions about). Think about how much more effective this would have been if the woman who owned the dog had just stood out on her porch calling for him, and he never came. This way, the realization that the man had killed the dog would have been much more gradually realized, and may have made the suspense created by it that much more impressive. At any rate, this is an outstanding film, and Hitchcock definitely created an amazing amount of suspense with such limited means, leading up to a tremendous climax that provided a quick but satisfying ending to this classic film."

","In New York, the daring photographer L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart) has been confined to his small apartment for five weeks in a wheelchair with one broken leg. He snoops his neighbors from his rear window to kill time and he is aware of the personal dramas of some of them. His fancy girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) is pressing him to marry her but he believes she will not fit and feel comfortable with his brash lifestyle. When the invalid wife of the salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) vanishes, Jeff believes the man might have killed his wife. He tells his concerns to Lisa and to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and the women agree with his observations, but his friend Detective Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) finds reasonable explanation for each remark. However, Lisa decides to go further in her investigation, getting closer to the suspect.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is one of my favorite classics ever and I do not know precisely how many times I have watched this film. There are many rip-offs of this simple story but none of them gets closer to this wonderful film. The first difference is in the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, a refined director with the subtle and witty British humor, capable to give meaning to a scene with one word or expression of his characters. The awesome James Stewart and the gorgeous and classy Grace Kelly show a perfect chemistry and it is impressive the beauty and elegance of the future princess of Monaco. Thelma Ritter is excellent in the role of the caustic nurse Stella. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the apartment of the composer twiddling his clock. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Janela Indiscreta"" (""Indiscreet Window"")"
"hitchcockthelegend","10","5","10","3 February 2009"," It Had To Be Murder.
","L.B. Jefferies is a wheelchair bound photographer who by way of relieving his boredom, starts observing the lives of all his neighbours from his apartment window. As he gets deeper into the lives of all around him, he becomes convinced that one of hem has committed the act of murder, thus putting himself and those close to him in mortal danger.<br/><br/>Much like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic. So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.<br/><br/>Rear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.<br/><br/>Working from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life!<br/><br/>It's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame. Rarely has a film been produced that has every single character having a critical element to the story. Then there is the ending where Hitchcock and his team weave all strands together to leave us wryly smiling away whilst simultaneously feeling that we have been had by the big director, and be under no illusions here, we have been at the mercy of a genius and party to a film of unquestionable quality. 10/10"
"bsinc","6","5","10","9 June 2007"," Is this REALLY the best Hitchcock had to offer???
","In IMDb's ""Top 250"" this movie ranks in the top 15, it's Hitchcock's highest ranking movie, so obviously many people see it as an exceptional one. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. I was eager to see it and perhaps I was expecting more, but frankly, is that so much to ask from supposedly one of the best movies ever made? <br/><br/>+To not come off as a lover of criticism, I truly have to commend the excellent use of sound effects throughout the movie. I realized on many occasions just how smart and practical the director was in making the outside world truly come into the viewer's life. I even realize how the whole concept of the movie must have been ""fresh"" back in its day, but here's where the lauding stops.<br/><br/>-I found ""Rear Window"" as a movie that definitely hasn't passed the test of time. The main set (around which the whole movie revolves) looked really fake...I mean come on, besides the incredibly wide windows that were just convenient enough for a peeping Tom to get a frigging panoramic view of everything, all of the apartments looked like two-dimensional sets from a drama play, even Jefferies's) The plot itself is almost laughable in its simplicity and more so painfully predictable. The first 30 minutes or so nothing much happens, there's a romantic subplot etc etc and when the main, murder plot comes into focus I simply realized there wasn't enough time left for it to turn anything BUT murder. So the supposed ""thrill"" of the movie mystery never even got to me.<br/><br/>I read that the scene where the murderer returns to the apartment and finds Lisa snooping around is apparently a ""classic"". LOL!!! The whole time I couldn't stop but wonder why Jimmy frigging Stewart didn't jump from his chair and limp like crazy to that apartment!!!?!!? All he could do was cling his teeth. Now that's love for you;) <br/><br/>Overall, way to many subplots and no real plot. Decent acting. Great sound but poorly-made sets. Bad ending. Bad premise actually. Not Hitchcock's finest moment. Honeslty, it's one of his weakest ones! <br/><br/>And just a personal observation that I find rather amusing: If the pianist was heard all the way to Jefferies's apartment, wouldn't any of the other residents ever get pi**ed at him for always playing that piano??;)"
"sol-","Null","5","10","11 February 2007"," Lots to see, even on a third viewing
","Made around the same time that televisions started to become an essential part of the home, 'Rear Window' paints an interesting time capsule of a society devoid of television, where the only entertainment if stuck at home all day is watching the neighbours' activities. In fact, 'Rear Window' could even be seen as a film about television, with Jeffries, the protagonist, switching views of other apartments just like a man constantly changing channels on his television set. As Thelma Ritter's character Stella says, ""We have become a race of peeping toms"", relating to a key issue of the film: the voyeuristic tendencies of society.<br/><br/>Although it would not be made for another twelve years, the film bears a strong resemblance to 'Blowup', with Jeffries stating that ""right now, I'd welcome trouble"", an indication that his mind is overactive, searching for something interesting to follow. And with his detective friend, a character representing the devil's advocate, we are constantly hanging on the edge, weighing up the evidence for ourselves. We are also able to do more investigating than what the characters themselves conduct. In different windows, different events occur, some of which the protagonists note, and others of which we ourselves observe only.<br/><br/>The cinematography helps a lot in serving this cause. There are at least a couple of shots that scan the courtyard and then go back into Jeffries' apartment. These shots at first appear to be taken from the perspective of the characters, but since they do not end on the characters looking out the window, Hitchcock establishes a separation between us and the characters. We are learning more about what is happening outside when they are distracted. The way we are introduced to Jeffries also probes us to investigate: first we see his leg, then photos of accidents, and only later do we realise that the photographs are of potential accidents, rather than photos of his accident.<br/><br/>The opening shots of the film are amazing. Three blinds are slowly opened in the background as the main credits roll, just like how we are slowly opening our eyes as the film begins. Then the camera goes through the window, explores the courtyard, and finally ends up inside Jeffries' apartment, and on a perfectly focused shot of Jeffries. Another great shot is Lisa's first scene, where she kisses Jeffries in slow motion, almost as if it is a dream. The film is full of great shots and excellent camera-work, and to think - Hitchcock probably had to call most of those shots from the distance! It's a very fine directorial achievement.<br/><br/>Speaking of Hitchcock, his cameo here serves more purpose than in any other film of his. Before Thorwald notices that he is being watched, Hitch is the only character to actually look back at Jeffries. And aside from that, it's quite interesting with the whole relationship that is then established between director, actor, film, audience: the whole chain that is controlling what we are seeing. If nothing else, Hitch's cameo reminds us that even though we see more than what the characters are see, we only ever see ourselves what he allows us to see."

"arenn","6","6","13","8 September 2000"," Vastly Over-rated
","I recently saw the restored print of this ""classic"" with some friends at the Music Box Theatre in Chicago.  After it was over, we all kind of stared at each other with slightly pained looks on our faces as if afraid to say what we really felt.  But none of us is truly that bashful about voicing opinions and it turned out we all shared the same one: namely that Rear Window was decent, but it was certainly no masterpiece and fell well short of our expectations.  I suspect the entire audience felt that way as there was very little crowd reaction to the film throughout and only polite applause at the end.  This is in marked contrast to the palpable thrill that the crowds at the Music Box's recent Kubrick film festival exhibited.<br/><br/>I thought the film was slow paced and rather dull, and was over-dominated by subplots.  The suspense level was low throughout much of the film.  There were a few interesting vignettes about the lives of the various people who lived in the apartment building on the far side of the Greenwich Village courtyard, but ultimately these weren't enough to put this one into the above average category.<br/><br/>I will confess that I've never been a big Hitchcock fan despite enjoying psychological thrillers.  So maybe that accounts for part of my shoulder shrug of this film.  Regardless, while I'm glad to have seen the film, I don't think I'll ever take the time to watch it again and I didn't come away impressed from my first screening."

If you don't mind sitting through 2 hours of monotony just to get 10 good minutes of suspense then go right ahead. I've had more enjoyable times watching ants kill a spider than I had during the first two hours of this movie.

"seymourblack-1","9","3","5","11 August 2016"," Voyeurism, Suspicion & Murder
","There can't have been many filmmakers who would have been excited by the prospect of making a movie about an immobile man who spends 99% of his story inside a single room where he's unable to see any further than the boundaries of his own small apartment complex. In the hands of Alfred Hitchcock however, the character's confinement is skilfully used to rationalise his unhealthy preoccupation with spying on his neighbours and to generate the kind of tension that's such an important component of this gripping murder mystery. Suspicion, voyeurism and obsession feature strongly and the presence of a cool blonde, a romantic subplot and some offbeat humour all add to the entertainment value of this fine movie which eventually became recognised as an all-time classic.<br/><br/>L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart) is a top-class photojournalist who's been used to travelling extensively to get the great photographs that adorn the pages of his employer's magazine. When he suffers a broken leg as a result of an accident at a motor-racing track and becomes confined to a wheelchair in his modest Greenwich Village apartment, he soon becomes frustrated and very irritable. To relieve his boredom, he starts to gaze out of his window and watch what's going on in the other apartments that face his. Because New York is in the middle of a heatwave, his neighbours have their blinds up to keep cool and so there's plenty to watch. An attractive ballerina who he calls Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy) rehearses regularly and enjoys the attention of a collection of male admirers, whilst in another apartment close-by; a single lady, who Jeff calls Miss Lonely Hearts (Judith Evelyn) prepares a meal and entertains an imaginary boyfriend.<br/><br/>Stella (Thelma Ritter), the insurance company nurse who calls by to attend to him everyday doesn't approve of Jeff's pastime and advises that he should pay more attention to his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) instead. Lisa's a fashion model and dress designer who's rich, beautiful and as Jeff readily admits, perfect in every way, but he's rather cool with her because he has doubts about their compatibility as they have such different lifestyles.<br/><br/>Jeff starts to take a particular interest in what's going on in the apartment of a jewellery salesman and when he notices that the man's invalid wife has disappeared, becomes convinced that she must've been murdered. Lisa and Stella are sceptical about his suspicions and even his old Army buddy Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey) who's now a NYPD detective, admits to sharing their scepticism after making his own unofficial investigations. As time passes, Lisa and Stella start to take his suspicions more seriously and eventually team up with him to try to find the evidence they need to prove that the missing woman has indeed been murdered.<br/><br/>In common with most Hitchcock movies, ""Rear Window"" boasts some great visual moments. Grace Kelly's introduction in a scene where she's initially seen leaning over Jeff is sensational and a short sequence in which the roaming camera focuses on a number of objects and photos in Jeff's apartment is exquisite in the way that it silently imparts so much information about him in such a short time. Hitchcock's skill in making, even the most mundane things seem sinister, is wonderfully displayed in a scene where the suspected murderer sits in his apartment in the dark with only the periodic glow of his cigarette providing a clue to his presence and again in a scene where the same man realises who's watching him. The gaze he directs back at Jeff is absolutely chilling because it suddenly turns the tables on the voyeur and carries the implicit threat that he could be the next invalid to be murdered.<br/><br/>The theme of confinement is also reinforced visually by the ways in which the lives of the neighbours seem to be framed by their windows, just as Jeff's outlook is framed by his own window and the apartment complex is itself, a closed-in entity.<br/><br/>The quality of the acting is consistently good with James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter all standing out and the dialogue is exceptional because, although it's far from punchy, there doesn't seem to be a superfluous word in it. Thelma Ritter is the beneficiary of more good lines than anyone else because her marvellous character, whose nose for trouble is so well-developed that she predicted the Wall Street Crash, is full of no-nonsense advice that she dispenses very generously."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","5","26 December 2012"," Reliable quality
","Hitchcock is one of those director's that you're not really allowed to hate. The man has such a reputation that if you don't like one his films, you're just not getting it or there's something wrong with you. Mostly this reputation is well-earned as his movies are extremely good and well-made, but sometimes this expectation to love a film causes sort of a backslash where you're fighting against the film, critiquing every little detail, not allowing it to pull you in. Thus I think that I did myself sort of a disfavour with Rear Window. I liked it quite much, but my expectations were too high.<br/><br/>What did the movie get right? The characters for one. The main couple of Jeff (James Stewart) and Lisa (Grace Kelly) is the centerpiece of the entire film and these two actors pull it off beautifully. The characters are quite different, but both actors play them quite similarly by adding a lot of charisma to them, as well as an underlying streak of good humour. With Lisa this streak is quite visible at times, as she is almost always smiling and a pleasant person in general. With Jeff it's a bit more subtle, but Stewart plays the character like he's usually quite a charmer, but now that he's been forced to spend several weeks indoors, he has become quite grumpy as a result. Very subtle performances from both, as is to be expected from two stars such as them.<br/><br/>Furthermore the various inhabitants of Jeff's neighbourhood are also quite interesting and given a lot of character, even though most of them only have a few lines of dialogue, if even that. But Jeff has spent weeks observing them and we see them through his eyes, which makes them more real and gives them colour. The names, such as Miss Lonely Heart and Miss Torso are especially telling.<br/><br/>I also quite liked the themes that got addressed throughout the film. The film has surprising amount of depth, considering that the premise itself is quite simple. A man notices that something is amiss with his neighbours and decides to investigate. With a lesser director that would have been all, but Hitchcock adds in a lot more without making it feel clustered. The obvious mystery plot is still the main attraction, but the film has lots to say about relationships, neighbourhoods and human character in general. And none of these themes feel forced or preaching. A lot isn't even said aloud, rather various shots and visuals are used to both introduce the characters and to deepen their personalities. This leaves more time for meaningful dialogue because it isn't needed to force in exposition.<br/><br/>What wasn't so hot in my opinion, so to speak? The main mystery, frankly speaking. Of course this is such a classic film that it's hard to see it without knowing how it's going to go beforehand, but I still would have liked for it to have been a little more complicated and/or deeper. Now the problem is introduced and at least I deduced instantly what had happened. Thus the main conflict isn't really finding out what happened, but finding out how they're going to prove it. Perhaps Hitchcock meant it to be like this, but I would have preferred a bit more ambiguity. The story itself isn't all that bad and it is told masterfully, with no motions or scenes wasted, but the mystery is overly simplified. For me that was a problem, but it doesn't mean that it will be so for everyone.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: It's a strong film because of its characters, its skillful technical details and its sheer flawlessness. The mystery plot might leave you wishing for more, but it's not an outright flaw, rather than a matter of opinion. So I quite liked the film, though I wouldn't call it one of the best films of all time, like some do. It's great, but not that great."

It is perhaps his most purely cinematic film while also showcasing his mastery of the art of suspense.<br/><br/>The story concerns a photographer (James Stewart) who is stuck in his apartment nursing a broken leg. He occupies his time by watching the actions of his neighbours. When he begins to suspect one of them of murder he enlists the aid of his socialite girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter).<br/><br/>While the film's cast members didn't land any Oscar nominations there were nevertheless several fine performances. You could say that James Stewart's performance almost single-handedly carried the picture but that would seem dismissive of the quality support given by Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey & Raymond Burr. Meanwhile, Grace Kelly looks exquisite in the female lead and she gives an excellent performance to boot.<br/><br/>The direction of Alfred Hitchcock and the screenplay of John Michael Hayes (both Oscar-nominated) are best considered in tandem. The separate threads of the intricate storyline are masterfully manipulated by Hitchcock with a visual approach that puts us squarely in Stewart's position. Also, I'm not usually one who notices sound design in films but the sound in this film is superb. Little wonder that it was nominated for an Oscar, as was the attractive cinematography. The Edith Head costumes also deserve special mention.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Rear Window"" is practically flawless. It's highly satisfying both as a piece of entertainment and as a piece of cinematic art. Anyone looking to experience Hitchcock at his best would be well advised to start here."

","This is an excellent movie and I still don't know how Hitchcock was able to pull it off so well. Multiple sets on camera in the same frame and still not confusing or disjointed.<br/><br/>It is also one of his most funny and entertaining pieces and that is another accomplishment given the dark subject matter. It could have been a morbid and nauseating film with the wrong tone but, he keeps it light and still doesn't lose a lick of the tension.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes here that are aces but one favorite is when Jeffries' detective friend visits him to tell him that he is wrong in suspecting foul play. Several things goes on in the scene at once and it is so well written. The looks that Stewart and Corey give each other are priceless.<br/><br/>Thelma Ritter as the nurse is brilliant and it's a shame that she wasn't really acknowledged more for the part. Grace Kelly was excruciatingly beautiful but you couldn't really see her as much more than that. She stopped acting before she developed into an accomplished actor. Her best scene is at the beginning when she realises that Stewart won't marry her.<br/><br/>The best part is of course played by Raymond Burr and as was intended, he does resemble David Selznick. It almost creepy how much he looks like Hitchcock's boss. I wonder how Selznick took it. It is a very difficult part too, virtually silent and incredibly menacing.<br/><br/>You could go on and on about the meaning of the whole thing. One thing comes to mind, though. This is a movie that virtually defines what a movie is. Perceptions, reactions, conclusions and all that defines great art. It's all here."
"barryrd","9","3","5","1 March 2009"," Classic Hitchcock from a unique perspective
","With the acting talent of two of Alfred Hitchcock's favourite actors, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and a strong supporting cast of Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr, we have the ingredients of a great movie. However, this movie is much more than the sum of its stars since the directing genius of Hitchcock is more than evident in this film, which is in the top tier of his work. The movie takes place on a small set; in fact, the action takes place in a bachelor apartment with cutaways to other apartments on the opposite side of a courtyard. The location is in a downtown neighbourhood of Manhattan. <br/><br/>The viewer sees much of the action through the telephoto lens of Jimmy Stewart (known as Jeff to his friends), who is a photographer sidelined by an accident. He takes to watching the antics of his neighbours in his spare time. The comic and the sad come together as the camera pans from one apartment to another. The neighbour he is mainly interested in is the apartment of one Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who Jeff believes has killed his wife. Thorwald thinks he is acting without the knowledge of anyone but in fact, there is an intruder looking on from the other side of the courtyard, through his rear window. <br/><br/>Raymond Burr gives a convincing portrayal of the sinister Mr. Thorwald – a far cry from the suave, courtly lawyer known on T.V. as Perry Mason. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Carol Freemont, enhances the look of this movie every time she walks on the set. In every scene, she appears like a model from the 1950's. I didn't count the number of costume changes she made but they must have been numerous and she made the most of each one. She is a class act every time she appears and plays the role of the uptown Manhattan girl to a tee. The close-ups of her are eye candy of the first order. In fact, Jimmy Stewart hesitates to marry her because as he says, ""she's too perfect"". Thelma Ritter (Stella) as the housebound photographer's nurse/masseuse/housekeeper is an absolute marvel with her quick repartee and New York twang to give it that extra zing. During her career, she was nominated for several Academy Awards and is a rich talent. Stella is almost a surrogate mother to Jimmy Stewart, playing the devil's advocate and giving her own two cents'worth on the love match between Lisa and Jeff, particularly Jeff's reluctance to wed. <br/><br/>The plot moves toward the climax when Thorwald realizes he is being stalked and after Jeff finally enlists the support of his buddy Det. Doyle (Wendell Corey). The voyeur's interest in his neighbours leads to some skilled speculation by Jeff that could at any point have been blown away by a logical explanation, as Doyle was suggesting. But the evidence kept mounting and became more and more difficult to ignore. <br/><br/>Some hands-on detective work by Lisa and Stella moves the story towards its climax. This classic movie will hold your interest from its amusing start to goose-bump finish. Along the way, there is a fine script and lots of wit. The vignettes involving the neighbours highlight the degree to which Jeff has taken to voyeurism, honing his observation of human behaviour. When he realizes what he has observed, there is a long silence, very effective. Photography forms a major role in this film, especially the use of the telephoto lens. Views through the viewfinder form part of the key visuals. Hitchcock makes good use of the growing appreciation for professional photography as the skills of one photographer become the basis for a case of murder."
"jzappa","10","3","5","2 September 2008"," A Redundant But Insightful Reflection On Rear Window
","I am sitting here wondering why I am commenting on Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. It is a definitive classic of enduring interest, quality, and style. The last sentence is as redundant as this review will be. I mean, what can I say that not only hasn't already been said but isn't already known? Its masterful voyeuristic cinematography, its impeccably atmospheric sound and John Michael Hays's screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's short story have been quite sufficiently recognized over the past half century. I suppose there is one thing that people don't tend to think about, or at least it is one thing I haven't heard anyone say, and that is that Rear Window is a virtuoso portrait the human element of privacy, and feeling naked when we notice that it is invaded. What's more, that invasion is another element of human nature: Voyeurism.<br/><br/>What else is left to debate for incessantly lovable Jimmy Stewart, a successful photographer whose restlessness takes him all over the world and into situations where he takes pictures no one else gets, recuperating from a broken leg during a scorching hot summer? Here is a restless daredevil who makes a living with his eyes, laid up in a wheelchair in a small, apartment. This is 1954. He's not going to sit at the computer and blast people on IMDb message boards. He does what any one of his neighbors could be found doing in his situation: Alleviating boredom by spying on the lives of his neighbors. Furthermore, his view is perfect! Through his rear window, he can see into the building across the courtyard of the complex and glimpse from front row seats the residents' daily routines. There's the ubersexy dancer who exercises in her underwear, the couple who sleep on their small balcony because they don't have air conditioning, a lonely woman who lives by herself (who alternately gains great sympathy from us and generates cruel laughs at her expense; true to the spirit of voyeurism), and a frustrated songwriter always at his piano. And, there is the salesman, a pitch-perfect Raymond Burr, who lives directly across the courtyard from Jimmy Stewart, the one with the pesky, harassing invalid wife.<br/><br/>I can safely assume that nearly everyone who reads this generally knows the gist of the plot. It is a fine plot, ever condusive to everything Hitchcock. What is so significant about it to me is how it takes two seemingly conflicting sides of human nature and turns the suspenseful corner by dangling by a thread the inevitable, which is that an everyday person, no matter how fixed they are in their day-by-day algorithms, just may eventually discover that feeling of nakedness, of intrusion.<br/><br/>Though there are films by Hitchcock that I favor more, like The Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, and Rope, Rear Window stands as pure cinema: Blatantly and shamelessly visual, full of layers of audible details from the ambient to deafening."
"billion_mucks","9","3","5","3 December 2007"," A Time Capsule
","Hitchock's smart review on voyeurism and human composed need for entertainment is fantastically stamped within ""Rear Window"". Those who see just a suspense story will overlook the most important backbone of the movie itself: the arrangement of a fauna of great, interesting human beings, each with their problems, happiness and something to scoop on.<br/><br/>The story quickly digests important views where a man with his broken leg gets no other option than to spend time watching and examining his neighbors' life. Before Television arrived, this endearing inspection like Big Brother brings the fantastic nexus that ties up the story. But there will be a transformation where the watching will transform into an obsession, and the most inner feelings of connection with the other will be arisen by what we call voyeurism, or morbidness. We will unite sober James Stewart in his progressive burial over the neighborhood's secrets.<br/><br/>There is in the movie one crucial analogy: the eyes watching the window. The eyes are subjective, and see what the mind wants to see. Curiously, eyes are the so called windows of the souls. Whereas the window exposes the reality, the fact to be interpreted (in many ways): here ambiguity strikes and in Jeffries situation it will present itself in the mood of paranoia. All of this scrutinizing over the others life is presented as unethical, but irresistible. Hitchcock uses Franz Waxman's moody music to alter the spectator's disposition to each scene, that lightens throughout the chilling sessions and paralyzes within the climax moments. There is a sense of fear, of being also observed and panicking of being discovered while enjoying the watch. The story seems possible and everyday, presented in a superb way, it will be more effective than what you expect it so. The photography is immense, roaming delicately over the used setting profiting on the smooth editing. We also can expect the most sophisticated and somewhat naive sense of humor to lighten the sordid tension of the movie.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" lives clearly up to the reputation. It is a movie to be examined closely and enjoyed with a good glass of freezing cold water to set the mood right. I believe the movie is somewhat of a time capsule, a very good one indeed, because it has gone over more than fifty years since released, and its a beautiful way of being entertained as it paints a wonderful picture of the era: the way they talked, they dressed, they spent their time. Time cannot falter pieces of art as this one. It renders past oblivion."
"pyrocitor","10","3","5","14 May 2007"," A culture that loves to watch
","Only in the hands of master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock could a seemingly simple tale about a man in a wheelchair watching his neighbours be twisted into a captivating tale of suspense and intrigue, mixed with a sturdy backbone of moral and ethical dilemmas and a social commentary on the culture that would be viewing the film. Hitchcock, who was notorious for mixing in such deeper themes with seemingly superficial suspense epics seemed to particularly relish the tale of Rear Window, a film entirely devoted to a man simply watching. At first glance, the plot sounds overly contrived, even downright dull, but under Hitchcock's careful grasp, the film never drifts into anything less than crackling with low key intrigue and tension - but always equally thought provoking as well as entertaining throughout. <br/><br/>Rear Window proved innovative in film-making style as well as supremely entertaining movie - a masterpiece in pacing, as well as a unique narrative style. The story plays itself out as a murder mystery, but as the plot unfolds, the solution remains abundantly clear to the audience watching the events transpire. Rather than throwing in a hackneyed forced plot twist near the end, Hitchcock is content to simply let the climax unfold exactly as the viewer would have predicted all along - after all, the joy of the film is not solving a mystery, but merely observing the murderous event itself transpire. In a day and age grown so accustomed to climatic plot twists, the absence of any is in itself more of a surprise than another forced plot twist would have been. Unfortunately, one of the film's minuscule flaws is that its ending comes across as a touch abrupt and forced; a minor lapse in pacing in a film which proves an otherwise stellar example of it. <br/><br/>But Hitchcock is not content with simply telling his story in an innovative fashion - his trademark deeper and darker themes make their way into a story which seems deceptively simple, brilliantly written by John Michael Hayes. In many ways, the premise of Rear Window serves as a social commentary on mass culture: people love to watch. How else to explain the enormous generation of income of the film industry than the general public's fascination with the stories of other people; often moreso than in their own lives. James Stewart's character seems to act as a representation of most audience members - too captivated by the social dramas of his neighbours and the glamour of potential murder (another trademark Hitchcock theme) to pay attention to his own life. <br/><br/>And there is no denying that it is enjoyable to watch, as we, the audience, get easily drawn into the private lives of these seemingly inconsequential characters (""Miss Torso"", ""Ms. Lonelyhearts"" and ""The Pianist"" as Stewart refers to them) framed by the spectacular cinematography, all shot from the room of Stewart's apartment - another reference as to how little it takes to entertain an audience. Indeed, Rear Window seems to serve as a precursor to the world of reality television, and the fascination ensuing from watching shows such as Survivor or Big Brother - simply observing ""real life"" as it is billed.<br/><br/>Hitchcock also raises moral issues as to the ethics of observing to the point of intrusion of privacy in a scene where Stewart debates the ethics of spying on his neighbours, even if he may bring a murderer to justice. Hitchcock seems to be silently making raising the question to his audiences - we are a culture that loves to watch, but is it always right to watch, and are we always meant to see what we see? Whatever decisions or interpretations audiences may take out of Hitchcock's social commentaries, their mere presence in the film make the unfolding of the plot that much more interesting to follow, and add strongly to the quality of the film overall. <br/><br/>An already brilliantly realized film is only made more powerful by the immensely capable cast - James Stewart proves perfect casting as the ornery yet charming L. B. Jeffries, the wheelchair bound photographer with a bizarre interest in his neighbours' private lives, determined to prove one of them to be a murderer. The peerlessly elegant Grace Kelly brings sheer class to the film as Jeffries' socialite girlfriend, though how could Jeffries ever be capable of pushing such an ideal woman away, and why she continue to be interested in one who comes across as a cranky older man is truly a question for the ages. Character actress Thelma Ritter proves an unquestionable scene stealer, raising many a laugh and making use of many of the film's best lines as Jeffries' unassuming but sharp tongued nurse. Wendell Corey is a similarly strong presence as Jeffries' detective friend who is eventually drawn into the conflict. Raymond Burr, seen almost entirely in extreme long shots still establishes himself as a formidable and intimidating presence as the suspected murderer, and some of the suspenseful scenes involving his character are some of the best nail biting sequences Hitchcock ever churned up. All the supporting players, also seen only in long shots still manage to draw the audience into their personal lives, forcing them to care even when they realize they should be observing dispassionately - an inspired directorial touch. <br/><br/>All in all Rear Window proves to be one of Hitchcock's most fascinating yet philosophical films in a career demonstrating many of the same traits. Though Rear Window may sound slow and uninteresting at first glance, there is a certain fascination the film evokes which triggers inevitable repeat viewing after viewing. This is one window which demands looking into. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","HITCHCOCK AT HIS BEST! I loved Psycho and Strangers on a Train, but I have to say I believe this one is the masterpiece in my opinion. James Stewart is unbelievable, a truly tremendous actor.

Thelma Ritter was fantastic, a true gem. Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever, flawless, and the perfect girlfriend. This movie sure keeps me on the edge of my seat, even though I have seen it before.

"blackcurtain","8","3","5","15 February 2005"," Looking Through the Rear Window
","""Rear Window"" is an excellent thriller by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. All throughout the film, the audience becomes a willing accomplice to a peeping tom. The audience watches the main character's neighbors right alongside the main character. <br/><br/>L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair due to a bad accident in which Jeffries nearly lost his life. It was a car accident, occurring as Jeffries tries to get a picture of a car racing, but the race car ends up coming apart just as Jeffries takes his picture. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Jeffries gets injured and his camera gets broken. He has broken his leg, preventing him from being able to get out of his apartment. These days, when that happens, someone might take to spending their time watching television. However, this film takes place in the 50's, when television was just coming into it's own. As a matter of fact, at the time, advertising companies generally were not agreeing with their clients as to whether or not to advertise on television. The advertising companies thought television was doomed. <br/><br/>Hence we have the reason why Jeffries ends up spending his time watching the neighbors. He has nothing else to do. He makes up his own name for each of them. There is a woman he calls Miss Torso, who dances all the time. There is Miss Lonelyhearts , who cries herself to sleep every night. Then there is the traveling salesman, who Jeffries becomes very concerned about. <br/><br/>Turns out the salesman's wife is bed-ridden. Then why is no one paying attention to her? Why is it the salesman is wrapping such bizarre things as knives, and in newspaper? <br/><br/>The film is centered around this mystery, and the audience becomes a peeping tom themselves as they try to unravel the mystery alongside Jeffries. <br/><br/>What I am trying to point out here is that the film is entertaining, but, like all Hitchcock films, it requires a different sort of attention span than a modern day film does. Sure, the film is about the same length as modern films usually are, but modern films have to have something exciting happen often, something usually in which the main character's life is threatened. Take for example ""I Robot."" The character played by Will Smith cannot go more than twenty minutes before he has problems with the androids in that movie. <br/><br/>Unlike ""I Robot"" ""Rear Window"" has the ability to just focus on the mystery and the development of the characters it has. This is not to say that the film is not interesting. Trying to unravel the mystery to ""Rear Window"" is fun, even though it means becoming a neighborhood watchdog like Jeffries. <br/><br/>Also, considering the year the film was made, the portrayal of the woman in the film is somewhat sympathetic, like in other Hitchcock classics including ""The Man Who Knew too Much."" Films from around the time, such as""The Three Faces of Eve"" have a tendency to look at all semi- strong woman as either loony or dangerous. ""Rear Window,"" however, has a very sympathetic strong female character in the form of Lisa (Grace Kelly). She goes with the nurse to dig up the plot of ground Jeffries believes the wife is buried in. She is the one who goes and gives Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr, known to television audiences as Perry Mason) a threatening note and even breaks into Thorwald's apartment, an event that becomes pivotal to the story in a way I will not mention, through a second story window while wearing high- heels. <br/><br/>In other words, the women of the story make up for Mr. Jeffries' weakness. <br/><br/>These are all reasons why ""Rear Window"" has stood the test of time. Although there are also other reasons, the film is fun to watch if you don't have to have something exciting happen every few minutes in order for the film to keep your attention. The mystery to the film makes watching ""Rear Window"" a lot of fun."

","Alfred Hitchcock finds a way to take a person who is doing the wrong thing and make him a hero, another example of the genius that was the director. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff Jeffries, a world famous photographer who broke his leg and is wheel-chair bound. In an age before video games, computers, cable TV, for that matter widespread TV viewing, boredom was adverted by leaving the apartment and doing something. Well, Jeffries and his wheel chair couldn't leave the apartment, so he has to fill his hours by eavesdropping on the neighbors across the courtyard from his bedroom. The entire apartment complex may be one of the greatest set designs of all time, an entire building as a set, looking fantastic, like an actual apartment that could be found anywhere, and the source for the success of the film. An unconvincing set, something that looks fake would take away from the real tension that ensues. Jeffries is wrong in watching all of his neighbors going through their lives each night, as we are told by his physical therapist, Stella (Thelma Ritter), tells him at the beginning of the movie. One night, while Jeffries is looking out the window while going in and out of sleep, he thinks he sees a neighbor kill someone (Raymond Burr). Not sure, he discusses it with his girlfriend, the radiant and beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, and convinces her to go over to the man's apartment to look for clues. That is the setup and Hitchcock pumps up the tension by allowing the audience to see everything the same way Jeffries does, through the rear window of his apartment. There are very few shots that do not originate from somewhere in Jeffries' apartment, a simplistic approach that makes it all seem so real. Hitchcock also fills all of the other apartments with characters that interest Jeffries and ourselves, plus adds a song writer to a studio apartment who supplies the soundtrack to the movie. Every detail shown early in the movie comes into play later in the movie. Hitchcock never cheats, and we are left wondering what will happen next. Rear Window may be the simplest movie ever made, proving you don't have to blow up 700 cars to create a truly tense and spine-tingling movie."

","Rear Window<br/><br/>
	Picture this: You're all alone in your apartment, dancing in your underwear when you suddenly stop cold.  The little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, and you get the feeling that someone is watching you dance the night away through your window.  Well, before you call the cops and tell them you have a peeping tom, why don't you wave at them because your peeping tom just might be...Jimmy Stewart.<br/><br/>
	Yes, Jimmy Stewart likes to look through peoples windows when they're in their underwear in the movie `Rear Window'.  And to tell you the truth, he does a pretty good job of it too.  Jimmy played a character named Jeff who was confined to a wheelchair in his apartment as a result of a broken leg. He was perfectly cynical, and his idleness, and curiosity of other people's private world was his downfall.  Jeff was like a stereotypical house wife who gets caught up in their `stories', or soap operas.  Jeff was becoming more and more absorbed in the private worlds outside of his rear window until he was finally sucked into that world in the shocking conclusion. Jimmy Stewart played this character with strength and established Jeff's cynicism, stubbornness and his meddlesome tendencies. 	<br/><br/>	But the viewer wasn't always paying attention to Jimmy and his paranoia, because there was often times something a little easier on the eyes on the screen.  The beautiful Grace Kelly played opposite of Jimmy Stewart.  Even though her beauty was undeniable, she was more hypnotic than anything else. It was in the way she delivered her lines with such, dare I say, grace.  Her parents weren't kidding when they named her after beauty.<br/><br/>
	Hitchcock used his resources to create beauty in every frame that appealed to all five senses and most emotions also.  And even more amazing is how he filmed the whole movie out of the little apartment, and made it both an interesting story which built to a fantastic crescendo, but his cinematic genius was also stimulating to the mind.  Hitchcock created visual metaphors of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs and of basic, raw humanity.  He accomplished this with his set that had a apartment building that symbolized the human state, with the rock bottom sad people in the lower apartments and the happy people in the top floor apartments.  <br/><br/>
	Hitchcock's film `Rear Window' had many levels much like his metaphorical apartment building.  And from every angle there was something to appreciate in this movie.  It captured beauty, it captured humanity, it reflected raw and polished life.  `Rear Window' is in every sense of the word `art'."

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a definite classic. The movie is about a successful photographer with a broken leg, whom is stuck in his apartment in a cast for 6 weeks. 	This story takes place during a one-week period, where this man has nothing to do but to stair out of his back window of his living room into a courtyard that is in the center of other apartment complexes. What is seen in the other apartments is a mystery you will have to reveal on your own. And when you do; you will be stunned with that you've concluded. 	Alfred Hitchcock did a brilliant job filming this story, as he does with all of his films. The different techniques that he uses play such an enormous part in this film. For example: when the man in the apartment tries to hide in a particular scene from another man, instead of running to another room, he scoots himself into a shadow, and it is so much more practical. The shadow across his face adds suspense and mystery that running away does not. <br/><br/>	Another powerful touch on the film was the soundtrack. All of the music and noise that is heard in this video are all from something going on in the scene. Whether it is the tapping of a hand on a table, or a man in his apartment across the courtyard playing his piano. None of the music was added in, it is all from the scene. Very Powerful!!!<br/><br/>	The movie as a whole is not necessarily a spook, but more of a possible murder mystery. This film is very good and gripping. Even though its not exactly scary, it still draws in its viewer. 	It is definitely a Hitchcock classic that all should see. It is definetly a respected film because of the way it was filmed my Hitchcock. So definetly check it out, you will not be disappointed!"

","`Rear Window' is an incredible mix of things; mystery, life lessons as lived within the perimeters of various stages of life, and romance. James Stewart portrays Jeff, an ambitious photographer who is temporarily on a wheelchair due to a work related accident. He believes to have witnessed a crime as he watched his neighbors' lives through the rear window of his apartment. The cinematography of Hitchcock's film is deserving of recognition, because it was the largest inside set of the time. The film's setting is inside Jeff's apartment throughout the duration of it, with one exception. Yet every single apartment watched through the apartment's window is so incredibly detailed and thanks to the filming allows the audience to capture all that goes on inside the far off windows. Hitchcock does an amazing job at carefully choosing the stages of life in which every one of Jeff's neighbors is going through. One woman is your typical lone heart; he gives us an aspiring musician, a ballerina, a newlywed couple, as well as a look inside a troubled marriage's apartment. These don't just stand for their clearly stated definitions, but also in a certain way reflect what Jeff's life is like. As he gives marriage a serious thought. Grace Kelly is portraying Lisa Carol Fremont, the woman Jeff is seeing and who represents an opposite of Jeff's character. She is rich and holds a high social status, and also deeply desires a commitment to Jeff. The chemistry created between Lisa and Jeff is reflected very well by the actors. Jeff is almost blinded to see the perfect woman throwing herself at him. The pace Rear Window starts off with is steady, yet seems to drag at about the middle of the film, making it hard for the audience to follow, again towards the end its faster pace is picked up again. This is recovered by the choice of inspirational and dynamic music continually played in the background of the film. Hitchcock demonstrates his geniality and incredible talent by the making of Rear window"
"henry-girling","10","3","5","28 November 2002"," One of Hitchcock's best
","This film, although ostensibly a murder mystery, is more about relationships. James Stewart marooned in his apartment overlooking the rear of his block sees into the windows of his neighbours and observes their stories. The girl dancer with the many admirers, the honeymoon couple, the woman without a partner, the couple with their beloved dog, the couple who quarrel, the happily married insurance nurse. And there is James Stewart and Grace Kelly, working out their relationship in a mature and modern way. The film weaves all these stories with the murder mystery hypnotically.<br/><br/>
Technically it is faultless. The editing is particularly good with things happening on several levels at once. The lighting gives a real impression of the movement of the day. The dialogue is wonderful and makes each character an individual. The actors do a sterling job. It is difficult not to be drawn into this world and feel the emotions of the people in it.<br/><br/>
Hitchcock shows himself not only as great director of the suspense film but a film maker able to see into the human heart. If we look into Rear Window we may find ourselves looking back out. More a rear mirror really."

","This is another good thriller of Hitchcock. James Stewart, as usual, was the selection as a leading actor together with the then nice Grace Kelly, always efficient supporting actress Thelma Ritter, a solid acting of Wendell Corey, and the villain Raymond Burr, who later in his career became the famous actor of the detective Perry Mason. The best is that the thriller does not show any particular violent scenes until its end when the wheelchair journalist (Stewart) was caught in his activities by the guilty man (Burr). Notwithstanding with this, the film keeps you always awaiting for a final discovery of the supposed killer. So watching the film you have entertainment, you may see the people's life of 50s, and you enjoy with the plot of the thriller.

","For the third time in the last five years or more! I saw this film again on TV.  It was preceded by a film about Hitchock so this time I was looking for his identity as a Director more than the content of the film.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the story, the acting from two great actors, and the very limited set.  There was no suspense that normally could be expected from a Hitchcock film, even taking account that I had seen it before.<br/><br/>The problem is that films date, we expect more now from writers, actors, producers and directors.  Everything moves on and up.  For example does anybody really enjoy silent movies anymore.  Would our children ever bother to see them?<br/><br/>Although current technology in film making does not replace good acting and a good storyline, it does save a film which is deficient in these.  We used to accept almost anything put on the magic screen, because it was an experience.  Now we want more. I wonder if the producers of the new Star Wars epic have learnt the lesson - not rely on any one of the following three, all are important, storyline first,  acting and then the effects to stimulate the senses.  Although I have not seen the film yet, and I will when it comes to the UK,  I suspect by the many negative comments that there is too much reliance on technology and not enough on story and acting.  I hope  I'm  wrong . If not, an ideal chance to get it right would have been missed .  I will reserve judgement."

","This was solid and I enjoyed it for the most part. One thing that took away from the film was Jimmy Stewart, he came off like a cry baby. I also had a hard time believing that a woman like Grace Kelly would waste her time with an old, out of shape, wimp. Stewart was good in Vertigo so I thought this would be similar, but his constant whining got to me. Stewart's physique was an embarrassment, can you say bird chest? And he is with Grace Kelly? I don't buy it. But if Jimmy Stewart's job in this role was to come across like a weak, egotistical, perverted twit, then he did good.<br/><br/>
I know it sounds like I'm complaining, but overall this movie is worth watching. I don't think this is Hitchcock's best however, I would give that nod to North by Northwest. Hitchcock is ill, so watch this and enjoy, just don't let all the Stewartisms ruin it for you."
"robert-temple-1","4","4","8","10 May 2017"," A very inferior Hitchcock film
","When this film was released, it was a big hit, but much of the reason for that was that Grace Kelly was in it, and she was the darling then. Also, people had not yet grown tired of James Stewart. But the film itself is contrived, artificial, tedious, unconvincing, and silly. Looking back now at the ethereal beauty of Grace Kelly, her perfect face, her perfect dainty profile, her perfect lips as she kisses, and her highly cultivated dreamy look which is meant to convince us that she is in love, it is a bit like remembering that one tried to eat the lace-like sugar ornament on the first wedding cake one encountered as a child: far too sweet, indeed sickly. The outrageous designer dresses and suits worn by Kelly in this film, including a ludicrously flouncy skirt, can perhaps be excused by the period, combined with a director indulging his well-known fantasies. But let's consider the film itself and what is wrong with it. For one thing, it is one of those films set in a single room which directors vainly imagine they can make compelling for the entire length of a film, but so rarely do. Alfred Hitchcock was notorious for preferring always to shoot in controlled studio conditions whenever he could, and would build whole exteriors inside a studio rather than step outside to the real thing where – what was it? – he was afraid of catching cold? No, it was insecurity and the need for control, especially control over those beautiful blonde victim actresses whom he wished to dominate either directly or through story lines. He could not kiss them himself, but he could have other people kiss them and film it. He could also punish them, or even murder them on screen. In this film, Grace Kelly is not killed, though she does have a serious scare. The story is about a press photographer who has broken his leg and is stranded in his small Manhattan apartment with his entire leg in plaster, sitting in a wheelchair by his large rear window. From there, he can spy on his neighbours, at first through binoculars, but later through a telephoto lens attached to his camera. It is summer in Manhattan, apparently August, when everyone in the 1950s was sweating and suffering from the heat, and air conditioners were not yet widespread. All the windows are open, one couple are sleeping at night on a mattress on an outside balcony, and everyone is on view, and one can hear everything and see everything. The photographer is played by James Stewart. He turns into a compulsive Peeping Tom because he is bored and, after all, he is a photographer who is always looking for things anyway. Stewart plays the role in his usual default manner, that of the droll and drawling good fellow. (His acting range was never broadband. He could always be counted on to be the same.) Grace Kelly flies in every evening in some fantasy gown or other to look after him. She professes that she adores him, loves him overwhelmingly, and why cannot they marry. He grumbles and complains both to her and his masseuse Thelma Ritter that Kelly isn't really what he is looking for. Pull the other unbroken leg! Grace Kelly not good enough for him? Try telling that to the public. The whole world was lusting after Grace Kelly at that moment, and tedious, drawling James Stewart wants to find someone better? How can she put up with him is the better question. And yet, this is what Hitchcock would have us believe. But she is having none of it, and will not be disposed of by her boring choice of husband-to-be. Being as well endowed with money as she is with good looks, she goes off to The 21 Club and orders a takeaway dinner for two. It arrives, carried by a man in a red bellhop uniform, and consists of a bottle of chilled Puligny Montrachet (of unimaginable expense in America then, and indeed now) and lobster thermidor. And thus her courtship of her reluctant photographer is carried out. She brings a small overnight bag because she is going to stay with him one night, and from it she pulls something long and silky. Shortly afterwards she emerges from the bedroom dressed in the most outrageous Hollywood floating negligee and strikes a pose in front of Stewart, asking him how he likes it (i.e., how he likes her). He remains indifferent. Surely erotic fantasy is here butting its head against a brick wall. Stewart remains more interested in spying on the neighbours. (Is he gay? What is his problem?) He rolls his jaw around and does a bit of drawling with it from time to time. Are there really no other takers on Kelly's Park Avenue? Must she really keep coming slumming in Lower Manhattan where her adored James Stewart overlooks a motley back yard with different small apartments inhabited by oddballs? (There is the usual irritating bad soprano practising her scales, an all too realistic touch, though we never see her.) Several of the oddballs are overdone, to say the least. The dancing girl in shorts is perhaps the most ridiculous. The story concerns Stewart believing that he may have witnessed the aftermath of a man murdering his invalid wife, cutting her body up and taking it away in stages in a metal suitcase. Everyone ridicules him for imagining this, but Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter end up believing him and try to collect additional evidence. This lengthy and languid attempt to keep us watching this dreary story is a complete waste of time."
"TxMike","Null","4","8","2 January 2002"," Considered one of Hitchcok's best, comes across a bit dated in the 21st century.
","Generally considered one of the best of all time, ""Rear Window"" is a very simple story filmed in the Hitchcock manner to provide suspense.  I rate it ""8"" of 10.  Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a world-traveling photographer confined for several weeks to his Greenwich Village apartment by a broken leg and cast up to the hip. He soon spends all his waking hours watching his apartment neighbors across the courtyard through his rear window, using binoculars and the telephoto lens and camera. Eye-candy is provided by 25-year-old Grace Kelly, in the same year she made ""Dial M for Murder"", and only a few years before she became Grace of Monaco. (Current starlet Julie Bowen of TV series ""Ed"" looks amazingly like Grace Kelly).<br/><br/>As Jeff watched neighbors, he becomes suspicious of one (Raymond Burr), a salesman with a wheelchair-bound wife who disappears suddenly on a rainy night. Clues he pieces together from his voyerism convinces him that she was murdered.  The police help only reluctantly, and Kelly actually goes into Burr's apartment at one point, is caught, is threatened, until police show up.  Burr in the final scene tries to throw Stewart out the window, is nabbed, Stewart falls, and the very final scene shows him in casts on both legs!<br/><br/>To accurately rate a film you have to compare it not only to what came out during the same era, but also everything since. With that criteria, I don't believe ""Rear Window"" is one of the best of all time.  Still, a pretty good flick."
"slaterspins","5","6","14","11 May 2009"," Through a Glass Not Darkly Enough
","First let me get this out of the way. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. But this simply is not one of my favorites. Usually movies based on noir writer Cornell Woolrich's plots work very well with his unusual twists and turns and core themes of nothing being as it 'seems' until in the end we see 'the truth' behind the facade. There's a little of that here, but just a little. It's as straightforward as possible. Yes, the set for this movie is wonderful. But the 'star' turns from Stewart, Kelly, Ritter, even Burr et. al, are a bit artificial. James Stewart, I have to admit, I've never liked in Hitchcock movies like 'Rope' or 'Man Who Knew Too Much' - his aw shucks, limited acting vocabulary doesn't stretch far. Grace Kelly - I don't believe she is in love with this man for a minute. Her accent is strange throughout and distracting and she is wooden - trying so hard to look beautiful she doesn't dare let a real expression cross her face. Her saving the day from afar is the last thing I'd expect this Patrician Figure to attempt - maybe Teresa Wright or even an Anna Massey, but not Grace. Thelma does her shtick - but does it to better effect in ALL ABOUT EVE. Burr seems a bit uncomfortable in the role of the one-note hapless villain and Judith Evelyn seems lost as sea as well in her rather thankless cameo as Ms. Lonelyhearts. She does her usual hysterical turn, but not as well as she does in THE TINGLER or FEMALE ON THE BEACH. There are some boring stretches along the way and too much artifice here - notwithstanding the interesting 'claustropobic' set, done just as well in LIFEBOAT as far as I'm concerned. The actors never seemed real people but 'stars' playing themselves. As such, they didn't provide enough interest for me as characters and helped keep the movie a bit 'flat'. The so-called climactic scene of Burr confronting Stweart was a real let-down. I can name a lot of H's movies that seemed scarier and more real, and had great photography too, such as THE BIRDS, MARNIE, and the excellently acted FRENZY. Not to mention the tension, editing and groundbreaking cinematic 'vision' seen in his early black and white pictures. But this seems to be everybody's favorite and that's fine with me, there's no right or wrong opinion. This one just doesn't grab me."
"pk_kenneth","6","5","11","16 February 2005"," I am disappointed
","I've known Hitchcock is the great ""master of suspense"" for a long long time. I've heard ""Rear Window"" is supposed to be a terrifying movie since I was a kid. I've spent a lot of effort in finding a copy of this film (which is not readily available even in HMV). And now, I feel I've just watched a below average thriller.<br/><br/>I can easily name a dozen of thrillers that gave me more excitement than this one. Is it because I've expected too much? Is it because I already knew the plot outline before watching it? Is it because the movie was made over 50 years ago? Or is it because I've already seen other movies (such as What Lies Beneth) with scenes that makes people think there is a murderer moving his wife's dead body out of the house? If this is truly the Masterpiece of the Master of Suspense, then all the above reason shouldn't be sufficient to add up and cause such a great difference between my expectation and my feelings towards the movie. And I don't understand why, in legal point of view, the left behind wedding ring is any stronger proof than the left behind alligator handbag to issue a search warrant. Overall I have not felt much tension throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I do appreciate the little details portrayed in this movie, such as the dialogues between Stewart and Kelly, lives of miss Loneyheart and miss Torso, the couple living above the Thorwalds, etc. But the ""suspense"" part? Sorry Hitchcock, I must say it is way too weak to be the ""Masterpiece of the Master of Suspense"". And Mr. Hitchcock, I've pinched myself, I know I'm still alive (if you have really said what is being written on the back of the DVD case)."
"slokes","8","5","11","22 December 2004"," Doot, Doot, Doot, Looking Out His Backdoor
","While recovering from a nasty leg injury, James Stewart finds himself looking out the back window of his apartment. Grace Kelly just wishes he'd look at her. Thelma Ritter wonders what's so special outside worth looking at. Raymond Burr wishes James looked at Miss Torso a little longer.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's directorial prowess is on full display in ""Rear Window,"" a film that IMDb viewers have made the 14th best in movie history. Not to burst your bubble, but Hitch made better flicks than this, like ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Strangers On A Train,"" ""The 39 Steps,"" and my all-time Hitchcock favorite, ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" But ""Rear Window"" is a hard film not to like, especially after you've seen it once or twice. The format is special, if not unique by Hitchcock standards, where we have a very controlled, limited setting, a man's Greenwich Village apartment that faces a courtyard and a number of apartment windows into various neighbors' lives. Think ""Lifeboat,"" ""Rope,"" or ""Dial M For Murder,"" only more varied. Instead of the people on the main set facing danger, they see apparent danger in a neighbor's dwelling, and sip adult beverages and chew fancy dinners while contemplating how to respond.<br/><br/>Making it more special is the fact Stewart and Kelly do much of the thinking. Stewart's L.B. Jeffries is the main character, a bored photographer of some repute laid up by an injury he suffered while covering an auto race. Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont is the high-profile, haute couture model used to wearing $1,100 gowns (in 1954!) and dining at Manhattan's 21 Club, but somehow willing to settle for Stewart amid all the Prince Rainier and Zoolander types she undoubtedly comes across.<br/><br/>However absurd, the central relationship is cemented by an apparent murder Jeffries thinks he witnesses, and Fremont comes to believe he did, involving a neighbor and his nagging wife. It's a bit of an irony, and a pretty marvelous one, that has Hitchcock celebrate one impeding marriage by making them apparent vultures in the untimely demise of another. Such was Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Great Greenwich Village ambiance, circa the early 1950s and ""My Sister Eileen/Wonderful Town"" rather than the drag queens and Stonewall riots of the near future. Boho artists co-exist with Miss Lonelyhearts-spinster types and costume jewelry salesmen that may be up to something more sinister, or not.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of Grace Kelly until that shot of her in Thorwald's apartment looking out the window while holding the purse upside down. Now I think she's swell. Thelma Ritter seems to have dropped in from a Neil Simon comedy next door, but she totally rules the scenes she's in. The set design, and the peeks at the neighbors, is especially well-wrought. That scene when Stewart and Miss Lonelyhearts share a silent, sad toast across the courtyard is one of cinema's finest moments.<br/><br/>While the mystery itself is kind of hokey and patly resolved, there's something special in the way it comes together on screen. It's one of Hitchcock's best meetings of comedy and suspense, and a great romance besides despite an early handicap (a beautiful, successful woman totally devoted to the leading man.) There's nothing to really dislike in this film, and while it's still not Hitch's best despite what all the IMDb voters say, it's a good-enough standard bearer for the best director cinema's ever known."

","One reviewer has pointed out that anyone who wanted to spy on his neighbours would surely prevent them from spying back on him. In fact everyone in this courtyard seems to perform in full exposure --- although there are one or two occasional exceptions. It is explained it is because the weather was very hot.<br/><br/>The fan-like structure of this movie is creative. The central theme, played out between Stewart and Kelly, concerns the relationship between the sexes. Every playlet observed through the window, offers an ingenious courtyard commentary on the variety of these relationships, from celibate solitude, via frantic partying, through loneliness, newly-weds and long-term marriage, to marital murder. The little dog seems to take the place of a kid; kids being otherwise relegated to the half-seen street at the back.<br/><br/>The dog, and its fate, is one of the two mysteries in the plot. What was the point of killing the little dog ? Why did murderer Burr bury something in a flower-bed ? What was it ? Did I miss something ? Seems completely pointless. He got rid of everything else by other means, simply enough. The other mystery which no-one seems to mention, concerns the curious black-clad female figure at one point seen emerging with Burr from his flat. Who was that ? Did I miss something ? Brilliant film, though. I like Grace Kelly. She is civilised because she says either, not eether."

Rear Window is something you don't see often in the cinema, Hitchcock had the freedom to take a ""crazy"" and tough idea into the work, and the fact that it's from 1954 it's mind blowing. With this film,Hitchcock was a child playing with a doll house, and he did it properly.
Nonetheless, the end seemed like they had some trouble deciding in the editing room, some of those choices seemed out of the style.

","1954's REAR WINDOW is my favorite of all of the Alfred Hitchock films. So when it came time to expose my college-aged children to the works of ""the Master of Suspense"", it was a ""no-brainer"" as to which film it would be.<br/><br/>And...they loved it.<br/><br/>Starring ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart and the always fabulous Grace Kelly, REAR WINDOW tells the tale of photographer L.B. Jefferies (Stewart) who is laid up in his New York apartment with a broken leg. His only means of entertainment is looking out of the ""rear window"" of his apartment into the courtyard - and the other apartments (and the people) therein.<br/><br/>This is a treatise on voyeurism and the pairing of this material with a master of film like Hitchcock is a marriage made in heaven. He sets up most of the movie so you are viewing the events as though you are Jefferies - confined to his apartment. Each apartment around the courtyard are their own little viewing boxes. He does a neat, subtle trick in this film. When he pans counter-clockwise, he is just browsing the apartments (like channel surfing on TV). When he pans clockwise - or goes straight to an apartment - he is focusing on that place/story. More often than not, the scenes in the apartments that Jefferies is looking at is mirroring what is going on in the relationship between Stewart and Kelly - sometimes with a sinister undertone. As always, Hitchcock ratchets up the suspense in a way only he can - focusing on a mundane item/thing until it becomes malevolent. This could have easily been a boring/static film, but in Hitchcock's capable hands, there is movement aplenty and the film flows beautifully.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Stewart has never been better as the audience stand-in/everyman who goes from charming scamp just snatching peeks of his neighbors to ""peeping-tom"" voyeur who is intruding in the private lives of his fellow courtyard denizens. Grace Kelly is just radiant in the way Hitchcock photographs her and in the way that all-time great costumer Edith Head dresses her. She is perfectly made-up and costumed to make her ""the most beautiful woman in the world"". But...what caught me in this viewing was how good of an acting job she does in this film. In previous viewings I was swept up in the look and feel of the actress. This time, I was taken in by the character and she became the one in this film I was rooting for. Well...either Grace Kelly or the great character actress Thelma Ritter as insurance nurse (and willing accomplice) Stella. She almost steals the movie from the two leads...almost.<br/><br/>All of the elements at play in this film work - acting, costuming, scenic design, cinematography and script - all wrapped up by a Master Director at the top of his game.<br/><br/>If you only watch one Alfred Hitchock film, make it REAR WINDOW.

","Why on earth a man, heterosexual and still relatively young, would spend his time looking out of his window when in his rooms there is a woman like Grace Kelly could be the real mystery left after watching Rear Window, the 1954 masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Besides this cheeky and impudent question, this is really a masterpiece, one of the films most loved by his director and one of his more sophisticated, both narratively as well as cinematographically. Loosely based on a relatively unknown 1942 short story written by Cornell Woolrich, It Had to Be Murder, Rear Window sees L.B. Jefferies, a successful photo reporter played with enough confidence and progressive involvement by James Stewart, confined in his New York small apartment with a broken and plastered leg. In the sweltering summer heat, he turns and focuses his attention and lenses to the neighbouring apartments facing his condo's backyard, observing them with a fast growing interest that rapidly becomes excited voyeurism when he starts suspecting that a uxoricide took place in an opposite flat. Albeit reluctantly, also his beautiful fiancée Lisa, a Grace Kelly whose first appearance in the film is one of the most esthetically captivating close ups in movies history and fully justifies the hot ice nickname given to her allegedly by Alfred Hitchcock, as well as both the solid, down to earth nurse Stella, caustically played by a vitriolic Thelma Ritter, and the reluctant detective Tom Doyle, a fairly stolid Wendell Corey full of banal common sense, are drawn into his obsession with what neighbour Lars Thorwald, an imposing Raymond Burr, might or might not have done to his nagging wife.<br/><br/>The opening credits reveal straight away one of the movie's multiple codes, when the curtains of James raise to reveal the fixed scene of the coming attraction, the very same back yard where all flats look into. From then on, a static journey begins that reverses many established principles of the 50s filmmaking: the main character does not move, all the other, secondary casts actually play in front of him. The viewer, barring a short yet important moment when James Stewart falls asleep, has the same point of view of the protagonist, sees and interprets the story through the eyes and expressions of him. The soundtrack comes from within the movie, mostly heard from one of the apartments where a musician is living.<br/><br/>All these filmic and narrative details, together with the crafted and perfect jigsaw of which each apartment and neighbours' live is a piece, are added to the self-conscious study of voyeurism and the essential role of cinema to make an essential film, where no shot, no dialogue is redundant, and an evergreen masterpiece, at the same time celebrating and subverting the Hollywood's codes.
This is not the only Hitchcock's movie constructed in a theatrical form, but in no other the British master was able to extremize with such genius and depth of analysis the intertwined relationships between the eye and the mind, mixing like an esoteric alchemist obsessions and humor, suspense and sexuality, flashing light and silent darkness, individuality and collectivity, reality and perceptions.

","I won't be the first to say it: how do you shoot an entire film about looking out over your porch and not lose a minute's pace? You call yourself Alfred Hitchcock, since it seems only he can and only he has donee so. You have to google this one BUT SOMEONE HAS created a montage of the entire view from the Rear Window, to watch! It's a perfect delivery for such a closed situation."

","We often see people in Hitchcock films who have a tendency to peep or to reflect the world through the lens of a peep. The rear window is a classic that takes Hitchcock's idiosyncrasy to its extreme. In the film, Hitchcock shows us the nature of the film. Film puts our peepers from the start point of view, namely the leg injured photographer Jeff's point of view, in Hitchcock's view, everyone has a voyeurism, the protagonist in the movie and the rest of us, but he is from the scene to watch the scenes of the eyes, and we can see through the hero's view is, not it is a microcosm of the world."
"garethcrook","10","1","1","16 April 2020"," Perfection.
","My joint favourite Hitchcock film (the other being North By Northwest). This is just perfection. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly and a cast of top class support flex their muscles through 2 hours of dramatic, mysterious, speculative bliss. If the apartment bound Jimmy Stewart isn't enough as the action hungry photographer in search of adventure from his wheelchair, you have his girlfriend Grace Kelly, bringing pure class with some socialite sophistication. J.B. (Stewart) really is punching way above his weight. On top of that you've got Thelma Ritter as nurse Stella with the razor sharp wit threatening to steal every scene she graces. J.B. is seeking danger, missing his assignments having acquired a broken leg in the last one two months ago. He thinks he's found it too, through his telephoto lens looking out of his rear window at a myriad of stories in every one of his neighbours apartments. He has an over active imagination, his paranoia growing at what he witnesses, much to the annoyance of Lisa (Kelly) who wants him to settle down and join her in respectable social circles. He draws you in though and Lisa too, who senses excitement as they find some much needed common ground and the conspiracy grows with each new snippet of information. It's a breath of fresh air, as the dialogue drops and we watch the windows, picking up fragments of sound and snap shots of actions. Almost like silent film in places. This is Hitchcock at the top of his game, ramping up the tension as we near the flawless finale with the danger dialled up and a killer on the loose! Surely everyone has seen this film? But on the off chance you've not, stop what you're doing and watch it right now."

","I love this movie a lot. The set design, cinematography, sound, and acting are all excellent as to be expected from a Hitchcock film. The movie is entirely shot from one bedroom and plays a lot with the theme of perspective. Hitchcock intentionally gives you a one sided perspective on Lars Thorwald, never revealing more than the characters in the movie would also know, making the mystery more intense and intriguing.
My one complaint is the relatively abrupt ending to the film. It isn't unsatisfying per se, but I wish more was revealed as to what actually happened with Lars Thorwald and his wife rather than leaving the audience bread crumbs of information."

","Rear Window may not be my favorite Hitchcock film, but it's still a timely classic thriller with a lot of influential material that has been passed down for years and years, there's an obvious reason why he's hailed as the master of suspense, he knows his style and he owns it proudly, wearing it right on his sleeve. I would say this is one of the best films for a newcomer of Hitchcock, and it has pretty much everything that makes a Hitchcock film just that, it has beautiful style and revealing cinematography, making the camera its own character, fully fleshed out characters that are built slowly from the beginning, and of course plenty of intensity and suspense revolving around this brutal murder mystery. It's sharp script helps elevate some of the more dated, for the times sort of material, which there's a decent amount here. And while the ending didn't satisfy me, it still has plenty of closure and a pretty cool final confrontation between the killer and Jeff, all led by fine performances which makes Rear Window a treat to watch every time."

"emmakenny-39680","9","1","1","11 December 2018"," Suspense through lighting
","Rear Window is a great example of Hitchcock's mastery of cinematography. This movie follows the story of Jefferies, an adventure seeking photographer that is stuck in his small apartment due to a leg injury he received while on the job. He resorts to finding entertainment by watching his neighbors through his rear window. When he notices some suspicious behavior from one of the occupants across the way his boring recovery becomes a lot more interesting. Through solving this mystery Jefferies learns a lot about himself, his relationships with others, and how people interact with each other.
This movie is a great example of using lights and shadows to create suspense. By having the entire movie filmed from one vantage point, Jeffeirie's apartment, the light was pretty restricted. However, Hitchcock creates amazing effects with minimal light. By using the window blinds to highlight certain parts of the room Hitchcock is able to make certain moments in the film more intense for the viewers. One of the most effective ways lighting was used to create suspense was by only having the eyes of the actors in the light. This made the characters more mysterious and invoked a sense of fear into the viewers.
Overall this was a fantastic film that incorporated the elements of cinematography extremely well and had a entertaining and captivating story line."
"namse","9","1","1","15 November 2018"," Best use of lighting in the history of cinema
","The Rear Windows showed the best type of lighting skills at that period of time when movie tools and techniques were not at the best. The whole movie kept audiences' attentions and tensions in them before the climax of the film. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to keep the movie so concentrated throughout the movie and the keylightings mixing lowkey light and highkey lights gave the highlight effects that helped mainly to make the mood or the atmosphere of the movie suspenseful. By putting really bright light on the face of the main character, it's triggering the audiences to look at his emotions and what he's thinking of the whole situation in the film. It was interesting that when, the main character, got into the shadow of his room, it made it seem like that he's no longer being seen by the neighbors outside through his window. The way the highkey lightings worked with the neighbor's building showed precisely what the neighbors do and how their lives are like. The angles of the camera also was interesting in a way when it shows the aspects of the neighbors lives, it uses the perspective shots as if the scene is seen with the character's eyes. This film shows really good side of the use of lights in the movies and demonstrate that only with the light, you could make the movie out of it."

","When watching 'Rear Window,' it was very prominent from the beginning that Alfred Hitchcock was a very talented director. He did a very good job at captivating the viewer and making them feel as if they were in the apartment instead of Jeffries. The way the film was shot made it seem like you were right there looking across at the other apartments instead of watching Jeffries do it. It was impressive that Hitchcock was able to build such a complex storyline with the main character stuck in his apartment the whole time. A good portion of the beginning of the movie is spent setting up all the different characters so that the viewer has a complete understanding of what is happening in the film. He portrays the smaller storylines in the film just as successfully as he does for the main one. They don't have a massive impact on the film but they force the viewers to become very observant and focus on more than one aspect of the film. We see the ups and down of the musician, the daily routine of the dancer and the artist on the bottom level as well as the main storyline with the salesman.
Hitchcock also did a very good job at incorporating many different genres into this film. This keeps it from being one sided and keeps the viewers entertained. There's the obvious mystery aspect of the film to start, which was the most prominent genre to viewers. The whole premise of the movie is Jeffries trying to solve the mystery of what is happening in the apartment across from him. Secondly, there is the thriller feel to the film. This is what keeps the viewers on their seats and guessing throughout the movie. We are finding out information at the same time Jeffries is, so the viewers are surprised by the same things he is. Thirdly, there is the romantic part of the film with Jeffries and Lisa. This is one of the genres that makes the movie so complex. Along with the various other storylines in the movie there is relationship between Lisa and Jeffries that we see develop throughout the movie. Lastly, there is a somewhat light comedic feel to the movie at some parts. The majority is not even somewhat related to comedy but there are few scenes that have a lighter and more relaxed feel that makes the movie even better-rounded.
Lastly, Hitchcock did a very good job using mise-en-scene in this film. The detail that is in each scene of this movie is one of the main things that makes it so good. If you look in the background of each scene everything is perfect in comparison to the character that it is with. For example, in Jeffries' apartment if you look in the background it isn't just any normal apartment. You can see various items that correspond with his career as a photographer that make you view his apartment as a whole along with Jeffries, not as two separate parts of the film. Hitchcock also did a very good job with mise-en-scene when it came to the apartments across from Jeffries. Each separate apartment is like a completely different lifestyle. You see the people all around the salesman's apartment living their everyday lives as if nothing's wrong throughout the movie. He doesn't just dial in on that one apartment for the rest of the movie once we find out something isn't right, the apartment becomes the main focus, but not the only focus. We still throughout the movie see the other characters going about their business."
"gkeaton-15549","8","1","1","15 February 2018"," A Gripping Exciting Film
","The movie Rear Window which was released in 1954 and directed by Alfred Hitchcock has proven to be a gripping and exciting movie that leads the viewer through a mystery. The main character L.B. Jeffries, played by James Steward, investigates a murder that he believed happened but has no real evidence to prove which he acts wonderfully in and makes the movie very exciting. This movie makes one evaluate the freedom that we have but also makes the viewer question is what L.B. Jeffries saw something that he should be concerned about and is he disrespecting others privacy.<br/><br/>The main theme in the movie gives it an interesting feeling because of the general plot that is around what Jeffries sees when he looks out his window and spies on his neighbors. The way that the plot goes it suggests from the beginning that there is going to be a problem at some point because of the way that the dialog goes. From this when Jeffries is talking to Stella it seems clear that he is looking out the window too much and paying attention in a way to other people where he is seeing more than they may want to make public. At first, when Lisa Fermont comes to the apartment it seems that she is going to be able to talk some sense into Jeffries telling him that the observations that he is making are crazy, but then she ends up believing him and just contributing to his observations and obsession to see what his neighbors are doing. But, as the movie goes on we learn that the events he is seeing may not be so far-fetched and the evidence starts to build up suggesting that his neighbor Thorwald might have killed his wife. In the end, Doyle realizes that he was wrong and even though that Jeffries might have been going a little crazy he was still sure of what he saw in the window which was proven to not be in his imagination in the end.<br/><br/>The movie gets even more suspicious when a detective friend of L.B. Jeffries, Thomas Doyle played by Wendell Corey, enters and initially doubts Jeffries because of circumstantial evidence. This is just the beginning of the character development for Doyle who starts doubting Jeffries then evolves over time to believe him more and eventually agree with accusing Thorwald of the murder. While Doyle may doubt Jeffries and his friends originally and want to have no part of the case, I believe that he eventually comes to realize that he knows Jeffries and that he may not be that crazy after all. This leads him to take another look at the case after Jeffries and Lisa Freemont find more evidence that suggests that the letter and things Doyle has found may not be true.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is very good and makes what is a small space feel very big and exciting with many different camera angles and tricks used. This is one of the largest factors that makes the movie exciting with the cuts from window to window and across the alley which show in an exciting way what is going on in all the different apartments. The cinematography is what makes the movie interesting because if it were shot in a different way the movie could very easily lose the viewers' attention. One of the most important and interesting shots in the movie is the opening shot where the camera pans through the alley setting the scene. This is very important because it really establishes the location where the events take place with a type of camera movement that we do not see many other times in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I would definitely recommend this movie to others because of the good cinematography, exciting storyline and good actors and actresses. I would give this movie an 8/10."

","Rear window is a mystery thriller movie that focus on the male protagonist Jefferies life and way he helps capture the murderer. He always seen looking at the neighbor's window. He broke his legs and always shown sitting on the wheel chair. He keeps his eye on different activities of neighbor through windows. Some neighbors are alone and some have job and some with wife. however, movie is mainly tell the story of Jeff try to prove the salesman crime, a neighbor of Jefferies who he believe murder his wife. And trying to get off from police eyes. 
 The movie was shot in same neighborhood area till the end. The event takes place in same area from beginning of movie to the end of movies. it is entire shot indoor set design. Only outside scene movie show is the glance of helicopter up above the building. Here, helicopter is use as mese en scene because adding scene of helicopter create suspense thought. Since, male protagonist could not able to walk, everything happens around him. The usage of sound in scary tone is brilliantly executed. The film not one focus on one-character story but also briefly take a peak story of lonely women and pianist guy. A movie is not much scary as I expected it to be. But full of suspense.it express the pain of loneliness, boredom, happiness and thirst for love. A scene when lonely women is having a candle light dinner but creep me out when she pretends to be with guy. This resemble the pain of being loneliness and boredom. Well, Jeffries neighborhood is not friendly and cooperative. The environment is fill with loneliness feeling. 
 The movie feature point of view shot to some extent. in movies, it uses this idea when, Alfred focus on antagonist with closer angle of camera, showing suspicious face expression or covering detail of character. This point of view shot also use whenever, Jeffries try to keep tract of the activities of salesman. 
 The story is arranged structurally. When no one believe protagonist story, even his girlfriend and detective friend don't believe in his story. but he himself decide to find the truth, kind of show the behavior of true detective. He uses his professional skill to find the true face of salesman. But later on, his girlfriend believes his story when she herself see the suspicious activities of salesman. This scene put life to the movie. It is always better to see when two lovers believe one another and together trying to solve the case. There is also a scene when hint of antagonist cruelty is displayed. when innocent dog is found dead, everyone come out expect the salesman. this event easily increases the viewer suspicion toward salesman.
 The suspicious act begins when male protagonist heard the scream of women but next day he did not see the wife of salesmen in bed. This unexpected scene, take movie plot into different track. From this scene, begin the real fun for suspense lover audience. Before this scene, a film Is not much entertainable. 
 There are lots of movement of camera going on because to show other characters from the perspective of main protagonist. The background sound of children scream in movie is nicely projected by sound designer. It creates fun full environment in movie for brief period of time. Visual artist uses dark color to symbolize the scary and suspense scene. At the end of the move the look of antagonist when Kelly shows ring to Jeff show the guilty expression on the face of salesman. The silence on phone, sound of walking on stair, suddenly showing antagonist in dark and the panicking expression of protagonist really feature super scary scenes. Because everything happens inside small windows. it feels like watching a tv. Like most film this film also ends happily. A dancer lover come from war, criminal accept crime, Jeff girlfriend spend time with him and lonely neighbor woman chatting with pianist."
"pcr-05045","9","1","1","8 February 2018"," My Thoughts on Rear Window
","This movie was something I would have never expected. As a freshman in college I have always been into the more modern things in life. New movies, new cars, new everything. I have never really been known for watching old movies.
However, this movie was a lot different to me. When I think of a movie from 1954, I was thinking of black and white or silent or just something that doesn't seem as much of an interest to me. This movie passed my expectations by a mile.
I have heard of Alfred Hitchcock and I have heard of the credibility of the man but I have never really watched any of his work. Rear Window was a story that I will probably remember for a long time. A man is in a wheel chair and all he does is watch the city go about around him from day to night. He experiences everything from happiness to sadness and even a murder. The whole movie was eye pleasing and just well thought out. The use of the city to display emotion in the movie was wonderful.
The main part of the movie that really stuck with me was the suspense within it. Every time the main character, L.B. Jefferies, would just look through people's windows and he thought they were looking at them just made me feel fear knowing that they could see him watching them. His caretaker, Stella, made it worse by talking about how he could go to jail for looking through people's windows and I thought that was foreshadowing to him actually going to jail which made me nervous each time it was a close call. Especially when Lars Thorwald was looking out the window and he had to hide in the shadows. This movie also had me asking ""What happens next?"" as it took our hand and brought us through this great story.
What makes a movie great is what ever emotions are going on, you feel them as well. This movie did that very well, any sort of fear, I felt fear. Any sort of happiness, I felt. Any sadness, I felt that too. Being able to bestow emotions onto the viewer is what means a movie is really well thought out and put together to try and help us be in the shoes of L.B. Jeffries. I could feel myself in that little apartment in that wheelchair and just watching everything going on.
Another thing done really well was character development. I could really tell the personality and how each character would react in these situations. You could really tell the social classes within each person based on how they dressed and how they act which really shows the problem with the love interest throughout the movie. Each character out the window had their own personalities and you could really see who the people in their apartment were and how they acted. It really shows how a city is back in that time, there is such different events happening in each room and the amount of people really creates the chaos that is in the bustling cities we had back then and what we have today.
Do I recommend this movie? Absolutely, this movie was very well made and put together and just looks beautiful. From the characters to the story, it was practically flawless in my opinion. Would I watch this movie again? Yes, I would, it is just so interesting and I feel like it is a kind of movie that the more times you watch it, the more times you realize something new. Do I recommend this movie? Yes, I do."

","'Rear Window' is a prime example of taking a simple idea and making it a masterpiece. The film manages to appeal to a broad range of our emotions including suspense, romance, and excitement thanks to the creative yet simple way it is filmed and directed. Right away the film begins by familiarizing the viewers with the scene where most of the story takes place, by showing us the busy view outside of Jefferies rear window. Each neighbor has an interesting and unique personality that makes it really feel like any of them could be the the main subject of the story. They're all cleverly named to match their personalities and it makes it very easy for the viewer to associate themselves with them by name almost immediately. For a film that has such a small set, it makes the best of it by really making all of the other apartments come to life with their own unique quirks and lifestyles that we get to see through the lense of Jefferies rear window. <br/><br/>The first act of the film mostly focuses on the life of all the neighbors and the relationship between Lisa and Jefferies. By doing this the viewer really becomes comfortable and familiar with all of the characters to the point of understanding them and their feelings. It is an interesting love story between Jefferies and Lisa. Lisa is in love with Jeff, and Jeff seems to think that she is too good and too perfect to be with a guy like her. I think this is a wonderful way to introduce the viewers to the main characters of the story and make them feel involved in the outcome of their situation. <br/><br/>It is right when it seems like there is much more to come between Jeff and Lisa that the story seems to have a sudden dramatic shift in tone, to more of a crime mystery film that is filled with suspense. It is in this portion of the movie where the way it is filmed really makes the viewer feel connected to the story. Jeff, who has been sitting in his window watching his neighbors lives very closely begins to notice something is out of place one night when he spots Mr. Thorwald leaving his apartment a few times very late at night. Since almost all of what the viewers have seen is through the eyes of Jefferies, we are inclined to also have the same biases and train of thought as him as well. So any conclusions he makes, it is easy for us to agree with him.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of having the viewer question if Jefferies is right or not when in introduces the character Detective Doyle. This is the first time we get to see someones opinion on the possible crime that isn't from our narrowed perspective we get from Jefferies. To me this was when it started to become more and more apparent that everything we had been learning about Thorwald and the criminal picture Jefferies had been painting of him could have been wrong. I think this forced perspective we are given is one of the most beautiful elements of the film and it all leads up to the end where we are in Jefferies apartment listening for footsteps outside the door, fearing for our lives. As viewers we become almost one with Jefferies, so we feel the same rushes of emotion as him as well. This perspective is what allowed Alfred Hitchcock to take a beautifully simple story, but use the power of a film camera to really make it a wonderful story with a cast of beautifully individual characters and stories as seen through the eyes of our main character."

","I must admit, I was skeptical at first about Hitchcock's suspense thriller ""Rear Window."" It's just another older film with the same murder-mystery plot to it where the protagonist sees a murder, has a relationship with some woman from the police academy, then gets in a final showdown with the main antagonist. They arrest the antagonist, and everyone goes on their merry way.<br/><br/>Boy was I caught off guard by how well this movie was made. <br/><br/>Taking place in 1950s New York City, it had a very nostalgic feeling in the introduction. Using Hitchcock's signature opening style, we glimpse into the life of a recently handicapped photographer who looks out his window and observes his neighborhood. This was unlike any other movie I have ever seen, in that the movie only has about four or five viewpoints: Jeff's view, looking into Jeff's room, looking out Jeff's window from farther back in his room, and through the magnified lenses to name most of them.<br/><br/>Contrary to my original belief that a film needs to be fluid with its location, ""Rear Window"" completely changed my opinion on the matter. <br/><br/>The focus on the minor characters was also very impressive. Each minor character, although not interactive, these characters let us peer into the life and blood of the courtyard where Jeff lives. <br/><br/>A scream and sob in the night, and the dog is dead. Why did this have to happen? I mean it added a whole new level of seriousness to the film, but why the cute innocent dog? This is actually a very good decision on their part but it probably hurt me more than it hurt the dog's owners. I hate it when animals die.<br/><br/>Going off of that, most action occurs in the dark. This is immaculate use of mise-en-scène; it gives the scene a much more serious undertone. If the action took place during the day, then the scenes would not be as effective. <br/><br/>Miss Lonelyhearts is a sad woman who lives in the bottom of Jeff's courtyard. She has been struggling romantically, as portrayed by the mise-en-scène of her apartment. The apartment gives off the vibe that it is full of things yet still missing something. This is truly apparent when she is sitting and eating dinner by herself and sobbing.<br/><br/>Jeff's musical neighbor that lives in the studio apartment always has a party. The composer that lives there loves his piano, and actually plays a significant part in the plot by getting Miss Lonelyheart's attention.<br/><br/>The only area that I feel that this film falls short is in some of the character development.<br/><br/>Why does Lisa think it's a good idea to go into the murderer's apartment? I mean, sure she got the ring, but this was probably the one of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen made by a director in a live action film. Second only to the decision made by Rian Johnson, the director of Disney's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" to have Princess Leia suddenly become force sensitive and use the force to re-enter the rebel ship. I guess Lisa had to do something like ""make a daring attempt to retrieve the wedding ring of Mrs. Thorwald (and succeed) that may or may not even be in the murderer's apartment"" to move the plot forward. <br/><br/>The other question about the film has got to be, ""why does the ballet dancer even exist in the script?"" The only reason I can see for her being written into the script is to draw attention to the outside world. In the word's of Alfred Hitchcock himself, ""I'll bet you that nine out of ten people, if they see a woman across the courtyard undressing for bed...will stay and look.""<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a great watch. I recommend it to all Hitchcock fans everywhere!"

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is an excellent film and undoubtedly a cinematic classic that will stand the test of time. In the film the main character has broken his leg working as a photographer covering a racing event and getting hit by one of the cars. Trapped in his apartment his only source of entertainment is staring into the lives of his neighbors through his rear window, much to the chagrin of his doting nurse(Thelma Ritter). After spending so much time watching he begins to notice something is going on in the other apartment and begins to suspect his neighbor of murder.
Most of the film the characters and thus the audience is always doubting weather or not something sinister is actually occurring. Facts are scarce to go on and a peeping tom's gut feeling certainly won't hold up in court. At several points the other characters insist that nothing is unusual about it. The audience is made aware of the improbability constantly by the nurse and the girlfriend and even a detective that had an investigation put into effect. And yet there is just enough to go on to maintain that uncertainty. Just enough is off to keep the audience wondering, ""Well yea,I'm sure that's not the case, but maybe...""
This potential murder is not the only thing for you to worry about though. Each and every one of the neighbors seems to have something going on that seems to raise concern. Hitchcock keeps the audience guessing by quickly reeling to other neighbors in distress all to further muddle the mystery of it all. Is it a murder mystery or is it a social commentary on the horrors of marriage? Or how about a love-lost emotional tragedy? Maybe the film is about depression overtaking what might have been an incredible music career. Even the struggles of Jeffries(James Stewart) and his girlfriend(Grace Kelly) are compelling and leave the audience wondering if that is the true crux of the film. 
The film demonstrates just how incredible Hitchcock is at creating suspense. As the story unfolds little clues become to grow bigger and bigger until it is all but certain there is an incredibly dangerous man among their town. This is made all the more unsettling for the audience because so much of the film is shot in point of view. Jeffries frequently observes his neighbors using binoculars and his long lense camera. Each time he does so the shot cuts to what Jeffries is seeing. When he sees something disturbing, we see something disturbing. When he sees alarming signs we see alarming signs. When he sees a murder staring him down, realising he has been made out, we see the murderer staring us down.
However the film is not without its faults. And unfortunately the biggest fault is an unusual one to have. The movie is too good. Hitchcock is a master of his craft and manages to make such a compelling narrative with so an absurd amount of suspense leading up to the climax. It is a truly enthralling film to be sure. So captivatingly suspenseful in fact that it fails to produce a satisfying conclusion. After an hour and a half of such incredible build up it is almost inevitable that the ending would be less than what you would hope for. It is by no means a bad ending, and actually on paper it does indeed seem perfectly fitting. However lack of music cues, distracting changes in framerate and strange dialog that lets the air out at the time when it should be most gripping undercut what could have been a masterpiece. 
Do not misconstrue this to mean that it is a bad film. Rear Window is indeed something to behold. While it is unfortunate that the end does not in my opinion manage to support the weight of the rest of the film, it does not detract the gravatias the rest of the movie produces. This is undoubtedly some of the best work film has to offer, faults and all."
"gtim735","9","1","1","7 February 2018"," Up to Alfred Hitchcock's Standards
","Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock come with the expectation that they will be of high quality and Rear Window fully lives up to this expectation. Rear Window is a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller movie. Hitchcock perfectly blends together a mixture of mystery, suspense, and sexual attraction.
The main character can see into multiple apartments from his position, and every one of those apartments has occupants that show different places in life. There is a newlywed couple, a bachelor who drinks, an attractive young single woman, a content single woman, a lonely single woman, an average married couple, and a married couple who fights. All of these apartments represent different groups of people. Hitchcock tells this whole story without ever leaving the small courtyard between the apartments. The only glimpse of the outside world that the audience sees is through a narrow alleyway that shows normal life going on outside of the courtyard.
Hitchcock takes the viewers along on a ride with the main character. The audience is given small bits of information as the main character discovers them. This slow building of knowledge allows the audience to piece together what has happened for themselves.
From the first interaction of two characters, there is a hint that something bad will happen. The first lines from Jeff's nurse is a warning that he will get into trouble if he keeps looking in other peoples windows. The audience is left to question what they have seen, what they think they have seen, their doubts about the crime, and what all of these add up to. Viewers are lead to believe the same things as the main character, Jeff, assumes based off what he sees. Once the main character's girlfriend, Lisa, gets involved what she says and does suggest to the viewer that maybe Jeff is wrong, maybe he has gone stir crazy from sitting in his wheelchair from weeks. Jeff's nurse and girlfriend doubt his observations and lead the audience to question his thinking too. 
Much of the interactions between the neighbors is just visual, leaving some ambiguity as to what is actually going on. The audience only hears murmurs and partial sentences coming from the other apartments and must rely on visual cues to know what is taking place in the apartment. This type of acting is part of Hitchcock's style, he once said, ""If it's a good movie, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on"". Non-verbal acting is very well used in the moment when the main character's girlfriend finally believes that a murder has been committed. Without saying a word she looks past Jeff and out the window with a look of horror on her face.
Hitchcock also mixes in a sub-story of the relationship between Jeff and Lisa within the main story of proving that Mr. Thorwald killed his wife. This mixing of the two stories helps to fill some of the less eventful moments by revealing more about their relationship. Showing the audience more about the relationship the two share also gives more depth to the conversations between Jeff and Lisa.
My one disappointment, though it is a small one, is the ending of this film. Hitchcock does an enchanting job of creating immense suspense building up to the confrontation between the main character and the killer and pulls the viewer right in. The suspense is broken with the main character being forced out the window and is partially caught in a very dramatic grand finale. What is disappointing is the almost immediate wrap up of the murder case. Once caught the killer does not put up a fight and he confesses to where the body is hidden and what the dog was searching for under the flowers. Though the main focus of this film is not the logistics side of police work to convict the criminal, it would have been nice to have that part played out a bit more. The immediate confession of our killer gives a feeling of rushing and quick script writing that takes away from the otherwise enthralling film."
"carfanatic-71053","8","1","1","6 February 2018"," Rear Window Film Class Review
","The rear window was a very good film. I sat by right with Jeff wondering if Lars was the killer. I felt helpless and trapped when poor Lisa was caught snooping around the apartment with no one there to help her. I felt as though she was calling out for me, and I couldn't do anything. Just sitting there witnessing the events, just like Jeff through his window. Hitchcock can achieve this remarkable state of suspense through the types of camera shots he chooses to take throughout the film. 
The majority of the film is point of view, specifically from Jeff's point of view. The three part shot that Hitchcock employs captures the viewer and places him in the wheelchair. Scenes of Jeff peering through the window, then cutting back to see what he is looking at. When we see it we can form an opinion and a reaction for ourselves, then the shot moves back to Jeff where he is showing us what his opinion of the events are. It could be a subtle smile or an investigative glare, but we are right there smiling or glaring along with him. This connection fuels the tone for the rest of the movie because Jeff is in a wheelchair. The wheelchair confines him, makes him look through the windows. Since we connect with Jeff we also feel confined, helpless at times peering through the screen. 
The use of the windows and sound also create that feeling of what if. What if Lars didn't kill his wife? What if we are watching something private that was not meant to be seen? The windows are full of private moments, scandalous and humorous moments alike. Who is to say the investigating we are doing is right? These people only allow us to see windows into their lives, with little context. If we are wrong about Lars then are we now the bad people? This doubt was brought to life by Doyle, the police officer. He did not take much interest in the window unless it was the ballerina dancer. He seemed to have an answer for evert conspiracy that Jeff throws at him. It seems to us the Jeff, and the audience with him is just cruising down a dead-end street. Instead of being super sleuths we are degraded to no more than creeps that stare at people through the window. This is all brought about by the suspense generated in the film. The highs and lows we experience, and this could not be done without the windows.
What creates the suspense and wonder is not what is shown to us. It is created the parts we can't see. The division of the scene by the windows and buildings. Characters in the same house even seen disjointed by the separation. Lars and his wife in the beginning did not seem that close because we rarely saw them in the same window. We could tell that their relationship was strained. Another effect the windows have is that we never see the whole scene much like we never really know the whole story until the end when Lars confronts Jeff in his own home. No more looking through the windows to find out what happens at that point, we can see the whole scene. Much like what the windows did visually the use of sound does auditorily. Laughter and screams can be heard clearly but no other context can be heard. Are we watching an argument? Playful banter between a husband and wife? We cannot draw a solid conclusion on the topic because we do not have all of the information much like Jeff when trying to find Lars guilty of killing his wife."
"jackfu-91821","10","1","1","6 February 2018"," A masterpiece of pure Hitchcock brilliance
","What do one usually see when they look out their back window? Some see trees and birds, others just see brick walls. ""Rear Window"" on the other hand lets us see the everyday, and not so everyday antics of nearby neighbors.
 A picture of a man, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, who's amazing determination to report on stories has landed him with a broken leg and the inability to capture the sights of the world through his beloved camera, which ironically caused him to end up in this condition. Being stuck in his bed all day, Jeff's only means of communication with the outside world is the window near his bed which he stares out of all day, secretly spying on his neighbors and their everyday antics.
 Through this window, we get a unique glimpse into everyday life during the 1950's. All accompanied by a panning camera that illustrates Jeff's point of view. Dogs are playing, women are cleaning and hanging clothes, and various people are walking around with nothing else better to do.
 But it's after the sun sets that the darker nature of the neighborhood is truly revealed. Through a unique shot of the camera, we see two rooms of an apartment divided by a water pipe that perfectly orchestrates the divided feelings that the couple in the apartment feel towards each other. After a scream in the night, Jeff wakens to find the husband of the woman in the window quickly leaving the apartment, with the woman nowhere to be seen. It is through this view of the window that Jeff comes to the conclusion that the man must have murdered his wife and is planning a quick getaway.
Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to make a suspenseful murder mystery film. He is well known for that after all, having made Vertigo in 1958 just four years year after this film and also starring Jeff Bridges in the main role. Both films are masterful at suspense, and manage to perfectly play out their plotlines with intense visuals and complex themes.
The shadows in this film perfectly represent the dark intentions of Jeff's neighbor and the underlying mystery of the film. Every major event happens either in the evening or at night. Jeff appears to be the only one who notices before those close to him also begin to follow along with his paranoia after seeing possible evidence themselves. During the day everyone is happy and nothing appears wrong, but during the night screams are heard, dogs are killed, and people leave their apartments. The night rules during this movie, as it tends to do with Hitchcock's other films.
Hitchcock gives us a unique camera perspective on the situation at hand. We see the apartments through Jeff's eyes. We are barely able to hear what's going on, but see enough to get either intrigued or suspicious at whatever these neighbors are doing. They say it is not nice to spy on others, but in this case we must use whatever we can get to figure out whether or not jeff's paranoia is justified. 
Under most circumstances, most people would go crazy if they were just locked up in a room with nothing to do all day. This makes it seem as if Jeff is going crazy due to his isolation in that room. If I were in his position, I'd almost certainly be using my imagination on whatever I saw to keep myself occupied. We believe that Jeff is crazy at first, but through his perspective, the mystery slowly begins to come together, and the truth becomes realized.
In conclusion, Alfred Hitchcock has made one of his finest films ever and it is a highly recommended treat to anyone. What kind of perspective will you have on the movie? Be prepared to figure it out for yourself."
"ginoplacella","10","1","1","6 February 2018"," Hitchcock and The Camera
","The film Rear Window from the great mind of Alfred Hitchcock follows a photographer of the name L.B. Jefferies as he observes his neighbors and sees things that maybe he shouldn't have seen. Throughout the film Hitchcock took many artistic strides with the camera. Some of these skills included representing the audience's eyes in terms of the camera as well as setting the stage with Mise en Scene. Hitchcock really applied the art of Mise en Scene with the arrangement of the set of the film as well as the way he portrayed the main characters point of view through the film. 
 Hitchcock takes the camera to film the set in the eyes of the main character. This is known as a point of view shot. Hitchcock uses this to represent how the character is feeling depending on what he is seeing through the other windows of his neighbors. One example of this and how is applies to the Mise en Scene is when Jefferies first notices Thorwald and his wife. Hitchcock takes the actions that are occurring in the other apartment and films the events. He then cuts back to Jeffries to show his reaction. After his reaction is recorded, Hitchcock goes back to the events to help proceed the scene. Mise en Scene is shown in the arrangement of the shots and how the stage/set is filmed. Hitchcock uses the small apartment corner and the point of view shots to help describe the scenery without having to explain it. In some instances, the scenery or set can show how the character is feeling.
 One scene where Thorwald is smoking in a dark room describes the feelings of the main character Jefferies. The darkness surrounding Thorwald shows that the main character is nervous or even scared of what has happened and even what could occur if Thorwald would have spotted him snooping. Mise en scene is also represented by the way Hitchcock captures the scenery. Hitchcock uses the ability to have the camera pan the entire scene with the way the set is made. With this Hitchcock really uses a slow movement pan to represent the eyes of a character or the eyes of audience. Hitchcock used this slow movement to set the stage for the film as well as make the audience believe they are they. This will lead the audience to see other things in the eyes of the main character and believe in them not just see it as a film. 
 Hitchcock also uses Mise en Scene to develop environmental feelings as well. One scene takes the audio, set, camera, and use of the point of view of the main character to make the audience feel as though they are experiencing the same uncomfortable suspense that the main character is feeling. This scene consists of Thorwald coming up to Jefferies room after seeing him snooping from his apartment. From this point we can hear Thorwald coming up the stairs and that's all we can hear. Hitchcock takes this opportunity to show the rest of the room from the eyes of Jefferies to show of nervous he is by trying to find a place to hide. This builds suspense for the audience as well by not knowing what will happen to the character once Thorwald gets to the door was well as now knowing when Thorwald will get to the door. 
Hitchcock also uses the opportunity when Jefferies almost believes that he is wrong to show the rest of the apartment. This happens towards the end of the movie. This is very interesting because Hitchcock only shows the outside setting of the apartments never the inside of Jefferies unless it's a shot of the character. However, once Jefferies finalize realizes his snooping is illegal and plainly not right the camera angles shown of Jefferies are different. Instead of showing Jefferies with the rear windows of his apartment behind him, Hitchcock takes the opportunity to show Jefferies with the rest of his apartment behind him such as the bathroom and fireplace that has not been seen until this time. Hitchcock uses Mise en Scene throughout this film whether to describe the feelings of the character to help apply to the audience or just setting the scene for the film itself."
"jakecolucci","10","1","1","6 February 2018"," Hitchcock Does it Again
","Rear Window is at its core is about a man stuck in a wheelchair who witnesses a murder outside his window. However, we learn so much more about the story and the characters throughout this film. Alfred Hitchcock uses various cinematic techniques to advance the plot, develop characters and tell the story in an interesting way.
 One interesting thing Hitchcock did was he gave the main character L.B. Jefferies a restriction. He couldn't leave his apartment due to his leg so he was bound to a wheelchair and also bound to that one room. This handicap not only handicaps the character but also the way the story can be told. Throughout the movie the camera never leaves the room and the whole story has to be told from in Jefferies' apartment. However the story was told so well, and interestingly that the story feels so much bigger than one room. It feels like it's also told elsewhere when in reality it isn't. Not only are we stuck in this room, we are stuck with the obstructions of the room. We can never clearly see what is going on in surrounding apartments and when a neighbor plays music loudly, we the viewer lose our hearing as well. This realistic storytelling made for a very interesting and suspenseful movie. As much as we wanted to see outside the room, we were always stuck with L.B Jefferies . It added a whole new layer to this movie that made it quite interesting. 
 Another technique used by Hitchcock was the Mise en Scene or the arrangement of scenery. The shots in this movie were perfectly laid out. During scenes where you would be looking into the windows across the way, we only saw through the windows and in doing so there was a level of confusion that we shared with Jefferies and a level of suspense in some instances. This technique really paid off because it made the viewer feel more invested in the story. Jefferies and us are both trying to figure out what's going on.
This movie was also cinematically very pleasing. One scene in particular really jumped out at me. It was the scene where Jefferies is questioning everything, from what he had been seeing out that window to the morality of him carefully watching out his window. For the first time in the movie we see the room from a new angle too. Not only is Jeffries looking at the situation differently but we are looking at Jefferies differently. It makes us the viewer also see things from a new perspective and and it makes us also ask the same questions he is asking himself. This attention to detail makes the movie very easy and intriguing to watch.
Besides cinematic techniques, this movie is also very good because of its actors. They had a very real and authentic script that made it feel like a real conversation when they talked. The characters were witty and it seemed like they knew and genuinely liked each other. This helped the movie flow really well between plot points and scenes.
All in all this is a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something good to watch. This movie further shows why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the best directors and that's why I'm giving it a 10/10."
"jnk-51718","9","1","1","6 February 2018"," A Timeless Film
","When first looking at this movie, I believed it would be a long hour and 52 minutes. I was wrong. Hitchcock, being a true artist of film, somehow spun the tale of a murder mystery all without ever having James Stewart get up from out of his chair. The film was masterfully created and seems to blow by with the exception of the suspenseful moments which seem to prolong the film much longer than it actually is. 
 Hitchcock's greatest ability throughout the film was his utilization of ""Mise en Scene."" From the beginning of the film, Hitchcock's use of Mise en Scene can be seen and admired. By the way he introduces the ""neighborhood"" with all the apartments just looking like they belong where they do, as do the people who occupy them. Hitchcock's not only has perfect placement of the antagonist's apartment, but his use of Mise en Scene inside said apartment makes it even better. He perfectly positions everything right from the beginning of the film, so that it can be used later on. The beds in the apartment can be clearly seen through Stewart's window as can the main family room. Hitchcock made sure that there were just enough objects and such in the foreground and background, that it could be a realistic apartment, but also makes sure that there are not to many items and such as to not drive the attention of the viewer elsewhere.
 Another great thing that Hitchcock did was he consistently used a somewhat low angle when showing Stewart in his chair. It is an interesting thought as to why he would do that because a lower angle generally means that the viewer should be looking at the character as if they have power. A crippled journalist is the last person anybody expects to have power... right? Hitchcock most likely proceeded to film in the manner because he wanted us to believe the path that Stewart was following. He wanted the viewer to unquestionably believe in Stewarts murder theory and in order to do that, he used the low angle to make it seem like this crippled journalist was someone that we, the viewers, should respect and listen to. A figure of authority per say.
 When this film came out, I wouldn't have necessarily categorized this as an experimental film, but it did challenge a lot of beliefs from the time. What one of the main focuses of the film is voyeurism. In the beginning, the film slightly challenges voyeurism when the insurance nurse says that ""the nation has become one of peeping toms,"" but by the end of the film, she's sneaking into the antagonist's property and rooting through their stuff. If Hitchcock wanted to criticize voyeurism, the antagonist Thorwald, would have turned out innocent and Stewart would have just been a peeping Tom. In this case, it showed that voyeurism has its rewards as Thorwald was found guilty. 
 It is truly interesting to see how Hitchcock evolved from this film to his next few. In this film Rear Window, It is a murder mystery with a dash or romance. Most of the action happens behind closed blinds except for the scene were Stewarts girlfriend or fiancé almost got caught by Thorwald and the scene were Thorwald actually comes up to Stewart's room. This is a much different approach from Hitchcock's movie Psycho, where the whole point of the movie is for the viewer to know that someone is about to get murdered by they are powerless to help the person. It is interesting to see his evolution as a director."

","Rear Window is Hitchcock's simple masterpiece. He could connect to this primitive curiosity of people. This is the start of, what I believe, to be the scariest genre of horror. The simplistic anxiety of people watching, and watching people is one that is the most realistic. A suspenseful thriller combines with a charming romance, with the expertise of Hitchcock's silent film expertise. This average apartment complex is the source of entertainment and mystery. <br/><br/>We are introduced to our characters during a heat wave which forces them to keep their windows and doors open. This pleasant and peaceful day meets L. B. Jeffries, bored and broken. Jimmy Steward is iconic, and his abilities are highlighted in subtleties of being confined to his one room apartment. 
Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter are fantastic as the girlfriend and the nurse, both in stereotypical role yet impowered by the disability of Jeffries. Kelly, in particular, places herself in suspenseful danger and is smart enough to leave with the evidence necessary to arrest our villain, Thorwald. <br/><br/>Hitchcock pairs his simplistically thrilling plot with controlled cinematography to create an attention vacuum. You are drawn into exactly what he wants, and the camera seems to focus on your own curiosities. His framing in Rear Window has been commentated on as watching a movie within a movie, seeing both the film as a whole and the entertainment that Jeffries sees, since a voyeur would see the world as their personal movie theatre. It could be argued that Jeffries is not our main character, but the viewer. We perceive the story through the lens of his camera. Jeffries is the personification of the viewers. His reactions are our reactions. He has no prior knowledge of the mystery, no need for additional exposition. <br/><br/>All in all, let's be honest. We are all curious, and if this would be remade into a contemporary film, it would be on social media, not just outside your window."

","Jeff got bored. A man who's traveled the world, photographed the world, and earned his place has been resigned to the confines of a wheel chair. From scene one we see his boredom. The world outside his apartment is alive with the diversity of the city. 
The first panning scene gives the viewer an omniscient view of this place. Never stopping on one person too long, but intriguing us with interesting actions, each brought into the center of the frame one at a time. We have not been in this setting for more than 2 minutes, and we have already been introduced to the world which Jeff observes.
The world in which Jeff lives is different. Seated in a wheel chair, and having only direct contact with people who enter his apartment, Jeff is cutoff from the outside. this creates a interesting dynamic challenge for the film, forcing it to create an engaging story to make both Jeff's live and our lives more interesting.
This is started through the only gateway of interest: the window. The story could have easily brought a series of interesting people to the door of the apartment, and through dialogue, made a murder mystery. But instead, it follows the story through the window. 
Spying like this is not an appropriate pastime. It is noted for nearly the entire film that it is rude to peep in people's windows, especially with binoculars. However, it is so enticing the way the camera waits to show the scene until Jeff picks up his camera or binoculars, that the audience is always on edge waiting for the next glimpse inside. It slowly becomes more and more acceptable for people to peak. First Jeff, then Lisa are consumed with the desire to look, and finally Stella. However, it never becomes socially acceptable. Doyle, the detective and voice of society in this film, is always against the spying. 
The framing in this film is always using Windows. It creates isolation in this film between characters, and separates their stories. When the couple is fighting, they are pictured often through different windows, separating them visually and showing the conflict in their marriage. The newly wed couple is shown only thought one window, and they are happy at the beginning. We never see Lisa and Jeff through their own windows, but if anything, the many windows with thin borders would show them together in the frame.
The audience can be invested in the characters in their own little worlds, but not very much. When it comes time to add drama and suspense, we need to be more emotionally involved with the subjects. That is why it is so exciting when Lisa and Stella go out to dig up the flowers. All of a sudden, two people, whom we care about are put in a place of danger. It is very engaging watching them sneak around. When Lisa is abandon by Stella when she climbs into the apartment, the audience knows the danger, and because we are trapped in the view point of Jeff's window, we feel powerless to help. 
The Climax of the story is when Mr. Thorwald enters the apartment with Jeff. Where as we felt an emotional connection to Lisa and didn't want her to get hurt, because Jeff has been our view point for this whole movie, and because he his immobile, this is a much more suspenseful scene. All of a sudden, the sanctuary of the apartment turns into a trap. The message against spying has been loosened throughout this movie but now it has meaningful consequence. 
The way Mr Thorwald is shown in the shadows and how Jeff's only defense is to flash a light in his eyes, mirrors the way in which Mr. Thorwald has been operating in private. He is revealed to be a killer in the same violent and sudden way that he is stunned by the light.
Jeff's, now with two broken legs, is bored again, but has resolved his conflict with Lisa, giving a happy ending to this story."

","I admit before watching Rear Window, I had never watched an Alfred Hitchcock film. As a first time watcher, I now know why his work is given so much praise. Rear Window is a story about a photographer who is stuck in a wheelchair after breaking one of his legs. The photographer watches his neighbors from his rear window, and suspects that one of his neighbors has murdered his ill wife. The camera was used to represent the eyes of L.B. Jefferies, and was shot through his point of view. Jefferies spent a large amount of time watching his neighbors out of his window, so when he looked out the window, the camera presented an image from his point of view, watching the neighbors through their windows, but at a distance. When Jefferies used binoculars or his camera, the view of the windows was significantly closer. When the scene was focused around Jefferies, the viewer could only see what was in his immediate vicinity. For example, the scene where Lars Thorwald enters Jefferies' apartment, the camera is a mid-body shot of Thorwald. At this point Jefferies is seated in his wheelchair, on the other side of the room. The viewer is watching from the perspective of Jefferies. This style of cinematography is far less omniscient than other styles. The film feels grounded, and from the point of view of a single person; the viewer does not feel like they are looking in, but looking out from Jefferies' eyes. This style of cinematography kept the viewer's knowledge limited to that of L.B. Jefferies, leading the viewer to be more thoughtful, and makes Jefferies revelations about Lars Thorwald more thrilling. 
As well as shooting through the eyes of Jefferies, Hitchcock also applies mise-en-scene excellently in all of his shots. The scenes that look out of L.B. Jefferies' window all use mise-en-scene; the many windows are populated with people and objects, are not overly crowded, and the viewer's eyes are drawn to the most important part of the frame. Another example of mise-en-scene, was when Lars Thorwald entered Jefferies' apartment. The lights in the apartment were out, and the view was focused on Thorwald, he looked large and intimidating, and his surroundings were masked in shadow, invoking a sense of fear in the viewer. Other scenes, like the very last one of the film, showing the repainting of the walls in the Thorwald apartment, and the rest of the neighborhood invoked a sense of happiness, joy and relief through the expressions of the neighbors and the light, which was much brighter than the rest of the film.
Although the film was wonderfully shot, I do feel that the start of the film was very slow, and I believe that introducing the conflict earlier could have solved this problem. I also felt that the conflict between L.B. Jefferies, and his girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, who was portrayed by Grace Kelly, were not necessary. Initially, Jefferies' inability to commit to Lisa seems to be the conflict of the film, however these issues disappear as soon as suspicions arise that Lars Thorwald murdered his wife, and after that conflict is resolved, there is no mention of the commitment issues faced by Jefferies' initially. If Lisa and Jefferies did not have relationship issues, the film still would have ended the same way, and would have better pacing.
Above all else, the film was cast incredibly well. James Stewart is an excellent fit for L.B. Jefferies. Having watched many of James Stewart's other films, I am not drawn back to other characters he has portrayed, I think only of Jefferies. James Steward also has fantastic chemistry with other members of the cast. Grace Kelly was also very convincing. Through watching the film, I also came to dislike Wendell Corey's character, Detective Doyle, who throughout the film disputes Jefferies' claims of a crime taking place, due to my investment in the L.B. Jefferies as a character.
Rear Window kept me on the edge of my seat while viewing. Initially, I expected the film to have a theme explaining the dangers of spying, instructing viewers to mind their own business, however, as the film progresses, the Hitchcock seems to tell viewers that they must keep an eye on their surrounding, and watch for the unusual. Rear Window deserves the utmost praise for its astounding cinematography, and point of view, which keeps the film interesting, and makes up for the issues with pacing."

","After watching this classic 50's film in the year 2018, I feel a bit disappointed in myself for not having seen it earlier. The fact that I'm only 22 could justify the fact that it took me decades to watch this, but I am also a true lover of film, so I should have seen this sooner. Anyways, this film does an incredible job of utilizing the different camera views and movements to truly make the audience feel like they are Jeffries himself. The slow pannings, the out-of-focus shots on the apartment from across the street, and the close-ups of the main character's personal relationships like his female caretaker and girlfriend Lisa all give make us feel like we are sitting in a wheelchair with a cast on our leg. The audience feels like we have been trapped in the chair for weeks and are just itching to be free. Another incredible tactic that this film incorporates is the use of ""mise en scene."" Mise en scene is the arrangement of scenery and stage in a play or film. Hitchcock does a great job of playing with this technique as Jeffries spys on his neighbors. For example, when he looks into the Lonely Woman's apartment as she is ""rehearsing"" or pretending to act out a scene where a man joins her for dinner and a conversation. The camera freezes on her as she begins to transform from a happy and heart woman into a sad and lonely one. The audience sees her sitting alone at a dinner table that is set for two and her head is hanging low and her body language changes to show feeling of sadness. Another scene that picked up on some suspense with this technique occurred when Jeffries and his caretaker were looking out the window into the suspected killer's open window right when he begins to notice that he is being watched. Immediately, Jeffries wheels himself back out of view and into the darkness of an overcasted shadow as he urges his confused caretaker to do the same. In that moment, the camera moves in closer on Jeffries and his caretaker and we are able to see the frightened and intense emotions on their faces as they evade being seen by the suspected killer. 
One of my favorite parts of the film is the moment where Lisa finally sees what Jeffries has been seeing all along from his spot in his apartment. The moment where Lisa begins to realize that something mysterious is indeed happening across the street in the Thorwald apartment. Hitchcock decides to use dramatic visuals in order to get the audience to feel that something special has just taken place. The camera gets close on Lisa's face as we begin to read and analyze the expression on her face. The frame changes from a rectangle to a circle as it encompasses Lisa's face and the rest of the frame goes completely dark as if a spotlight had been placed on nothing but her head. It is in this moment that Lisa goes from critiquing and arguing with Jeffries to actually agreeing, understanding, and seeing everything that he's been experiencing. Another great element in this film is suspense and it is used multiple times throughout the story. In one scene, while Jeffries and Lisa are talking, we hear a loud, blood curdling scream from a woman that comes from across the street. At that moment, not only do Jeffries and Lisa go to the window to investigate, but so do the other surrounding neighbors! Every single person within close proximity of the scream comes quickly to the scene of the scream, as they attempt to figure out why someone is screaming. Hitchcock does a great job of getting the audience to feel anxious and nervous during this scene, as well as a feeling of deep sadness as we find out that the reason for the scream was due to the death of the screaming woman's dog down below in the corridor. The use of the death of an animal is almost always going to upset the audience in some type of way. Hitchcock's Rear Window is a masterpiece for generations and generations to come. This is what today's filmmakers need to remind themselves about in terms of simplicity of plot and camera filming techniques."
"cxw-25960","8","1","1","5 February 2018"," Hitchcock Work of Art
","Here we have a story of stories. Numerous narrations enveloped into one holistic, Thriller of a film. Namely two plot lines steal the spotlight; the life that has been given to L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), and the life which he has chosen to lives his days by through that rear window. 
The emotional relationship journey through his character and Lisa, and the murder thriller brought to life by predominantly nameless characters and events from which the audience and main cast are entirely concealed from. Every detail has its place, every storyline has its meaning, Alfred Hitchcock has unlocked this dynamic story through plot intuition and creativity which is then presented from film angles so that no intention of the storyline is missed. Both the story itself, and the film art, work from separate perspectives to make this entirely cohesive thriller. <br/><br/>Professional photographer L.B. Jefferies spends his days peering down from his apartment window at his neighbors and surrounding alleys as he recovers from his wheelchair restricting broken leg. His persistent watching produces consecutive evidence of questionable action by his neighbor Thorwald. Later aided by his dear Lisa and other close companions, Jeffries unravels the story of a murderous husband, and complex deception, that would otherwise go unseen. <br/><br/>From the artistic and technical side of the film, the plot line and camera angles take gold in my eyes. The window of the shots oscillate between having Stewart dead center, to his optical target, and then back again repeating this pattern. The audience then receives from this a beautiful interpretation of Jefferies inquisition, physical target, and then reaction to what he saw. Each consecutive view of the same region would also involve a closer look at the region of interest. Without words the audience understands each detail and the mental process of the character.<br/><br/>Another story telling technique which really stands out is the order in which pieces of evidence are visually presented, significantly before they are ever considered by a character. This is fascinating as it allows the viewers to ultimately solve parts of this riddle entirely on their own; independent of the characters' discovery. Two examples of this are the digging of the dog in the garden, and the wedding ring that is seen in Mrs. Thorwald's handbag. The dog's curiosity is seen very early on in the film, though not addressed until the poor pup is later found dead. The ring is first seen by Jefferies as Mr. Thorwald fumbles through the bag's contents while on the phone, though no character acknowledges the discovery until later discussion occurs. The close-up shots and perfectly timed panning of the set allow for these details to be picked up by the audience and subtly emphasized as important without any plot cue having to tell them so. <br/><br/>Along with film angles, the control of light and dark on the set itself is the obvious director of audience attention. In the extremely tradition sense, rooms that are lit are where the eye is meant to be drawn. This is a voiceless narration that is ideal for this film. This film is essentially narrated by the thoughts of L.B. Jefferies, though these thoughts are not audibly expressed. The film angles and set lighting are meant to produce the narration in the head of the viewer by matching your thought process identically to that of Jefferies himself. Phenomenal.<br/><br/>Lastly, just as the light is used to regularly draw attention, in calculated instances the darkness was used in just the same way. When the dog was discovered to be dead, lights came on in every room as people all around the set looked out of curiosity; all except one room. This dark room of Thorwald was silent proof that emphasized him as the guilty party."
"raj-83168","10","1","1","5 February 2018"," Wonderful, Skillfully made movie
","The movie uses exemplary framing and composition. The film has a great feeling throughout. Each window in the alley is a whole different possible story, a love story, a slice of life story about a marriage, or a story of mystery and intrigue. The only reason this movie is about that latter option is because that is what L.B. Jeffries happened to notice randomly one night. In the movie, you yourself don't know whether or not Mr. Thorwald did it throughout the movie, similar to the cast of characters in the story. You are in a state of slow increasing suspense throughout the movie. To create this feeling and the rest of the emotional gambit the movie goes through the movie does many different amazing tricks and tools.
 The framing of the movie was astounding. The movie mimicked L.B. Jeffries' sight outside his window or in his room. The camera was always either exactly where he is looking or very close to the side or back of his head, showing the movie from the character's point of view. As a viewer you are seeing the world through Jeffries' eyes. This point of view extends to the usage of lenses and filters used over the footage. Although old fashioned from current movie effects for when Jeffries was looking through his binoculars or lenses were good for the time, and still accurately portray what they need. Especially the effects of the flashes at the end of the movie, having the dark screen and suddenly lighting up the screen blinded me s a view the first time, due to me watching the movie in a dark room. The framing and effects of the movie were extremely well done.
 The movie has excellent usage of light and dark/day and night to show the danger and suspicion in the movie. When going through the movie, during the initial day, the feeling is upbeat and has a slice of life feel. Though, as day turned to night, the first clues of something being amiss came out. This pattern continues, through the days the movie is set through. During the day Jeffries is told that he is wrong and that nothing has happened and that everything is peachy. The day represents safety and the naivete of the characters in the movie. Alternatively, during the night, odd, suspicious things happen even Lisa begins to believe the story as it is becoming night. This all comes to a climax near the end of the movie when the final confrontation happens in near total darkness and the suspicions are proven true. The night represents danger and suspicion. During the night, the wife is murdered. during the night the dog is murdered. During the night Jeffries is almost murdered. After the resolution and everything is back to normal it becomes day again and everything is upbeat again. The usage of lighting, and especially the usage of night and day add a whole new aspect to the movie.
 The camera's distance from the characters and scenes helps the character's feeling and the scene's feelings be better expressed. The reaction shots of James Stewart's face after he looks out the window are close to his face and are used to endear us to his character. The distance from Thorwald's apartment and the other apartments in the alley, are used to distance us from the characters. We can see the stories in the other apartments, we hope their stories end happily, though we do not feel as strongly about them as we do our main characters and stories. 
 Over all, Rear Window was an cinematographic masterpiece. Using all avenues of camera work and lighting to make the movie, which consists mostly of calm conversations in a small apartment into extremely interesting murder mystery. I personally have not watched any Hitchcock movies, excluding this one. Although, after watching this one I feel like I must watch the rest of his works as soon as possible."
"jbplawson","9","1","1","5 February 2018"," Alfred Hitchcock in Control
","Read Window by Alfred Hitchcock, was experimental in nature. Almost the whole movie was set inside of L.B. Jefferies' living room, this was not a common practice in the 50's because it usually is hard to keep the viewers attention without showing them new and bold sets. But Hitchcock made it work extraordinarily and I personally didn't even notice the whole movie was only set in one room until after I had finished watching the film. It was Hitchcock's use of Mise En Scene that didn't make it easy to realize you were trapped in one room for 2 hours.
 Mise En Scene in Rear Window included the use of the camera, the shots used, the angles and distance at which it was filmed from. After looking back on the film it is very clear that the ""camera"" or the point of view that the viewer sees is actually lined up with where the main character L.B. Jefferies is looking. If he is watching the ally, the viewer is watching the ally, if he is watching the apartments, the viewer is watching the apartments. Hitchcock made the whole movie through L.B. Jefferies eyes and brought the viewers along for the ride, like they were spectators in another persons life. The only shots that aren't lined up with where Jefferies looks is the ones of himself, which show the viewer his reaction and emotion to what is happening outside of his apartment. 
 Another reason that this film could be seen as experimental is the fact that again in the 50's ""amateur sleuth"" movies were not popular. All the crime movies were about cops or detectives, but when Hitchcock made the main character of a crime mystery film a ordinary civilian, it gives the viewer more reason to sympathies with the characters who are similar to themselves as they go on this journey to solve a murder. On the other hand viewers have a hard time connecting with the characters of a cop/detective movie, unless they are cops or detectives, because their lives are so different from the ones being shown in the movie, but when it is about someone that represents an ""average Joe"" you can connect so much more with it.
 Alfred Hitchcock did a tremendous job keeping this movie in a sense realistic. When viewing the salesmen and his wife in the beginning of the film, Jefferies isn't able to hear what they are talk and arguing about because his apartment is on the complete other side of the alley. It wouldn't be realistic to be able to hear every word that was spoken, and most of the times that would be frustrating for the viewer to be left out of the loop, but that was the point because Jefferies was also in a sense left out of the loop because we are hearing what he is hearing, making the whole movie through his eyes idea even more intriguing. Along with the sound, Hitchcock keeps the viewer and Jefferies guessing to what is happening in the house by only having a couple of windows open to the apartment, this gives room for the characters to do this outside of the viewers vision, making them think about what is happening behind that wall, what is that character doing that I can't see.
 Alfred Hitchcock made a masterpiece with Rear Window it was a whole new experience to be in someones shoes, to be ""in the movie"" as a passive spectator. Even after 50+ years I enjoyed this movie and was interested the whole time, I wasn't ever thinking about when the movie was going to be over, I was there, entertained, and fully approbated this piece of art."
"calebkatzenstein","8","1","1","5 February 2018"," Ingeniously Crafted
","It is no fun talking to a know it all. When watching a movie, it is no fun being one. I was grateful that Hitchcock knew this when seeing Rear Window. The movie is so effective because we usually only know as much as our main character, Jeff. The movie also makes Jeff our avatar in the movie through several techniques.
 Like Jeff, the audience is confined to his apartment. We frequently see things from his point of view. When the camera is focused on him, we usually see him at eye level. Even though he is in a wheelchair, the camera is never made to pity him. Jeff and us are equals. 
While the camera does frequently look to Jeff's neighbors, they are usually far away, at the distance Jeff would see them at. One reason may be to isolate the audience from them as much as possible. This is so the audience does not get concerned about Jeff's spying. The movie would be quite different if the protagonist was a young dancer who was suffering from a peeping Tom in the building across from her. The closest to empathy we get is to the woman on the balcony after her dog is killed. The camera lingers on her, still from afar, as she screams at her neighbors and laments how isolated they all are from each other. This is possibly the only time we get close-ups of any of the neighbors. This is, of course, just a way to jolt the viewer back into attention after the mystery runs into a dead end, and to turn our suspicions back on Thorwald. However, the main reason for this is to place us in Jeff's shoes. If he cannot see his neighbors close up, then for the most part neither can we.
One possible exception to this perceptual connection is when Jeff falls asleep, and we see Thorwald and a woman leave his apartment. Later, Boyle says that the landlord caught Thorwald and his wife leaving for the train station, and due to what we saw, we are led to believe him. Later, we know that the woman was not Thorwald's wife. Hitchcock may have let us see something that Jeff did not, but he only did that to deceive us. Even though we saw more than Jeff, we still do not know more than Jeff.
There is also one notable exception with the angles of the film. It is when Thorwald confronts Jeff in his apartment. For the first time, the camera is far away and looking slightly down on Jeff. He is backed against the wall. He looks trapped. For most of the film, he is our equal. Now, he is in danger, therefore so are we. Thorwald is treated to a low-angle shot. He is menacing and imposing. For the majority of the movie, he was far away, a merely suspicious presence. But now he is at our hero's doorstep, and the danger is clear and present. The angles are not too extreme, but in this movie it is rare for the camera to deviate from eye level.
This film would not be nearly as iconic as it is without the attention paid to Jeff. Every technique employed in this film is done to ensure the audience's connection to him. The camera does not merely stay on him, it treats him like we would want to be treated: it looks him in the eye. It is shot not only through his eyes, but through his camera and binoculars. This means that whenever he ventures to learn more about the mystery, it feels like we are accomplishing something too. Without this connection, Rear Window would just be another movie with a great premise but wasted potential."
"ianmatic","9","1","1","5 February 2018"," Visual Storytelling at its Finest
","This Alfred Hitchcock classic shows just what a detailed filmmaker he really was. The film features excellently directed acting, set design, cinematography, lighting, and pacing.
 The acting quality is already of a high standard knowing that James Stewart stars in the leading role as a man in a wheelchair observing his neighborhood. His acting is given the opportunity to shine thanks to his inability to animate his delivery in the vast majority of the movie. He does an immensely excellent job reacting to the events going on from his window, so well that it truly feels like he is watching the events unfold with just as much curiosity as the viewer. The supporting cast also does a great job, specifically the actors playing the characters that Stewart's character is observing. They masterfully acted out their scenes in such a fashion that the viewer could understand what was going on without actually hearing what they were saying, in part thanks to the set design.
 The set design is carefully executed in order to allow the viewer to clearly see what is going on around an almost convoluted apartment complex. This is done by giving each ""apartment"" a distinct look and shape in order to prevent the viewer from being lost as to which ""apartment"" they looking at. It would have been easy to make the stage look very stale and normal in order to fit the ""every day"" setting of the film, but the fact that it was decided to instead give the neighborhood a very distinct look helped the film immensely in terms of directing the viewer's attention. The viewer's attention, however, is also guided by the meticulous cinematography.
 The cinematography is carefully coordinated in order to guide the viewer along the protagonist's point of view. The movie features an extensive amount of POV shots, which are excellent at presenting the viewer with the exact same amount of information as the protagonist. The camera is always carefully planted in order to show the viewer just the right amount of information, and rarely instills confusion as to what is supposed to be noticed within the shot. The cinematography isn't always limited to POV-shots, however. There are many different kind of shots, such as pans, tracking shots, and reaction shots, all used to build up the story, setting, and characters into a well designed whole. Overall though, it is the fine attention to detail in terms of zoom levels, angles, and lighting that allow the shots to truly capture the moments.
 The lighting is very sophisticated in terms of how it is often used to both reveal and hide information from the viewer/protagonist. Light plays the role of exposing characters to the rest of the characters, while darkness is used to hide a character from the rest of the neighborhood. Many of the ""apartments"" are often very well lit in order to allow the viewer to be able to tell exactly what they are they looking at. The lighting isn't just limited to observational shots, as it also plays a crucial role in character relationships and development. Subtleties like casting the protagonist in darkness when he feels discontent over his situation with his girlfriend, and other similar narrative elements, are what allow the lighting to play not just a visual role, but a narrative role.
 The pacing is very consistent as a result of well written dialogue and the extensive presence of suspense and the viewer's sympathy with the protagonist. The dialogue is often witty and clever, allowing the user to enjoy dialogue heavy scenes without feeling like the movie is slowing down, while the scenes during which the protagonist is investigating feel naturally paced thanks to the fact that the viewer and protagonist are presented with information at the exact same moment in the exact same way. Hitchcock's masterful use of suspense further allows the movie to move along at a steady pace as there are multiple scenes throughout the film where the viewer feels as if something critical could happen at a short notice, in turn gluing both the viewer (and often the protagonist) to the movie.
 Overall, the movie is not just a well done movie, but a well done example of how to present information to the viewer, while also a strong example of how to keep the viewer interested with not only dialogue, but visual storytelling. The film suffers in terms of the actual sense of mystery present in the movie, however, as the story is nothing exceptionally out of the ordinary and isn't difficult to predict. Despite this, the film is a very enjoyable experience and is recommended to anyone looking for not just a Hitchcock movie, but to anyone simply looking for a very overall enjoyable mystery movie.

"lxg-14800","9","1","1","5 February 2018"," Are Silent Film storytelling techniques outdated?
","Rear Window is a formalist movie as seen by Alfred Hitchcock's deep focus on theme and style. This movie focuses on relationships and provides contrasting examples throughout the story. From the newlywed couple next door to the lonely heart across the neighborhood, Hitchcock uses these relationships to develop the plot and tell the story of a murder. Rear Window is successful in engaging viewers, delivering a coherent story and building effective suspense using thoughtful movie techniques. Alfred Hitchcock merges silent storytelling with a simple storyline, a good selection of shots, and a masterful control over the frame. These techniques are apparent to the viewer as they build the stage where the story plays out.<br/><br/>When discussing storytelling, Dialogue is the first thing that comes to mind. How else could someone explain a convoluted plot with multiple twists and story elements? One answer is to keep the story simple and fill in the gap with better storytelling. Rear Window benefits from this rule by sticking to a linear story with no more than six important characters and using visuals to enhance storytelling by involving viewers in the investigation of the murder. There are various times where a character will convey a stance or message through facial expressions as opposed to dialogue. One example being the detective debating with Jeffries on whether the information about Ana Thorwald is trustworthy or not. The detective states his point about everybody not telling their landlord everything by staring at Lisa Fremont's dress. He proved his point without having to explicitly tell Jeffries that he didn't communicate Lisa's stay at his apartment to his landlord. <br/><br/>The main plot of Rear Window is basic and involves a bitter relationship between Lars Thorwald and his wife, which leads to him murdering her and attempting to get away with it. Despite this plot seeming boring and overused, Hitchcock is able to engage the viewer by using clever camera movements, thoughtful shots and suspense.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock is successful in controlling the frame throughout the movie. His three-part POV shot, mixed with expressive close-ups, was the main force pushing viewer engagement. This technique focused on doing a close up on Stewart, then panning over to what he was seeing, and finally focusing back on Stewart to catch his reaction. This combination of shots engages the viewer in the story and builds a connection between the audience and the main character. This connection is reinforced by the dominant middle screen shots where the main focus is Stewart's reactions. Viewers are able to feel the emotion of scenes by a combination of close ups on Stewart's face and Stewart's great acting performance. <br/><br/>Another way that Hitchcock portrays his control of the frame is through well-chosen angles. He uses medium shots during the three-part POV to complement Jeffries' point of view by staying eye level with Jeffries. Then uses high angle and low angle shots in the final confrontation between Lars Thorwald and Jeffries. Hitchcock portrays Lars as a sinister figure using a low angle shot and dark lighting, this angle made Lars look more dominating and threatening to the viewer. Hitchcock then portrays Jeffries using a high angle shot which enhances the idea of Jeffries being trapped and vulnerable. Adding to these angles which enhance the feelings of current scenes, Hitchcock uses tightly framed shots to complement the feeling of confinement as Jeffries spends the whole movie in his small apartment. These different shots and angles all are part of Hitchcock's expressive editing which screams for viewer attention.<br/><br/>Rear View is a good example of a movie which is not afraid of mixing visual storytelling with other important editing techniques in order to catch the viewers' attention. In this movie Hitchcock proves that visual storytelling is just as important as dialogue, which can be easily forgotten and results in viewer disengagement."

","James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, a professional photographer who is confined to his wheelchair after an accident on the job. His injury also confines him to his apartment, only having his girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, played by Grace Kelly and his nurse, Stella, played by Thelma Ritter come visit him. To combat boredom, Jeff sits by the rear window of his apartment and observes his neighbors from across the courtyard in their apartment complex. As he observes he gives the other tenants playful nicknames like a single woman he calls ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" and a dancer he calls ""Miss Torso"". While Stella tells him, ""The New York State sentence for a Peeping Tom is six months in the work house"", his voyeurism is exactly what allows Jeff to witness what he believes is his neighbor, Thorwald, murdering his wife. With the help of Lisa and Stella they try and catch the murderer without being murdered themselves.
99% of the movie is seen through Jeff's eyes, as told by a lot of point of view shots of the apartment courtyard. The camera pans to show whatever Jeff is looking at. Jeff often looks through his camera lens to observe his neighbors, with the movie showing what he sees through the lens. This was a masterful way of Hitchcock blatantly showing the audience the whole premise of the movie. The audience is just another camera in the room, because we are constrained as much as Jeff is. He also creates a powerful story by using a three-part point of view shot constantly throughout the movie. It starts with shot of Jeff looking out his window. It then cuts to a shot of the courtyard, focusing and moving wherever Jeff is looking. It then cuts back to a shot of Jeff to get his reaction. This three-shot approach allows us to feel whatever Jeff is feeling, while feeling like we are in the room with him experiencing it with him as well
""We are now having a very innocent little chat. Let's suppose that there is a bomb underneath this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!"" There is an explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene, of no special consequence. Now, let us take a suspense situation. The bomb is underneath the table and the public knows it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is aware the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions, the same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene."" 
The famous quote above is Alfred Hitchcock's famous quote about the difference between ""surprise"" and ""suspense"". Alfred Hitchcock's film Rear Window is a fantastic showcase between that difference with this movie having no ""surprise"" jumps, only lots of suspense. This is shown during the dramatic scene where Lisa enters Thorwald's apartment to obtain some evidence of the crime. The ""bomb"" in this case is Thorwald and his impending return to his apartment. Hitchcock heightens the suspense by moving Jeff's and the audiences view to Miss Lonelyheart as she is about to commit suicide. While this is happening, the ""bomb is ticking under the table"" as Thorwald returns while the camera wasn't looking.
That scene also highlights the feeling of being ""trapped"" that the movie creates. Since we are limited to Jeff's perspective, it feels like we are trapped in the apartment like Jeff. When Thorwald returns we feel as helpless and Jeff and can only watch from afar and hope that the police show up on time.
The set in the movie is clearly meticulously crafted and adds to the quality of this movie. It was built to resemble a Greenwich apartment complex. As the camera pans around you can start to feel the sense of space in the complex and start to remember the locations of the various tenants. Also, as the tenants pass from room to room in their apartments you can see the care that went into what the audience can and cannot see from their ""seat"" in Jeff's apartment.
Hitchcock crafts an amazing thriller with the tension getting so thick that you could cut it with a knife. This is a fantastic movie and should be seen by any fan suspense movies."
"agilesharks","9","1","1","4 February 2018"," Suspenseful Movie with Great Cinematography
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" has a simple premise, but is executed masterfully. A photographer named Jeff Jeffries is recovering from a broken leg. He's so bored he looks out his window all the time suspecting one of his neighbors committed murder. He disregards his beautiful girlfriend because he thinks she's too perfect for him. He's into adventure while she's into fashion, but they work together on solving the mystery and settle their differences. <br/><br/>You see everything from Jeff's perspective out of his window. The whole movie is filled with nervous energy, I felt like I was in his spot spying on his neighbors. You can get a sense of the whole neighborhood all through that one window. The camera never leaves that one room, even when something happens outside you see it all out of the window of Jeff's apartment. It really makes you feel like you're in his shoes watching everything play out. The cinematography shows just how intentional it was to evoke this feeling. The camera work is truly fascinating and adds to the suspense to really get inside your head. There are nuances and the subtle details that work well with what the film tries to communicate. You can hear people across the way, but only faintly. It reels you in and makes you want to be able to hear what they're saying. <br/><br/>I was never bored throughout the entirety of the movie. The music fits atmospherically well with what's being portrayed. All the characters are very well written and the dialog is wittingly funny. The humor of the characters balances out well with the drama. The quarrel between Jeff and Lisa is as amusing as it is heart wrenching. You can tell that Jeff is impatient about his situation as it doesn't help his character any. While he can be abrasive and course we eventually get to see his soft side when Lisa warms up to him as the mystery unfolds. Through their differences there is a turning point in the film after Lisa believes Jeff's suspicions. She grows to adapt to Jeff's lifestyle even going as far as to stay with him living out of a handbag. <br/><br/>Additionally, you can see the stories of the other neighbors play out simultaneously. There's a newlywed couple, a songwriter, a ballet dancer, and a woman who can never seem to find love dubbed ""miss lonely heart"". This makes a very compelling story as the main plot unfolds along with these sub stories. These characters add depth to the already engaging story. By the end of the film it's heartwarming to see that there's a resolution along with most of these other characters as well. These minor characters build up the various lives occupying the neighborhood that bring the setting of the film together. <br/><br/>I liked the fact that while the plot progresses as a murder mystery, but the main character isn't a detective. Jeff is just an everyday person that turns out to be a sleuth just by a matter of occurrence. It feels as though anybody could be living in that situation. The later half is extremely suspenseful. The pace of the movie builds up increasingly until the very end. When Lars Thorwald looked straight at the camera at Jeff it took me out of the moment as if he was looking at me. This film made me believe there could be a murder going on right next door behind close windows. The acting and pace are what really make this; It's brilliantly shot and edited by which could only be the work of a master that is Hitchcock."
"msl-10124","10","1","1","3 February 2018"," Camera Techniques in Rear Window
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a masterpiece made with all of the elements known to a Hitchcock film: suspense, a love story, great use of frame and point of view shots, and a murder.
 
Rear Window is about a professional camera man named L.B Jeffries that is confined to his apartment due to a broken leg. He spends his time looking out his window and watching the neighbors for entertainment until he witnesses what he thinks was a murder. While struggling with his love life they tend to bond over trying to figure out what really happened, even though the detective Jeffries continues to call for help tells him to stop prying.<br/><br/>The suspense builds throughout the entire film and hits home right before the climax when Lars Thorwald confronts L.B Jeffries. The three part point of view shots that are used to out us in the eyes of Jeffries also help to build the suspense, because as viewers we can only see what he sees and make similar assumptions to his character based on what we are being given.<br/><br/> The shots start with Jeffries looking towards something, often quizzically, and then we are transferred to a lens or frame that he is looking through so that we can see what he sees, and then we see his reaction to what we both saw. This method is incredibly engaging, as we are connecting with the character and need to piece together the puzzle of is going on in a similar way that he must do.<br/><br/>The way that they use the frame itself also helps to pull the viewer in. When Jeffries is looking with just his eyes we get a further, broader view of what he is looking at. When he looks closer we get zoomed in slightly, which gives us the indication that this is more important. When he looks through the binoculars or the camera lens it gets us closer yet again, but we also get a circular view to feel like we are also looking through a lens with him. <br/><br/>The use of camera movement is also realistic. It follows the path of someone that is panning over an area to understand what's going on. This helps to add to the feeling that you are there in the room with Jeffries. Along with the movement of the camera, sounds that we hear from the neighbors also come into play only when we are looking at or near them through Jeffries eyes. Hearing the piano usually meant that we were going to get a view of the man playing it, or that we had just seen him. The sounds come in and out of focus also based on what Jeffries is focusing on. When he looks closer at some things and the camera zooms in, we often hear what is going on a bit better too.<br/><br/>The editing of the film in general plays a large part in keeping the audience engaged and further creates the feeling that they are a voyeur like Jeffries, watching the people around them and trying to solve the mystery. Being able to suck viewers in to make them feel like they are part of the experience is no simple task. There's a reason that people still learn about film techniques and methodologies from Hitchcock films and Rear Window is a prime example of why. At first I was slightly confused as to why the film was doing things the way it was near the beginning, but I quickly forgot about my confusion as I was absorbed into the environment and story that was presented to me through Jeffries perspective."

","Although we know that nothing is ever going to come close to 1960's Psycho, Rear Window (1954) is another prime example why Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense is probably the best director of all time. 
With classic James Stewart as the protagonist Rear Window is a very rare movie experience that lets the story develop through the main characters interpretations and not through the real action. 
You know Hitchcocks brilliance is shown when there is literally nothing happening but you still feel your self wanting to continue watching. It's a gripping movie that needs to be watched with carefulness to not miss out on excellent detail work.

"gbill-74877","8","1","1","4 December 2017"," Suspense all from the vantage point of a window
","Hitchcock's nod to voyeurism has a very simple premise: a photographer (Jimmy Stewart) is laid up with a broken leg, and finds entertainment in looking out his second floor window at his neighbors. The plot device is that during a heat wave, these neighbors leave their curtains drawn or shades up at all times, well, with the exception of a pair of newlyweds, whose implied activity (and its frequency) is a little joke Hitch gives us early on. He also dials up some eye candy circa 1954 with a dancer who regularly prances about her apartment. Stewart (slash Hitchcock) is a bit of perv, and he's kidded about that by his tough little nurse (Thelma Ritter) and glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly). Things get serious when he notices one of the neighbors (Raymond Burr) leaving his apartment multiple times in the wee hours of the night, and that the guy's wife has mysteriously disappeared.<br/><br/>From then on, there is a tension to the film, as we're not sure what's going on, or if anything at all is going on, as Stewart's detective friend (Wendell Corey) is skeptical and provides some alternate explanations. You might say, c'mon, we're pretty sure something's going on, this is a Hitchcock film after all, but consider the uncomfortable light Stewart's character is placed in: spying on neighbors with binoculars and a gigantic zoom lens, suggesting that his friend break the law by searching the guy's apartment without a warrant, and even (gasp) having Kelly over for a little sleepover, despite only having a single bed. It would have been interesting had Stewart's character been darker, e.g. taking pictures of his neighbors, but that may be implied when he breaks out slides showing pictures of a flower garden in the courtyard to try to understand if anything has changed.<br/><br/>Tension ratchets up considerably when Ritter and Kelly investigate on their own, but I won't spoil it. The fact that the action for the entire movies takes place in Stewart's apartment or from its vantage point is a pretty phenomenal achievement. Stewart turns in a strong performance, and Ritter's blunt speculations are effective in spurring our imaginations. I loved the scene which ends with Burr's cigarette glowing in the dark, one of the best moments in the film. The little stories playing out in the various apartments, including a woman who is lonely and depressed, provide interesting subplots. Overall the film is a little too constrained for me to consider it Hitchcock's best, and I could have used a little more darkness in the characters or the plot, but it's certainly very good, and a brilliant example of suspense not requiring fast-paced action or gore."

In fact much my desire to see this movie was down to the it being listed at number 14 on the IMDb top 250 movies list , so I stayed up late last week to watch it on television where it was broadcast at the ungodly hour of 2am and I'm afraid I was bitterly disappointed <br/><br/>Maybe it was the fact that it was well past my bedtime that I could hardly keep my eyes open but it could have been down to the fact that this is one slow moving thriller and the more I think about it the more I start to think that the screenplay was originally written for radio ! The action is very static with Jeff Jeffries lying in bed recovering from an accident looking into a courtyard that is obviously a pastel coloured studio stage . I wasn't expecting explosions and car chases but I was expecting exciting plot twists not a film where the hero spends all day in bed <br/><br/>Is Jeff really a hero anyway ? How would you react to someone who likes to watch pretty young girls sunbathing all day ? And instead of the always likable James Stewart playing the role how would you react if the part had gone to a lecherous bald middle aged man with glasses ? That's right you'd react like one of the villagers from a FRANKENSTIEN movie and lead a torch carrying mob to burn down Jeff's apartment <br/><br/>I won't go into the plot but I will warn anyone who hasn't seen it not to expect very much . It's far from a masterwork of cinema and doesn't contain the director's imaginative visual style as seen in VERTIGO , the unsettling atmosphere as seen in THE BIRDS or the blackly comical twists as seen in PSYCHO"

","Alfred Hitchcock was the king of suspense.

","How come all the films in those top 100 TV countdowns are all old with the exception of maybe 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix' and if your lucky 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Because all a film has to do to be a classic is be old. If anyone degrades it they can just be accused of not understanding or truly appreciating Black and White cinema. I say logically, the top 100 films out to be the 100 most recent films since naturally humans progress as does technology and we learn from our mistakes and do a little better each time. Now obviously that's not the case because modern films include things made for a specific audience eg. making a film for a stereo typical teenage boy you call it 'Road Wars' and it's not necessarily a good film. However I do think a lot of modern films are better than older films and this should be appreciated.<br/><br/>Similarly, anything Hitchcock is clearly a masterpiece just because he made a few excellent films like 'Psycho' which really was excellent. However 'Rear Window' is over rated and it's the only way of saying it.<br/><br/>Do you think if that film was made today instead of decades ago it would be half so critically acclaimed? It's purely average. It's not a bad plot but it's not a great one either, the script is average, the actors are average and the directing and editing is average too.<br/><br/>It's pretty dull too. It builds up to be mildly interesting, an average kind of film but the ending is awful. It goes on for ages and then he ending comes. Now I was expecting something spectacular since the back of the case described it as 'one of the most memorable endings of all time' and what a disappointment!

"schappe1","10","3","6","7 September 2003"," Sweating the details with the Master
","It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABOTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched. The result is not just Hitchcock's greatest film but one of the greatest films ever made.   <br/><br/>The marvelous detail of this film is just amazing. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are legends of the cinema and Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are actor's actors. But the real star is the set, a world unto itself. And the photography of that set, all that was needed to allow us to see into the rooms clearly- it's amazing stuff, (the lighting needed was so hot it set off the sprinkler system). But even better than that is the sound. It's not all just flat on the soundtrack, like actors in a dubbing session. Like good radio drama, it recognizes that people who are some distance away sound different. The voices coming from across the courtyard are just perfectly done and do more than even the camera work to `put you there'.<br/><br/>
The musical score for this film is not a film score at all- it's the music of these people, also heard across the courtyard. We hear the composer composing his song. We don't hear him doing it in five minutes, as we have heard in all the musicals. Instead it evolves over time. The dramatic piano cords he plays underscore the drama to come. We also hear some opera music that does the same. Everyone seems to have their own music-everyone except Thorwald, the murderer. And what a brilliant touch it is to make the murder a pathetic man, instead of some brilliant mastermind. In the end, he is one of us, as well, in a twisted way.  <br/><br/>I can't think of another movie that creates a world so vivid for the audience to live in. ROPE was strictly about the action in the apartment. The view out the window is just a painted backdrop. Maybe a better comparison could me made to DEAD END, but as good as that film it's not really the same. Our perspective changes too much. Perhaps my favorite scene in REAR WINDOW is the one moment, (seconds, really), the perspective does change. It's when Jefferies is struggling with Thorwald and everyone in the apartment house looks in the direction of his apartment for a change. Now there's a twist!"

","A photographer named L.B. Jefferies has broken his leg. With nothing to do throughout the day, he starts observing his neighbours from his window which leads him to grow more and more suspicious about one particular neighbour's behaviour which leads to extremely suspenseful consequences.<br/><br/>Clearly Hitchcock's theme for this film is voyeurism. We all have at least once watched someone from the window secretively. The thrill of observing people who are completely unaware of our peeping has always fascinated us. This very concept of intrusion of privacy has been the primary reason behind the success of the innumerable reality shows which have become so popular nowadays. The current scenario with reality shows makes Rear Window seem profound. The neighbourhood which is being observed by Jefferies is a representation of the whole society. There is the poor couple who struggle to get by,there is the rich lady who is tortured by her loneliness, there is the young ballet dancer who is trying to make her presence felt in the social scene, the musician who is desperate to achieve success with his talent, the old bickering couple and the young newlyweds. <br/><br/>James Stewart has a commanding presence as Jefferies. Everyone knows about Grace Kelly's looks, but what is great about this film is that Kelly is not there just to look beautiful. She is actually the one who does all the physical thrilling dirty work while Stewart remains attached to his wheel chair.<br/><br/>The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is absolutely brilliant. The whole story gets told from the point of view of Jefferies. This is a rare suspense thriller without any chases or thrilling action sequences. The movie depends completely on atmospheric tension. Hitchcock is not called the Master of Suspense for nothing. He shows how minimalistic filmmaking can also generate spine chilling moments of suspense. The film is grounded in realism. Although at first the other characters disapprove of Jefferies' obsession with keeping an eye on his neighbours, but gradually they also become addicted to this practice of voyeurism.<br/><br/>Rear Window is arguably Alfred Hitchcock's best film(which is saying a lot). The movie grabs your attention immediately and never lets got of it. It is an immensely engaging watch and a genuine masterpiece."
"kathleen-n-oneal","6","2","4","2 December 2014"," An Interesting Psychological Thriller
","One of the most remarkable things about Rear Window is the way in which the perspective of the cinematography contributes to a feeling of claustrophobia for the viewer as we experience everything outside of the protagonist's apartment from his point of view looking out of his window as he recuperates from a broken leg. The film is an interesting commentary on voyeurism, privacy, and gender although I wish that the plot had been a bit more developed than it was and that the audience was given more context for the murder of the villain's wife, the event which drives the action in the movie. I also wish that the conflicted feelings of the protagonist in reference to marrying his girlfriend had been dealt with in a fuller sense."
"FilmMuscle","7","2","4","30 September 2013"," Looking Through the Rear Window
","Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. <br/><br/>Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. <br/><br/>Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). <br/><br/>Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. <br/><br/>In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)"

","I'm 47 years old and have just recently started to try and experience some of the three and four star older movies which is pre-1970 for me. One thing that I have learned is that you have to give them a little more time. There were several times in the first hour or so that I almost gave up on it, but once things started happening, it was just as exciting and sometimes even more so than current action films today. I've heard so much about Grace Kelly and she really was wonderful in this movie. Biographies have said that she truly missed being an actress after her marriage, and you can tell in this movie how much she loved her craft. Jimmy Stewart plays the part well, although it is hard to imagine that someone like Grace Kelly would be interested in him. I loved the character of the nurse, Stella. The storyline really started moving once all three actors were involved. All in all an enjoyable movie."
"98nurdinm-1","7","2","4","24 March 2005"," Classic Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest film directors during the first half of the twentieth century. His films have become legends in their own right, and have established a style and genre all of their own. the term 'Hitchcockian' is now widely used for a film today where all the elements of a Hitchcock film have been exploited to the highest level. Very few films can break this mould and be truly considered in the same league as some of this great man's work.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is probably in the same group as other memorable Hitchcock movies. They are all memorable, of course, but there are one or two classic Hitchcock movies - such as ""North By Northwest"" and, of course, ""Psycho"" - that are TRULY memorable. You can tell when a movie is memorable, for example, when ""The Simpsons"" parody the film in an entire episode - see ""Bart Of Darkness"", it's very good and very funny.<br/><br/>James Stewart is in the lead role, playing L.B.Jeffries, a photo-journalist who has broken his leg and spends his days staring out of his apartment window at all the neighbours. There is a very quiet, but quite apparent fascination here that Hitchcock explores brilliantly. Although it is never mentioned, and it is not strongly suggested, there is an element of something in this movie that helps to give the movie one of its classic Hitchcock themes - exploring taboo subjects very, very slightly. There's the newly-married couple who never seem to get out of bed, the ballet dancer who practises in her underwear, and the sculptor who lives underneath her. With the songwriter in his penthouse apartment providing incidental music, we also have the suicidal and lonely woman who craves the love of another, and the elderly couple who sleep outside on the balcony and use a basket to give their dog some exercise.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the Thorwalds. Here the main aspect of the plot comes into play. Jeffires becomes convinced that Mr Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr, who would go on to play ""Ironside"") has murdered his wife and done away with the body. Using his photographic lenses, Jeffires spies on Thorwald, trying to catch a glimpse of anything that will help prove his suspicions.<br/><br/>He is helped through this by three individuals. The first is his lover, Lisa Fremont (Played by the beautiful Grace Kelly), a woman who Jeffries believes is too perfect for him. The second is his masseuse and helper from the insurance company, Stella, (Thelma Ritter), who provides some of the funniest lines in the film with her dark, sometimes twisted humour. Finally, and the one who needs the most convincing of all, there's Jeffires' old friend from the air force, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey). However, his involvement only complicates matters, as he constantly brings out evidence that Mrs Thorwald is not dead, but simply on holiday.<br/><br/>The final half-hour or so of the film has quite a few twists and turns. The eventual conclusion, that Thorwald IS a murderer, is something you want to happen. this is another of those Hitchcockian elements. As an viewer you WANT the man to be a murderer, because you are so sure that Jeffries is right, and you yourself get frustrated when he is constantly proved wrong. There is an extremely tense scene at the end of the film involving Jeffries and Thorwald that puts you on the edge of your seat. The use of light in this scene particularly is excellent.<br/><br/>This is a very good film, and something to watch either with a loved one or just by yourself. Stewart is excellent and constantly dominates the screen even if he is stuck in a wheelchair for most of the film. Grace Kelly is very talented as an actress, and there are one or two rather daring scenes for the 1950s that show you that Hitchcock was full aware of the changing attitudes towards this sort of thing. I also think that Thelma Ritter deserves a mention, as she holds the film together with her witty comments and is largely ignored by some reviewers.<br/><br/>But the real stars are the neighbours of Jeffires. The whole film is shot from the room in Jeffries' apartment, which is in itself a wonderful idea. Whenever we see through that window something new and interesting is happening for each of the neighbours - be it witty, like the newly wed woman who can't seem to get enough, or tragic, like the lonely woman who lives underneath the Thorwalds. The final scene shows Jeffries, not only with two legs broken, but also facing away from the window. He does not need to watch his neighbours any more. this is a nice touch, and it symbolises that all is going to go well for our friend Jeffries. Plus Grace Kelly is on his couch, so that's a bonus as well!"
"ncarmadilloman","Null","2","4","29 July 2004"," ""Close the Curtain... Please!"" (Spoiler)
","The writing for ""Rear Window"" is little more than an insult to the intelligence of modern day man. Understand that, based on the chronology of my all time favorite films I do have the ability to watch a piece from this era realistically, giving all the necessary consideration to when it was made.<br/><br/>First of all, most of the eventual suspicions acted upon by the cast are thin at best. The ones they're built on, (the basis for Stewart's initial disturbance) are completely unwarranted. There simply isn't enough evidence to ignite the investigation.<br/><br/>The culprit, (Raymond Burr), is suspected of killing and dismembering his wife. The viewing audience is expected to believe that he meticulously disposes of the body with the exception of her head, which, if I'm not mistaken, he buries in the flowerbed outside his own apartment building. Come on, this guy's not portrayed as a serial killer so don't give me that ""subliminal need to be caught"" crap!<br/><br/>When the neighbors little dog becomes curious and begins digging in the garden he promptly becomes the films second casualty. Instead of properly disposing of the tiny carcass it is left lying on the walkway beside the flowerbed, sending its owner and the rest of the complex into a state of panic. Was he nearly caught in the Act? I don't know, give me at least a slight indication! I could go on and on. The nighttime voyeurism from Stewart's window with the room brightly lit, etcÂ… More disturbing than anything else was the dialogue. I don't believe that people communicated in this manner in the fifties, or anytime in the twentieth century for that matter. The conversations between Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are like a psychotic production of Shakespeare meets The Farmer in the Dell. Oddly enough the one refreshingly realistic role was that of Thelma Ritter, who plays Jimmy Stewart's home healthcare worker. <br/><br/>Rear Window is worth watching, if for no other reason than to witness Hitchcock's phenomenal camera work. I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. Unfortunately, three of his most popular films, (Psycho excluded), are three of my all time least favorite. In fact, the nicest thing that I can say about this movie is that it wasn't nearly as bad as ""Vertigo"".<br/><br/>A foot note. It might surprise you to know that I've seen this film many times. You see; I have insomnia and there is a classic movie channel that plays it late at night on a semi-regular basis. For me the viewing experience comparable to a shot of Nyquil and three Zanax."
"alice liddell","10","2","4","29 March 2000"," Even Homer nods. (possible spoiler)
","Hitchcock's most perfect movie, so perfect that it ALMOST seems unsatisfying.  Compared to VERTIGO, where every loose end and ambiguity only leads one into an interpretive labyrinth, each piece of REAR WINDOW's puzzle seems to fit; there is little room for doubt.  Interpretations are variations on two themes - a critique of voyeurism; and an investigation into heterosexual relationships (critics have been quick to pounce on the paralells between the Thorwalds and Jeffries and Lisa, their names all begin with 'L'), and the film is probably the best we have on both these subjects.<br/><br/>But, like Peter Wollen, I see Hitchcock as primarily a Surrealist, and read this way, we can return to the film all the ambiguity and doubt proper to Hitch's artistry.  The film is about playing God.  Two gods, the director and the lead character.  It is important to note the difference, and Hitchcock does very clearly, because it is the disparity between the two that calls into question the very reality of the film itself.<br/><br/>
Although the film we are about to watch concerns assault, murder, loneliness, attempted rape, and modern alienation, it opens with a score of uncommon jauntiness.  Three blinds go up one by one, not by human hand, revealing the view from the rear window, the field of the film's play.  The camera then travels through this field, introducing us briefly to the secondary characters and environs before finally bringing us to our hero, LB Jeffries, asleep on his chair.<br/><br/>This opening sequence is crucial in two ways.  Firstly, the majority of the film's action arises from motivation inspired by Jeff's point of view.  He sees a certain action, he interprets it, and the other characters act accordingly.  He is a godlike character, in classic Hollywood close-up, while the little people he watches are boxed in their little lives like TV sets.  He can even create people; before we even meet Lisa, he has provided us with a detailed picture of her, that she seems to conform to pretty well. He sees all, like God, and no-one can see him.<br/><br/>Except, of course, he doesn't.  This opening sequence has already shown us things he hasn't seen.  He is frequently missing important plot elements, through sleep, or watching someone else, or being bothered by Lisa.  The sleep thing is important.  Notice how many scenes begin with Jeff waking up, or how the climactic events, which fulfil his every prediction, takes place at night.  Notice the repetition and circularity in the film, how certain scenes, patterns, motifs, colours return (eg. Lisa turning on the three lights), like signposts in a dream.  Look at how a man in a cast, powerless, impotent (unable to even uncork a wine bottle) grows in power, turns two sensible independent women into his pawns.<br/><br/>Notice how Thorwald is his doppelganger, not an evil Other, how when he looks at Thorwald he sees himself, how Thorwald's window reflects on his lens, how the final struggle is less between good and evil, than an existential conflict of the self.  Note the pattern of Jeff's viewing, especially the correlation between Miss Torso and the Thorwalds, he always turns from one to the other.  Miss Torso represents sex, Jeff's lust; the Thorwalds death - the two are inseperable in his mind, especially when you consider Lisa compared Miss Torso's loneliness to her own.<br/><br/>
Watch how the views across the street are less those of independent characters, than projections of Jeff's desire or anxiety - watch how each one seem to match his state of mind.  Is it far-fetched to suggest that the whole film is Jeff's dream?<br/><br/>Even if you reject this extreme interpretation, Hitchcock's ironies are masterly.  Jeff is a man whose career is to travel the world, who is a war hero, and yet is not only confined to a cast, but is forced to confront the notion of home, of melodrama, of the lives of 'ordinary' people who have to stay put and do the same thing day in day out.  When you think about it, most of what happens across the street is the stuff of cheap novelette - Jeff obviously doesn't read very much (or else he wouldn't be spying) - haven't we all imagined scenarios for people we see on buses etc.<br/><br/>
What about Jeff's fear of sex, his pleasure in onanism (figured in his continuous need to scratch)?  Or, one of the most beautiful scenes in all Hitchcock (i.e. cinema), the kiss, where the film slows down, and the story becomes a momentary fairy tale, operating on a different temporal level, out of time - Jeff's problem is that he has too much time, too much of the same time.  Hitchcock never features in the group of great 1950s melodramatists, but surely his subversion of the crime genre, and masculinity, is every bit as melodramatic as Minnelli or Ray.<br/><br/>The film, as well as sensing, years before Antonioni, urban alienation, also reveals the fears of men with no more wars to fight or Wests to win, and must stay at home, like women have always had to.  Jeff's real pain is that Lisa is independent, mobile, earning as much, if not more, than him, and refuses to kowtow.  Far from being a misogynist, as is his reputation, Hitchcock always shows how silly men are.<br/><br/>(Oh yeah, I forgot.  It's a brilliant thriller too - I've seen the film a dozen times, and still get breathless and sweaty when Lisa goes into Thorwald's apartment.  And the scene, where the dead dog is discovered (the only time until the climax any of the groundlings get more than a long shot) has the best editing since THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS)."

","So I just watched this for the first time in years, and as I often tend to nitpick things, I have a few beefs with the protagonist's shortsightedness. First, who would spy on their neighbors through large uncovered windows with the lights on, allowing the person being watched to see you? You'd think he would try to be a little more covert, as any rational person would, especially after he suspected a murder. Then after he's discovered, he doesn't anticipate that the killer would come after him next? The killer expectedly pays him a visit, and instead of the snooper grabbing a blunt object and concealing it behind his back, he foolhardily decides to blind the guy with his camera's flash. It's unlikely that an attacker would stop and go, letting him reload film each time. Imagine it were bullets being loaded. Would you wait for someone to shoot you twice? Any normal killer would've went straight at him. Moreover, why didn't the photog just take pictures of what he saw? He's already holding a camera. I guess he got so caught up in all of it and wasn't using his head. Oh well, I guess this is still considreed classic cinema."

","Plot<br/><br/>Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful heat wave, he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.<br/><br/>He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames ""Miss Torso""; a single woman he calls ""Miss Lonelyhearts""; a talented, single, composer-pianist; several married couples, one of them newlyweds; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.<br/><br/>Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful socialite girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.<br/><br/>One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream ""Don't!"" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.<br/><br/>Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), a New York City Police detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself. Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.<br/><br/>Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.<br/><br/>Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.<br/><br/>Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.<br/><br/>A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.<br/><br/>Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled Beyond the High Himalayas.

we are joined by Jeff and he is a photographer and he is willing to take risks for the perfect picture and we see him in a wheelchair and here comes the perfect camera work we see every neighbour out there when Jeff is watching out from the window but we never go inside their apartment because Jeff is in a wheelchair with a broken leg but in the movie we find out that he has a lover and her name is Lisa and she is perfect and beautiful but Jeff says she is way too perfect for him and wants to break up with her cause she does not want to take risks but then Jeff finds out that one of the neighbours named Thorwald killed his wife and he tries to tell everyone that he killed her and no one belives him cause until he does something suspicious and then we try to catch him doing something Jeff tries to tell his Thomas which is a cop and he doesn't belive him and then they find out that he did it and Lisa goes in his apartment and she gets caught and then he sees Jeff and goes to him and tries to kill him but does not succeds and then we get the final shot Lisa willing to take risks and Jeff has his both of his legs broken
i liked about the movie: the camera work was fantastic and amazing and also it was fun to see neighbours doing something and it was really intresting and also the story was really intresting and the ending was really stressful
the thing i didn't like about the movie: is the movie for me felt like way too stretched and in my opinion there are some scenes that not much happening and it makes the movie feel kind of boring and it feels like this movie is supposed to be like 1 hr and 20 min long but was strecthed with almost 2 hr and also i didn't like when Thorwald came to kill Jeff and he used flash to make him stop to go kill him and Thorwald walked so slowly to him he could easily kill him but i would like the movie much more but i didn't and i would rate it 8 but some scenes are just strecthed which is boring so i have to give it 7 a good mystery movie yes"

","Undoubtedly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Alfred Hitchcock has a body of work so classic and influential that it is almost impossible to view the films with fresh eyes. His style has been emulated, parodied, and downright copied so many times that even those who come to his films later in life will find them familiar. His vision as an auteur of film is arguably unparalleled, and Rear Window is among the best of his work.
James Stewart, a regular in Hitchcock pictures, plays Jeff, a professional photographer who is bedridden with a broken leg. Somewhat immobilized, Jeff's vantage point is restricted to his apartment, where Hitchcock keeps the audience's perspective based. After discussing with his nurse that his girlfriend Lisa is ""too perfect"" for him, she is introduced as an imposing force of beauty played by Grace Kelly, another Hitchcock favorite, her shadow looming over Jeff as he wakes up to the most extreme close-up shot in the movie of her beaming face.
The premise of the plot is simple enough. Without much else to keep him entertained, Jeff peers through his rear window into the lives of his neighbours, who he affectionately gives nicknames such as Miss Torso and Miss Lonelyhearts, until a suspicious series of events lead him to believe that one of his neighbors has killed his wife. Full of red herrings, dealing with themes of voyeurism, marriage and captivity, and featuring his trademark cameo, Hitchcock masterfully conducts every element of Rear Window.
One of the most notable aspects of the film is constrained perspective. Hitchcock uses the limited scope of what can be seen by both the characters and the audience to drive the narrative. This objective goes beyond his selective mise-en-scÃ¨ne, pushing the audience to listen in a bit more closely and strain to see more than they are shown. This technique is used to virtually the opposite effect in Psycho, where Hitchcock challenges convention by killing off the protagonist half-way through the film, and following a variety of characters including the film's villain. While drastically different in terms of style, it is the same level of control over what the audience gets to see that makes them quintessentially Hitchcock."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Panning and peeping is what a man with a broken leg in a wheel chair is doing as he looks down and across the courtyard from his apartment to another apartment building and into the windows of each unit. He believes he has spotted a crime occur...based on witnessing chopped up segments of time, his limited vantage point and visual obstructions. As his imagination runs wild, he begins using a long range lens to help back up his assumptions! He contacts a few other able bodied people and they get into mix to find the truth. Is what he think he saw really what he believes? This is a really unique approach to a film, even by today's screenplays. I love the opening series of panning shots to paint the picture of the location from the POV of the main character stuck in a wheelchair trying to entertain his mind.

","Rear Window is a masterpiece of voyeurism and claustrophobic storytelling. Here is a film that slowly builds the suspense and paranoia and does it with style. The production is outstanding and gives the film an intoxicating atmosphere. Hitchcock masterfully puts us in the shoes of Jeff, (James Stewart) as he seats in his apartment and spies on his neighbors. Except for one instance, we see everything that Jeff sees, which includes a possible murder. From that point on, the film grabs a hold of you and leaves you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The casting is flawless. James Stewart is funny, likable and a little creepy as Jeff. Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter are excellent as his girlfriend and nurse. When it comes to suspense and entertainment, you don't get much better than this. A masterwork by the master of suspense."

","""Rear Window"" is the type of classic that has become such a part of pop culture that it's likely never going to surprise anyone with its plot twists again thanks to its proliferation, but it's still a great way to spend two hours. The setting itself is one of the movie's most effective touches, with its intimacy and its structural uniqueness, and it's not hard for the audience to get lost in the movie's central mystery. James Stewart and Grace Kelly make a grand duo onscreen, with Stewart's curmudgeon charm doing most of the dramatic heavy lifting here. This is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's most famous thrillers, and while it's definitely been impacted by the passing of time, it's a worthwhile classic that should be seen by every cinephile at least once."
"jbingham-87310","9","0","0","29 September 2018"," An Alfred Hitchcock Classic
","Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces. This movie uses many film techniques, one of them being camera angles that help builds suspense and creates such a phenomenal film. Hitchcock's use of experimentation using only one soundstage for the entire length of the film while most of the filming was in one small part of the soundstage; the apartment of L.B. Jeffries ""Jeff"". While using this one scene, Hitchcock is able to keep the audience engaged for the duration of the film, he is able to do this by using suspense. <br/><br/>Hitchcock's use of camera angle as a means to communicate to the audience helps to keep the audience engaged while also a better understanding of the events occuring in the film. The film is based off of Jeff being confined to his apartment after he broke his leg while trying to take a picture at a race track. This is very important planning by Hitchcock as he would have been seen as a stalker taking pictures and having the binoculars. Hitchcock's planning of Jeff's character is very important as he's curious by nature, this is emphasized as his job of being a photographer. His curiosity is defined by the camera angles of Jeff's apartment and his perspective view. Many scenes are built off of suspense that has been created by the characters saying things first and then the viewer is able to see the scene. One example of a camera angle showing a clearer perspective for the audience is after Lisa -Jeff's girlfriend- is finally convinced that Mr. Thorwald may have injured his wife. The camera pans in towards Lisa to show that she is now the center of focus and that she is on the same level as Jeff, sharing the belief that something terrible has happened to Mrs. Thorwald. Another example of Hitchcock's use of camera angle is when Lisa is in Thorwald's apartment and Lisa is snooping around his apartment. Hitchcock pans back and forth between Lisa and Jeff to help build the suspense of the scene as Thorwald approaches Lisa. This back and forth between the different reactions of the characters builds suspense by leaving the audience questioning about what is going to occur. <br/><br/>Hitchcock uses suspense to develop the plot of the movie. There were snap shots in the movie of clocks ticking which showed intense situations and the camera angle panning Mr. Thorwald and Jeff to show the scene getting more intense. Using the clock ticking away to show time moving creates an environment for the audience to be involved and become emotionally attached to the movie. As the audience becomes more caught up in the film they start to focus more on the time as an event occurs. The panning between both characters gets the viewer even more emotionally attached to Jeff when he is being attacked by Mr. Thorwald. As the scene becomes more intense with Thorwald getting closer and closer to Jeff as he is about to attack. While this is occurring the music tempo picks up, this influences the audience's heart rate to increase and makes the scene more intense for the viewer. Hitchcock also uses lighting as another effect to give a more realistic feel to the scene and a first person perspective to present the film in a more dynamic manner. Jeff uses the light and a first person perspective to show Thorwald approaching Jeff as he uses the flash bulb and Thorwald's first person perspective to show the buildup of the scene. It also helps to build suspense of the scene as Hitchcock uses the blinding of Thorwald to leave the audience questioning of what is happening to Jeff as Thorwald approaches slowly."
"mpothaczky","9","0","0","27 September 2018"," Hitchcock's Film About A Man Looking Out a Window is Surprisingly One of His Best
","'Rear Window' Is about a man named Jeff with a broken leg that has nothing better to do than sit in his window and people watch. The film is confined to one room for about 99% of it's run time, Hitchcock uses this to make the viewer feel safe from the actions of the outside world. The camera follows Jeff's eyes while he sits in his window, as Jeff leans in to get a better look the viewer also gets this view. We become comfortable with becoming this 'peeping tom', while his girlfriend Lisa joins him in his voyeurism. The view does not hear what the characters are saying, just like Jeff. We only hear the muffled words spoken across the courtyard making everything that much more mysterious. Jeff receives no consequences for looking in the private lives of his neighbors, his room becomes this safe place. Hitchcock exploits this feeling the viewer has, the man who Jeff is accusing of murder approaches him in his 'safe place'. Hitchcock creates this scene of immense suspense, Jeff hears the footsteps of Thorwald (the murderer) slowly making his way up to Jeff's room after he had spotted Jeff. Jeff sits in his room crippled and unable to defend himself, he frantically moves around his room trying to find something to defend himself with. This sense of helplessness and a breaking of comfortable boundaries makes this situation feel real, the viewer is thrown into suspense as they question what will come next. The most eventful scene of the movie is the one where we finally leave the building as Jeff is pushed out by Thorwald, this shows how we have reached the conflict and peak of the film. This change of pace at the end of the film makes the sense that more potent, most of the film has been slow-paced up to that point. <br/><br/>Using just one room and a small neighborhood Hitchcock creates these small but deep stories for each neighbor. These stories create character and life to the neighborhood that many filmmakers seek to form, but Hitchcock does it with a much smaller setting. The film shows many of the different phases of both marriage and loneliness. Across the way, you have the Thorwalds where the husband is seen possibly cheating (but we know that it ended up in murder), Mrs. Lonelyheart and the songwriter both struggle with loneliness, and the newlyweds and Mrs. Torso both are deeply in love with their corresponding lovers. Jeff and Lisa both go through internal conflicts about whether or not they should change their way of life for their lover, they exemplify the dating stage before marriage. These side stories keep the viewer's attention, there's always something to interesting going on. Hitchcock's use of music throughout the film also helps give this character, music is also used as a plot device as well. The songwriter slowly struggles to finish his piece, while this happens Jeff and Lisa feud about where their relationship is heading. As Jeff and Lisa become closer because of the external conflict (Thorwald's murder) the piece becomes more complete. At the end of the film, the songwriter plays his piece which is named Lisa while the couple sit together happily in Jeff's apartment.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is one of his best works, his masterfulness of suspense shines through. He kept me engaged throughout the whole film, there was never a dull moment. Hitchcock's use of the camera pairs Jeff and the viewer together creating this sense of engagement that most films cannot create. You along with Jeff are solving this mystery, for most of the film you only hear and see what Jeff does. Rear Window pacing makes the main story feel natural, the small side stories in between help give the movie it's charm and character while tackling some serious issues (Mrs. Lonleyhearts). Overall, I think this along with Psycho are his top two films, pushing the boundaries in both of their corresponding genres while utilizing Hitchcock's mastery of suspense."

"brp-91602","10","0","0","27 September 2018"," Movie Review
","It's great to experience a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat, very rarely does a movie have a story that has you so immersed that you forget you are watching a movie. The movie was so good I had my roommates join me in the movie viewing. I enjoyed a lot of the subtle camera work in the movie because it made you feel like you are seeing everything though Jeff's perspective.
A good example is when Jeff is looking out his window to see his neighbor, Lars Thorwald, bringing his wife food to her bed on a tray, the camera is zoomed out, showing that Jeff is just passively watching not seeing anything interesting happening. Then it shows Jeff sitting in his wheelchair suddenly being enticed in something that's going on off camera, so the camera pans back to Lars and his wife but this time the camera is slowly zooming in as the scene progresses to show that Jeff is interested in what's going on, it's as if we are seeing this scene through Jeff's eyes.
Something that I found very interesting about rear window that I didn't realize until we talked about it in class, is the fact that the whole movie takes place in the same room for the whole length of the movie. That's very impressive since showing the same room for the whole movie would normally lose the audiences interest. The only other movies that I've seen pull this off was the breakfast club and 12 angry men.
I thought It was very cool that Jeff was watching all his neighbors as if it was some crystal ball showing him all the different futures that he could have. I liked that each neighbor represented something that Jeff was thinking about, whether it was the young couple who just got married and are happy that they just got married, showing that Jeff was thinking about how happy he would be if he was to marry Lisa. Miss. Torso representing some girl of his dreams that he just can't take look away from her. Lars Thorwald representing an older version of Jeff who is unhappy with his marriage. The young musician, representing Jeff because he's successful and well recognized but unhappy because he feels alone. Miss. Lonely heart representing an older version of Jeff who choose not to marry Lisa and feeling alone.
I loved the fact that you can see Hitchcock in the movie when the musician is at the piano and someone is winding the mantel clock, I like it because I thought Orson Welles was one of the first movie directors to cameo in their own movies.
Something I thought was interesting was the fact that at the end of the movie it shows the young couple's window, the newly wed husband comes out to smoke and have a small break from his new wife and she calls out to him and it shows his face that he's annoyed representing that the honey moon was over."

","Rear Window Review
The film Rear Window is about a photographer named Jeff. Jeff has a broken leg and is stuck in his apartment for another week. So, what does he do? He looks out the window and watches his neighbors. When one of his neighbors starts acting suspicions Jeff starts to think that he murdered his wife. Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, and his nurse Stella also become suspicious and they investigate. 
Rear Window is a fantastic film filled with suspense and excitement. There are some amazing techniques used in in the film. Starting with the control of your emotions right from the start. After only a few minutes into the film we learn of Jeff's suspicions of the neighbor Mr. Thorwald. The suspense and my curiosity only went up from there. This control from the start had completely blew my expectations out of the water. I thought I was going to half pay attention, half do something else, but I couldn't. I was fully focused and engaged in the film right from the start. 
Besides grabbing you from the start there are many great technical effects used in the making of this film. For example, we go through the story from Jeff's perspective. We see what is happening as Jeff does. He is looking out his window across the courtyard at his neighbor's apartment. We see this as a wide shot. The audience sees what Jeff sees. We also look through his hand-held camera with him to zoom in across the courtyard. Another way we share Jeff's perspective is by viewing the events in the film through his eyes. There is a moving shot following Jeff's eyes looking through the courtyard. The camera also pans from inside the apartment to outside and to the neighbor's apartments following where Jeff is looking. 
Other great effects in the film are the sound. I think the most dramatic example is when Mr. Thorwald is walking towards Jeff's apartment. You can hear his footsteps, one at a time, slowly waking towards the door, getting louder and closer. This add suspense. Another key element to the sound in the film was the music. Music helps to show what is going in a story. Suspenseful music enhances suspenseful scenes and intensifies the viewers experience. This also helps to control our emotions. 
Rear window has some interesting ideas for characterization. These ideas are conveyed through the characters names, dialogue and actions. The two main characters are Jeff and Lisa. Jeff is an average name for an average person with an average life and job. Lisa has a pretty name which is appropriate to her character. In the film she is a beautiful fasion model. We don't always associate intelligence with someone who appears as Lisa does but she is much more than that, and we see this through her words and actions. Towards the beginning of the film and through ought its entirety Lisa believes that Mr. Thorwald did murder his wife because she would have never left the house without her purse, wedding ring and other jewelry. Lisa calls this her women's intuition. We also learn more about her character through her actions. Towards the end of the film she goes across the court yard and climbs up the fire escape to Mr. Thorwald's apartment. This demonstrates that she is much more than a pretty model. It demonstrates that she has courage and bravery. 
Lastly Alfred Hitchcock is great with lighting and its effect on the story. As we follow Jeff we learn more information as he does. To elaborate, we learn more about Thorwald in the day time then at night. At night Jeff is just guessing and speculation about what is going on. All this appropriately matches up with the amount of lighting that is in the scene. 
I understand why this film is considered a classic and would recommend it to others."
"amb-17775","9","0","0","27 September 2018"," Audiovisual masterpiece
","Being a Hitchcock movie, Rear Window has excellent use of many tactics to increase suspense. One thing that I found fascinating was how this film also skillfully employs the use of audio and the view of the camera in playing with the concept of perspective. Jefferies is physically trapped in his apartment, bound by injury and feels trapped emotionally as well. We are kept inside the apartment with him until Jefferies finally ""makes his exit"". Throughout the whole film what we are able to hear is true to what Jefferies would have been able to hear except at a couple key points. 
When Jeff is in his apartment listening out he can hardly make out what people are saying, at several points in the movie he often leans in to try and hear better, an action that is accompanied by slight tightening of the camera shots, which really creates a very accurate first-person perspective. Hitchcock tried very hard to keep the perspective true to what those looking out of the window were seeing, only using third person shots within the apartment and in the final scenes. This was important because, by trapping us in one perspective, some information seemed desperately close but still out of reach, creating Hitchcock's favorite thing, suspense. However, that is not the only reason the use of perspective was critical in this film. It was important because whenever it was strayed from an event would stand out drastically. Look, for example, at when the footsteps were coming up the hall at the beginning of the third act, they were by far the loudest thing to happen in the movie up to that point, which brought a new element into the film, fear. Up till then we had felt safe yet quizzical in Jefferies' apartment, trying to figure out a puzzle on the outside. Now that puzzle and all the dangers with it, were coming into our safe space where we had been trapped. The sheer difference in the exaggerated volume (along with the lighting of the apartment) this scene had from those before made it stand out and added emotion. 
Another example of how perspective was used in the film is rooted in the camerawork rather than the audio. As I stated before, the only time the camera shot leaves the apartment is when Jefferies does. Once he is outside the apartment we see the scene from the perspective of the onlookers and those in the apartment. This is in stark contrast to the views we have had up to this point and lends additional gravity to an already heavy scene. Finally, by trapping the camera in the apartment Hitchcock was able to also make my favorite scene in the movie. When Lisa was in Thorwald's apartment we could see her actions along with Thorwald's walk up the hall at the same time. This created an intensely suspenseful scene having all the aspects of parallel editing without the camera ever having to change its location.
Hitchcock was known for his use of suspense and Rear Window is another suspenseful masterpiece. There were a number of other very intriguing facets to this movie but what really stood out to me was his ability to create suspense and manipulate his audience with perspective. This film was a delight to watch and there is much more to be said about it but I didn't see much mention of Hitchcock's use of audiovisual in the reviews, so I thought I would bring up my perspective."

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a masterpiece of filmmaking. The film focuses on a professional photographer, Jeff Jeffries, who broke his leg and spends his time recovering by looking at his neighbors through a rear window in his apartment. Throughout this time Jeff suspects that one of his neighbors has murdered someone, while also having conflicts with his girlfriend, Lisa Fremont. 
 Throughout the film, there is a linear plot. This helps ensure that the audience is not bored while watching the film, as there is always something new happening throughout the film. This plot does focus on a specific point, which is the lives of Jeff's neighbors. The entire plot occurs within one setting, which is Jeff's apartment. Nevertheless, through Hitchcock's change throughout the film, audience remains entertained despite the fact that the setting does not change throughout the film, which is something that was not really done at the time. 
 Hitchcock's use of conflict also works towards the goal of entertaining the audience. The film does delve into aspects of the lives of the other characters, but maintains a focus on Jeff Jefferies, the film's main character. The struggles shown throughout the film are his own, from the internal conflict of whether to marry Lisa Fremont, to the external conflict of proving Thorwald murdered his wife. These conflicts are developed in a way that holds the viewer's interest.
 The film's use of suspense also helps keep the audience interested. Throughout the entire film, Hitchcock never actually shows that Lars Thorwald murdered his wife, but the audience is informed of Jeff's suspicions as Lar's actions get more and more dubious throughout the course of the film. The audience is left with the question of whether Jeff will be proven wrong, or if Thorwald really did murder his wife, throughout the entire Second Act. of the film. Hitchcock also uses suspense in smaller magnitudes throughout the film, including a phone call that Detective Doyle takes. The audience doesn't hear the call after the caller asks if Doyle is on the line, but we are told of it afterwards. In the meantime, we are left wondering what was said and what effect it would have on the film. This furthers the audience's interest and renders them unable to stop watching. 
 Hitchcock presents moral questions regarding privacy throughout the film, which is one of the central themes. Throughout the entire film, Jeffries's curiosity leads him to invade his neighbors lives from afar, and take the audience along with him. It even gets to the point where he almost takes his focus off of a woman about to commit suicide in order to satisfy his curiosity about whether Thorwald killed his wife or not, but it doesn't end there. Jeffries continuously spies on all of his neighbors, coming up with cute names for them. He spends his entire recovery looking out of a rear window at his neighbors. He is literally unable to stop. This point is stressed by the actors in the film, where the actor portraying Jeff shows that there is no point where Jeff will not go in order to satisfy the urge to spy on his neighbors. When the lights in Thorwald's apartment goes out, he simply changes to a different neighbor for a moment. This central theme of the ethics of questions regarding breaching someone's privacy adds to the content of the film, making it substantially more interesting. 
 Hitchcock also uses irony beautifully in Rear Window. Throughout the entire film, all Jeff wants is to go back to work and get out of his apartment. He even asks for a job while he is still in a cast, which he is denied. In the end he ends up with another broken leg. This further adds to the theme of the ethics involving privacy because it almost seems to be a punishment to Jeff for spying on his neighbors so frequently. Now he will have to stay in his apartment for much longer than he intended, which he considered torture. 
 The script of Rear Window is written well in order to convey the theme and maintain the audience's interest. Throughout the movie, there is always some element at play maintains the viewers' interest in the film, and the plot furthers the central theme. Whether it's irony, suspense, or action, there is always something holding the attention of the audience. Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window manages to experiment and break norms of the time in order to deliver a wonderful experience to the audience, and is interesting at every turn."

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a very captivating piece. In the film a professional traveling photographer, L. B. Jefferies, is confined to his small apartment due to a broken leg. He becomes infatuated with watching the everyday lives of his neighbors through his window. As time goes on, Jefferies starts to believe that he may have witnessed a murder of a woman take place in one of the apartments due to the suspicious actions taken by his neighbor, Thorwald. Jefferies tries to piece together this mystery while also trying to gain the help of his girlfriend Lisa, his nurse Stella, and detective and friend, Doyle. The tension and excitement in the film becomes so exquisite that the viewer tends to forget a very large piece of the film; Jefferies never leaves his room. The entire movie is set from Jefferies' apartment. We become so involved with the story and concerned over what is going to happen next, we don't even realize the setting is the same throughout the entirety of the film. The camera angles also help us with this. We feel as though we are also watching Jefferies' neighbors through his window, as if we were sitting in the room right there with Jefferies. We understand his point of view very well because he is unable to leave his room due to his broken leg. All the characters in this film, including Lisa and Stella, leave Jefferies' apartment at some point, but as for us, the camera stays in the room for the entire time, so we only see through Jefferies' view. To add to the mysterious vibe of the film, we are only able to see some parts of what happens across the way. For example, when Lisa goes into the murder's, Thorwald's, apartment, we are only able to see half of what is going on. Some scenes are cut off by a wall or a building to add to the suspense of the scene. Another element that makes this plot so interesting is how Jefferies' perspective on love and marriage changed throughout the film. As he watches through his window, he sees people in many different stages of their relationships. He starts out not wanting to marry Lisa. As the film progresses and he continues to observe these couples and fall more in love with Lisa, he realizes that he wants to be with her for the rest of his life. This was a very subtle, yet delightful, addition to the plot of the film. Another important element that makes this film so enticing is the plot progression. The plot includes the linear structure of films in acts broken down into exposition, complication, climax, and denouement. Throughout the film, Jefferies' is made out to be crazy by his friend Doyle. Doyle is a detective and every time Jefferies has a claim against Thorwald, Doyle is there to automatically shut it down. But with the help of Lisa and Stella, Jefferies eventually proves that he was right all along, and all the pieces come together. In the beginning of the film, the mood starts off very laidback and innocent, but as it progresses, we start to see how serious the problem really is and eventually Jefferies is caught right up in the action. It is definitely a film that will keep you interested throughout due to all of the suspense. This movie shows the overall nature of humans; we are very curious beings. As for the ending, we are aware of what Thorwald can do, which makes this scene so suspenseful. But, due to Jefferies' fast and resourceful thinking he is able to survive the attack and Thorwald is finally caught for the vicious crime he has committed. This is one of the most remarkable and gripping endings I have ever watched. Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock aged very well and is definitely still a must-see."

","Hitchcock's Rear Window is a masterpiece that pairs dynamic cinematography and sound design with great acting and a unique plot. The film is highly experimental, with every scene being shot on a single (but massive) soundstage; and with most of the scenes being shot from one camera location within that soundstage. The title is very apt, as we experience almost the entire film through the rear window of a Chelsea apartment. Despite these self imposed restrictions, the film is still able to captivate audiences to this day.<br/><br/>In the expository phase of the film, we learn much about the protagonist L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries from the very first shot. We see out the window from which he looks, all of his neighbors going about their daily business, generally a very vibrant and lively opening scene. Then, as the camera pans inward towards Jeffries' apartment, the film gives us an overview of his condition, by showing us the cast of his broken leg, his name, by showing us the writing on the cast, his job, by showing us some of his photography, and his girlfriend, by showing us a picture of her; all without a single word being spoken. Most of the shots at the beginning of each scene are remarkable because of the camera's range of movement; panning and tilting extreme angles. Another bulletin of the cinematography in Rear Window is the heavy use of perspective changes. While we are inside the apartment itself, the cameras take on a more traditional objective perspective, placing the audience as the third party. However, when Jeffries is looking out the window, we subjectively see what he sees, and this is done in a very realistic way. When Jeffries looks towards something that is far away, the scene is not artificially close to the subject of the camera. Instead, we see a wide shot and, as if we were looking out the rear window ourselves, it is hard to completely make out everything that is happening. Of course, when Jeffries picks up a pair of binoculars or a camera, we are able to see a more clear picture of what is happening. This is also reflected in the sound design, as we cannot totally hear everything from a distance and have to try and make out what is being said.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, we are introduced to Jeffries' employer over the phone: they talk about his potential new assignment, going to Indo-China and photographing the situation there. When we are introduced to Stella (Jeffries' nurse) in the next scene, she brings up how she predicted the stock market crash of 1929. These remarks serve to add dimensionality to their characters and make them more relatable to the audience of the time. We are then introduced to Jeffries' neighbors: a newlywed couple, a lonely pianist, a girl nicknamed Miss Lonelyhearts, a seemingly single ballet dancer nicknamed Miss Torso, a sculptor, a couple and their dog, and Thorwald and his wife. The obvious theme presented to us is one of relationships at their various stages: this transitions us well into the overarching conflict between Jeffries and his girlfriend Lisa Freemont. Jeffries and Freemont both work for magazines, but the nature of their work is very different. Jeffries is a photographer who travels the world in pursuit of the latest global conflicts and stories while Lisa is an editor and model for a New York fashion magazine. Lisa would like nothing more but for Jeff to settle down with her and get married, while Jeff would like nothing more but to continue his world travels. Jeff, while still loving her, believes that Lisa is too sophisticated to be his wife, and our first impression of her supports this view. Lisa thinks Jeff is wrong and wants to prove that she is up to the task of world exploration.<br/><br/>The next scene brings us to the main conflict phase of the film. On a rainy night in the early hours of the morning, Jeffries hears a woman scream ""Don't!"" followed by the shattering of a glass. Then, he sees his neighbor Thorwald carry a briefcase several times from his apartment to an undisclosed location. The next morning we see Thorwald cleaning off a knife and saw blade and wrapping them with newspaper. At this point the connotation is obvious and need not be stated until Lisa returns the next day. She sees an opportunity in this case, however grim it may be, to prove her worth to Jeffries. After unsuccessfully trying to get his detective friend to investigate and prosecute Thorwald, Jeffries decides to take things into his own hands. Jeffries sends Lisa to slide a note under Thorwald's door to elicit a reaction and succeeds in not getting caught. Later, however, when Stella and Lisa go to investigate Thorwald's flower bed for evidence and come up blank, Lisa runs and quickly climbs the fire escape to enter Thorwald's apartment.<br/><br/>What follows is both the climax of the plot and a classic Hitchcock suspense scene that lasts until almost the end of the film. Jeff wants to call Thorwald's apartment to get Lisa out of there but gets distracted by Miss Lonelyhearts' attempt at suicide. In a hint of dramatic irony, the audience is completely aware of Jeff and Stella's ignorance and expects Thorwald's sudden return. When the police enter Thorwald's apartment they prevent him from attacking Lisa further, but Thorwald then realizes he is being watched by Jeffries. Stella leaves to bail out Lisa, and minutes after, Jeffries receives a call: it's Thorwald. After a brief pause to let it sink in, we hear a door slam in the distance. The footsteps approach closer and closer, the light in the hall goes out. When Thorwald enters, the only light source shines on his face. Upon realizing that Jeffries has made the police aware of the murder, Thorwald begins to approach but is hindered by Jeffries use of flashbulbs. The camera takes on the perspective of Thorwald, and visual effects are used to illustrate his temporary blindness after the use of each bulb. When Thorwald does finally reach Jeffries, a close up action scene ensues, with Thorwald throwing Jeffries out of the window from which he was watched. This is the only scene when the camera exited the apartment. In the end, the police arrive again just in time to break Jeffries fall and arrest Thorwald.<br/><br/>Directly after the climax ends and justice is served, we are presented with a scene very similar to the beginning of the film, although this time all of the minor conflicts of the plot are resolved as well: the Pianist and Miss Lonelyhearts are now a couple, the neighbors got a new dog, Miss Torso's boyfriend returns from the army, and Lisa appears to have taken an interest in exploration as she is reading 'Beyond the Himalayas' (although she appears to switch over to a fashion magazine when she realizes Jeffries is asleep). Overall, the film is remarkable in its use of dynamic cinematography from a static setting, and its use of the first person perspective to really make the audience of the film feel directly involved. The characters are well thought out and relatable, and the plot works very well despite the restrictions. Rear Window is a clear exemplification of Hitchcock's natural aptitude for cinematography, plot, and suspense."

","Rear Window is a fantastic mystery and suspense film utilizing unique techniques to captivate the audience. Alfred Hitchcock uses phenomenal camera placement and carefully positioned shots to connect the audience to the main character in a special way. The eyes of the main character, Jefferies, are almost directly tied to what the audience sees. The entire setting for the movie is within Jeff's apartment and the view outside of the window, yet the camera placement is so effective that this setting constraint goes practically unnoticed. With added elements of suspense and such a limited camera viewpoint, the audience is left on the edge of their seats wanting to see what simply can't be seen. 
For a vast majority of the film, the camera is fixated in the apartment of Jefferies and never shows anything beyond the perspective of Jeff himself. Jeff was injured trying to take an action shot on a racetrack, leaving him immobile in a wheelchair next to his apartment window. He spends hours gazing out the window, watching his neighbors, to pass the time. The camera positioning resembles Jeff's view outside the window, panning across the windows just as if Jeff's head was turning. Whenever Jeff leans in to try and get a better view, the next shot is zoomed in a little closer to reflect it. This makes the audience feel extremely connected with Jeff, what he sees is what the audience sees. As Jeff looks around at his neighbors, the audience gets to know the characters, but only from the point of view from which Jeff can see. Conversations can be seen in windows between couples, yet Jeff is too far away to hear and therefore the audience can't hear. The curiosity of Jeff is almost directly passed onto the audience, who struggles to understand the surroundings just as much as he does. This is proven to be very effective once Jeff notices strange behaviours from his neighbor Mr. Thorwald. Jeff can only see snippets of Thorwald's suspicious actions, and they suggest that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He spends hours stalking the man from the window, trying to uncover the mystery as best he can from his viewpoint. The audience is left completely in the dark, only able to see what Jeff can see, escalating the mystery of the murder. The connection of the camera to Jeff's viewpoint captivates the audience in such a unique way.
With the camera being tied to Jeff, the setting for the film almost never changes. Jeff is stuck with a cast on his leg, leaving him in a wheelchair in his apartment. He can't leave the apartment and struggles to move around the room. As a result, the entire setting of the film is limited to the main room of the apartment and its window view. Despite this, the setting limitation goes almost unnoticed. Jeff constantly has visitors or phone calls that give the audience insight into the outside world, never truly limiting the plot to the setting. It is quite impressive how a long film can be so engaging and interesting to the audience, despite taking place in a single room. 
While using thoughtful camera placement to engage the audience, Alfred Hitchcock takes it one step further with suspense. The most noticeable suspense scene takes place right at the climax of the film, when Thorwald breaks into Jeff's apartment. The scene begins with a phone call that Jeff answers, thinking it's his friend. He starts talking immediately, only to be met with cold silence followed by the click of the line ending. Footsteps are then heard in the distance, slowly approaching the door of the apartment. With the lights in the apartment off, the shadow of a man can clearly be seen stop directly in front of the door and pause. Throughout this scene, Jeff is frantically trying to move about the room in his wheelchair, but with little success. With the camera stuck in the room, the audience feels trapped with nowhere to go just watching the main character panic. Once Thorwald breaks into the apartment, it is almost as if he broke into the audience's personal space. The audience has safely watched the story unfold up in Jeff's apartment, only to find the murderer directly in their viewpoint. This suspense and shock grabs the audience for the duration of the climax, making it one of the most engaging parts of the film. By using innovative camera positioning and implementing suspenseful scenes, Alfred Hitchcock creates one of the most engaging and suspenseful films to watch."
"bsg-42134","10","0","0","24 September 2018"," Rear Window Review
","Alfred Hitchcock is undoubtedly the master of suspense. ""Rear Window"" is a testament to his ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Not only does he build suspense through the power of doubt, but the subtleties of his camera-work contribute to the audience's physical and emotional investment.<br/><br/>Rear Window's main character, Jeff, is wheelchair bound after having broken his leg. He spends his time spying on his neighbors, who end up all representing different aspects of love & relationships. One neighbor in particular, Mr. Thorwald, becomes especially suspicious to Jeff as his behaviors seem to indicate that he killed his wife after a rough marriage. We are introduced to Stella, Jeff's visiting nurse who is initially skeptical, and Lisa, Jeff's love interest. Both characters eventually join Jeff in his speculation, and work together trying to figure out if Mr. Thorwald really is a murderer. In the end, Mr. Thorwald is caught and Jeff falls in love with Lisa.<br/><br/>Like any other mystery movie, Rear Window withholds the killer's reveal until the very end, but Hitchcock takes building the suspense a step further. Throughout the movie, Hitchcock makes the audience question or even doubt Jeff, by introducing counter evidence. At times, we are made to believe that maybe Jeff's opinion's are hyper speculative and that his observations can be explained by perfectly reasonable behaviors. This doubt makes the mystery and the suspense so much more powerful, as the situation could realistically go either way. We first begin to doubt Jeff when we are introduced to Stella. Jeff tells Stella about his theory that Mr. Thorwald is a killer, and Stella very reasonably comes up with other explanations for Mr. Thorwald's actions. Hitchcock makes us doubt Jeff a second time, when we are introduced to Detective Doyle. Like Stella, Doyle explains that it is unreasonable to accuse Mr. Thorwald since there is a lack of concrete evidence, let alone act on it and search his apartment. It is hard not to side with Doyle, after all he is an experienced professional with a high reputation. The third and final time Hitchcock makes us doubt Jeff, is when Lisa sneaks into Mr. Thorwald's apartment in search of Mrs. Thorwald's ring. The trio (Jeff, Stella, and Lisa) had reasoned that Mr. Thorwald was sloppy in his execution, and had put Mrs. Thorwald's ring into her purse; a place no woman would ever keep her jewelry. The trio was sure that they would find the ring and solve the mystery. As we watch from Jeff's apartment, Lisa finds that the purse was empty and we are instantly hit with a feeling of ""oh crap! Maybe we were wrong about this..."" By making us doubt the characters and even ourselves to an extent, Hitchcock masterfully keeps the tension high. The audience can't help but feeling anxious that they might have been wrong, a critical element of suspense. <br/><br/>
Hitchcock creates suspense with the plot, but he really raises tensions through his camera work. The brilliance of creating Jeff as a character in a wheelchair, excuses the anchoring of the camera throughout the movie. (In any other circumstance, the anchored camera would have made for a dull viewing experience). Instead, Hitchcock takes advantage refusing to zoom in or give us a better angle of what Mr. Thorwald is doing. So much of the movie's suspense is caused by the audience craning their necks to see what is going on in Mr. Thorwald's apartment. Hitchcock physically makes the audience lean forward and squint, just like Jeff. He even refuses to give away what Mr. Thorwald is saying, covering it up by street noise. Without even noticing it, the audience can't help but join the trio in trying to solve the mystery. This is the brilliance of Hitchcock's anchored camera.<br/><br/>Another masterful use of the camera is, strangely, when it is pointed away from the action. For example, when Lisa is caught by Mr. Thorwald after having snooped around his apartment, Hitchcock chooses to point the camera on Jeff and Stella's faces instead of the active conflict between Lisa and Mr. Thorwald. He refuses to let us see what's happening. We instead see the terrified looks on Jeff and Lisa's faces, and our minds begin to race as we try to imagine the horror they are looking at. Hitchcock defined suspense as the opposite of shock. Shock is caused by a sudden surprise, whereas suspense is created within the audience's own minds. It is our imagination of all the horrible possibilities that makes this technique so suspenseful. <br/><br/>Rear Window is a model example of how to best create suspense. Hitchcock's insertion of doubt into the plot, use of camera positioning make this movie a classic."
"bpf-38524","9","0","0","24 September 2018"," Rear Window
","In Alfred Hitchcock's film Rear Window, he masterly tells a story quite unusual from the rest. Mr. Hitchcock dives into the realm of observation as he portrays L.B Jefferies, a wheelchair bound photographer bored out of his mind. Jefferies, trapped in his tiny apartment, casts his view towards the outside courtyard to gaze at his neighbors. As Jefferies peers into what is best left unseen, he catches onto the coattails of what seems to be a murder. Jefferies, along with his fiancée, watch and unravel the mystery that unfolds in Jefferies' backyard.
Alfred Hitchcock is crowned to be the master of suspense and carries his title into this film. Hitchcock employs the viewers to fixate on actions done by characters to build suspense through out the film. One suspenseful scene highlighted in the film is when Mr. Thorwald catches the sight of Jefferies spying on him through the window. As Mr. Thorwald makes his way over to Jefferies, Hitchcock builds suspense by what is left unseen. The scene grows more and more intense as the deafening sounds of Throvald's foot falls approach Jefferies' door. Jefferies' actions are also used to build the suspense of the film. Jefferies answers a call from Doyle in a hurried whisper, detailing the event of what transpired that night. Another call comes in later in which Jeff answers in a hurry, believing its's Doyle. Only after the phone call cuts off after a few words from Jeff does the viewer guess at who the caller truly was. By using the reader to use their mind to guess at the true caller, Hitchcock deepens the interest of the viewer and more so the suspense. Later the suspense builds as the view watches Jefferies scramble around to prepare for the inevitable entry of Thorwald. Whether it is the actions of others left unseen or the actions that the viewer sees, both of these are employed by Hitchcock to increase the suspense of the movie.
Another device that Hitchcock uses is foreshadowing, primarily in the scenes with Stella, Jeff's nurse that takes care of him on occasion. While Jeff first exposes his interest in viewing the courtyard and spying on people, Stella comments that the punishment for a peeping tom is six months in the workhouse. Later she continues to detail that she has a nose for trouble. This trouble is what Hitchcock wants to focus on. The trouble that will continue to develop in the second act, the complication, will form all from the observations that Jeff will make in the coming days. When Jeff starts ""seeing things (he) shouldn't see"", he will entangle himself into the trouble brewing underneath the surface in these apartments.
Hitchcock holds a deep respect for the camera and how it can be used to tell a story. Hitchcock, in multiple scenes across the film, uses Jeff's camera or action of leaning in to zoom into certain areas. The zooming in of a camera is used to place a greater emphasis on the actions seen through those lenses. The scene that comes to mind is during Jeff's diner with Lisa. As she wanders into the kitchen to prepare the meal, Jeff can be seen looking out the window staring at the Thorwalds. Jeff is slowly gripped by the situation and hopes to learn more by leaning in which in turn zooms in the whole view of the camera. As Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald argue, Jeff desperately tries to hear more but ultimately fails, leaving the conversation left up to the viewer to piece together. Hitchcock wishes to convey to the viewer that this scene is important through the leaning and zooming in. Other important scenes also revolve around the zooming in aspect employed by Hitchcock and are highlighted due to this. 
Although Hitchcock doesn't have Jeff go into much detail on the morality of watching people, he uses other means to convey his feelings to the viewer. Hitchcock has shadows to emphasize this point. Whenever Jeff fears of being spotted, he doesn't stay by the window in the light where he can own up to his crime, instead he retreats into the darkness of the shadows behind him. The shadows casually fall down onto Jeff's face which symbolizes the darker theme of what he is doing. 
The last area that Hitchcock looks into is the sense of being an observer. Throughout the film, Jeff is trapped in his wheelchair with nowhere to go. He looks down on his neighbors and spies into their lives. However, Hitchcock uses much more to develop Jeff as an observer. During moments of action and suspense, Jeff is sometimes trapped in hesitation and much like the viewer, fail to act. As Lisa explores the apartment and Thorwald approaches, both the viewer and Jeff can do little more than hope that everything will turn out ok. It was only after a little delay that Jeff realizes that he remembers that he is also an active character that can do something to prevent a tragedy. It is in this moment that he escapes his illusion of only being an observer and becomes a player who calls the police. Hitchcock uses Jeff's identity as an observer to develop a stronger sense of connection between the viewers and Jeff, all in the name of allowing the viewers to understand and become more invested in the story. It isn't only until the end of the story that Jeff is thrust into an active role to defend himself from Thorwald's attacks."

","In the Rear Window directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the story take place in a small but at the same time a large community. In the movie, Alfred Hitchcock is discussing the topic of voyeurism, depicting the change of main characters' mindset, and detective element that deals with a murder case through the point of view of a broken leg person, Jefferies. As the nature of human, people are always curious about what is behind the curtain even though it does not do any good to them. Here, Hitchcock uses Jefferies as the perfect person to peep through windows of his neighbors. Jefferies broke his leg for 7 weeks already, and during this period of time, he keeps peeps out of his window and looks at what is his neighbors doing. This is totally legit since they did not close their windows and Jefferies don't have anything else to do besides this.
 In the exposition, Hitchcock starts with the use of an objective viewpoint to bring audiences into the setting. He quickly panning and tilting around the community so that the audiences can have a better picture of the neighborhood and Jefferies's neighbors. At this point, the audiences might be confused about why are there so many foci on this particular area. Hitchcock explains it well by emphasizing the size and closeness of Jefferies's cast. Within one minute, Hitchcock is able to use the focus of destroyed items and photographs hang on the wall to answer how did Jefferies break his leg. Lastly, before there is any dialogue happening, he gives another focus on stacks of magazines on the table with a woman as cover, labeling ""Paris Fashion"" at the bottom left corner. Based on previous information, the audience know that this woman has nothing to do with Jefferies's career, so why would he have so many magazines about her? It can only be either Jefferies has a strong possession to her or they have a special relationship. This creates a suspension for the audiences that they want to know what's going on with him and what is that woman's role in the play.
 During the phone call, the audiences know that Jefferies has been sitting in a wheelchair for 7 weeks and yet he still need to endure another week before he can take off his cast. While Jefferies is speaking, Hitchcock changes from an objective view to subjective view. First a scene of Jefferies looking outside of the window, and then the audiences join his view. This same step is repeated multiple time by Hitchcock later on in the movie. Through this, the audiences can follow what's going on in the neighborhood and put themselves in Jefferies' spot as a peeper. Especially when Jefferies is peeping through Thorwald's family for the first time in the film, the audiences can clearly see the difference after the cuts between objective and subjective view. That as Jefferies stretches his neck for a better view, the next subjective view of the Thorwald family will appear larger for the audiences. This technique makes the audiences feel like they are involved in the film, that they are the Jefferies.
 Later on, as the complication starts to emerge, the audiences will feel a stronger relationship with Jefferies. That even though Detective Thomas disagree with Jefferies's point of view on the murder and back it up with valid reasons and evidence, the audiences would still stay at Jefferies's side because they have been peeping through the window with him the whole time. The other conflict in the complication stage is when Stelle, Jefferies's nurse, shows up. During their conversation, Jefferies tell the audiences that he is not a suitable husband for Lisa because she is too perfect for him. Here Hitchcock is able to connect back to the woman on the magazines, now the audiences know she is Lisa. Which Lisa is standing by Jefferies's side because she also saw the scene with him. But this didn't remove the suspension from the audiences' hearts. In fact, this actually builds up more suspension since they want to know more about the lovers, and how would they work together to prove that Detective Thomas is wrong.
 Finally, in the climax, all these issues are resolved. Through the dialogue between Jefferies, Lisa, and Stella at 1:27:34, Hitchcock finally finishes developing Jefferies and Lisa's character. Their internal issues are solved when Lisa is willing to put herself in a dangerous situation, which is what Jefferies don't think she will do. Therefore, Jefferies changed his view towards Lisa. That he thinks Lisa is not some perfect human-being he can't touch, but rather a perfect wife for him. This shift of feeling closes the gap in between their hearts. Which after the tense and irritative scene of hide and seek, they finally stay together. All the other neighbors go on the good track, makes the audiences enter the state of denouement, and think everything is good, life is wonderful."
"jonnyrleonard","10","0","0","24 September 2018"," Rear Window Review
","Rear Window is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and stars James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, and Grace Kelly. It follows L. B. Jeffries, a daredevil photographer (Stewart) with a broken leg who, confined to his apartment, passes the time by spying on his neighbors through the window. This grows to an obsession when he starts to think he may have discovered a little neighborhood murder. Stewart shines as Jeffries, providing insight into his thoughts and feelings with each and every reaction shot (of which there are dozens). The happenings outside the window are shown exclusively from Jeffries's point of view, both visually and audibly, and sometimes relies on his reaction to provide insight for the audience. The apartment-courtyard in which the majority of the action takes place serves to separate Jeffries from his surroundings by quite some distance. It is impressive, therefore, that the viewer is never confused about any of the essentially silent scenes that play out in the tiny windows opposite. In fact, it's almost impossible to not be pulled into each little drama that we see play out across the way, making Jeffries a surrogate for the audience's own particular brand of voyeurism. After all, what is a screen, if not a window into another life? And it is here that Stewarts co-stars come in, effectively pulling his and the audience's attention back inward. Ritter plays Jeffries's nurse, Stella, who provides him with a few pieces of sage wisdom. For example, ""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change."" Although perhaps a bit on the nose, this line provides insight into what ties the film's many sometimes disparate small storylines together. Rear Window is ultimately about voyeurism as a vehicle for introspection. As earlier stated, Hitchcock uses Jeffries's reaction shots to help the audience interpret what he sees, but most of the time the reverse is just as true. Jeffries's interest is held by an attractive bachelorette and her suitors, a brokenhearted woman having dinner by herself, a newlywed couple, and another couple that does nothing but argue. We soon learn why these hold his attention: he is grappling with thoughts of his own potential marriage. His girlfriend, Lisa (Kelly) wants to tie the knot, but Jeffries is unconvinced that she could be happy while he is constantly travelling to dangerous places for his job. Jeffries's internal conflict supersedes all else in this film, with even the murder mystery sometimes feeling like a side storyline, a way for Lisa to prove herself to Jeffries. It's all just a way to tell Jeffries's internal story. At least, it is until the outside world finally comes crashing in, a full hour and 45 minutes into the runtime. Hitchcock is a master of suspense, and his skills are on full display here, ratcheting up the tension throughout the second act. It all builds to the unforgettable moment when a murderer stands silhouetted in Jeffries's doorway. Up until this moment, all of the action has occurred at a distance, with Jeffries nothing more than a spectator. For the first time he is unprotected by even a pane of glass, and the effect is substantial. By stretching the buildup to moments like this for as long as possible, Hitchcock keeps the audience constantly on the edge of their seats for almost the entire runtime. Ultimately, Hitchcock assembles all these parts, the love story, the murder mystery, and the artistic exercise of filming most of the movie from a distance, and combines them together with a remarkable cohesion thanks to the thematic through line of marriage and Stewart's excellent performance."

","Rear Window is the story of a photographer named Jeff who is recovering from a broken leg and is grounded in his apartment until he is healed and can return to the field. Jeff is cared for by a nurse named Stella who aids Jeff is his recovery while also encouraging him to marry his girlfriend Lisa. Jeff is extremely reluctant to the idea as he describes that the two of them may not be compatible. The core of film revolves around his relationship conflicts with Lisa and eventually a suspected murder that took place in a neighboring apartment. The plot of the film is entirely driven from Jeff's immobile condition. The film's title is essential to the central cinematic theme of the film. That is, we watch an entire story unfold through a single scene of a rear window. In doing so, we see a carefully crafted story unfold just as Jeff does. The exposition of the film is overall quite limited. But it provides all of the elements needed to garner an audiences attention and curiosity. With consistent foreshadowing of trouble to come, the film invites the audience to join Jeff and look through his eyes. Rear Window is a masterwork display of information obfuscation and does so through a lens of voyeurism. Story telling in this nature is interesting because from a literary perspective it is the opposite of dramatic irony. Where dramatic irony is employed stories take on a certain sense of suspense where wonder what will happen to characters based on information we know but they do not. In Rear Window's case, the use of dramatic irony is entirely null and the result is suspense that imitates life. This version of suspense is far more real seeming because it is based off of information that is known and unknown. Much of story telling in film is done through the simple structure of an audience watching a story. Rear Window differs from this model going a level deeper. As an audience, we watch characters who view a story unfold. This distinction is important for the theme of voyeurism and for the layers of abstraction that are done through Jeff's apartment point of view. The information that we are given as audience members is given out when we are given point of view shots as if they were from Jeff's own eyes. The smooth camera movement from one apartment to the next throughout the film gives glimpses into the lives of his neighbors and gives us limited perspective on the happenings around him. This makes us speculate and draw our own conclusions in addition to the ones our characters creates. Rear Window is superb in its ability to simultaneously tell a story of suspected murder through what Jeff sees as well as intertwining the conflicts that he is facing is his relationship with Lisa. Rather than having a compartmentalized and divided story, the murder case acts as a cinematic element to push his relationship forward. Throughout the case Jeff sees Lisa differently and find a new appreciation for her. As mentioned earlier, the film uses point of view shots of Jeff's neighbors to further the murder plot and build suspense to the film. The characters that are found in the neighboring apartments also act to further his relationship with Lisa. Jeff often views scenes which include the likes of a newlywed couple and a lonely woman who drinks her sorrows away. Ultimately, it's shots of this nature that tell of an internal conflict within Jeff in which he is deciphering what is important to him and which life he would rather end up in."
"jw-26611","10","0","0","23 September 2018"," A tad bit of analysis
","Although Rear Window is a relatively old film, I can see why it is one of the classics. In this film, L.B Jefferies is a photographer who is stuck in his room because of a leg injury. His only method of entertainment is to look out through his rear view window where he is able to peek into the lives of his neighbors. This simplistic setup of the story, however, doesn't dilute from the actual content of the story at all with elements of romance, mystery, and abundant amounts of suspense. Through his conversations with his caretaker Stella, his wife Lisa, and through his external action, we're able to slowly characterize and figure out what kind of person Jefferies is and discover the main conflicts of this film. We realize his dissatisfaction with Lisa and how he believes he is unable to decide whether or not to marry her. We also figure out the external conflict, which is revealed when he spent an entire night peering at Thorwald, concluded that he murdered his wife, and then almost obsessively trying to get his detective friend to go investigate. However, unlike other films, these conflicts are all resolved with Jefferies not having to move at all from his room. 
 Alfred Hitchcock, aka the Master of Suspense, lives up to his name in this film. By putting the audience in the point of view of L.B Jefferies he is able to masterfully create scenes of suspense where the user feels as restrained as the main protagonist of this story. Switching between the subjective point of view and the indirect-subjective point of view allows the audience to feel the emotions that are reflected in Jefferies' face. We can feel the anticipation and the suspense that Jefferies is feeling during a close up shot at his expression in the scene when Lisa becomes stuck in Thorwald's apartment; we realize his worthlessness and ours in the situation. We can feel the tense and almost hopeless situation as Thorwald slowly approaches towards his door and he frantically tries to find a weapon while being stuck in his wheelchair. Jefferies is kept in our attention to keep us anxious, the use of foreground framing keeps him that way even when he is moving about in the screen. When Thorwald finally appears in his room, the anticipation climaxes, as the camera depicts a low-angle shot of Thorwald, dominating over Jefferies. 
 Just like Jefferies, we are stuck behind a window, and can only view the events that are happening but unable to take action. This is shown throughout the film when Jefferies girlfriend takes a bold move and climbs into Thorwald's apartment, we feel a similar feeling to Jefferies: we felt fearful and wanted her to reconvene with us instead. However, just like Jefferies, we are not able to call out or stop her. Lisa is seen in the objective view, far away and distant from us. However, by using his camera, he is able to yet again zoom in to see what is going on and to also get closer to Lisa. Zooming in and out to view the different events that are happening in his neighborhood is a constant technique used throughout the film. Alfred Hitchcock likes to have the audience feel what the character is feeling and uses Jefferies' camera as a way to restrict our point of view but also to help us get in closer personally and to view more accurately what is happening.
Alfred Hitchcock uses of perspective also touches on a darker element of human nature: Voyeurism. Voyeurism is the act of deriving pleasure from spying on people engaging in intimate behaviors. Although it might not be sexual in nature, we do a similar activity by deriving pleasure from peeking into the lives of people in a movie theater. This is an element Hitchcock uses to entrap us into Jefferies' voyeuristic actions. We get to see many of his neighbors like ""Miss Torso"" who tends to be in revealing outfits and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" who doesn't seem to be able to get an adequate boyfriend. We as the audience shares his curiosity, which eventually becomes obsessive, as the camera pans around to each window like he's watching a movie, we get to see a glimpse of their lives after each day. Alfred Hitchcock, however, doesn't provide any narration or explanation to what is happening. We as the audience have to deduce what is happening without any dialogue but only with the details that are given. This way of storytelling is part of the film's genius. It allows us to provide our own interpretations and secretly allows us to touch on our own voyeuristic tendencies. 
Rear Window unifies all these elements to become truly a classic and masterpiece. Alfred Hitchcock not only used a wide variety of film techniques but capitalized on them to capture the audience's attention and skillfully create scenes filled with suspense."

","In the film Rear Window, main character Mr. Jeff has a broken leg with a cast on it, and he is watching all of his neighbors through the window of his tiny apartment. Even though the main character does not move out of his living place, the film is not boring at all because Jeff knows what is happening around him; what makes the beginning so interesting and attractive to me as an audience is I am able to experience what Mr. Jeff is watching. The window bridges the gap between character and audiences. In the beginning, there are many emotions on Jeff's face while he is watching the woman dancing, the man who is playing the piano, Mr. Thorwald and his wife, and etc. The camera shot goes back and forward between Jeff's face and the outside world. We can see how Jeff responses to each of the scenes through the moving camera. Director uses this technique to interact with audiences in order capture people's attentions. 
The background music is a significant factor that makes Rear Window a great film. The rhythm rises as the story rises to its climax. When the story starts, audience is focusing on what is going outside the window, the music brings nothing to audiences in the beginning. When the story keeps developing to its climax where Mr. Thorwald try to kill Jeff, cadence of the music goes rapidly fast, and it brings intension to audiences, it makes people nervous and curious about what is going to happen to Jeff. The music in this film really brings up the story together, and it also brings up audience's attention to plot developments through out. 
There is one thing stands out in the film which is the color combination in each scene. First of all, while Jeff is watching multiple actions happening in the neighbor, there are different colors in the frame. People dress up differently, and the bright colors correspond to the smile on Jeff's face because he is having fun with people's different lives. In addition, when Lisa Fremont comes to Jeff's apartment, she always dress up nicely; the color of her dress brings out the mood for their little date night and romantic time. Moreover, when Mr. Thorwald comes into Jeff's room, everything become so dark because there is no light. The scene creates scariness, and my heart rate increased as an audience because I was so nervous, I don't know what will happen but I want to know what will happen next. Color is an important factor in Rear Window, which makes it a successful film. 
After Mr. Jeff realizes something is wrong with Mrs. Thorwald, he uses the camera with a long lens in order to figure what is going on in Mr. Thorwald's apartment. Later on, he wants to get a more clear view to ensure his assumption that Mrs. Thorwald is gone; he takes out a telescope. And then, he is very sure about Mr. Thorwald has murdered his wife. The changing of Jeff's equipment corresponds to the plot developments too. Every little details in this film tie up together and leads to climax of the story. In addition, symbolism also plays out in Rear Window by the director. The dog died in the yard right after Jeff figured out Mrs. Thorwald has gone for so long. The dog symbolizes death, Jeff is right about that Mr. Thorwald had killed his wife, and he killed the dog too because the dog saw Mr. Thorwald is hiding something in his apartment. It also shows brutality of Mr. Thorwald."

","Rear Window is a great example of how to tell a visual story in an unconventional form. This film is one of the first, if not the first film to be created in a blatantly voyeuristic style. What makes Rear Window such a renowned classic is not what the story is, but how the story is told. <br/><br/>Most of the characters that we're introduced to are seen throughout the entire film and are mostly seen but not heard. They each add to the story in subtle ways and sometimes even relate to the thoughts and feelings of the main character Jefferies. Since the film is viewed mostly through his perspective, these thoughts and feelings are beamed into the viewer as well. The audience pieces the ongoing mystery together along with Jefferies. This gives the viewer an active role in the film. They aren't there just to consume, they're meant to feel like an active participant in solving the mystery presented. We're immobile in Jefferies' studio apartment, only able to see events unfold from the inside of his window. This perspective is never broken. Even though the the setting isn't physically dynamic, viewers get a sense of a larger and more vibrant environment by viewing the lives of the characters through their own apartment windows. <br/><br/>Everything feels incredibly deliberate, which is characteristic of a Hitchcock film. Every scene and every frame serves a purpose. This is definitely a film that benefits from multiple viewings. By picking up on small subtleties that arise from the secondary characters, you'll begin to notice how it all ties together.<br/><br/>The acting still holds up well in 2018. It doesn't feel very dated. The actors all do a great job and are generally convincing. James Stewart in particular does a stellar job in delivering facial expressions that fit the situation at hand. His acting really shines through in the more suspenseful parts of the film, where the terror on his face instills total dread for anyone who watches.<br/><br/>Hitchcock of course is known to be adept at suspense. Rear Window in particular has a few key scenes that keep you at the edge of your seat. These sequences are agonizingly drawn out, but not so much that they lose their effect. These scenes are paced very professionally and they leave much to the imagination. The scene just prior to the end of the film requires that the viewer suspends their disbelief to a significant amount which for some could ruin the moment. However, everything else about this scene is a great example of how to build suspense properly without overdoing it.<br/><br/>The last aspect of this film that sets it apart from others is how there are essentially two stories being told. Of course, there's the murder mystery aspect of this film and all the standard elements that go with it. The main character gets curious and starts investigating and eventually the perpetrator is exposed and brought to justice. However, this film could also be viewed as a romance. The relationship between Jefferies and Lisa is just as important In this film as the investigating that they take part in. The relationship between the two at the beginning of the film seems strained and awkward and Jefferies is convinced that they aren't fully compatible because of their differing lifestyles. As the film progresses and Lisa takes an interest in helping Jeff investigate the murder, they grow closer as a result. This aspect of the story is never neglected as Lisa does play a major role in the murder investigation as well. Her role becomes more active as the film gets closer to its end.<br/><br/>It's no mystery why Rear Window has the following that it does. Like other Hitchcock films, this one showcases an experimental approach to storytelling in a similar vein as Rope. It's creative risks like these that keep film fresh and diverse. Modern aspiring film-makers could learn a lot from Hitchcock's approach to film-making with its intricate design and clever use of visual elements. <br/><br/>9/10"

","Elijah 8/20/18 
 Rear Window Review<br/><br/>If there is one director whose work will remain timeless and watchable in generations to come, it is Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. From the chilling story about a lowly man who's a little too obsessed with his mom (Psycho), to the story of a man struggling with his fear of heights (Vertigo), Mr. Hitchcock is a director that has earned respect and recognition from critics and fans all the way up until he sadly passed in 1980. But whenever I think about his films, there is always one that immediately comes to mind, Rear Window. If you haven't seen the film, then I recommend you to stop reading now, as I'm going to spoil everything that happens, but I URGE you to watch it if you haven't. With all that being said, let's get on with the review.
The first thing you'll notice when the movie starts is how incredible the set design is. The panning camera shot showing all the people in this tiny apartment complex, from the rich musician, to the lonely women on the bottom floor, it really sets the tone of ""coziness"". We are then introduced to the film's main character, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, and we see that he's injured and so he's stuck in his apartment to spy on the neighbors, because this is 1954 and there wasn't really much to do back then. 
Now the basic story is that Jeff is injured and bored so he's spying on neighbors and eventually he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors, named Lars Thorwald, has murdered his wife. On the outset that sounds like every other thriller out there, but what makes Rear Window different is two specific things. 
First is that we never actually see any murder happen or even know if something did happen and it seems like the whole movie every character is telling him that nothing is wrong and that he's just bored or overly suspicious. We also realize very early on that Jeff is a pretty cynical person. We hear the conversation between him and his nurse where he says he doesn't want to marry his girlfriend Lisa Fremont, because she's too sophisticated or rich for him. The entire movie you are convinced that Thorwald didn't murder his wife and that Jeff is just bored and skeptical. That's why the eventual reveal that Thorwald did murder his wife is actually surprising! Because you watch the whole movie expecting the twist to be that he didn't murder his wife and Jeff is just way too suspicious and needs more sleep. But the twist is there is no twist! Which is actually genius because it preys on the fact that you usually expect a film like this to have a twist. 
The second thing that separates this film from other thriller films, is that the entire film takes place in his apartment. No really the ENTIRE film takes place in one apartment with Jeff and there isn't a single scene that breaks this. Even when Lisa is sneaking into Thorwald's apartment later in the movie, it's still from Jeff's point of view. We hear about stuff that happens outside of the apartment, but these never shown. This gives the film a very unique vibe that I haven't seen replicated since. 
These two attributes are the reasons why it has stood the test of time and is considered a classic. I haven't even mentioned the fantastic performances, particularly by James Stewart and Grace Kelly. The music by Franz Waxman is also soothing. What I like most about the music is that it only appears during character moments or scenes between Lisa and Jeff talking. There is no music whenever something intense or suspenseful is happening, which creates are very stressful atmosphere because it feels real. 
In the end, Rear Window is one of those rare movies where it truly feels unique even over 50 years later. It's a movie that has and will be appreciated and enjoyed for years to come.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Even though the whole movie takes places in an apartment, it is fluent and makes you curious about what's going to happen next.The script is written cleverly and as i watched i couldnt see any holes in it.<br/><br/>The movie is about stalking and being curious about other human lives.This is an instinct that we all have, we compare ourselves with others and we learn about life as we observe people around us.Hitchcock also wanted to show types of relationships between men and women through the neighbors we see in the movie.<br/><br/>For the 1950s, Rear Window is an amazing movie; well written, good acting and sets a foundation to all the movies we've seen so far about spying.
Most of the thriller horror movies are based on Hitchcock's movies.The reason he is considered one of the best directors in the history is that he accomplished the first of many films and inspired others that came after him.Rear Window is a true example for this.<br/><br/>(Still feeling bad about the poor dog..WHY)"

","Rear Window
From an artistic perspective, I thought that this movie was very well done. The colors were vibrant but also showed the dullness that living in an urban environment can have. I also enjoyed the costumes and makeup of all the actors. I found that it reflected the time period well and accurately represented what a middle class person would dress and look like. I also enjoyed the sounds that were incorporated into the film. Throughout the film, birds could be heard or dogs barking and this gave a very open feel to the otherwise closed in feeling of being in a walled in apartment complex. Another very good aspect of the film was the quality of the actors. Throughout the movie, the actors do a very good job of ""show don't tell."" What I mean by this is that many scenes in the movie do not need the actors telling each other how they feel and it can be read on their faces. An example of this is when Grace comes to the realization that LB's theory that Lars killed his wife may have some truth behind it. You can see the change of expression on her face and without her even saying anything, the audience knows what she is thinking. The film had a very slow and relaxing feel at the beginning which I found interesting because it would be the opposite of what you might feel living in a downtown apartment. At the beginning of the film, the camera pans from apartment to apartment showing the daily lives of the people around LB. This gives us the feeling that we are actually looking through LB's eyes and feeling what he feels. I had a slight sense of loneliness when watching this because I felt that all of this was going on around me but I still felt distant and not a part of it all. I believe this is what Hitchcock was intending when filming this because it allows us to relate more to LB. During this scene, and in many other parts of the movie, it is as if LB is actually in a movie theater watching all of this unfold in front of him. In many scenes, such as the one where Grace breaks into Lars' house, LB must sit back helpless and watch it all take place as with the audience in the theater or the viewers at home. I found this very unique in that I have never experienced this perspective with any other movie I had seen. One thing about the film that can be seen as both a positive and a negative is the fact that there is a very long buildup from the beginning of the film to the climax. Although this can be seen as very important aspect of the story, I found it kind of boring at times and a little slow. There were times that I found myself spacing out and losing focus in the film. While I believe that a large portion of the film was slow, the last half hour of the movie had me on the edge of my seat. When Grace broke into the apartment and when Lars confronted LB were very well done. I felt the suspense that LB felt because we both felt that we were helpless and trapped in our seats."

","Rear Window was a wonderful movie that more than fits into Hitchcock's portfolio of masterpieces.<br/><br/>Personally I have trouble categorizing this movie into a single genre as it is so diverse. With this said this movie certainly used certain elements from multiple genres. One of these genres that the film certainly borrowed from was film noir. One of the biggest conflicts of the film was whether or not Thorwald killed his wife. Even I as a viewer was unsure if this was the case while I was watching it. Although Rear Window's setting might've been too trusting and almost lush for it to be considered hard boiled, this movie certainly was a crime drama with certain romantic elements. Additionally this movie has many elements of a suspense film. I know personally I was sitting on the edge of my seat while Lisa was going into Thorwald's apartment, as well as when Thorwald had entered Jeff's. However I personally don't believe there was enough suspense throughout the entire movie for it to be outright considered a full-out thriller movie.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock claimed to be a formalist director at heart and that really showed in the film. The movie used continuity editing so that it was easy for the viewer to sympathize with the protagonist, where as if he used non-continuity here the viewer might get confused and might emotionally disconnect from the protagonist. Additionally at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie the pacing of the cuts is very slow to show that there is very little tension. At the climax of the film the pacing is much faster to express a new sense of urgency and tension.<br/><br/>
The shots used in the film and the camera techniques were unlike many other movies. This first scene in this film was a long panning shot of Jeff's backyard showing off a unique assortment of happy individuals from both in and outside their apartments. I think this opening shot really impressed me because this scene not only conveyed who many of the individual characters and families in this neighborhood were, but it also did a really good job of making this neighborhood seem especially open and trusting. One of the major plot points of this movie is that the protagonist, Jeff, is looking at his neighbors through their apartment windows. To compliment this most of the shots in the film, were framed by Jeff's window sill. Like I said before the viewer throughout the film felt like they were watching from Jeff's point of view, where they could see what was happening around them but they were stuck in their seats and unable to affect anything. Hitchcock was able to build this sympathy also by showing an event happening outside of the window and then showing a close up on one of the protagonists so that they know how to feel about these events.<br/><br/>This film also focused in on the certain themes and successfully raised a lot of questions about them throughout it. One of the themes that was brought up was community. At the beginning of the movie, the neighborhood that Jeff lived in was portrayed as being, perhaps a bit more friendly than most but overall unextraordinary. You felt like if you knew any one of those neighbors you'd be friends with them. But later in the film, obviously this sense of community is betrayed as one of the neighbors finds their dog strangled to death. Hitchcock often leaves his audience afraid of things people have come to trust in his films like in his other classic, the birds. Additionally this movie seems to revolve around Voyeurism which in this case is the pleasure one gets from watching people who don't know that they are being watched. This movie shows both positive and negative outcomes from Jeff's ""peeping"" so the question is left up in the air. However some viewers got a sense that the voyeurism Hitchcock was referring to wasn't staring at unsuspecting people through a window, but rather staring at characters through a movie.<br/><br/>All in all I was absolutely in love with the cinematography and am looking forward to watching the rest of Hitchcock's films."

","The 1954 film Rear Window, encompasses the story of L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, played by James Stewart, a wheelchair-bound photographer who is injured after a racetrack accident. In his post-recovery, Jeff is confined to his apartment, leading him to watch his neighbors through his ""rear window."" As a result, Jeff finds alarming discoveries about his neighbors, revealing more about the ""ordinary"" town. <br/><br/>The film begins with the audience's introduction to Jeff, the protagonist of the movie. After an accident, Jeff is bound to a wheelchair and begins to watch his neighbors through his courtyard apartment. As the story progresses, the audience is introduced to various characters of town. Jeff starts to memorize the patterns of each of his neighbors, understanding their day-to-day life and responsibilities. In addition, the audience is introduced to Stella, Jeff's nurse, and Lisa, Jeff's ""fiancé."" The film shifts after Jeff makes a shocking discovery about the Thorwalds, a couple who lives directly across from Jeff. After previously observing the Thorwalds' complicated relationship with each other, Jeff notices Mrs. Thorwald's disappearance. As Mr. Thorwald becomes increasingly more mysterious and shady, Jeff recruits help from Doyle, a police officer as well as Stella and Lisa. The story progresses, and Jeff develops his theory on Mrs. Thorwald's murder and seeks evidence to affirm his guilt. At the end of the film, Mr. Thorwald's guilt is confirmed when he confronts Jeff, ultimately leading to a fight. As a result, Mr. Thorwald is arrested and faces the repercussions of his actions. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, Hitchcock's specific presentation of characters and context adds to the genre of suspense. The audience's ability to grasp the complexity of each character without any dialogue or direct involvement with the main character plays a significant role in establishing suspense. Mr. Thorwald's anonymity to the audience enhances the level of suspense and mystery, as Jeff tries to confirm Mr. Thorwald's guilt in his wife's murder. In addition, I noticed the use of music and time in the film. In more intense scenes, Hitchcock incorporates a darker aesthetic and eerie music, dramatizing the feelings of suspense. This is evident in Director Hitchcock's decisions to have most of the suspenseful moments occur at night. Some of these scenes included Lisa's search of Mr. Thorwald's apartment, the dog's murder, and the confrontation between Mr. Thorwald and Jeff that occurred at the end of the film. In addition, I found it interesting that the entirety of the film took place in Jeff's apartment and was still able to omit a dynamic, thrilling feeling as the audience watches the film. In some cases, filming in one location can negate natural progression and make a movie feel slow. <br/><br/>Apart from the shocking plot revelations and the suspenseful scenes, Hitchcock's incorporation of unique camera perspectives and angles demonstrates a unique way to translate film. The utilization of the ""three-part POV"" and intense zoom-ins, allow Hitchcock to reinvent film in a new, meaningful way. One example of this is Hitchcock's camera angle after Lisa starts to believe Jeff's accusations. The camera zooms in from a lower angle, increasingly getting higher as it zooms closer to Lisa's frightened facial expression. In contrast, this is evident in Hitchcock's decision to incorporate a broader camera angle during intense moments. While Lisa is attempting to collect evidence from Mr. Thorwald's apartment, ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" attempts suicide simultaneously. In this shot, Hitchcock intensifies the thrilling emotion by closing the blinds in Miss Lonelyhearts' apartment, giving the audience feelings of uncertainty about her fate; all occurring while Lisa is searching Mr. Thorwald's apartment. Since there are several things transpiring, Hitchcock uses a broader camera angle in displaying the content of this scene."

","Doyle! I think my neighbor across the courtyard murder his wife! What evidence do I have? I can answer that for Jefferies - a dead dog and a purse. 
When it comes to being the best amatuer detective in the block, Jeffries is the first thing that comes to mind, if you need someone to watch your neighbor day in and day out, he is your guy. 
Jeff (James Stewart) also known as L.B. Jefferies. An amazing photographer turned sleuth when he breaks his leg getting into the middle of a racetrack to take a picture. Stuck in a full leg cast and bound to a wheelchair for several weeks, Jeff finds many ways to entertain himself, like scratching itches on his leg, taking pictures of others while they are unaware, and also watching those same people. He watches his neighbors argue, a pianist play his music, a dancer dance in her underwear, a newlywed couple moving in, and a husband taking care of his bedridden wife. He gets the occasional visit from his nurse/caretaker Stella (Thelma Ritter) a sassy older woman who is a hard worker and tries to convince Jefferies that watching his neighbors is pretty creepy, but he still continues to do so. Stella also talks to Jeff about his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) a fashionista socialite, who Stella believes is just the right girl for Jeff and is very much in love with him and that Jeff should marry her. However, Jeff believes he has too much of a rough and tough lifestyle, where you can only have one suitcase, and that's not the life he would want to give Lisa. Sorry to break it to you Jefferies, but Lisa isn't the only one who can change themself *cough Jefferies cough*. Moving on in the movie, we see Jefferies neighbor, Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr) across the way acting somewhat somewhat suspicious one night, and Jefferies decides to make Thorwald his next person to peep on, after the girl who dances in her underwear everyday. Jefferies then uses his old timey war connections to get his friend Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) to help him with this case, even though Doyle does not see much of a case, he still entertains Jefferies by checking out Mr. Thorwald and his suspicious behavior, while our peeping tom continues to peep his eyes away. After seeing other suspicious behavior from Mr. Thorwald like wrapping up large knives, packing up all of his wife's belongings, wrapping up his mattress, and the straw that broke the camel's back (or should we say Jefferies leg) a dead dog near Mr. Thorwald's garden. After noticing this Jefferies decides to send his small army of Lisa and Stella to harass Mr.Thorwald and snoop around to find some hard and tangible evidence. During this time Lisa sees an opportunity to sneak into Mr. Thorwald's home to grab some more hard evidence, and she does it alone because she's a risk taker. In the end, Lisa almost gets assaulted, gets arrested, but gets out of jail in the end. Mr. Thorwald realizes that Jefferies has been watching him the whole time, and decides to give Jefferies what he deserves, after all he is a peeping tom. In the end Mr. Thorwald confesses to murdering his wife and everyone lives happily ever after. 
This movie is filled a lot of suspense but not a lot of twists and turns. This movie didn't really wow me, it was good, but not the best movie I have ever seen. When I hear the name Alfred Hitchcock I expect a lot and I was kind of disappointed. This movie came of to me as a peeping tom who gets caught up in something bigger than him, but it alls works out in his favor. His girlfriend has to change herself (unknowingly) so that in the end he realizes she's the one and he's ready to settle down. Maybe it's because I'm from a different generation, but this movie did not really have me on the edge of my seat, it had me laughing. All the cliches of movies from that era shined through, and I think Hitchcock could have done better."
"drystyx","3","9","36","10 March 2007"," Even Hitchcock pulls some boners
","Hitchcock is obviously one of the best directors, if not the best, of all time, and Stewart is one of the greatest actors. However, they've made over a hundred films between them, and there are a couple of clunkers. This is one. The suspense exists, and mystery, so we are told. However, it is not possible to know this first hand, because no creature on Earth can sit through the movie. This is because it has the worst and most annoying sound effects ever in any movie. Hitchcok certainly wanted the audience to twist and hate the noise, but there is considerable overkill here. A human's nerves can't take this horrible noise and concentrate on what is going on. Even if you sit through it, you don't know what is going on, because you are in way too much pain. Some people insist they can watch it, but it isn't possible without drugs. I wonder what drugs they are taking? A normal person would need two and a half strong Valiums to even begin to sit through this. Not watchable."

","Rear Window (1954) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's smart and sexy thriller remains one of the greatest of the genre. James Stewart plays a man confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg who spends all day and night spying on his neighbors. The biggest thing going in his life is his nervousness of his relationship with a rich woman (Grace Kelly) but that's about to change when he thinks one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Here's another film that probably would have been a disaster had anyone else in the world directed but Hitchcock brings his normal brilliance to the film making it one of the greatest ever made. This film has countless layers so it's impossible to catch everything on one viewing, which is why I think the film gets even better with each new viewing. The way Hitchcock has Stewart spy on all the neighbors is something brilliant and we get to know and care for each of them, which pays off greatly towards the end of the film when we're worried about the ""lonely lady"" while forgetting to watch Kelly who has snuck into the neighbors home. I've read several reviews that says the film moves too slowly and perhaps this is true but on repeat viewings it's clear that Hitchcock is just setting a trap for the viewer, which leads to a really suspenseful ending. There's no question Stewart is a brilliant actor and while I haven't seen all of his film I might put this at the best performance of his career. Sure, he was brilliant in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life and various others but he has to do all his acting here in a wheelchair so his facial expressions, voice tones and other small items have to be used throughout the film. How deep of a character he's able to deliver is something not too many actors could do. Grace Kelly is great as well as is Thelma Ritter adds great comic support. Raymond Burr never gets mentioned but he's terrific in the film as well."
"RNMorton","10","3","8","15 February 2004"," An acquired taste
","I didn't really know much about this movie until the 90's and never made it all the way through until the last few years. Now it's a high-priority selection. Action photographer Stewart is injured and confined to the rear porch of his modest Manhattan apartment, which overlooks a courtyard and many other units. He thinks he sees a murder, or is his under-stimulated mind just imagining things? It's so good you don't even realize that the camera is (just like Jimmy) grounded on Stewart's back porch. Kelly is great as the dedicated love interest and Ritter equally so as Stewart's nurse. Stewart is about twice Kelly's age and pretty much looks it, just the same there is a certain chemistry between the two.

","Contains spoiler!! Like so many of Hitchcock's films ""Rear Window"" has many strong points and many weaknesses and is ultimately over-rated. Many of the weak points are specific plot points, so I must warn you, this review contains some spoilers. Perhaps because Hitchcock is almost single-handedly credited with creating the thriller genre, we must tip our hat to him and label the bulk of his work as not only ""classics"", but they are supposedly recognized as some of the best movies ever made. Well, I for one think we give our classic film-makers far too much credit, for the thriller genre has definitely been improved upon in the fifty years since ""Rear Window"" was first released. Many contemporary films contain real genuine 'twists'. ""Rear Window"" delivers only a plodding plot which in the end only confirms the original hypothesis, that the neighbor across the way *did* in fact kill his wife. Perhaps the twist Mr. Hitchcock was trying to pull on us was that *yes* the movie was in fact *that* unimaginative. The twist is: There is no twist! Boy, weren't you surprised!<br/><br/>The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife *was* alive, but that the neighbor *was* in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? (The neighbor was a jeweler in fact.) No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious booty and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife. This kind of unimaginative plot might have played fifty years ago, but movie-goers expect a little bit more than that now-a-days. But even then I suspect it was considered week back then, for having a good plot has always been a plus, even back to the days of Shakespeare, who churned out more suspenseful stories than Hitchcock ever dreamed of doing.<br/><br/>Now, I did mention that the movie did have quite a few strong points. The movie was quite innovative, even by today's standards. It would be hard to pull off filming a movie from just one point-of-view, out the window of an apartment building. The sound and cinematography were quite well done. And over-all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous ""Hitchcock Twists"", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes. On the subject of a rushed ending, the movie is also supposedly a character study, with a not so subtle sub-plot between the leading man, James Stewart, and his lovely leading-lady Grace Kelly. Of course no one seems to mind that this sub-plot is completely devoid of any resolution. Do they or do they not get together? Does it really matter to anyone? Apparently not because this movie is for some reason stuck in the imdb.com top 20. Apparently I *am* the only one. 6 out of 10 stars."

","I saw this film and thought little of it. I thought that most of the story was... bad. A man believes one of his neighbors committed murder. Okay, so you call the police. COMMON SENSE!!!<br/><br/>But then, what if the police don't find evidence, or don't believe you? Then FORGET ABOUT IT!!!<br/><br/>But then, what if you decide to be stupid and, despite being in a wheelchair, decide to stop him ultimately by force and your camera's flash, which surprisingly holds him at bay long enough for help to get there after, of course, you are knocked off a low balcony that you would survive the fall from. SO the killer will get caught after all. Oh yeah, if I killed, I would let the witness survive and get caught.<br/><br/>No common sense was put into this. Without it, most movies aren't very good. This is no exception, and stands as a very overrated movie."

","As often happens when one experiences something after a great deal of build up, the primary emotion one feels is disappointment.  I had read for years how Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" was a masterpiece, one of the greatest and most suspenseful films ever made.  So when I finally rented it and watched it, I came away thinking it quite overrated. The film was rather unremarkable in my estimation, despite the superb work by the cast and the undeniable craftsmanship.  It just didn't seem particularly interesting to me. The cast was great.  Jimmy Stewart (a longtime favourite for his work in ""It's A Wonderful Life"") is quite convincing as L.B. Jeffries, the photographer with a broken leg who is convinced his girlfriend is too good for him; Grace Kelly is truly luminous, and her work makes me want to see more of her movies; Thelma Ritter (from ""All About Eve"") is great as Stella, Stewart's nurse.  Raymond Burr is good as the villain of the piece, Lars Thurwald, although he never becomes a truly great villain. Despite all that I've heard of Hitchcock's skill as a director, no sequence was really suspenseful to me, although many were quite interesting."
"MovieCriticOnline","3","6","24","3 April 2019"," Totally overrated and dated
","This movie could have been a 15-min short. Went on too long in the beginning with not a lot of stuff going on. The last 15 min or so was the climax, and perhaps it broke ground for its time, but we've seen this premise a million times, likely copied from this, but I wasn't born when this came out and just saw this for the first time.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is really overrated as a filmmaker. They are too long and drawn out."
"alistair_deacon-1","Null","2","5","19 August 2011"," Maybe in the 1950s?
","I'm a big Hitchcock fan and hadn't seen Rear Window since I was a child, so I was surprised when I sat down again recently to watch it and found the movie to be quite bad. Obviously this is one of Hitchcock's most famous movies and is considered a classic, but on re-examination one wonders if aside from the novelty of the concept of the film and it's reputation if it is really a very good movie after all.<br/><br/>I won't go into the details of the plot too much, because it is unlikely you are reading reviews of this famous movie to find out what it is about. And if you are then there are hundreds of other reviews here that already give a rough outline of the plot. The core concept in Rear Window of having a story that plays out from events witnessed while looking in the neighbors' windows in a building across a courtyard or alleyway from one's own apartment is a great concept and that is really the best thing about this film. The sound and music are also quite good, especially impressive is the way we get just snippets of (often ambiguous) sound drifting in from the apartments across the way as we see what is happening inside them.<br/><br/>Anyway, aside from the novel concept and some of the nice technical aspects of the film making, what are the problems with this movie? First of all, there is not really any reason to be suspicious about the murderer. Jimmy Stewart is convinced that the man murdered his wife, but he doesn't have any reason to believe anything like that happened and neither do we the audience. And this is true well over an hour into the movie, so it is just boring. Then in the end his theory turns out to have been magically true... so what? It was still boring, and all that happened was it stopped making sense when the man turned out to have murdered his wife even though there was no evidence or reason for any suspicion whatsoever that he had done so.<br/><br/>One thing that doesn't help the movie is that Jimmy Stewart was extremely poorly cast. He is about ten years too old for the relationship with Grace Kelly to play out the way it should, and he hardly fits the bill of a globe trotting adventure photographer. I love Jimmy Stewart, but this role needed an actor who was younger and less pedestrian in personality.<br/><br/>Well, those two things pretty much ruin the movie. The plot is implausible at best and having an implausible lead actor doesn't make it any better. Perhaps in the 1950s audiences were naive enough to get in on the idea of 'suspicion' about this man who murdered his wife, but when you look at the movie today he is just a man living his life there is no reason to believe he did anything wrong at all and that ruins the suspense of the movie and makes it pretty strange to watch for the first eighty or ninety minutes. The characters don't make any sense, because you can't understand why they are buying into this idea that the guy 'over there' murdered his wife when there is literally no reason whatsoever to have any suspicion (that they know of or that we the audience know of) until the movie is already almost over. Personally, as a viewer, I could not get into a 'suspension of disbelief' for this plot and that made the viewing extremely tedious.<br/><br/>Like I said, I love Hitchcock and had considered this to be a classic movie from what I remembered when I saw it as a child, but it hasn't aged well."
"secondtake","10","2","5","30 March 2010"," A voyeuristic masterpiece of style and storytelling
","Rear Window (1954)<br/><br/>Director Alfred Hitchcock's movies have almost always cut against one of the strongest currents in American Cinema: complete verisimilitude. Even some of his masterpieces, like North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho use montage, special lighting effects, and backprojection to break out of pure believable film-making. But it's intentional. It's part of the experience of watching a movie, like watching a play, that reminds you that you are a viewer, and the movie is a separate thing, a work of art, or stretch of celluloid in a can.<br/><br/>He even presses this point in every film by inserting himself in the movie. How can you not notice the director winking, as if to say, don't forget, this is all a big game.<br/><br/>Rear Window makes intentional artifice the defining aesthetic of the entire shoot. And now wonderful it all works. Yes, we can totally accept it all, somehow. The events are unusual, but not unbelievable, and the acting is candid and remarkably nuanced with everyday expressions. Jimmy Stewart in particular is amazing as the wheelchair bound photographer with nothing to do but look at the neighbors in around the courtyard, but Thelma Ritter is also in top form, quirky but in a lovable, not distracting, way.<br/><br/>The rest, outside, is all theater. We see with uncanny perfection what is happening through all these apartment windows, and so there is a dancer and a pianist and a newlywed couple and a lonely middle aged woman and a bickering couple and another couple who sleeps on the fire escape. It's exaggerated just so, partly comic, partly trenchant (who can not love the groom carrying the bride over the threshold?), and we see it more or less through Stewart's eyes, and appreciate his reactions up close. What a great set up for a movie, and for storytelling in general. <br/><br/>And so, night and day and beautiful twilight, we learn about the neighbors and events begin to sort out and suspicions about one neighbor's activities rise. And rise higher, causing disruption among those in Stewart's apartment (including his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly). It goes from there, always a little lighthearted, but with such visual, quiet, deft handling you just sweep along happily, sometimes joyously. The echoes of camera angles, the moving in and out in space, the layering of close views and far as he looks through his camera's telephoto on and off, all make for a steady visual pace that gives a sense of control and confidence. We know we are in a deliberate movie, and that the artifice will surprise us and delight us both. And that we will come away unscathed, but enchanted.<br/><br/>There might be better made films, or more ingenious films, or movies that have deeper messages and funnier lines, or ones that move you one way or another, but there are few films this carefully flawless. You might say that about any number of Hitchcock films, but in fact those brief moments of montage or backprojection in those films are distracting to us now, coming in a movie of greater verisimilitude. In Rear Window, as in Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter the next year, the artificial style and structure is part of the movie, and we accept it and require it to remain so."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","2","5","14 May 2009"," Alfred Hitchcock wasn't called the Master of Suspense for nothing
","Alfred Hitchcock's theory about suspense was that there was no horror in the final moments of something terrible, only the ominous anticipation of it. And his impressive collection of masterpieces and the many mimickers—those successful and unsuccessful—who imitated his techniques prove that he was correct. Alfred Hitchcock was known as the Master of Suspense. ""Rear Window"" is one of the reasons why.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's frequent leading man, Academy Award-winner James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries: a cynical wheelchair-bound photographer who finds himself with yet another week of lying beside his apartment window with nothing to do but look out at his neighbors both down below and across the street. He becomes particularly interested in a salesman (Raymond Burr) who lives in the apartment building parallel to his' with a bedridden wife. And he as well as his fiancée (Grace Kelly) become particularly interested when they notice that the salesman is making odd trips at night, hiding sharp tools such as saws, and the sick wife has conveniently disappeared.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock seemed to have a fascination with the crime of murder. His most famous films which include ""Rope"" (1948), ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""Dial M for Murder"" (1954), and ""Psycho"" (1960) all relate to it in one way or another. Thus ""Rear Window"" was the quintessential vehicle for his vision of a two-hour journey of merciless suspense.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is, believe it or not, foundationally a very simple film. Most of the movie is shot from and takes place in James Stewart's apartment overlooking the neighborhood. Everything that happens occurs within a bird's-eye view of his window. Another one of Hitchcock's theory was ""less is more"" and at least in the case of this 1954 masterpiece, he was right again. Even with such a simple scenario and concept, Hitchcock does not fail. It's amazing how intense this movie becomes especially within the last hour, where Hitchcock utilized all of his horror theories, techniques, ideas, and formulas. Like he did in ""Vertigo"" (1958) four years later, Hitchcock used his leading actor James Stewart as an everyman personification so that the audiences identified with him, saw what he saw, thought what he thought, and thus we felt suspicious when he was suspicious, curious when he was curious, and scared when he was scared. And nearing the end of the film, Stewart is sweating and gripping furiously into the armrests of his chair. Guess what? So are we.<br/><br/>But on top of this, Hitchcock also installed what he tried to do with every film. He tried to put in a story and characters into his films. He always liked to show audiences a familiar setting (in this case, New York), relatable characters, and then shock us with relentless and unexpected malice. James Stewart does not merely portray the peeping tom looking out the window, but a human being with problems beyond having a cast-bound leg.<br/><br/>To be frank, Stewart's character isn't that likable of a man. He's cynical, pessimistic, inexplicably rude, sarcastic, and vindictive. And the fact that he's stuck in a wheelchair in a sweltering apartment room for six (going on seven) weeks does not help his personality any. And yet we identify with him for we do see his more tender sides without him being transformed into an emotional mope like many too-be-changed characters today seem to. He's a three-dimensional human being, not a stick figure, played magnificently by the man whose continuously considered one of the greatest actors who ever lived alongside names such as Humphrey Bogart and Laurence Olivier.<br/><br/>It is a real shame that Grace Kelly only made a few films in her short, but brilliant career, for she always seemed to end up with films of the highest caliber and gave such mesmerizing performances. She's great here as well and we also identify with her and see her problems, but these do not get fully in the way of the murder mystery that soon overtakes the full focus of the story.<br/><br/>Is this Alfred Hitchcock's best film? Some like to think so. I personally would actually have to go with ""Vertigo"" (1958) because it evoked more thoughts, emotions, and sympathy from the deepest regions of my soul, but ""Rear Window"" is most certainly not far behind. Hardly a day goes by where I don't look back on the first time I started watching it late at night and found myself gripping my bed sheets and my chest hurting from a hammering heart two hours later."
"myfavouritemovies","10","2","5","8 November 2008"," surely taken by surprise!
","I have just two words for this movie-BLOODY BRILLIANT! .to be honest all i knew about Hitchcock before watching 'Rear window' today was that he is the master of mysteries and thrillers though i never really watched any of his movies.after all this one was made 36 years before my birth and that is quite a long period as far as movies are concerned.i started watching this without any idea of director,cast or genre and only because i had no other movie to watch.as the movie started and the scenes only suggested a dull drama or sugar coated romance that i associate with old movies.it was only after 40 minutes or so that i got interested and from then on there was no looking back.by the time the movie finished i had skipped my lunch which i intended to have during the course of the movie.i couldn't find any faults in the script or logical loopholes.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent.everyone played their part quite convincingly and background score was quite apt for this genre.and finally the cinematography-the problem with these kind of movies is that the movie is so good that u miss the technical excellence.the movie had to be portrayed through Jeffreys' window for most part and that can get quite boring but this surely wasn't dull.<br/><br/>i read a lot of novels(all genre but mysteries are a favorite) and believe that novels are far more powerful medium compared to the big screen.the type of excitement i felt towards the climax was similar to what i felt while reading a novel and that speaks volumes of this masterpiece.one thing that this film surely did was change my opinion of old movies.after this i watched 'psycho'.i wasn't as impressed by it because many such movies have come on the same line.but i am sure 'psycho' started that genre of movies.next thing on my list is to watch all Hitchcock movies i can get hold of."
"SnastyZ","10","2","5","13 September 2008"," Great!
","This was a really good movie. The story of the man who lives across the street and kills his wife is a great plot. L.B. Jeffries was a great character and always knew what to do. Like when the man came from across the street came into Jeffrie's room, he knew to make the camera flash go off to protect himself. The character was also great because he would always make snappy lines about the murderer. It was fun to watch the murderer become so mad at Jeffries. Jeffries was really smart and funny. That was the main reason I liked this movie. Eventually, I would like to see ""The Birds"" That movie is a story about a town that is attacked by evil birds. Both movies were rumored to be great. This is a definite see!"
"claptonisgod53","10","2","5","31 August 2008"," One of the few films to get a deserving 10!
","After seeing Rear Window, I have to say that it is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Sure, there was no twist at the end, but I still feel that Rear Window leaves a good thrill aspect on the viewer.<br/><br/>What I think made Rear Window so good is the fact that it takes place in such a claustrophobic setting. Rear Window may very well be the most claustrophobic movie I have ever seen in my life, considering that it takes place all in one room. Hitch also did this with ""Dial M For Murder"" but I feel that he did an even better job here in Rear Window.<br/><br/>I also like the interesting camera shots in the sense that all the important ones pointing out the window (the important shots) are done from the character's point of view. The characters themselves are very well developed and acted. The chemistry between James Stewert and Grace Kelly are amazing and unforgettable.<br/><br/>The first 3 quarters of this movie plays out more like a murder mystery than a true suspense film, but the last quarter is extremely suspense driven. This is true with most Hitchcock films. The suspense in Rear Window comes from the danger that the main characters outside the window are in, with nothing that the other characters can do about it.<br/><br/>Overall, Rear Window is a must see for every movie fan, and a must own for every Hitch fan."

","James Stewart, a prize-winning photographer, is cooped up in his Greenwich Village apartment with a broken leg. Bored, he watches his diverse neighbors around the courtyard. One of them, a salesman (Raymond Burr), seems to dispose of his nagging, invalid wife by chopping her up and removing her body in sections, but Stewart has no evidence. Gradually, he draws his nurse (Thelma Ritter) into his web of convictions, then his girl friend (Grace Kelly, than whom no girl friend is more gracious -- or better looking for that matter, all that nacreous beauty coiled around a soft pink core). But he is unable to convince his ""ornery old friend"", the police detective, Wendell Corey, that anything is wrong. The climax reveals Burr to be a murderer, breaks Stewart's other leg, and smooths over some riffs in the Stewart/Kelly relationship. <br/><br/>This is one of Hitchcock's best. It raises certain ethical questions, of course. Is it right for people to spy on one another? But the philosophical issues are minor compared to the virtues displayed by this film if taken as a simple mystery thriller. Everything comes together.<br/><br/>It's from Hitchcock's best period, the 1950s, and the director does a laudable job. But it's one of those movies that requires the services of a crew that really knows its business, and they deliver. The performances by the principals is excellent, especially Stewart, on whose smallest movements the story depends. But the movie wouldn't be the success that it is without Franz Waxman's score, Robert Burks' photography, Sam Comer and Ray Moyer's set decoration, and the Sound Department. These aren't the kind of crew members who get noticed, except among their peers, but they put together a winner in this instance.<br/><br/>Here's one example of what I mean. One of Stewart's neighbors, ""Miss Lonelyhearts,"" lives alone and is given to having dinners with imaginary suitors. One night, after suitable preliminary libations, she goes out and picks up a younger man and brings him home. Instead of the decorous development of a romance, the testosterone-driven dude becomes aggressive and Miss Lonelyhearts must slap him to get him to stop. He leaves in a high dudgeon, or maybe, given the circumstances, a low dudgeon. Now, Stewart is watching this from his window across the courtyard. It's late evening and rather noisy. A pop song is playing somewhere. Stewart can't hear what's being said, and he can barely see the events through the half-closed blinds of Miss Lonelyhearts' apartment. Yet the sound of that slap registers, faintly but still audibly. It's the only clear sound we hear or need to hear from her apartment. It acts as punctuation, a period putting an end to this particular cardboard fantasy.<br/><br/>The set is functional and evocative. There are about two dozen windows around the courtyard and Stewart can see almost all of them. The less important apartments are off to the side so he must bend over, but the other are accessible. (It's mid summer and the temperature is in the 90s, so everyone's windows tend to be open.) The construction of the set even yields a tiny sliver of the street across the way, and, with the help of a telephoto lens, even an interior glimpse of the restaurant on the other side of the street. And events of varying importance occur in these tiny porticoes. A murderer may be seen toting body parts off in a suitcase, just for a few seconds, on the sidewalk, or a photographer's girl may give him the high sign when he sends her off on an errand.<br/><br/>The interior of Stewart's apartment is designed with precision. It's what I think is called a studio apartment -- just one room, not overly big, combining bedroom and dining room. There's a miniature kitchen off to the side, the interior of which we never see, and a bathroom, ditto. The place is cluttered with Stewart's memorabilia and other junk. How he can get around in that wheelchair amid the chaos we'll never know. If he had two functional legs he's STILL have to edge around sideways. And, man, do we get the feeling of heat, and of involvement with other people, so open and involved that they can't seem to get out of each other's way. That's why, when a miniature dog is strangled, and the owner across the courtyard screams out that nobody knows the meaning of ""neighbor"" anymore, it rings false. None can be unaware of his surroundings. <br/><br/>James Stewart is not a likable guy in this movie. He's edgy. He's superior, argumentative, neither invites nor projects warmth, is sometimes snotty to his visitors or even hostile. It's hard to imagine why his detective friend would have anything much to do with him. And he plays Grace Kelly like a hooked fish on a very light line. Kelly wants to get married and Stewart wants to keep things ""status quo."" She wants him to give up his adventurous, perambulatory life, wear dark flannel suits, and settle down to taking fashion portraits, which is definitely not his bliss. Kelly herself is always impeccably dressed, carries expensive luggage, and is perfectly satisfied with the comfortable life she leads among the social elite. At the end, in a consummately phony compromise, we see Stewart sleeping peacefully and smiling, the temperature now having dropped into the 70s, while Kelly sits curled on his couch and, after a glance at him, puts aside the book she's been pretending to read, ""Beyond the High Himalayas"", and takes up a copy of Harper's Bazaar. Can anyone believe that this marriage will be a happy one? <br/><br/>It's full of intrigue and suspense, finely done, and not to be missed. Not profound -- just ""deep"" enough."
"seanbrianmaguire","10","2","5","30 March 2006"," An Allegorical Tale Of 50's McCarthyism
","Hitchcock's masterpiece 'Rear Window'is a poignant example of how film can truly reflect a society and its questionable values. I think that for a modern viewer Hitchcock, through such films as 'The Birds'and 'Psycho' has attained a mythic quality of artisan beauty within cinematic dramas that analyse the social fabric of society.<br/><br/>When watching 'Rear Window', I was amazed at the allegorical depths that can be read through this amazing film. 'Rear Window' although in narrative, primarily focuses on the murder of Mrs Thorwald I believe the most socially conscious message discerned comes from the questionable investigate processes of vigilante L. B Jefferies. I think Hitchcock develops into a cinematic genius when one reads these questionable detective processes as an allegory for nineteen fifties McCarthyism. One could discern that Hitchcock has created 'Rear Window' as a monument to this oppressive period in American History and through the ineffectual Detective Doyle the last remnants of morality . I believe Hitchcock could be seen through Jefferies as utilising the camera (both on and off screen) as an ambiguous weapon against crime. However, it is the way we perceive Hitchcock's weapon against 'crime'; as either anti-voyeurism or anti-murder that will develop what message is received."
"sgreene-2","10","2","5","18 July 2000"," Another Hitchcock masterpiece
","It's as if Hitchcock got bored making superb suspense movies that included grand sets and special effects, and decided that he would put shackles on himself. Having only one setting for the entire movie just showcases his genius.<br/><br/>IMO, the single most beautiful/sexy female character in the history of film is Grace Kelly in Rear Window. Her radiance and allure are stunning. She is all-at-once strong and self-confident, caring and sensitive, provocative yet demure. In a word, she is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart is brilliant in this very difficult role. His helpless frustration at his condition as the film nears it's climax is suspense at it's finest. I can feel my skin crawl with anxiety as the plot is revealed, and you can watch the same thing happen to Jeffries.<br/><br/>Finally, this is another AH movie that it pays to see over and over. The details you notice will continue to appear anew even after the fifth, seventh, tenth time you see it. Although Hitchcock's films are all great, I think this is his crowning achievement."
"diffusionx","9","2","5","18 July 2000"," Superbly Suspenseful
","Rear Window is such a great movie because it manages to create suspense with ease, and manages to sustain that throughout the entire film. You only really see what Jeffries sees; and, of course, this guy must be feeling a little nervous seeing as though he thinks he knows about a murder. By making the viewers see it has he does, Hitchcock manages to make the viewer as nervous about the situation as Jeffries does. <br/><br/>There isn't much plot here, instead, it's one linear storyline with little tidbits from the other people's lives. Each of these stories are brilliantly complete in and of themselves, from Ms. Torso's freewheeling to Ms. Lonelyheart's... lonely heart. Still, this movie is, completely and totally, about voyeurism in every way. Jeffries's profession is about taking pictures of other people's situation. Him and his girlfriend are worried that they just won't work as a married couple, because of their vast differences in lifestyle. The murder plot unfolds carefully, and slowly (like a puzzle slowly being solved), and the viewer manages to see only as much as Jeffries does, in effect turning each viewer into a voyeur. Jeffries' paranoia ends up consuming just about everyone else he knows, and it all leads to a very suspenseful climax that does not disappoint the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>With Rear Window, Hitchcock manages to latch onto a subject that just about every person could be compelled with, and follows through with such precision and flair that is practically the norm for him. Absolutely one of the best movies ever made."
"mikhaigh","9","2","5","19 June 2000"," A Classic
","Wheelchairbound Photographer James Stewart spends all day and night spying on neighbours from his ""Rear Window"". Believing he has witnessed a murder in apartment opposite he tries in vain to alert others to the vile crime.<br/><br/>This film was way ahead of its time and is even more amazing in the way it tackles the relationship between men and women in a time when in thrillers men where the boss and women screamed. were kissed and did little else.The mere mention of sex was not an option in hollywood movies. The way Kelly invites herself to stay at the apartment and is the more active in suggesting an obvious sexual relationship must have been shocking for the time.<br/><br/>In a way, the role of manly male and feeble frightend female are reversed. James Stewart although desperate to maintain his credibility as a man, is a mere onlooker on the microcosm of society that is represented by the closed block of apartments that he inhabits. By contrast, his girlfriend Grace Kelly is fearless and inclined to action once she begins to believe also, that a crime has been committed.<br/><br/>The callous way that Stewart rebuffs the obvious sexual advances of Kelly adds to the impression that deep within Stewarts psyche he believes that without the ability to control events he is not a man.<br/><br/>The photography is superb, from the way that you see the lives of the other inhabitants from a distance through their ever open windows, (haven't these people heard of curtains?) but in silence, apart from the ever present music of the composer, trying to finish his film score.<br/><br/>Raymond Burr as the suspected villian is superbly sinister,  but James Stewart really showed what a magnificent actor he was by shedding the tough guy image and taking on a role that took guts in real life. For me the most frightening part of the movie  is when Kelly is discovered in the apartment opposite and Stewart is powerless to help her. This reminds me of all those nightmares when you are powerless to move and avert disaster.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly is possibly the most gorgeous woman ever, and has that innocent yet woman of the world quality that most guys would gladly jump over cliffs for.<br/><br/>A Classic."
"Sam_Spade","10","2","5","15 February 2000"," All human life is here
","Hitch's finest: containing more humanity than his earlier films, but with the same precision to detail and technical excellence that first made his name.<br/><br/>That said, what really separates this from all his other work, and that of the other great directors, is that the lead character is as impotent to alter his view-point, or act on what he sees, as is the viewer. Stewart becomes a de facto member of the audience , and all this while not only retaining all his phlegmatic charm and charisma, but also adding a hitherto rarely seen hard edge.<br/><br/>Kelly is given a rare chance to portray a character other than a porcelain doll, and in doing so elicits the audience sympathy. Perhaps the most interesting part of the picture though, are the voyeuristic overtones of not only Stewart, but also the audience observing snippets of the life across the court-yard. Is he justified in keeping himself entertained, in his injury imposed monotony, by intruding on his neighbours private lives? Are we?"
"Elizabeth-328","10","2","5","29 January 2000"," One of my favorite Hitchcock movies
","I adore this movie!  James Stewart and Grace Kelly are great as the main characters, Jeff and Lisa.  There are also fantastic performances by the supporting cast: Thelma Ritter as Stella, Wendell Corey as detective and friend of Jeff Tom Doyle, and Raymond Burr as the bad guy Lars Thorwald.<br/><br/>My favorite part is the whole sequence when Jeff, Lisa, and Stella try to get Thorwald.  It begins with Lisa entering Thorwald's apartment, and reaches a climax when Thorwald gets home and discovers her.  He wrestles with her and Jeff gets panicky, but luckily he had called the police and they arrived before Thorwald could hurt Lisa.  The truly frightening part is when Lisa is wiggling her finger back and forth so Jeff could see Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.  Thorwald sees what she's doing, and looks up into Jeff's apartment, and right into the camera.<br/><br/>The really climatic part comes when Jeff answers his phone, thinking that the caller is Doyle.  He blurts out a lot of information about Thorwald, but then stops suddenly.  He realizes that the person on the other end hasn't said anything, and then the person hangs up.  The look on Jeff's face says it all: he knows Thorwald is coming to kill him.  And since he's in a wheelchair, and now the only one in the apartment, there's nothing that can be done.  He can't even get up and lock the door.  <br/><br/>""Rear Window"" combines suspense with romance and comedy.  It's truly one entertaining movie!  Anyone who is a Hitchcock fan should see this movie.  I gave ""Rear Window"" a 10 out of 10."
"Calysta","10","2","5","19 January 2000"," Hitchcock masterpiece
","There's something so terrible and tragic about Jeff Jeffries, Jimmy Stewart's character. Confined to a wheelchair at home with his leg in a cast, the photographer seems to be incredibly lonely, a photographer who seems to have lost some of his humane instincts by not allowing mostly decent people to have their privacy. We see through his eyes what he believes to be a murder, but what we don't see is all the rest of what happened as his suspicions all come exclusively from his point of view.<br/><br/>
This was one of the best Hitchcock films ever made, and is second only to ""North by Northwest"". The Hitch managed to assemble top talent for his movies, beginning with ""Rope"" for Jimmy. ""Rear Window"" was Jimmy's personal favourite of the Hitchcock movies. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Freemont, the rich, beautiful girlfriend does not have the most essential part but her presence does manage to unearth Jeff's solitude. Notable performances from the supporting cast include Thelma Ritter, as Stella the maid and Raymond Burr, as Lars, suspected murderer. <br/><br/>Certainly the movie has in tow all the great elements on its side. The best of scripts, the best of talent from the acting stable and a mastermind director of suspense. Another of the more interesting elements is the musical score, which is provided courtesy of the songwriting man as he attempts to unleash his musical masterpiece.<br/><br/>Does this provide an excuse for prying into the lives of other people, by unearthing the curious inner person of us all? I hardly think so, but it brings a very real insight to the lives of others, particularly shown through the character of Miss Lonely Hearts, that there are a lot of lonely people out there. It also shows that our neighbours can be doing a lot of interesting things if we are watching at the right moment.<br/><br/>
After the whole murder business which pulled Jeff further and further into the mystery to the point of no escape, I think I will stop spying on my brother and his girlfriend. It after all, was my new year's resolution before I turn fifteen. But just by writing the words to this review makes me want to watch the movie again. <br/><br/>Hitchcock created an intriguing treat which cannot be spoiled by repeated viewings of his 50s thriller classic. <br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"
"Spleen","10","2","5","13 December 1999"," A classic, but also an old favourite ...
","Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his apartment for some weeks.  Lacking anything more interesting to do, spends his time watching all the people in the apartments across the courtyard, one of whom, he soon thinks, has murdered his wife ... and so on.  Everyone knows everything about this film already.  Everyone knows that every single shot is taken FROM Jeff's apartment.  There are no gratuitous close-ups of the people on the other side - except, of course, when Jeff gets out his telephoto lens.  So there's never any doubt what we're meant to know, or what we're meant to think that Jeff knows, or anything of that kind.<br/><br/>It's soon obvious to most people that the open windows across the courtyard look exactly like movie screens.  Many consider this to be a comment on the voyeuristic nature of cinema.  Hitchcock himself thought as much (perhaps prompted by François Truffaut).  Well, it isn't.  It's clear that Jeff is looking at the lives of the people in other apartments AS IF they're movies, screened for his amusement; but the film is really saying, `Jeff is acting as if he's watching a movie'; rather than, `We, in watching the movie, are acting as if we're staring through other people's windows.'  That's if you MUST read anything at all into Hitchcock's neat visual idea.<br/><br/>There's also an uneasy love story taking place between Jeff and a much richer woman, Lisa (Grace Kelly).  Personally, if I were Jeff, I'd forget about Lisa Whatsername and concentrate on Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy), somewhere to the upper right.  But even though the love story is beside the point the film wouldn't be nearly so good without it.  Jeff needs someone close enough to be an ally when the story requires it, not so close as to simply be on the same quest he's on.<br/><br/>This is Hitchcock's most purely enjoyable film since he left Britain - which is to say, since `The Lady Vanishes' (1938).  It still works even when you know it all by heart."
"orcrush","10","2","5","18 August 1999"," Simply the best
","Pretentious film scholars may say Citizen Kane, hopeless romantics point to Casablanca and Gone With the Wind, IMDB voters love the Godfather, and Brittany Spears fans choose Titanic, but for my money this Hitchcock movie is the all time best American movie. It was the first movie by the master I ever saw, and 26 films later, it's still my favorite. Anybody who only knows Hitchcock for Psycho or the Birds, or Stewart for overbloated Capra fare, should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>The basic story is one of voyeurism, and the first half hour has no real plot. But you'll find yourself engrossed in the lives of the people the wheelchair bound Stewart is peering at. This being a Hitchcock film, of course, there has to be a murder, too, and that's when the real fun begins. To reveal anything else would be criminal. The performances all around are astounding, particularly Thelma Ritter as Stewart's nurse. Grace Kelly is mesmerizing as always. But this is Stewart's movie. I am confounded by those who claim Vertigo to be his better performance. He was so disturbed and unlikeable in that film. This is *the* masterpiece of his, Hitchcock's, and all of film history."
"1of1","10","2","5","16 June 1999"," More than a nail-biter, a work of art...
","There are two things about this film that make it my favorite of all the Hitchcock films I've seen:  #1, Grace Kelly's performance and #2, the level of art achieved by the story.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly was certainly a great actress and a lovely lady, but for some reason this is the film I think of whenever I think of her.  I never wanted to be a princess, but as a kid I used to imagine reprising her role in this movie.<br/><br/>More intellectually, the story is so fabulous because it varies the pace, builds and plays with the suspense, rather than trying to keep us on the edge of our seats every second.  Life plays in varied tempos.  Also, it is so realistic in depicting the guy in his room with a broken leg (been there, though thankfully by my day they'd invented the VCR).  Yet, within this realistic and believable situation, the ordinary man's rather understandable voyeurism works so well because it becomes a metaphor for our own inescapable solipsism.  We're all prisoners of our own little room (self), looking out on the world and trying to understand it and the other people in it.  We get glimpses of their lives through their windows, but that is all we can get."
"tim777ca","8","2","5","2 May 2002"," Why Leave the Door Unlocked?
","There are always forced ending climaxes in Hitchcock's films, such as the on-time rescues in North by Northwest and Psycho, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>In Rear Window, James Stewart has a cast on his leg, but that doesn't mean he cannot move at all. We see him standing up when Thelma Ritter comes to give him a massage. We can also assume that he takes care most of his meals and goes to the toilet by himself. But when the murderer finds out where he is and comes over to teach him a final lesson, Stewart just sits there listening to this guy's footsteps. There's certainly enough time for him to ""walk"" or crawl over and lock the door of his apartment.<br/><br/>I do admire Hitchcock's cinematic ability to handle a story about a character who is confined to the wheelchair, but it seems that he never paid his attention to the logic of the plots too much."
"hbs","10","2","5","18 April 1999"," one of the best movies ever made
","I think that this is Hitchcock's best, although I won't argue with someone picking something else. It's too bad that they keep yanking the thing from circulation, since I believe that there is enough ongoing interest that they'd do just as well selling it all the time.<br/><br/>One thing to notice in this movie is how skilled everyone is. Even Grace Kelly, who wasn't that experienced an actress does a more than creditable job (although she does flub the line about ""ghouls"" in the middle of the film a little), but Stewart and Ritter are just amazing. I think that having a career in which you make 100 movies, something that apparently will never happen again, makes talented actors and directors into something more. The movie is a straight suspense picture, and the fact that it's about something more profound than just whodunnit adds to the tension, since you care about the characters. The casting is great, and Stewart manages to realistically portray a guy thinking about breaking up with Grace Kelly."
"fletch5","10","2","5","20 December 2000"," Sheer brilliance of film making
","I believe most Hitchcock buffs consider ""Rear Window"" the director's best accomplishment. And why not, although ""Vertigo"" is a serious competitor. ""North by Northwest"" is my favourite Hitchcock film, but I think it's ""Rear Window"" that proves his mastery perhaps most perfectly.<br/><br/>Aside from being a highly enjoyable murder mystery, ""Rear Window"" plays like a lesson on film making. Even though when you're familiar with the plot, you can still watch the movie over and over again, admiring how brilliantly it's put together. Elaborate camera work compounded with flawless editing - simply marvellous.<br/><br/>John Michael Hayes' script - containing interesting, lively dialogue - is downright delicious; one of the best Hitchcock worked with, not to mention the excellent cast. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are fantastic, and Thelma Ritter adds plenty of comic relief.<br/><br/>In a way I can understand some people who say ""Rear Window"" is boring. Occasionally it may seem a bit sluggish, because nowadays' audiences are used to much quicker pacing. But when Stewart makes Kelly to believe his murder theory, the story gains momentum at a stroke. From there forward, it's topnotch thrilling all the way to the tingling climax."

","Before I start my review I just want to say this is my favorite movie of all time and I urge anyone reading this to go pick up a copy immediately.<br/><br/>Hitchcock directs and Jimmy Stewart stars. Does it get much better than that? Jimmy Stewart plays a photographer, L.B. Jeffries(Jeff) who broke his leg on the job so is now bound to a wheelchair for another week. Jeff becomes obsessed with watching the fellow attendees of his apartment complex through his rear window. He starts to believe that a man across the way has murdered his wife. Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly) also begins to share the same suspicion.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a classic that still holds up today. It's funny, heart warming and very suspenseful.

James Stewart plays the 'louse' who declares she could never follow him through the middle east photographing on dangerous assignments and he could never fit into her ideal.

"MartinHafer","9","4","17","19 May 2006"," yep--it's a good film,...but #14 on IMDb???
","This is a very good film--definitely one of Hitchcock's best films and very suspenseful. But when I noticed on IMDb that it is ranked #16I was shocked. I just can't accept that this is the 16th best movie out there. If you thought about it, I'm sure most everyone reading this would be able to pick more than 16 better films with little problem. Jimmy Stewart, the star of this film, himself probably did a hand full of other films that should be ranked higher than this movie (such as MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE MORTAL STORM, ANATOMY OF A MURDER and several others come to mind). <br/><br/>Now my rant about it being over-rated is NOT to say this is a bad film. As far as suspense films go, it's one of the better ones and the only Hitchcock film I like more is NORTH BY NORTHWEST--and only by a shade. The acting is just fine, the script is excellent and the scares are intense. It's also amazingly innovative the way an entire New York neighborhood was recreated in a sound stage! Truly original and a must-see for suspense film buffs."
"jboothmillard","10","4","17","4 March 2005"," Rear Window
","Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock has created another masterpiece, my second favourite after Psycho. Basically L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (the great James Stewart) is the reporter who is spending his last weeks in his apartment with a broken leg, and all he can do to pass the time is stare out the window watching his neighbours enjoying the hot weather (with no blinds down). During his time though, he is occasionally visited by the nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his model girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (the beautiful Grace Kelly). While he is watching the individual occupants of the windows, he has given them all nicknames and is consumed by their private dramas. But one particularly window has caught his attention, when Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) is looking very suspicious with knives, saws and ropes, going out late at night, and his nagging wife has disappeared. Jeff is convinced that he has murdered his wife, and is constantly trying to watch the action, and prove Throwald's guilt. Det. Lt. Thomas J. Doyle (Wendell Corey) is convinced he is overreacting, but more and more incidents with Thorwald make Jeff, and you (the audience) believe this accusation. The best moments are when Jeff gives Thorwald a note and a phone call, the investigation of the patio, and the concluding fight. Hitchcock's cameo is the man in the songwriter/pianist's studio winding a clock. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Grace Kelly was number 86, and James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Stewart was also number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Kelly was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Stewart was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, Hitchcock was number 75, and Kelly number 92 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Outstanding!"
"thegornie","8","1","2","26 May 2018"," Think but don't overthink
","Hitchcock tackles our bizarre fascination with voyeurism. After all, what are movies but a godlike ability to watch a story play out without the actors acknowledging the audience?<br/><br/>Filmed brilliantly, so that you feel just as James Stewart does in the film: that you're watching people who don't know they're being watched. The next-level mastery from Hitchcock is that you're watching people who don't know they're being watched watching people who don't know they're being watched. At the center of this masterpiece was witnessing how voyeurism transforms Lisa from conservative cosmopolitan queen to the adventurous thrill-seeker that Jeff desired. A fine story in itself, if that is all that it was ever meant to be.<br/><br/>But as some reviewers have called out, this movie could have reached a whole other level of greatness, had it featured a final twist ending. And given the claims that this film was among the greatest ever, I fully expected a shocking twist! Among the areas my mind wandered: while Jeff and Lisa are preoccupied with a murder that never actually occurred...Lonelyhearts's suicide occurs in plain sight; the fire escape sleepers fall to preventable deaths; newlywed husband and Miss Torso start a steamy affair.<br/><br/>But the ultimate twist my mind swirled up: That Jeff was secretly being watched all along from another apartment across the way, by none other than Lieutenant Doyle who had been digging for dirt on Lisa in a scandalous corruption investigation. Can you imagine the horrifying paranoia when Jeff realized the tables were turned on him? Such is the greatness that I had imagined, fueled by the hype this movie still generates six decades later.<br/><br/>Alas, the twistless ending was plain and simple. With no expectations going in, I would have fully appreciated the fine camerawork and direction, all the more outstanding in the absence of a musical score. Instead I was left wanting more."

She is smart, beautiful, brave, kindhearted and devoted. <br/><br/>The Hitchcock movies I like are as follows: <br/><br/>1. The 39 steps 2. Stage Fright 3. Strangers on a Train 4. Rope 5.

"zkonedog","9","1","2","11 March 2017"," Hitch Breaks New Ground Again
","By today's standards, a film like ""Rear Window"" would seem quite uninspired, unoriginal, and just plain derivative (see: Disturbia). However, when one considers that Hitchcock's ""Window"" actually SET the standard, it really can be considered a groundbreaking film.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rear Window"" sees photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg, with nothing else to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city- dwelling neighbors. One neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) in particular, though, arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife. At first, things seem relatively harmless, until Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, making things a whole lot more personal.<br/><br/>Once again, this movie shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of his time. In 1954, while other directors were cranking out B-pictures, character flicks, or even ""variety show"" events that did nothing more than draw crowds, Hitch was crafting a spooky tale of voyeurism that still holds up very well to this day. The directing is fantastic, as Hitch slowly builds the tension to a few scenes towards the end that will make your blood run cold.<br/><br/>The acting is also top-notch. You can't go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly shows that she isn't just a ""pretty face"" as well. Raymond Burr (though only uttering a few lines of dialogue) is also intriguing as the antagonist throughout.<br/><br/>About the only criticism I have of this film (what drops it from a 5-star to 4-star rating) is that Hitch puts in some character development just for the sake of character development...it doesn't really lead anywhere. A full 20 minutes could have been cut out in relation to character-building, and the overall product might have been more exciting/better paced.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a great movie that truly stands the test of time. Immerse yourself in Hitchcock's original fare and see the master at his best."

","From cinemas leading auteur, Alfred Hitchcock comes the story of L.B. Jefferies, a photography who has been bound to a wheelchair after getting in the middle of a race car crash and now spends his days spying on the neighbours. One day the curious Jefferies begins to notice something isn't quite right with his neighbours the Thorwarld's and thus begins an investigation in search of the truth. It's a classic Hitchcock suspense thriller that plays on the themes of paranoia and voyeurism ans not only deals with issues behind other peoples closed doors but also talks of the voyeurism associated with cinema going.<br/><br/>The film keeps you guessing as the suspected crime remains just that, suspected. What unravels is an ambiguous psychological mystery for the most part as we are lead to question whether a crime has actually been committed or is Jefferies simply fixating on little things and trying to make his own narrative from them. As I previously stated if we step back and point the finger at ourselves and see what Hitchcock is saying about us, the viewer and our attempts to piece together the plots of peoples lives be it in real life or magnified on a cinema screen.<br/><br/>The film, like Jefferies, not only fixates on the the Thornwald's but also shows follows the lives of the other, rather eccentric neighbours, such as the fire escape couple and Miss Lonely hearts and the songwriter. These stories are intriguing as they seem to remain rather realistic as in little transpires in their lives over the course of the film with a few exceptions, but somehow you find yourself intrigued by their lives despite of the seemingly eventfulness of their home lives. This again speaks to the voyeurs in the audience, which it appears I am one of.<br/><br/>Overall, Rear Window is a contained film (pun intended) that conveys an intriguing message about voyeurism and cinema going. It's interesting to see as one of Hitchcock's essentials as that in itself could begin a debate of whether that is accurate but I think I'll just leave it here."

Everything is pointing towards this being a wild goose chase and just when he's about to give up on the idea something arouses his suspicion again.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is the master of thrill and horror and he will have you wavering between siding with Jeff or with reason throughout the movie, never truly settling on a side for too long. <br/><br/>Beautifully shot, smooth editing... and Grace Kelly is her radiant self in it!

But the TV movie that was done 1998 which was a remake of the 1954 classic is my best, I actually saw the TV movie first before seeing the original it stared Christopher Reeve, who himself was paralyzed as the result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, so he fitted the role perfectly.<br/><br/>Well enough has been said about Rear Window, it is a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller that I can say if you are watching all Alfred Hitchcock classic then you must see this one.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"p_adkins2004","8","1","2","22 February 2007"," Hitchcock's True Classic?
","This film is pretty much set in Jefferies flat throughout the whole 2 hours (reminding me somewhat of The Glass Menagerie, which is never a good thing), and no shot outside of the apartment block is shot, and although Hitchcock ensures the audience aren't too aware of this, it doesn't help the static feeling that this film creates.<br/><br/>The most interesting level to the flick is the relationship between Jefferies and his girlfriend, which at the start of the film is mismatched, disjointed and mainly physical (Kelly's sexuality is on full display here), yet through the supposedly horrific circumstances they are able to use murder as a lubrication to a better relationship. Kelly especially seems aware of this yet, almost acknowledging the sacrifice of a life as a fair act for the salvation of their relationship. In many ways this complex relationship means the murder itself plays second fiddle.<br/><br/>The murder plot itself is fairly basic and uninspiring, yet it is the unlikable Jefferies response to the proceedings which mean the viewer doesn't lose interest.<br/><br/>Compared to many of Hitchcock's true classics this film does not have a tense edge to it (not to the modern audience anyway, when the idea of voyeurism or being watched all the time is reality not fantasy), till the final 10 minutes of climax. Perhaps the idea of being watched from afar is accepted to the point where the pivotal point of the flick is somewhat lost."
"gjlmovie4711","Null","1","2","8 August 2001"," No rear window
","Many positive things about Rear Window have been said; after seeing Hitchcock's ""own favorite movie"" for the first time, I would only make some small critical comments. First, I don't understand the title. Because Stewart's appartment doesn't have a ""real"" front (the front door is situated in a corridor, where are no windows at all), the window he's continuously looking through is by all means a FRONT window. Second, only for Hitchcock's own comfort as a director, Stewart is able to observe his neighbours through his binoculars and his enormous - at least - 300 mm objective the entire day and night, without ever being asked or confronted what the hell this voyeur think he's doing! His neighbours, who live only a couple of feet across, must have noticed this man observing them way before ""Thorwald"" does, when Kelly is found in his apartment (giving Stewart fingersigns, discovered by Thorwald). Third, and most important, I found the final scenes so disappointing, I couldn't believe this was a Hitchcock-movie. All of Stewart's assumptions and predictions are proven to be right and that's it.

","Hitchcock's favorite leading man, Jimmy Stewart, wheelchair bound and bored, does what every guy in this situation would do: He grabs a pair of binoculars and ""explores"" the apartment windows across the yard. Of course he eventually gets an eye-full of funny business in one of the windows (someone murdered a woman and then disposed of the body by burrying it in the yard). Love interest Grace Kelly, totally keeping her cool, aides the handicapped amateur sluth in his quest to bring the murderer to justice. Also part of the fun is Thelma Ritter in one of her 6 career Oscar-nominated performances. <br/><br/>This ""thriller"" is certainly predictable, limping by on a bit of nail-biting tension and several ""almost caught by the bad guy"" scenes. Otherwise it's just not up to Hitchcock's usual best. To anyone just discovering The Master of Mahem, I can highly recommend ""Frenzy"", ""The 39 Steps"" and the dark comedy ""The Trouble With Harry"", assuming that everyone starts (and has already seen) ""Psycho"". If you are new to ""Rear Window"", there are many better ways to spend 2 hours of your life (that you'll never get back).<br/><br/>As a big fan of ""The Master"", I find this to be his weakest work. He offers the beautiful, ultra-glamorous Grace Kelly (soon to be Princess of Monacco) and a visibly much older, favorite leading man Jimmy Stewart, further perpetuating the chronic ""older man, gorgeous young woman"" love story that endured Barrymore/Garbo, Bogey/Bacall, Gable/Monroe and the likes. What is (and ever was) wrong with a 50 year old man dating a woman his own age? Stop the ""Daddy"" stuff, it's no longer cute."

","Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

","This movie will probably be with us forever! It's a fantastic movie to say the least. And Hitchcook got once again a chance at displaying his genius. The movie is beautifully composed, you would fell that following a character that sits in his wheelchair and glances out his rear window all day would get quite boring after some time, but it's absolutely fantastic! I think that has to do with how Hitchcook composes the shots, we are always looking at what the character is looking at, it's from is point of view. Occasionally the perspective will switch and we are now interrogating the characters expression toward what just happened. He connects the emotions with the visuals perfectly. Every time, it feels like we are looking at another world, it's all the windows that are the portals which will let us see in to other peoples life. Understand them and poke our curiosity towards their movements, and actions. Which is the whole structure for the plot, curiosity. But i wouldn't be a Hitchcook movie without some love with friction. Jeff, who is the main character is a magazine photographer with a packed suit case and too many stamps on his passport, during the movie he is in a wheelchair with a cast on his right leg. Whilst his wife, Grace Kelly is a Park Avenue socialite who seems ill-adapted for his life style. She wants to marry him whilst he sees marriage as an extension of his cast on his leg. The romance is complicated to say the least, but interesting and dramatizing. In the end it's a fantastic movie which is worth watching every day as long as you are breathing."

","You just can't resist watching Hitchcock's Rear Window, just as L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) can't resist the urge of peeking at his neighbours. What makes this movie so great, besides the witty dialogue and simple yet perfectly executed plot, has to be that unique feeling where you become one with the main character. As a viewer you share and experience everything from Jeffries' perspective which automatically creates a certain suspense. Personally, I found the authenticity of this movie to be quite charming. Rear Window remains an all-time classic for a reason. Good walls make good neighbours, but what happens when you're getting a bit too curious?"

While he is confined to a wheelchair and unable to escape on assignments, he is forced to evaluate their relationship and considers breaking up with her but Stella, his physical therapist tells him he's being foolish.<br/><br/>One night while dozing in front of the window, he hears a scream from outside. The following morning the wife of one his neighbours, Mr. Thorwald has mysteriously vanished and after observing more closely, Jeff becomes convinced that he has murdered her.<br/><br/>He confides his suspicions to Lisa and Stella, who don't believe him at first, but soon they too are drawn in and try to help Jeff solve the mystery behind Mrs. Thorwald's disappearance.<br/><br/>The movie was shot entirely from inside Jeff's apartment, giving the movie an intimate, voyeuristic feel (a conscious artistic choice from Hitchcock), which I love.<br/><br/>There is plenty of the usual mystery and suspense that you'd expect from a Hitchcock movie, but by far my most favourite aspect of the movie is the evolution of Grace Kelly's character, Lisa. At the beginning of the movie Jeff is reluctant to commit to her because he considers her too prissy and feminine, instead preferring a woman who is pluckier and with a sense of adventure, like himself. But she proves him wrong when she goes to extreme and dangerous lengths to help him prove Thorwald's guilt and shows that she's more than just the pretty face he considered her to be."

You don't suffer, or the movie, because of too dark a corner or something lacking lighting wise. The director is on his game and is not gong to let any detail go unnoticed. Truly a masterpiece. The directing is taught, truly suspenseful, and not over done. You are too wrapped up in what is going on in this film to even have much of a chance to think about the directing. The acting is great as well, but I don't think Mr. Hitchcock wouldn't have had it any other way. James Stewart is great, just great.

"brchthethird","9","1","3","6 August 2015"," Interesting social commentary wrapped up in Hitchcock's best film so far
","Not having seen every film that Hitchcock made, and therefore not entirely qualified to analyze what makes a film ""his,"" REAR WINDOW is definitely getting closer to what my idea of the ideal Hitchcock film is. Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far. I also can't wait to dig further into to his filmography."
"arussell23","10","1","3","14 July 2015"," 'Rear Window' is a thrilling film that keeps you guessing until the last few minutes
","Alfred Hitchcock's illustrious career truly began to take off in the 1950's, as most of his remembered films come from those years. One of these such films is the classic Rear Window, released in 1954 and based on a short story written by Cornell Woolrich. The film was regarded as one of Hitchcock's best, being included in every ""Masterpiece"" or ""Essentials"" collection of his, and it currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, an 8.6 on IMDb and is in three of the Top AFI lists. So, let's see if one of Hitchcock's most known is as good as they say.<br/><br/>Rear Window follows a photographer forced to stay in his home due to his leg injury. He bides his time by watching his neighbors out of the window, dealing with his girlfriend, and having discussions with his insurance nurse. One night, he witnesses events through his window that begin to make him believe that the man just across the square may have murdered someone. As he gets closer and closer to the truth, things only get crazier and crazier.<br/><br/>This film was one that I expected to be great, due to it's history, but I didn't expect it to be this great, honestly. Stewart, as he always does, does a brilliant job as Jeff, a photographer who gains a greater appreciation for the people in his life as the film goes on, and he really sells the role. Grace Kelly also does a stellar job as Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, managing to never seem like she's trying to nag Jeff as they disagree about their future together. Thelma Ritter is an often darkly funny character as Stella, and she truly brings a dimension to this film that really helps it, in my opinion. Raymond Burr does a intriguing job as the neighbor Jeff begins to suspect as the murderer. Finally, Wendell Corey is an intriguing character, as the detective friend Jeff calls in to consult with.<br/><br/>The music for the film, only really for the opening and closing, done by Franz Waxman was great. I wish it had been utilized more, but I get that if it had, it might have ruined what Hitchcock was trying to accomplish. The special effects used at times, especially in a certain scene at the end, were not that bad. I mean, today, they wouldn't fly, but for the time, it looks pretty good. I enjoyed the lighting in this film, such as the many scenes where Jeff is sitting in the dark in his apartment, and it looks as if he's hiding in the shadows at times. I mean, sometimes, it's intentional, but at other times it works well.<br/><br/>I thought the script was written very well. Several of the discussions between Jeff and some of the other characters were very riveting and hold your interest, even if it seems to be about something trivial on the surface. I enjoyed a lot of the camera motions and how the film was done. The film is basically set in Jeff's apartment for the entire film, as most of the camera shots of other people and apartments are from his apartment, which I thought added a lot to the film. We only see what the characters can see - nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed how the sound effects really complimented the film. Instead of having a formal type of score, you mainly only hear sound effects from other apartments or natural nature noises. The only time you actually hear music, aside from what Franz Waxman did for the opening/ending, is from the songwriter's apartment. I thought that was a very clever way to keep the film grounded, props to Hitchcock for that idea.<br/><br/>Overall, Rear Window is an achievement in filmmaking. Its mystery is compelling, the story is great, the acting is fantastic, the music, albeit limited, works very well, as does it's use of sound effects, the script and the way the film was done. If you haven't seen it, consider checking it out as it is very riveting and will keep you guessing until the end.<br/><br/>10/10. Grade: A+"

","""Intelligence. Nothing has caused the human race so much trouble as intelligence.""<br/><br/>Rear Window was my first Hitchcock film, and what a lasting impression it has had on me ever since. I remember watching scenes for it in a film course I was taking in college and I enjoyed it so much that I immediately decided to see it in its entirety. Alfred Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors ever since. It helps that suspense is one of my favorite genres so leave it to the master to deliver plenty of thrills in all his films. In Rear Window the suspense was elevated to its highest potential and what a fun experience it was. The first thing that stuck out for me in this film was the voyeuristic nature that Hitchcock is exploring through the main character of the movie, played magnificently by James Stewart. Just like his character I remember spending some summers in the balcony of my apartment looking at the passing by neighbors in order to fight my boredom. In Rear Window I too felt I was alongside Stewart's Jeff obsessing over the possibility that a horrendous crime had been committed. We also suffer with Jeff when he sends his beloved Lisa (played by the gorgeous Grace Kelly) to investigate the suspect's apartment while we see that he is arriving, and just like Jeff there is nothing we can do about it other than hope she manages to hide before she's caught. This film is so well made that it continues to thrill today without having to rely on impressive visual effects. There is a reason why Alfred Hitchcock is considered the Master of Suspense, and this is perhaps the greatest proof for that claim. I can't think of another film that's as involving as Rear Window is with its audience. We become participants in Hitchcock's latest experimentation with voyeurism and that is its major appeal. <br/><br/>""We have become a race of Peeping Toms.""<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Once again, Hitchcock is effortless in his pacing and virtue to the philosophy of an advantaged and privileged victim. Unfortunately and disappointingly, the film is often slow-moving and unlike others in the Hitchcock canon, the slow-mounting tension and thrill of the chase is often rendered monotonous. Nevertheless it is enjoyable and incredibly taut, the paranoid and claustrophobic tension is eased by the glistening of Grace Kelly and the ridiculously dry wit in the back and forth between Thelma Ritter and James Stewart. Definitely worth a watch and a necessity for any Hitchcock collection - the imagery and pace are both really unique to Hitchcock's style but are more on show in Rear Window."
"sandnair87","9","1","3","24 March 2015"," Rear Window is a Rarity - Even by Hitchcockian Standards!
","Rear Window is an intriguing, brilliant, chilling Hitchcockian study of obsessive human curiosity and voyeurism. It plays as the ultimate guilty pleasure treat (comparing the viewer to a voyeur who sits in the dark judging what he sees while being unobserved) and an extended metaphor to the illusory workings of the cinema. <br/><br/>The premise echoes the director's simple but lucrative narrative launching points. Jeff (James Stewart) is an action-hungry photographer who has spent several weeks in isolation, as a result of a broken leg that has relegated him to a wheelchair in his New York apartment. His social interactions are limited to his sarcastic massage therapist Stella (the deliciously acerbic Thelma Ritter) and a romantic interest with an unqualified patience (the marvelous Grace Kelly). From his apartment window overlooking a closed courtyard, the audaciously observant Jeff peeks at the busy lives of an assemblage of suburban tenants in perplexed fascination and witnesses everyone's dirty linen: suicide, broken dreams, and cheap death! There is an unsettling resonance in what his eyes and ears absorb. During a particularly humid night while Jeff drifts in and out of slumber, the foreboding figures across the yard are heard and seen in lightning-fast increments. There is a spine-tingling scream followed by stoic silence. The husband leaves the apartment in the dead of night, seemingly shaken, only to return later. By the following morning the wife is no longer seen from Jeff's vantage point, but where did she go?<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock crafts one of his most intelligently thrilling films (a sadistic pleasure in meddling in the questionable private lives of others), adapting an incredible tale of pure misanthropy. All those characters we glimpse across from Jeff's window are real people, given dimension by basic but brilliant filmmaking techniques. The most remarkable aspect is the way that it is filmed: the camera never strays from inside Stewart's apartment, and you never really realize that while watching the film. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is an insightful amalgamation of character and behavior, and the dialogue is wonderfully used to accentuate details. Also, due mention is rightfully reserved for the three lead actors (Stewart, Kelly and Ritter) who play the material with orthodox conviction, as if oblivious to the monumental profundity stirring beneath them. <br/><br/>Rear Window has an infectious and savage charm that leaps beyond even the highest of expectations. What's more, it is also a vivid reminder of who Hitchcock was and continues to be: the quintessential voice of audacity in an industry starved for the guidance of progressive voices. Rear Window is a joy from start to finish!"

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","3","6 January 2015"," First-rate Hitch . . .
","I consider myself a student of Hitchcock. His films are pure, with little confidence in symbols and egghead analysis. It is said that he treated his actors like cattle but the payoff is that he treated his audience like gold. He made his films for the public, he made them entertaining and he made films with characters that at least approximate human intelligence.<br/><br/>Rear Window is mounted on an idea of complete simplicity. A man is trapped in one location, an island – in this case, a wheelchair. Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies – Jeff to his friends – a traveling photographer who is in a state of confinement after an accident. A brilliant tracking shot gives us the entirety of his predicament as we see his broken camera and a photo of an airborne racecar tumbling right at Jefferies' lens.<br/><br/>Jeff's days of confinement are spent staring out of his window, which like all others, are open due to the intense heat. He takes daily inventory of the tenants in the apartments across the tightly packed courtyard. His travels haven't given him much time to get to know his neighbors. There's the lady he calls Ms. Torso, a party girl who has a steady stream of gentlemen callers. There's the couple who live on the top floor who lower their dog in a basket to the garden below. There's Ms. Lonelyhearts, a sad spinster who has dinner with imaginary dates or gets dressed up to go to the restaurant across the street and pretend she's expecting someone. There are the newlyweds who pull the shade and rarely come up for air. There's the frustrated musician whose labor bears no fruit. And there's burly Mr. Thorwald who has an invalid wife and a marriage that seems to consist mainly of tolerance.<br/><br/>The habits of Jeff's neighbors become routine and then one day he notices that Mrs. Thorwald has disappeared. Later that night, he sees Mr. Thorwald wandering in and out of his apartment during a rainstorm. Jeff's curiosity centers on a few vital clues that lead him to believe that this man may have killed his wife. First comes a large suitcase, then the appearance of a saw, then a change in the arrangement of Thorwald's flowerbed.<br/><br/>Jeff's mounting suspicions come only from what he observes from his window. He's in a wheelchair so his visual plane is limited and Hitchcock never allows us to see anything that Jeff can't see. We become participants because Hitch puts us in the wheelchair with him. Close-ups are provided first through a large pair of binoculars, then through Jeff's telephoto lens which allows us to see with clarity. There is no musical score (the only music comes from the musician's apartment) so all of the sounds are natural. This allows the sounds coming from Thorwald's apartment to be muted so that we think we know what we are hearing, but we aren't sure. We strain to listen, to hear some hint of what is being said, but it is to no avail (closed captions don't help).<br/><br/>Jeff's state of immobility is the anchor of the story. Everything that Thorwald does seems to make sense if one just rationalizes it long enough. When he binds a trunk with heavy ropes and then has it picked up, we suspect that it contains his wife's body. When Mrs. Thorwald's purse appears in a window we suspect foul play because what woman would leave it behind? When Jeff's detective friend goes to investigate, he comes back with a very reasonable, rational explanation that punches a hole in all of the evidence. Yet we have been drawn in, and we have invested so much in Jeff's belief that we become a participant ourselves. Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff's gorgeous fiancé, and Stella (Thelma Ritter) his level-headed nurse, at first scold him for peeping on his neighbors but eventually they become participants themselves. They, in a sense, become our point of view, disgusted by what Jeff is doing but eventually curious.<br/><br/>This is a film of limited characters, and one of those characters is the setting itself. It is important that the set feel like an additional character. The courtyard and the building across the way create a feeling of tight, closed-in space. It was a brilliant touch to set the film in the heat of summer so that all those windows are opened so that we get the noise of each apartment and we are able to peer in on each tenant. We can't see the street on the other side, since it is obscured nor can we see the other tenements on Jeff's side of the building. We see only what we need to so the mystery is held in our minds just as it is in Jeff's mind.<br/><br/>Rear Window is Hitchcock at his best, toying with our expectations and then not only giving us what we expect but a great deal more. He is a puppeteer pulling the strings in such a way that the ending doesn't come as a surprise but doesn't come to any false conclusions. The final confrontation with Thorwald is not just tossed into the plot, it is built on everything we've seen before. Hitchcock famously said that he played his audience like a violin and with Rear Window, we like being played."

","Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and psychological warfare and at the top of those elements is Rear Window. Many will call it voyeurism or Peeping Tom...but understand back in the mid 1950's, there was a new movement taking hold, the open, social common garden complexes, apartment buildings. Having your blinds open, lights on was common practice and way of living. In Rear Window you can see this wonderfully, and James Stewart character was more of a people watcher for entertainment. This is when neighbors used to be more social, borrowing the ""cup of sugar"". Having cocktail parties was a way of life much more prevalent than they are today. <br/><br/>It's only when Stewart's suspicions were peaking, of something being wrong, not quite right, did he become a honed in peeping detective, trying to put all the pieces together of where, and what happened to the woman, the victim. Hitchcock was brilliant in giving just enough information to chew on, but not enough to completely solve the case, and you can see this in Stewart's eyes. It may seem odd that it took the villain some time before he glanced across the garden courtyard to spot Stewart eyeing him, but again, this was somewhat more normal behavior back in the 1950's, post WW2 people were much more active, maybe even happier than we are today, busier, unlike today where we sit and watch TV or sit on the computer for hours...blinds drawn. Typical for a Hitchcock film, the colors were vibrant, the cast was neatly dressed, hair perfect, women beautiful...a key trait for a Hitchcock film, and also a signature director's move on his part, the bright, cheerful lighting when the mood was happy and slowly transgressing into darker, moodier lighting when the film becomes more intense and suspenseful. Many viewers will not even notice as it is so gradual, but the effect it has on the viewer is there.<br/><br/>For the money, Alfred Hitchcock was the best, 1 or 2 locations and getting the most out of his cast, no other director was better, so for me, he is at the top."

With each scene you will see what Jeff (Stewart) sees - is it what Jeff suspects or is there another logical explanation for what Jeff and the audience sees - this is where it's fun to guess; to guess simple, logical explanation outside of covering up a murder.<br/><br/>Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best films. I personally found more mystery and suspense in Rear Window than I did watching Vertigo. Yes if you love a good mystery then I highly recommend Rear Window (as well as Vertigo).<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"lowskie6129","9","1","3","24 September 2014"," I see why this movie is a classic with a little bit of everything
","I recently watched the Alfred Hitchcock movie the ""Rear Window"" and after viewing the movie it's clear to see why it is such a classic. The movie is 60 years old and has a little bit of everything in it. I think the main genre in this film is somewhat of a murder mystery. Some of the subgenres that are showcased in the film are a few different romance stories and some comedy going on. For me, the movie started out a little slow because we spend a lot of time getting to know all of the characters in the story. Later on in the movie we find out how each character's and their roles really plays a part in the story line make up of the film. The movie starts out with the director giving us (the audience) a glimpse at the setting of the movie. The camera pans over all the apartments showing us a long shot view into each characters apartment. The story is shown through James's eyes, never leaving his apartment but we meet many people. We meet his girlfriend Lisa, his caretaker Stella and the man that is seen most of the movie playing his piano working on his music. We meet the women that he refers to as ""miss lonely heart"" and ""miss torso."" We also meet a couple with a dog. All of these characters end up being a big part of the story line but we don't know that in the beginning. Alfred Hitchcock did a very good job with the editing and sound use in the film. He used the fade in fade out technique of cinematography in almost every scene witch somewhat helped the movie to feel like it was all one period of time. The music was appropriate as well setting up the different events that were about to take place with different neighbors. This is when he starts seeing some suspicious activity going on in one of the apartment's right across the court yard from James's window. I recently also broke my foot so this movie was very enjoyable for me as I was able to relate. When you have a lot of time on your hands, you'll find yourself finding getting entertainment anywhere you can get it. This movie made me think of the movie Disturbia where Shai Labeouf is on house arrest so has a lot of extra time and notices a lot of strange activity going on at a neighbor's home. He comes to find out that the neighbor is a murderer. The social context of the film show some of the love story that was taking place and shows how crazy things can be going on right next to you and you could be unaware of it. I would recommend this movie but would warn people that it is an older movie so the edits and production is not what we are used to now days. I would give this movie 8.5 out of ten as the beginning dragged a little for me and it ended somewhat quickly but I liked all of the different stories that were pulled in and the advancements that they used in editing for it time."

","When it comes to filmmakers, very few have made as much of an impact as Alfred Hitchcock. He was the Master of Suspense, as he was called. He's influenced filmmakers across the board, from Steven Spielberg, to Christopher Nolan. He's also some of the most famous films ever made and one of them, is Rear Window.<br/><br/>The plot of Rear Window is very simple. Basically, a professional photographer by the name of L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries breaks his leg while getting an action shot at an auto race so he spends all his time observing his neighbors through his rear window and one night, after witnessing some mysterious acts from a man who lives across his apartment, he begins suspecting the man to be a murderer. At first, he tries to warn a detective, but the man doesn't believe him so it's up to Jeff to solve it on his own with his fiancée.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a perfect example of a movie that survives on the strength of the direction. Normally, a film where you watch a guy watching someone through his window would be very boring, but Hitchcock's directing makes for a very witty, entertaining film with a strong intrigue throughout and a very memorable finale.<br/><br/>The first thing that makes Hitch's directing special, is the way he puts us into the perspective of the main character Jeff. The camera in this film rarely ever leaves Jeff's apartment, we see the neighbors just like how the character sees them, through a window. And their dialogue always sounds as though we are REALLY hearing them from such distance by having more echo than the characters'voices in Jeff's apartment. The sound design also makes the neighborhood feel very alive by having numerous sounds in the background at once such as car horns blowing, birds chipping, pianos playing, people singing etc. The sound design also gets SCARY at times when we hear sounds of Thorwald presumably killing his wife. These things are probably not things you'd think about on a first-time viewing, but they help put you into Jeff's perspective perfectly.<br/><br/>But outside of the gimmick of a film being entirely set in one room with a character looking out a window, the film also has a very strong, witty script that keeps the film entertaining from beginning to end. The characters in the film(even the neighbors) all have distinct, memorable personalities that keep the film afloat when it gets talky and the way they bounce off each other is very witty and memorable. The performances, themselves, are excellent. The performance of the actor playing Jeff is very important, because not only is he the audience surrogate, he's also the character whose perspective we see through from beginning to end and yet, Jeff is never BORING. Jeff is always interesting and compelling to watch because James Stewart is just such a likable, charismatic actor. He's funny, he's relatable, you care for him, he's great. Grace Kelly on the other hand, is simply STUNNING as Lisa Freemont, Jeff's fiancée. Her beauty and well, GRACE, perfectly contrasts with Jeff's adventurous attitude. And Thelma Ritter very likable and has excellent chemistry with Jimmy Stewart in the role of Stella, Jeff's nurse. <br/><br/>We also have Judith Evelyn as Miss Torres or, as Jeff likes to call her, Miss Lonelyheart, a sad, lonely woman without a lover. This character doesn't have any lines but Evelyn manages to make her a very sad and sympathetic character without ever saying anything. Lastly, there's the murderer himself, Lars Thorwald, portrayed by Raymond Burr. Thorwald is a villain that really depends on the actor's look. He needs to have an intimidating, scary look to make for a memorable villain. Luckily, Burr pulls off this intimidating look on his face the entire time to make for a scary villain.<br/><br/>The film also has a great, suspenseful climax. It involves Lisa basically sneaking into Thorwald's apartment to find evidence but as she's doing so, Thorwald comes right back to his place. The entire time, you're just BITING your nails in suspense because Jeff is not an action hero. He can't even walk, so we feel just as helpless as he does and we're just hoping that Lisa gets lucky the entire time. Although, there were some silly moments at the end such as Jeff using the flash on his camera to slow down Thorwald from getting to him by temporarily blinding him in the dark each time and the dated fast-forward editing and front projection shot of Jeffrey falling out his window.<br/><br/>But overall, Rear Window is a great film with stylish direction, witty dialogue, memorable characters, and a great, suspenseful climax. 8/10"

"tomcatjak","10","1","3","28 December 2012"," A great movie that sadly, the modern generation will not see.
","First off, hats off to Alfred Hitchcock, he's one of the greatest directors ever. This is certainly one of his masterpieces.<br/><br/>Now for the movie review. This is what a thriller mystery should be like, I look at all of these modern films and with most of them you just don't get that feeling that movies like this give you, the real thrill. <br/><br/>Hitchcock did a great job of not letting the audience in on what was happening and giving a genuine first person view. If you don't know what I am talking about, just look at most of the modern thrillers/horrors. Most of those movies will give little hints as to when a scary part is coming or when the movie is about to climax. As a fan of the cinema, I do not like that. I like to be surprised and this movie did just that. You will not have any more knowledge than the lead protagonist does during the course of the movie. This is important for the development of the mystery.<br/><br/>The setting is quite simple, it's an apartment building. This is perfect, as the main character is in a wheelchair and cannot leave. Therefor the plot has to develop while being in the apartment building. Most of the movie takes place looking out a window. The main character observes his neighbors actions, and well, I'll leave it at that so I don't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, as expected from a Hitchcock movie. There are not many actors, well, not that many that actually talk. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a must watch. Don't let that 1954 year dissuade you from watching, you'll be missing out on a classic."
"roger-pettit1","9","1","3","6 December 2012"," One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best films
","""Rear Window"" is a very good suspense thriller, and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Based on a story by noir writer Cornell Woolrich, it appeals to the voyeur in all of us. Human beings are naturally nosy and inquisitive. And that is the premise on which the film is based. <br/><br/>L.B. Jeffries, known as ""Jeff"", (James Stewart) is a photo journalist who works for a magazine. He is wheelchair-confined in his small, seemingly cramped apartment, recovering from a leg injury sustained while on an assignment. Because he is bored, he spends a great deal of time looking at the goings-on in the block of flats opposite. As a result of what he sees, he begins to suspect that one of the residents of that block may have murdered his bed-ridden wife. He involves his fiancée, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), his carer, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and an old friend from war service, serving police detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) in his suspicions. But are those suspicions the product of an overactive imagination or is there some substance to them? <br/><br/>""Rear Window"" keeps the viewer on tenterhooks right up until its excellent conclusion. It is a riveting and entertaining film with superb performances from its principal actors. It is proof positive that a film does not need high-octane action sequences, expensive special effects, a cast of thousands or breathtaking scenery to keep the viewer's interest. This is a film that is claustrophobic, almost theatrical in nature (""Dial M for Murder"" was apparently based on a stage play; and I can envisage ""Rear Window"" making a successful theatrical transfer, if it hasn't already done so). The direction by Hitchcock is, of course, excellent. <br/><br/>Hitchcock makes his trademark cameo appearance in the film (about 30-40 minutes in), as a guest in one of the apartments opposite Jeff's. Incidentally, Stewart and Kelly each make a very minor error when delivering their lines in two separate scenes (they hesitate slightly and stumble over their words). These are barely noticeable but I am nonetheless surprised that both scenes were not re-shot or, if they were, that the unblemished versions were not inserted into the final version of the film. <br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is a great film. 9/10."
"leifu-wang","8","1","3","15 November 2012"," Rear Window, a story about love
","Rear Window, a story about love<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock had shot many films during his life. It is said, more than one third of his films finally became classics. He was undoubtedly a real master in the field of movie. And the Rear Window, is the brightest pearl on his movie crown.<br/><br/>As is well-known, one of the most notable characteristics of this successful film is the shooting angle. Almost everything that happened in the film was presented in the scenery opposite to Jeffries' window, or inside his room. The director told the story just through our hero's eyes.<br/><br/>Thereupon, some audiences gave out their criticism. Someone claimed that plenty of contents in this film were dispensable. Hitchcock set several attractive plots to cast a mist before audiences' eyes. But at last, those plots seemed unnecessary. The director should not pay too much attention to what happened on the merchant's neighbors. Also, he cared too much about the interaction between Jeffries and Lisa. He would better have his film focus on the murder.<br/><br/>The people who love the film have a different voice. Here is a famous review about Rear Window from a professor of film. 'If you see a movie about murder, you are in first stage; if you see one about peeping, second stage; if you see love, third stage.' In his opinion, the greatest skill of this film is the way Hitchcock expressed his thoughts through the film. He successfully made a large number of different film elements from disorder at the beginning to complete order in the end. Actually, His story is not merely about a murder. He wanted to discuss more.<br/><br/>I agree with the professor. From my point of view, Hitchcock is not only a suspense master, but an outstanding psychologist. He always wanted to probe into human nature and people's mentality. In Rear Window, the murder is just the main clue to keep the audiences concentrate. 'The movie combined the introspection and moral criticism of peeping with marriage issues through a theme of murder.' It seems that the director wanted to put more emphasis on Jeffries' peeping, through which Hitchcock also showed us various states of people's living. And mostly, the film discussed the love between the hero and the heroine.<br/><br/>In the film, Jeffries and Lisa loved each other deeply, but they had big differences in character. Lisa was a favorite in the field of fashion. She wore all kinds of beautiful clothes showing in front of his boyfriend every day, and kept speaking about the interesting news from the world of fashion. She wanted Jeffries to get a more stable job and marry her, living in a big city calmly and respectably. But Jeffries felt uncomfortable with her desire. He was eager for freedom and adventures. Therefore, a marriage with Lisa seemed constraint to him.<br/><br/>Personality conflict is love's enemy. Problems with money or social positions can probably be solved by efforts, but it is hard to force two different people think together.<br/><br/>Fortunately, an accident provided a chance for them to get closer. When Lisa found that what Jeffries told her about the merchant was not merely a fuss, she felt really curious and excited, and threw herself into the investigation actively. During the process of solving this case, both of them realized that adventures and challenges could attract not only Jeffries, but also Lisa. It seemed they could possibly be able to live in a same life style in the future.<br/><br/>But at the end of the film, when everything had come back to peace, the director presented us a last scene: Jeffries, who was still having a rest-cure, dozed off on his bed. On the side sat his girlfriend Lisa, reading books about geography. When she noticed that Jeffries had already fallen to sleep, she put down the book and picked up a fashion magazine. Then she looked much happier than before.<br/><br/>Perhaps the director hoped to express an idea dialectical: it is good for lovers to try hard to get accustomed to the characteristics of the opposite side and look for interests in common. Hopefully they may finally accept each other to a deeper degree through the changes. But we have to understand and keep in mind that, sometimes, differences are always differences. Real changes are not easy to happen.<br/><br/>Hitchcock also extended his discussion from love to marriage. The activities and behaviors of neighbors peeped by Jeffries implied a gradual development of marriage. Ms. Lonely-hearted lived alone and looked extremely unhappy, showing a bad mood of being single; a newly- married couple seemed cheerful so much, closed their window and made love every day; the merchant could not stand his awful marriage any longer, so he killed his wife. People need love. Love turns out to be marriage. Marriage is usually happy at first, but can be a tragedy at last.<br/><br/>The neighbors' lives can be projections of Jeffries'. Other people's failures in marriage may deepen his fear of marrying someone else. How would Jeffries think if he could see that the newly-married couple living in the opposite building changed into continuous quarrels and raised the roof at the end of the film?<br/><br/>Rear Window has too many topics to talk about. It is impossible to discuss everything that Hitchcock wanted to express in it through one article. But in my eyes, it is a story about love."
"jose-cruz53","8","1","3","22 October 2012"," Excellent, much better than 90% of the films made today
","One of the best films by Hitchcock. While I did not love Vertigo and The Birds, this one was exceptional: in contrast to other old films (I define a film as old when it was made before 1977 (Star Wars), since films before that date were slow and ""boring"" while films made after that date tend to be faster and more visceral), it is a quite driving film with a well constructed plot and the director handles very well the overall tension and payoff. It is also more light-handed than later films by the director, such as the quite scary Psycho. <br/><br/>But I found it to be hugely entertaining and I am well prepared to see it again, its much better than 90% of the films made today."
"wanda-larkin","8","1","3","17 October 2012"," Viewing From Afar
","Knowing whether to act out in a dire moment could be a matter of life or death. In the film ""Rear Window"" (1954), the main character, L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) tries to determine if he has witnessed a murder or not. Times like these are where making quick decisions are crucial. The plot of this film introduced itself after a wheelchair bound photographer spots unusual actions going on across from his apartment. During his confined stay in his apartment, L.B. watched the lives of his courtyard neighbors outside of his rear window. What L.B. possibly discovers later is a man murdering his wife. Certain clues keep arising that may lead to a definite murder, but nothing exact can prove the man culpable of murder. Throughout the movie, L.B. uses different resources to find the truth since he is unable to leave his apartment. Once Jefferies finds out the real truth, he could not have been more surprised. The intention that the director (Alfred Hitchcock) was trying to prove was that it was impossible to know everything about someone. L.B. had occasionally seen his neighbors, but did not really stop to think what they were really about. I'm sure he even walked passed them on the street, but never thought what happened behind closed doors in their homes. As soon as L.B. became bound to his apartment due to an accident, he began to learn new things about all of them. <br/><br/>The viewing technique that was unique to this film was the camera L.B. used to watch all of his neighbors with. The majority of the film was viewed through the lens of L.B.'s camera. So in a sense, it was like looking through the eyes of L.B. Jefferies himself. This way of filming is different than the conventional third person view. The idea to film through a first person point of view helped me feel as if I was in L.B Jefferies's position. During the moments where third person filming was re-introduced, it was possible to step back from the movie and look over was transpiring. First person viewing had definitely enhanced the quality of the film."

"Schnayblay","9","1","3","30 July 2012"," One of the Most Intriguing, Unique, and Well Done Murder-Mysteries Ever
","""Rear Window"" is a film I had heard of for a long time. It seemed that life kept pressing me to see this movie. I'd see a poster for this film in the bedrooms of main characters in many other films, just pushing that I had to see it. I saw the semi-remake ""Disturbia"" first and really enjoyed it, but was concerned that I may not like the original because I may just compare it to the Shia LaBeouf version. And finally by luck, I found a copy, so I rented it. And now I see why it's held as such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I can honestly say, from the second I threw on ""Rear Window"", I completely forgot about ""Disturbia""'s existence. The plots are the same in about two aspects, everything else is completely changed. ""Rear Window"" is about Jeffery, who has been confined to a wheelchair for the past several weeks in his apartment. Because of this, he passes his time by watching his neighbours out his window. And after observing a married couple through many fights and the sudden disappearance, Jeffery becomes convinced that the husband murdered his wife. Now, Jeffery must the authority of the crime before the husband can disappear without consequence. It's a very unique premise in which the villain is completely unaware of the hero, with there being no previous personal or political conflict between them, but simply a series of observations that has brought them against each other.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great. Jimmy Stewart leads the film as Jeffery. He is the everyday common man. You believe this guy completely and his performance never seems forced or written. It feels 100% natural and he pulls it off with such class. It's the little things in his character that make him relatable. Like him staring at his hot neighbour despite having a beautiful girlfriend, and making judgements and nicknames for his neighbours who he's never talked to. These little character traits make him likable to everyone and make you care for him.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly plays Lisa, Jeffery's girlfriend. She and Jeffery are polar opposites. Jeffery considers Lisa to be too perfect for him and is into adventure, while she likes shopping and fashion. They're on the verge of breaking up, but as she helps Jeffery try to solve this mystery, her adventurous side comes out and they wind up closer than ever. Funny how that always seems to happen it movies, isn't it? She doesn't seem as natural as Jimmy Stewart, but that doesn't mean she's bad. She still does a good job, and it's fun to watch her go from buying dresses and eating expensive meals to breaking into houses and solving this crime.<br/><br/>No one can talk about this film without mentioning the camera-work. This movie is filled with wonderful cinematography. Long, panning shots across Jeffery's neighbourhood that show all the neighbours activities makes you feel like it's actually full of people, and not just a bunch of shots of small sets cut together to give the illusion of scope. The set was designed in a brilliant way. It's a relatively small set, with all the houses being in apartments connected to each other, and the neighbours always interacting in one way or another. We get familiar with these neighbours quickly, with all them having nicknames based on their personalities and activities.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to say about this movie is the finale. It's no wonder there's a last conflict between Jeffery and the killer. The killer breaks into Jeffery's apartment and is walking up to Jeffery, when Jeffery blinds the killer with a camera flash multiple times. And every time, the killer stops dead in his tracks, takes a second to adjust his eyes back, and takes another step or two and gets blinded. The idiot doesn't even cover his eyes after the second time, he just keeps looking straight into the flash like a dumbass. This really undermines how threatening the villain is, in my opinion, when he's too stupid to cover his damn eyes.<br/><br/>Overall though, ""Rear Window"" is a brilliantly paced, shot, edited, acted, directed and just really well-done film. But I could easily see modern viewers being turned off by its age and its very different concept. Regardless, I highly recommend giving it a watch."
"Magenta_Bob","8","1","3","27 June 2012"," Rear Window
","""We've become a race of Peeping Toms"", Stella (Thelma Ritter) claims in the beginning of the film. Hitchcock's films are often about more than a murder history. In Rear Window, he tackles voyeurism. When our own lives are uneventful, as Jeff's (James Stewart) is due to being confined in his apartment by a broken leg, we turn to others', or to gossip, in order to feel better.<br/><br/>What's interesting about the film is that just like the audience is hoping for some excitement in the neighborhood, so is Jeff. Stella might plant the seed in his mind, by predicting that he will ""see things (he) shouldn't see"". He then invites it himself, by gazing out the window and saying that ""(he'd) welcome trouble"". With the things he observes from his apartment, he then fabricates a murder mystery that he macabrely wishes to be true even when all evidence speaks against it. Even his initially skeptical girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), whose looks and first appearance are like a dream, joins in after a while, maybe as that is a way for her to finally get Jeff's attention. The fact that the theory later turns out to be true, in the twist-less final act that might be more of an anticlimax than a climax as it only confirms what we have suspected since about 40 minutes into the film, should perhaps be taken symbolically rather than literally.<br/><br/>With the apartment complex in Rear Window, Hitchcock has created a wonderful setting resembling a doll house, in which physical windows work just as well as windows into people's lives, or maybe one person's life, as there is sex, violence, loneliness and happiness to be found within the different apartments. Rear Window might not be Hitchcock's most suspenseful or entertaining film, but it is certainly one of his most fascinating."
"Artimidor","9","1","3","16 June 2012"," The ultimate triumph of imagination...
","""Rear Window"" is proof that one can put an actor a whole movie in the same room, even the exact same wheelchair and follow his actions for two hours, and it's still a hell of a ride. Providing we have an actor who can carry the whole film on his own shoulders and tremendous direction. The director in question in this case of course is Alfred Hitchcock and his collaborator as actor is one of his favorite lead regulars, the humble, always likable hero by circumstance, Jimmy Stewart. As far as this minimalism is concerned: The great master of suspense did a very similar thing to ""Rear Windows"" in ""Dial M for Murder"" (also shot in 1954), where one single apartment serves as the focal point for the entire action, and suspense can boil in this closed environment until the lid bursts open.<br/><br/>The vast set (a whole apartment complex plus courtyard!) built for this gem are one of a kind and there's the awe-inspiring beauty of the Technicolor cinematography, which along with the thrilling story, Stewart and Grace Kelly as the indispensable blonde makes this a quintessential Hitchcock film. And this in spite of the voyeurism that is portrayed, rather elegantly though - unlike it was the case with acclaimed director Michael Powell a few years later, whose ""Peeping Tom"" would try to turn the tables and let the murderer be the voyeur, an artistic attempt that practically cost him his career. Hitchcock however appeals to the imagination of the viewer in his film and scores big with this idea. There's no need to break out and leave Stewart's character to show the actual crime, not even in a flashback: It's all right there in front of your eyes, just a thought away."
"hilary-durham","8","1","3","10 June 2012"," Rear Window Review
","The film Rear Window kept me on the edge of my seat nearly the whole time. It made me interested in all these other people's lives by showing brief glimpses of everyone from the rear window's of their apartments. You may get the feeling that Jeff (James Stewart) is kind of peeping tom in the sense that he just sits in his wheelchair all day and watches what his neighbors do, but you have to realize that in a sense, you are doing the same thing as you watch the movie. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat just basically because you never know what is going to happen next. You get to form your own ideas and opinions throughout the movie, because a lot of things happen to make you believe his neighbor killed his wife, but at the same time, Jeff's friend the detective makes you believe that nothing really happened. You never really find out until Jeff's girlfriend is in the neighbors apartment herself, trying to find her own clues. The most pivotal moment in this movie is near the end when Jeff's neighbor is in his apartment. You don't know whether or not he is going to kill Jeff, or if he is going to ask him why he is watching him because you still aren't sure whether or not he killed his wife. In this scene it is dark, the only light is coming from the street lights outside. You can see the outline of his neighbor and of him. You see the man up close as Jeff flashes the light bulb to one of his camera's, as he walks up to Jeff. Jeff is defenseless and alone in his wheelchair and when I found out the neighbors intentions I could feel anxiety and stress, wondering what was going to happen next. That is what I truly loved most about this movie. I love a movie that keeps me guessing, and gets my heart beating a little faster. This movie does all of those things, and it doesn't leave you guessing at the end. You know that the ""bad guy"" goes to jail, the ""good guy"" survives, and you even get to see how his neighbors come together at the end and all seem to be friends and become closer after what has happened. It also shows you how Jeff and his girlfriend become closer. It let's you know what happens in the end, and I love that because it seems that most movies these days leave you guessing and never gives you a picture of what happens next without adding on thirty minutes to the movie. This film could be watched by anyone who likes to watch suspense films. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I hope you do as well.<br/><br/>Sinclair Community College H.D."

","I was never into older movies that much but after seeing 12 angry men and this ,I felt what I had been missing all this time. This was my first movie of Alfred Hitchcock and he truly deserves the fame. The moment the film starts you would never want to leave even for a moment and it will make you predict things all the times. It's like you are actually spying yourself into the lives of people. Another thing was that I was predicting the relation between the protagonist and the girl. Their conversations were like very fine dialogs. The maid seems to provide a different set of acting. At times when I felt that the film I getting too obvious ,I was served with another element. The story and the way it was presented is really commendable. All hail to Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>""A must watch for every film lover. """

","Rear Window, as every other classic masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock, provides a gripping tale of gripping suspense and mystery that can be felt throughout the whole picture. The very gloomy and uncanny atmosphere of this picture adds up to an amazing, and unforgettable overall experience. This is definitely Hitch at his very best.<br/><br/>It is also one of the most memorable roles of the magnificent James Stewart. If I would have to choose only one movie out of the four, on which he collaborated with Hitchcock, I would definitely pick Rear Window.<br/><br/>Stewart plays a journalist named L. B. Jeffries, who is forced to stay at home for a few weeks after an auto race accident. With nothing better to do, he starts observing his neighbors through that eponymous rear window of his cozy apartment. At first it all seems to be just a silly way to pass the time. But as the night falls onto the city, something strange happens right across the yard and 'Jeff' is quickly drawn into a puzzling life-and-death situation. It suddenly became possible that one of his close neighbors, Lars Thorwald, is a killer on the loose and nobody seemed to have noticed it.<br/><br/>In order for the viewer to get acquainted with the characters, the movie opens with a 30-minute easy introduction. As soon as we know the basics the action suddenly starts to take on totally different turn. The viewer gets wound up in the conundrum that leaves the protagonist sleepless.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly is magnificent as Jeff's high-class girlfriend, Lisa Fremont. She's got so much style and glamor, and she proves to be a brave young woman too. There is one great scene, where she has to sneak into the alleged killer's place and find out if all of the murderous assumptions can actually be proved by palpable facts. I know I was cheering so mightily for her to get out, when dangerous Mr. Thorwald was getting closer and closer to his door, ready to catch Lisa right in the act.<br/><br/>Although the whole movie takes place only on one single street, the diversity of presented characters and a deep look into their personal lives (and apartments) account for a picture, which isn't boring even for a minute. In the end we are actually able to distinguish all the people, who live nearby, as every night and day we follow them around along with Jeff's binoculars.<br/><br/>Every true movie fanatic should watch Rear Window, as it is definitely one of the biggest achievements in cinematic craftsmanship. The thrilling script, marvelous acting, great camera shots, and the ubiquitous suspense that won't even let you blink – it's all in here, plus many more.<br/><br/>This film actually got so many rave reviews, that it started a wave of many (better or worse) spin-offs. It influenced such films, as Blow Up, Blow Out, or more recently, Disturbia. This is the true power of a Hitchcockian movie. The themes that it presents are untimely. This is why so many directors tried to copy his style, but it's hard to point out the ones, who were actually close to the true genius of Alfred Hitchcock."

","An everyday man trapped in an out-of-control situation, a cool and sophisticated blonde with a burning flame and a heart-pounding paranoid sensation driving the narrative until a suffocating and suspenseful climax. On the surface, ""Rear Window"" is made of the same usual Hitchcockian ingredients, but the film has a specificity that elevates it above all the other Hitchcock experiences and best exemplifies his brilliance as a director and a storyteller.<br/><br/>The secret of ""Rear Window""'s timeless appeal relies on its self-reflexive approach to whatever defined Hitchcock's style, in the first place, the identification with the hero. Here, we root for L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, not just because he's an ordinary man, but also because he's stuck in a condition similar to us with his leg casted after a car accident. He's still above ordinariness through his job, he's a photographer and from what it seems, quite an adventurer, the very cause of his accident happens to be due to his closeness to a car just to get the perfect shot. His métier, cleverly hinted in the opening scene with the shots on his material and pictures, is the perfect device to justify the presence of binoculars, and sort of redeem Jeffries' voyeurism by translating it into a simple case of job conditioning. But apart from these considerations, it's still not Jeffries the photographer whom we identify with, but Jeffries, the man.<br/><br/>The man can't move, can't wear other clothes than his pajamas, a nice visual touch that makes the film even more memorable, he can't go outside and basically, he's condemned for a seven-week passivity. Therefore, the only area of freedom that is offered to him is to watch his neighbors from the titular window, and discovering their private lives. Hitchcock uses a clever plot device by setting the film in a hot summer week so it justifies why all the windows are open. We discover a beautiful neighborhood setting where each window represents a little vignette of action within a movie, there is Miss Lonelyhearts, the old maid seeking love desperately, Miss Torso, a pretty dancer who invites many guys at parties, a couple of newlyweds, another used to sleep in a balcony and owning a little pet dog, and there are the Thornwalds, the typical constantly-arguing couple. If only for the setting, the film is a remarkable technical and artistic achievement.<br/><br/>Now, ""Rear Window"" doesn't question if watching the neighbors is morally defendable, Hitch is just stating the obvious, if we were put in Jeffries' situation, we would watch, because human nature has a tendency for voyeurism. It kind of reminds me of the French adage that says: 'when I see myself, I feel bad, when I see the others, I feel better'. Jeffries seems to enjoy watching people precisely to reconcile himself with his own condition. It's human and this is where we identify with him, especially when Hitchcock tricks us into admiring the voluptuous body of Miss Torso, or laugh at the couple caught by the rain. We're even more voyeur when we tend not to see what's wrong inside us, and this is the psychological dimension that enriches an already clever script. More than a mystery, ""Rear Window"" acts as an excellent character study and introspection into the mechanism of voyeurism. And the two female characters play a significant part by indirectly mirroring Jeffries' inner weaknesses that we'd notice if we weren't too busy watching what he watches.<br/><br/>The first one is Thelma Ritter as Stella the no-nonsense caregiver who can't understand many of Jeffries' attitudes: why doesn't he marry Lisa, if she loves her? Why is he spending time watching other people, it will only cause trouble (and we know it will). Stella is the common sense of the story, and the reflection of Jeffries' own indecision. Lisa, on the other hand, provides the romantic aspect of the film, which is essential -her entrance with this extraordinary close-up is one of the most beautiful from any film-, Lisa is a fashion designer, elegant and classy, she spoils Jeffries, bringing a whole restaurant to his modest room, but he doesn't share her passion and doesn't feel like she could follow him. They love each other but they can't make up their minds, and while we see them arguing about the way to handle their relationship, we –viewers- experience exactly what Jeffries does every day.<br/><br/>Indeed, Jeffries embodies our own perspective, and the neighbor's windows symbolize what we see on-screen. The film is remarkably told in focal perspective where we're put in the same position than the character, and the directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is particularly attentive to very simple but subtle details. Basically, each important moment of Jeffries' watching is regulated in three times, he sees- we see what he sees and then his reaction (a smile, a surprise, a shock ) betrays his interpretation. A voice-over would have cheated with the concept, now we only see and try to figure out what happened from what he saw. And when Thornwald leaves the house many times during a rainy night, taking saw and ropes, and suddenly his wife isn't here for the next days, anyone can get suspicious. But Hitch also teases us by showing us things that gets unnoticed by Jeffries. We're frustrated because we know something he doesn't and can't do anything, we're powerless, but ironically, so is Jeffries. <br/><br/>And this is where the power of the climax relies, because Jeffries can't do anything, he can't move, he can't even cry for help if he becomes the watched or if he sees his beloved Lisa in danger in Thronswald's house. The suspense here allows us to experiment the viewer's condition on the character and uses the romance to drive the narrative: Lisa becoming a bit of an adventurer and Jeffries starting to put his own troubles and torments into perspective, and learning that any watcher should watch himself first  which of course, applies for us too."

","Imagine a hot summer in New York City in the pre-air conditioned 1950s. Now imagine apartment buildings surrounding a courtyard, all windows open at night, trying to catch any breeze. It's so hot, some put bedding on their fire escapes and sleep outside. Now fill in the blanks between the parts of the residents' lives you've seen through wide open windows and what you no longer see. <br/><br/>Jeff (James Stewart) has all the time in the world to do that; he has to wear a hip-to-toe cast on one leg for 7 weeks, repairing the leg he'd broken in his usual job as a professional action photographer (sports, mountain climbing, wars, etc.). <br/><br/>His visiting nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), daily attends to his basic needs--food, cleaning, etc. Lisa (Grace Kelly) also comes; she's a well paid fashionista exec, in love with Jeff, but their life styles (& incomes) are so different that Jeff is very leery of the marriage she obviously wants.<br/><br/>Jeff, since wearing his cast, won't sleep in bed. He's too taken with his voyeurism, his place by his window watching the various lives unfold in the various apartments within his view and imaginatively filling in the blanks when he can't see them; he sleeps in his wheel chair. He (and we) occasionally see the newly wed couple who often draw their shades despite the heat. And ""Miss Torso,"" a shapely ballet dancer, who practices, practices, practices--and sometimes entertains male friends. ""Miss Lonelyhearts,"" about 35-45, we know fantasies having a man in her life because she practices entertaining an imaginary man at dinners she cooks. There's the musician who keeps trying to write a great song. And a traveling jewelry salesman (Raymond Burr) whose bedridden wife is demanding and never appreciative of his attempts to serve her. When his wife suddenly vanishes and Jeff sees him disposing of a saw and knife, Jeff suspects the worst. <br/><br/>Jeff tries to convince Lisa and his nurse, but they initially think he's going overboard. He also tries with a detective friend (Wendall Corey), his WW-II flying buddy, but with worse results. <br/><br/>Eventually, with several increases in suspense somewhat relieved by humorous bits, all the various narratives are resolved: the salesman and his wife, Miss Torso, Miss Lonelyhearts, the musician---and even Jeff.<br/><br/>The casting couldn't be better. The screenplay artfully makes us, the viewers, along with Jeff, into very similar voyeurs, eager to fill in the same blanks. Immensely satisfying to most (IMDb voters rank it Hitchcock's best; it's an Ebert Great Film; 100% of Rotten Tomatoes critics rate it ""ripe""), it builds suspense throughout but, nicely, lacks any doses of horror that lead to nightmares.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece."
"jackhamel1987","10","1","3","30 August 2011"," The original Big Brother.
","Rear Window was the first Hitchcock film I saw. It packed a tense punch then, and still packs a tense punch now. Whilst I don't think it has the emotional depth that say, Vertigo does, it still remains the greatest example of Hitchcock's ability to take a simple plot and turn it into something much, much deeper.<br/><br/>Rear Window is set in a small New York apartment, where L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) has broken his leg and is wheelchair bound. He is also a totally dedicated photographer, a man willing to further than his competitors for any photo (as is seen in the film on numerous occasions). Having been stuck in his wheelchair for some time, he has taken to watching his neighbours during their daily lives. He is warned by his nurse, Stella (Themla Ritter) that there will be trouble if he continues to watch, and that he should instead focus on his girlfriend, Lisa ""Grace Kelly). Sure enough, he doesn't listen and he's soon drawn into what may or may not be a murder, leading to a hugely tense climax towards the end.<br/><br/>Rear Window strikes me as two things. Firstly, it's a very early example of Big Brother, or another reality TV show that's like it. The neighbourhood is the show, L.B. Jeffries and we are the audience. Together, we sit and watch the neighbourhood, the neighbours. We see the newly married couple and wonder what is happening behind the closed curtains. We see the musician attempting to create a piece of music that will ignite his career. We see the sculptor. We see the beautiful dancer and want more. We see the lonely woman who desperately wants someone in her life - and we enjoy every second of watching these people as Hitchcock carefully sets us up, just as L.B. Jeffries has been set up, to be witnesses to what may or may not be a crime depending how we choose to view the evidence. And then, when we sure a crime has been committed, we can do as much as any man with a broken leg can do - nothing.<br/><br/>Seondly, Read Window is an example of how the power of suggestion can be used to manipulate an audience. Hitchcock is very careful never to show anything - this film is based on suggestion. We know there is a married couple, but we're not sure how their relationship is progressing. We know there is a musician, but we know little of his career. We know there is a lonely women, but we don't know why. We think there has been a murder, but there is no real proof. Hitchcock never shows us anything. He merely uses the power of suggestion.<br/><br/>This truly is a magnificent thriller, and is one of Hitchcock's finest examples. Hitchcock slowly builds the tension right from the start and teases us with glimpses of something horrific. We think something has happened, but we have no proof. We want to know more, but can't because we are as useless as L.B. Jeffries. When the action scenes come, they are some of the most tense in the history of film, yet they are so simply. <br/><br/>To compliment Hitchcock's directing, there is also the hugely talented cast. James Stewart is in every scene of this film, and it's a credit to him that he's able to so effectively pull off this level of acting. In turn, he is supported by the enchanting Grace Kelly and the entertaining Thelma Ritter.<br/><br/>One of the finest examples of thriller, that uses only the power of suggestion and the idea of Big Brother to create so much tension. This shows why Hitchcock was truly the master of suspense - he uses only suggestion to create and idea. We're the ones who then take that idea and expand upon it. If only modern slasher thrillers built up suspense like this does. <br/><br/>For those who enjoy this film, I'd also recommend Hitchcock's ""Rope"", which could be viewed as a twin of this - except it's set in the murderer's apartment instead."

","This movie will steadily increase your excitement to keep you on the edge of seat and at last what a thrill.. Don't miss this movie, if you want to see a thriller movie. Alfred Hitchcock is a master for thriller films. James stewart acting is impressive. Easily one of the best triller film and one of my all time favorite movie. Choreography is astonishing. Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense. As much as the story is interesting, so is the way it is told. Nearly all shots start out from Jeffrie's apartment, and there is tremendous detail paid to the characters that really don't have anything to do with the murder. Really, when you think about it, Hitchcock tells two stories here; the murder mystery and the lives of others amidst this hot and steamy week in New York. It is an eyeful and takes more than one viewing to get it all, but it is well-made enough that it is never boring and the last twenty minutes will still thrill you, even though you're being a voyeur."
"Eternality","10","1","3","20 May 2011"," A groundbreaking film study on the theme of voyeurism.
","Even though I consider Vertigo (1958) to be the greatest Alfred Hitchcock picture of all time, Rear Window remains to be my personal favorite. In the complete oeuvre of Hitchcock, Rear Window firmly occupies the very top shelf, together with such classics as the aforementioned Vertigo, North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960). It is a great film, not only from a critical standpoint but also from the audience's point-of-view. For a 1950s picture, it has not dated one bit, and offers an excellent introspective night's entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>A groundbreaking film study on the theme of voyeurism, Rear Window has no equal. Even its contemporary remake, Disturbia (2007), isn't even a third as good and is an insult to what Hitchcock originally planned to achieve with this picture. Starring the legendary James Stewart as Jeff, a wheelchair bound photojournalist who met with an accident but is only a week from full recovery, and the elegant Grace Kelly as Lisa, Jeff's fiancée who slowly becomes involved in one of the most intriguing plots ever written, Rear Window is a brilliant concoction of drama, suspense, and dark humor.<br/><br/>This being a Hitchcock picture, there would certainly be a crime involved, or so we thought. Jeff thinks that one of his neighbors might have murdered and cut up his invalid wife. His detective friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), however thinks that Jeff is delusional. At this juncture, we are in doubt, yet this draws us further into the film. Later, Lisa and Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeff's personal nurse, become convinced of the possibility of such a heinous crime happening when their observations point to the suspect as a murderer.<br/><br/>Written by John Michael Hayes (To Catch a Thief, 1955; The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956), the screenplay takes its time to develop the protagonist who spends nearly the entire film immobile in a wheelchair. Jeff's immobility would become a plot device in the climax, which even by Hitchcock standards, is extremely tense. A particular phone call seemingly sucks the air out of the picture, conveying a deep sense of dread and inevitability that is to come. Moreover, the use of ambient sounds as part of the film's mise-en-scene, as well as to dictate the level of suspense is masterfully done.<br/><br/>Supporting characters are seen through the voyeuristic eyes of Jeff, and they are developed objectively through the lens of the camera. We sympathize with Ms. Lonelyhearts who longs for a man to love her, smile at Ms. Torso who flaunts her athletic body with graceful stretching motions, and observe with some degree of comic distance the rest of the folks in their apartments doing their private business. The capturing of the ignorance of these characters towards a possible murder committed in front of their eyes marks one of the screenplay's high points. In one scene, a dead dog is found. Its owners are devastated but for the rest, life goes on without sympathy. Are we not the same?<br/><br/>For its time, Rear Window is remarkably advanced from a technical standpoint. The cinematography by Robert Burks brilliantly captures exterior and interior shots in single takes without problems arising from differences due to the exposure of light. The transition is so smooth that it is impossible to tell when natural or artificial light is used in these shots. Burks' camera-work makes us willing participants in the spying game, drawing us into the sinister world of Hitchcockian terror. Like David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986), Rear Window explores the concealment of Man's hideous nature under the façade of seeming normalcy. It takes a keen eye to see what's wrong underneath all the pleasantries.<br/><br/>Rear Window is not only a masterpiece of film direction and screen writing, but also an influential force that continues to inspire contemporary filmmakers to deal with the issues of privacy, intrusion, and paranoia in the modern world. One of the best examples would be Michael Haneke's Cache (2005), with its dramatic treatment of the ethics of video surveillance a cinematic offshoot of Hitchcock's work. Rear Window is one of the greatest films of all time, and with each repeated viewing, its thematic elements not only become more salient in the world we live in, but also increasingly unsettling.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+ (10/10 or 5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"andrejvasiljevic","10","1","3","25 April 2011"," Timeless
","So much is Right about Hitchcock's movies. This refers not only to ""Rear Window"", but most of this brilliant director's work. Te question is, how did he make it so perfect? How do 2 hours get so compact and timeless? Well, the answer lies in everything Hitchcock does, and believe me, not one single thing in his movies comes without a reason.<br/><br/>First and the most obvious part of Hitchcock magic is the story. Crime has ever been an interesting subject for the big screen, but in ""Rear Window"" it gets a new dimension that exceeds it's violent nature and evolves into a social and philosophical problem. Naturally, unlike today, 60 years a go murder was not an acceptable category, thus making it more dramatic. And you undoubtedly get a lot more drama and suspense in ""Rear Window"" than in any of today's sludgy TV contents of the CSI kind. The story does not only revolve around the murder itself, yet it involves tho whole surrounding micro cosmos, and which is most important, the people.<br/><br/>This brings us to the cast members and their brilliant role in ""Rear Window"". Just as ever, Hitchcock knew how to pick the right people for the job. Needless to say that Grace Kelly and James Stewart did a brilliant job. Besides the tension which surrounds the crime, we also get to see the full aspect of a relationship between two major characters which evolves throughout the storyline. One thing is for sure, Alfred sure did have a good taste for women, and man do I envy him...<br/><br/>Finally, the technical aspect of ""Rear Window"" tops it off and seals this masterpiece in a package of perfection. Each frame, each shot, every single detail on the set is adjusted towards perfection. I heard somewhere that all the residue material, after the master editing, was able to fit on a single roll of film... that's simply amazing. If I ever become a true film director (since I'm an amateur one, for the time being), my only wish would be to closely match Hitchcock's skill, since reaching his level of perfection fits in the domain of impossible. 10 points is way to little for ""Rear Window""."
"ilpohirvonen","10","1","3","28 February 2011"," A Macabre and Perverse Picture of Marriage
","""I always say that Shadow of a Doubt is my favorite but I am very proud of Rear Window."" (Alfred Hitchcock)<br/><br/>In 1954 Alfred Hitchcock was at the top of his career. He had gained a reputation that can only be compared with a handful of others. He had the continuous need to regenerate, to find something fresh and new which can be seen everywhere in Rear Window; in its setting, movement of the camera, tricks and colors. It is an unusual film and doesn't have any flaws nor defects. Hitchcock had the challenge to make a film set in one room, and to show the story from only one perspective. Each shot was a risk taken, and as usually the risks taken by Hitchcock gave a lot in return. The film is a brilliant mixture of comedy, romance and excitement. It portrays the American idyll with its shadows. Rear Window is a perverse study of our society, and it's surprisingly dark, pessimistic if I may say. The impossibility of happiness, the agony caused by performance pressures and marriage, are the main themes of it. One critic even called it a horrible film because the hero spent all of his time peeping out of the window; to which Hitchcock replied: ""What's so horrible about that? Sure, he's a snooper, but aren't we all?""<br/><br/>A photographer L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) has broke his leg and is condemned to the wheelchair. To spend his leisure time he spies his neighbors and, one day is convinced that one man has murdered his wife. The film is a criminal investigation done by Jeff apart from his moving disability. But we must not forget his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), who wants to get married with him and plays an essential part in this investigation with his feminine intuition.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a clear film for its world view which is quite hard to see during the first viewing. Marriage is the main subject of the film, it is its leading theme and everything wraps around it; the nagging wife of the neighbor, Jeff's friend's wife, Jeff's nurse Stella and Jeff's possible wife-to-be Lisa Fremont. The quintessential realization of the film is that Jeff doesn't want to marry Lisa but just about everything around the yard reminds him of marriage: lonely woman without husband or lover, a couple who make love all day, bachelor composer who drinks, the little dancer whom all the men are after, childless couple who dote their life on the dog and of course the married couple who are always at each other's throats, until the wife mysteriously disappears. <br/><br/>Then there's the wedding ring with a double-meaning which exposes the murderer; because if he hadn't murdered his wife and his wife would be out of town, she would've taken her wedding ring with her. As Lisa (Grace Kelly) goes to search the ring from the murderer's apartment, she finds it and puts the ring into her own finger and secretly waves back to Jeff. She got a double win: she got the evidence but, who knows, maybe this ring on her finger will inspire Jeff to ask her to marry him? What an ironic touch. <br/><br/>Surrounded by marriage, Jeff obviously gets anguished. This agony caused by performance pressures and marriage, makes him a peeping tom: ""We've become a race of peeping toms,"" as Stella puts it. This, of course, not only indicates to the character of James Stewart but also to all of us -- to our society. Alfred Hitchcock often let's or forces his viewers to be peeping toms in his films, Psycho for example, but in Rear Window this theme is at its most intelligent. This reinforces the idea that the film is a study of marriage and society, it portrays an anguished man for whom voyeurism is the only form of sexuality he is capable of. But also that the film is a study about the ethics of watching and peeping: the window-motive is the screen, it's a film about watching films. <br/><br/>An important observation is also that Jeff only spies his neighbors at their most ridiculous, he doesn't like to watch their happiest moments. He gets entertainment, and pleasure, for watching them getting wet, talking to their imagery friends, nagging to their husbands and getting drunk. Rear Window is actually a cruel, and quite perverse, film. But it's brilliant, a masterpiece, who else had noticed this before Hitchcock. And it's not a thing to be ashamed of, it's just a humane part of us all. If the yard is the world, then Rear Window is also a film about isolation: the small apartments of the characters represent small private jails which they have built for themselves. The scene where the dog gets killed is an excellent example how people are unable to rely on each other let alone help their neighbors.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a macabre picture of marriage. In the end the lonely composer and the woman find each other, perhaps start a life together, but nothing actually indicates that Jeff and Lisa would get married. Lisa is reading a traveling book 'Beyond the High Himalayas' to prove that she is ready to start an international life with a report-photographer. But as soon as Jeff averts his eyes she changes the book to a fashion magazine. What a cruel solution! French critic and filmmaker François Truffaut even said that the film's world view was close to misantrophy.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a ruthless film about the agony caused by marriage, society and sexuality. It's easy to see as a cruel pessimistic film about the impossibility of happiness, but the overall mood of it is, paradoxically, warm, humane and compassionate. The yard is a picture of the world; full of people from all walks of life, small stories and all kinds of behavior. ""Rear Window is a symphony of everyday life and shattered dreams."" (François Truffaut)"

Made by Alfred Hitchcock, which is another reason to watch it, it is proof that Hitchcock really was a master of suspense. The movie builds it slowly on a subtle psychological level, but when it really counts it is impossible not to watch.<br/><br/>The story is masterfully told, threaded through a complex weave, with small hints and clues presented constantly. But their meaning is not instantly clear, so you have to keep watching to get their real meaning. And so the suspense builds, until Jeffries has involved everyone close to him, whom all was very skeptical at first, until the very end. What also makes it so interesting is the hints ambiguity. The story could turn in two directions, right up to the end, and those directions are truly opposite. Is Mr. Thorwald an murderer, or is he just a victim of his neighbors paranoid mind ghosts. Either end is plausible, until which one is right is revealed.<br/><br/>The acting of the cast is an integral part of the movies success. Stewart must convey that he is convinced, with his supporting actors contributing with the doubts but slowly coming around to his point of view. Stewart is very good at this, and it is also very easy to see how Grace Kelly came to be so popular. Such beauty with such talent is memorable. And it is also easy to understand why Thelma Ritter got so many nominations as best supporting actress (but unfortunately never won). The acting of those three, combined with Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr under the supervision of Hitchcock is really the main reason why the story is so captivating.<br/><br/>Albeit not so apparent in the movie and not so essential for the story, the ambition with the sets and setting of lights and placement of cameras is impressive. It is just good craftsmanship.<br/><br/>8/10"

"bobsgrock","9","1","3","22 May 2009"," A journey through the lens of a voyeur.
","We all have been on the receiving end of being a voyeur once in our life. There are times in our childhood, I am sure, when we spied on someone whether it was our parents, siblings or neighbors. As humans, we have the compelling feeling to be nosy and try to find out about business that is none of ours whatsoever. Alfred Hitchcock knew this feeling, so much so that he knew he could make a murder mystery out of it. Here, L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) represents all of us, unable to be satisfied with our own lives, so we pry into the lives of others. Unfortunately for him, he is also stuck with a cast for a broken leg, and is so bored with his current situation, he takes his overactive imagination and comes to the conclusion that one of his neighbors has committed murder.<br/><br/>A set-up that has inspired many movies since then, Rear Window is one of the finest achievements of Hitchcock as well as an interesting and compelling thriller that really has more of a lack of thrills. But, like many Hitchcock films, it is the possibility of what might happen that keeps us in tune as well as the reason Jeffries stays involved. Nearly all of Hitchcock's heroes have an obsession, whether it is with a woman, clearing their name or trying to solve a murder, they do not let up but continue on until they either fail or succeed.<br/><br/>I believe Hitchcock is also saying something about the balance of interest between our own lives and how much we should have in others. Jeffries is obsessed with bringing a possible murderer to justice, but he also tends to ignore those closest to him, his girlfriend Lisa (the beautiful and flawless Grace Kelly) as well as return to his job as a photographer. This voyeurism will put him in serious harm's way, but for him it is worth it to get some excitement into his life.<br/><br/>As much as the story is interesting, so is the way it is told. Nearly all shots start out from Jeffrie's apartment, and there is tremendous detail paid to the characters that really don't have anything to do with the murder. Really, when you think about it, Hitchcock tells two stories here; the murder mystery and the lives of others amidst this hot and steamy week in New York. It is an eyeful and takes more than one viewing to get it all, but it is well-made enough that it is never boring and the last twenty minutes will still thrill you, even though you're being a voyeur."

","No one should make a remake of this movie unless they have the proper cast, great director, great producers, a setting just like the original movie and not like the remake with Christopher Reeve. Raymond Burr gave a performance of a lifetime and put people through suspense every minute you watched him. This movie intrigues you so much that once you start watching it, you can not take your eyes off it. This movie should not be classified as horror but it gives the real meaning of THRILLER. James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr give you the time of your life as you witness what it is like to spend your whole day through your rear window."

Everything from camera-work to editing in each and every scene is simply brilliant. Also the acting is great, not only by Stewart, but down to every supporting character. However, what really annoyed me and what kept me from giving a top-notch vote is the script.<br/><br/>Not far into the movie we are made to believe that the neighbour killed his wife.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","14 August 2008"," Suspended between window and yard
","This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden: at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening: we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it: a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"jaredmobarak","10","1","3","1 December 2007"," Call it female intuitionRear Window
","After seeing Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window for the second time, I am even more convinced that the broo-haha surrounding Disturbia and its ripping it off was uncalled for. Besides the premise of a person confined to their window, seeing what they think is a murder, the two could not be anymore different. This film is one that will never age, whether it story, acting, or sheer inventiveness in its execution. Only Hitchcock could build the suspense as high as he does for almost two hours never leaving one room the entire time. Our hero is in a full leg cast and a prisoner to his room and window. Besides that interior, everything else we see is from his vantage point across to the rest of the apartment complex and a sliver of space opening to the street beyond. A clinic or choreography and showing us only what we need to know, Rear Window leaves you guessing right up until the final scene, unaware of what the whole truth to the situation is.<br/><br/>Technically, the film has no flaws. Its utilization of a pivoting camera that pans left to right out L.B. Jefferies apartment is one-of-a-kind. With only the zooms from his camera lens and binoculars, we are allowed to see everything he does, letting us as the audience come to our own conclusions as well as become a part of his. This is a slow burn of a story, revealing each new discovery as though the layers of an onion peeled away. The sheer amount of rehearsals must have been staggering. There are plenty of long takes that go from window to window, catching the precise moment of activity we need in order to continue the story. Each actor had to be able to hit their mark at the exact moment necessary; timed to perfection. It is a joy to think about the work that went into the film every time we are shown characters moving from room to room, stopping at each window for our benefit, yet never feeling unnatural. Full credit goes to the cinematographer for orchestrating it all.<br/><br/>The premise and craft are not the only things going for it. Acting-wise, there is not one misstep. James Stewart truly was the greatest actor of his generation. His delivery is uncanny and he can go from serious drama to light comedy without a blink. There is a lot of heavy emotional tension between him and his girlfriend that is treated with the same amount of care every other plot thread is. His relationship with Lisa Fremont, the gorgeous Grace Kelly, is mirrored in that of the quarrels and love trysts happening all around him. Without the murder mystery and the peeping into the lives of other couples, they may end up breaking up forever. His middle-class upbringing and photojournalist lifestyle just doesn't match well with her patrician ways and necessity of wearing a dress only once to keep appearances up for her job. The two could not be anymore different except for the fact they are madly in love with the other.<br/><br/>Kelly is not just a pretty face either. Her performance is realistic at all times, keeping up with Stewart's sarcastic wit and playing the girlfriend being spurned all while slowly becoming engrossed in the story of the Thorwalds across the way. She becomes a photojournalist herself in many ways, looking through the camera and coming to conclusions for what the story may entail. In opposition to this, Stewart morphs into that which he thinks can never change in his love, her ability to stay on the fringe while others do the hard labor. Many times towards the end, he is the one left to watch others risk their safety for his manifested theories. He himself is the helpless being unable to go into the trenches, but instead prepare everything for the others to carry out. Whether Thorwald killed his wife or she has taken a train to visit family, the hold the mystery has on them finally shows the two what the other goes through and their respect for the other blossoms to become as strong as their love.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the complete achievement, however, is the levity infused at all times. Sure the subject matter is very seriousI wouldn't be surprised if it was at first created to be a commentary on the Red Scare and worrying about what your neighbors could be up tobut at every turn we get witty banter helping to alleviate the tension and give us viewers a breather. Stewart and Kelly are quite the team and they perform the words of John Michael Hayes' script with ease. The timing is superb and many of the best lines are mixed into the dramatic dialogue always breaking up the suspense. We aren't talking gags and jokes, but instead puns and sly shots taken as a result of the conversations at hand. This is one smart script and I find myself even more interested in seeing The Man Who Knew Too Muchthe second version Hitchcock directedto see how well the team does, joined together again."
"ShootingShark","7","1","3","12 June 2007"," Brilliant, Voyeuristic, Minimalistic, Darkly Humorous Murder Thriller
","Photo-journalist L.B. Jefferies is recovering from a broken leg. Bored, he spends his time looking out his apartment window at the neighbours, and begins to suspect the salesman across the way of murdering his wife. Is he imagining things, or is there some foul play ?<br/><br/>As with so many of Hitchcock's films, this is a wonderful example of how to take an almost absurdly simple idea and spin out the maximum tension, character, humour and drama from it. It should be boring (a movie set in one room with a guy who can't move) and ludicrous (a killer who murders his wife and chops her up in front of his neighbours) but it's quite the opposite - riveting and eerily plausible. If ever there was a film about voyeurism and its relationship to cinema, this is it; Hitchcock tells engrossing little silent movies of the tenants (the newlyweds, the sculptress, Miss Torso, the dog-owners, the killer, the songwriter, Miss Lonelyhearts) without ever cheating and cutting to closeups of them - we see them all remotely, from Stewart's detached and aloof point of view. It's a masterpiece of editing, which builds and builds into a nail-biting final reel, with our hero sitting helplessly alone in the dark while the killer closes in. Stewart is wonderful as always as the sardonic prisoner, and is the only leading man not to fawn over Kelly, resulting in her best performance, while Ritter steals the show as Stewart's wisecracking nurse. Equally fabulous is the production design - contrary to appearances, the whole backyard neighbourhood was a very elaborate set on the Paramount backlot, one of the most memorable in any movie. An extremely influential picture, particularly on the career of Brian DePalma (see Body Double), with the helpless-witness motif appearing in many fine subsequent thrillers (Wait Until Dark, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, Panic Room, etc), and a watershed of stylish, intelligent direction. Remade for TV by ABC in 1998 with Christopher Reeve in the lead. Based on a short story by Cornell Woolrich and deftly scripted by John Michael Hayes, who wrote Hitch's three subsequent films (notably the sublime The Trouble With Harry). Hitchcock appears in his standard cameo as the guy winding the clock in the songwriter's loft."

","Rear window is one of the best movies ever made. Jeffries a photographer that broke his leg starts looking out of his window to pass the time, after a while he starts to notice some odd happenings throughout one of his neighbors that lead him to the conclusion of murder. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very end constantly wondering what happens next. This is by far one of director Alfred Hitchcocks greatest work and helps justify the saying that he is the master of suspense. The acting is perfect and character creation is flawless. One flaw might be that people nowadays might not enjoy it as much because the film is not as fast paced as the movies today. although it may not stand up to the hype of films now it has a perfect story which the movies nowadays cannot seem to create. I greatly suggest watching rear window it deserves more than it ever got."
"Doylenf","8","1","3","26 August 2006"," In a world where nobody ever heard of window blinds...
","While I thoroughly enjoyed REAR WINDOW and think it's among Hitch's best films, I always observe how easy it was for Stewart's character to view the lives around him. It seems that nobody in the entire neighborhood ever heard of keeping curtains or window blinds in more discreet positions. We are forced to believe that all of these people leave their windows totally exposed to the naked eye even though they face an apartment building not more than fifty feet away, and even when scantily clad or seeking a romantic rendezvous.<br/><br/>Of course, little do they suspect that a wheelchair-bound photographer is stalking them through his binoculars and keeping tabs on their everyday quirks and foibles. This is where the story taps into the psyche of the main character, brilliantly played by JAMES STEWART.<br/><br/>He gets excellent support from a first-rate cast, although I think GRACE KELLY was a bit arch as his female companion. However, it's RAYMOND BURR (as a man Stewart suspects has killed his wife), JUDITH EVELYN (as ""Miss Lonelyhearts""), WENDELL COREY (as a skeptical detective), and most of all, THELMA RITTER as a wise-cracking nurse, who really stir things up.<br/><br/>Hitchcock shows complete control of his camera, forcing us to view everything just the way Stewart sees things and focusing our attention where it ought to be through the development of the story, which is loosely based on a Cornel Woolrich short story.<br/><br/>It's the kind of film where you have to be watching and on the alert all the time so as not to miss anything.<br/><br/>Highly satisfying and typically good Hitchcock suspense that builds to a tense stand-off at the climax."
"JuguAbraham","7","1","3","17 April 2006"," Precursor to ""Dekalog 6"" and ""Cache""
","After my third viewing of the film over a span of 20 odd years, I went beyond appreciating the cinematic challenges that Hitchcock sets for himself to overcome. For instance, I was not appreciating that this film is one of the rare instances in cinema where all the sounds are ""diegetic"" recorded on the soundtrack.are sounds from within the visual world captured by the camera. After the earlier viewings, I was no longer intrigued by the amoral perspective of the voyeur, represented by L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), the good, average American bachelor with a robust, modest, creative career and a rich doting girl friend, Lisa, trying to rope him into marriage. No longer was blending of the viewer's perspective and that of Jefferies' perspective a major feat of Hitchcock.<br/><br/>My third viewing threw up new perspectives of the film because I had now got to see over 20 Hitchcock films.<br/><br/>First, ""Rear window"" is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where women emerge smarter and stronger than menthe last scene has the hero with two legs in a cast and his lady love switching reading material to what she prefers to read over what the hero would prefer her to read, even though for the first time she has switched to trousers to humor her future husband's vision of his kind of wife. Similar ends were obvious in ""Family Plot,"" ""Spellbound,"" ""Rebecca"" and, by inference of the final choice, in ""Marnie."" The final shot in ""Rear window"" is a sexual reversal of the final shot of ""Mr and Mrs Smith."" <br/><br/>Second, ""Rear window"" is yet another film on marriagea recurring theme in Hitchcock's films. Jefferies and Lisa do not tie the knot but the end inferred this would eventually happen. But the switching of the reading material gives the viewer a clue who among the duo would rule the marriage. In another perspective on marriage, within the film a husband kills his wife. A wedding ring is stolen of all objects. Other perspectives in the film reflect on the sex in marriage and another looks at a woman dreaming of a virtual husband, a dream to which Jefferies involuntarily raises his own glass! <br/><br/>Third, this is a film on photographers, photography and voyeurs. Only the photographer looks out of the window, when all have windows open, except when a dog or housebreak is involved. Many years after Hitchcock made the film, the Polish director Krystof Kiesolwski in his ""Dekalog no. 6"" explored the same theme with astonishing results. Recently, Austrian filmmaker Michael Hanneke's ""Cache"" presented videos of an anonymous voyeur as the pivotal essay on racial interaction. All the three films infer that the crime is in watching other people commit crime. The watcher and the watched emerge as flip sides of an individual or alter egos."
"smvlowrider64","10","1","3","15 March 2006"," Rear Window: A True Classic
","I always loved Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", so when i found out we would be watching ""Rear Window"" in my college film class i was excited. Surprisingly i didn't know much about the film, and had never seen it before. It is so much fun to watch a classic for the first time. The movie is so full of suspense it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.<br/><br/>When ""Jeff"" (James Stewart) continually spies on his neighbor believing him to be a murderer, the plot thickens. I love mysteries, and i wasn't sure throughout the movie if i also believed there had been a murder, or if i thought maybe ""Jeff"" was just paranoid. Hitchcock uses great elements to build the suspense, such as POV (Point of View) shots that really make you feel for the protagonist. He is seemingly helpless stuck in that wheelchair of his. I also loved how Hitchcock not only included the story of the upstairs neighbor, but also of many other neighbors surrounding the courtyard. Downstairs, Miss Lonely Hearts was also an object of ""Jeff""s voyeurism.<br/><br/>This film was interesting for 1954, an era when peeping tom's were not accepted, much less as the ""hero."" It broke down barriers by showing women ""spending the night"", and dancing around in their underthings. This film has definitely become a new favorite of mine, and i would recommend it to any movie-buff's out there that haven't yet seen it."

","Murder is not one of the words that comes to mind when the talking about a neighborhood. A neighborhood is supposed to be a secure, warm, and inviting place that a person can come to after a hard days work and know everything will be alright. In the world of Alfred Hitchcock, it's everything but.<br/><br/>Rear Window is the story of L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), a photographer who is currently incapacitated due to a broken leg. He must stay at home and wait until it fully heals to get back out into the world. The only pleasures he has is talking to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), spending time with his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), and looking out his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex.<br/><br/>Even though Jeffries can be considered a ""peeping Tom"", his motives are simply out of boredom and curiosity. All he has are the lives of the other tenants and watching them play out. There is the dancer he dubs Miss Torso. There is also the ever depressing Miss Lonelyheart. The Songwriter and the Newlyweds also live their lives outside Jeffries window. The apartment that particularly catches his attention belongs to that of Lars Thorwald. He suspects that he has killed his wife.<br/><br/>All of his accusations are simply based on what he sees, not what he hears. Stella and Lisa both think he is crazy and should stop snooping before it consumes him entirely. Before long he has his friend Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) investigate what is going on over at Thorwald's apartment. The stage is set for a thrill ride through a pair of binoculars.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's use of the camera is some of the most creative to date. Almost the entire movie is filmed in Jeffries's apartment. TO make the shots look like what Jeffries is seeing through the binoculars. This same type of shot is used in Roman Polanski's Chinatown. It's an excellent first person perspective. It gives a more realistic quality, like someone could actually be seeing this.<br/><br/>Hitchcock also uses a lot of sounds that would be heard in an urban area. The sounds of the street, the other tenants, and what elements of nature remain. The music is used to enhance a shot or a feeling that is trying to be given off.<br/><br/>Stewart and Kelly's performances are mirror images of what a couple would be like. They fight, love, and go through the motions of just everyday life. As Stewart's character gets more and more involved with what is going on, so do the other characters. Their mood changes from concerned for Stewart to concerned for Thorwald's wife. <br/><br/>This film takes a real setting, real people, in an extraordinary situation. Invasion of a person's privacy working towards the common good is a very peculiar subject to be shown, but Rear Window does it. It's a roller coaster of emotions where the suspense is enough to lift a person out of their seat. Each frame more engaging than the previous. Hitchcock proves that a fascinating story and a little imagination can go a long way."

God creates Hitchcock, who creates Jeff, who creates his story.<br/><br/>Along the way there are various comments being made about film-making. The camera Jeff uses to get a better look. Also, the very tools of the trade are compartmentalized, each given a ""window"" to be viewed through. One window for the score, one for the choreography, etc.<br/><br/>But the thing that sets this film apart is the way the audience is pulled into the experience. The dark, comfortable theater is actually Jeff's apartment, a notion that remains consistent throughout. That is, until the end when we are thrown out of our ""window"" and into the film itself.

What follows is a buildup which is Hitchcock all the way. Nobody builds suspense like him, and even though I was disappointed by the ending because I was kind of hoping for more of a twist, it's still pretty powerful. I highly recommend. It was pretty obvious to me that Hitchcock didn't write the screenplay, and I kind of wish he had, although what we have is still one of the best ever written. Highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>9/10"

","One of the most famous movies by Hitch was Rear Window, starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly (who shined on the screen of my TV--I can't imagine how she looked on the big screen).<br/><br/>Stewart stars as a war photographer that is confined to a wheelchair because of a broken leg or hip. The only thing to do in 1954 was to watch the neighbors through the windows. The multiple levels of voyeurism are amazing in this movie, especially noticeable after several viewings (I think I have watched this four or five times). Stewart sees a microcosm of different points of his own life as he watches Miss Torso, the happy-go-lucky gal with a million gentlemen callers, Miss Lonelyhearts, who is apparently becoming an old maid, the Wedding Couple, with their wedded bliss, and the married couple and the arguments that they are apparently facing. Stewart watches people for his job, in a movie where we the viewers are watching somebody watch others. It's enough to make anyone think they are seeing things.<br/><br/>Stewart thinks something is fishy with the married couple when the woman seems to disappear into thin air. His deductive skills are on the move and he thinks there is foul play. Or is there? The amazing part of a movie with only one set is how deep it can actually be. It doesn't have to take place all over New York or the world. This seemingly simple man is thrust into a dire situation, and that is Hitchcock's trademark. Danger may lurk in your own backyard. Will you be up to the challenge? I wonder how many false alarms were made in the mid-1950s by other apartment dwellers because of this movie? How many today? This movie receives my highest possible recommendation."

","Just finished watching Rear Window and it was fantastic. The film was refreshing compared to most of the new movies and it was good to watch a film worthy of being included in the saying: ""they don't make movies like they used to."" I was enormously entertained and it was very suspenseful. It did seem like the ending was going to have a big twist, but I don't think a lack of one really detracted from the movie as a whole. This is really Grace Kelley and James Stewart at some of their finest work. The entire set was so well put together that it was like being in a dream in that it was real, yet it was noticeably different and strange to the viewer."

","I have seen that this film has been given some bad reviews recently but people are forgetting the year 1954. I have read others reviews that state that the story is predictable but that is now in 1954 people would have been glued to the screen with suspense as this was original at one time but it has been copied over and over again in many different ways since, and others have said it's just plain boring but again you have to remember the era in which it was made and i still do think that the story is not boring as it had me on the edge of my seat with suspense even though it is slow paced this film has not been given enough credit. No violence, no sex, no cursing, modern viewer is drowning I read this is ridiculous it is a PG rated film and there is no need for any swearing, sex or violence it is a great film in the way it does not need any of these to make it good."

","""Rear Window"" is, as ""Rope"" was, a study of setting a story in a confined place. ""Rope is notable for the smallness of its set; one studio apartment, rarely leaving the main living, and edited in such a way as to appear as one continuous take. ""Rear Window"" is famous for just the opposite; it had a giant set, occupying he biggest studio on the lot, with and extra level excavated to provide a life-sized, four-story set. Hitchcock also uses many more cuts, using the shot-reaction-shot technique with L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) as he uses cameras and binoculars to observe the goings on outside the rear widow of his apartment.<br/><br/>The main theme of ""Rear Window is privacy  how far those standards extend, and what people do when they think they are secure in the privacy of their own home. Jeffries, a magazine photographer trapped in his apartment with a broken leg, turns to the view out his window to while away the hours until his cast comes off. His only contact with the outside world arrives in the form of his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and female friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), a rich socialite who has a romantic interest in Jeffries (who seems to abandon his photographer skills as an observer when it comes to her).<br/><br/>Hitchcock played with audiences by having them play the role of voyeur along with Jeffries  he knew that human nature compels us to keep staring, even when polite society tells us to look away and mind our own business. By capturing our interest with a variety of characters and a portion of their lives  Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, etc.  Hitchcock creates an interesting character study as well as his usual thriller. We are only allowed to see what Jeffries sees, bits and pieces presented out of context, and we are left to make our own theories about what these bits mean in the overall lives of these characters.<br/><br/>The main focus of the movie is Jeffries suspicion of Lars Thorwald, who occupies a second-story apartment across from Jeffries'. He notices Thorwald's strained relationship with his wife, then her sudden disappearance. A number of events that could be related follows. As he pries more and more into Thorvald's life, he gets closer and closer to the man himself; climaxing in Lisa's entry into Thorwald's home to search for clues, and the mano-a-mano confrontation between the Jeffries and Thorwald at the film's end.<br/><br/>By the movie's end, resolution has been achieved for most of the characters in the film; the truth about Thorwald is discovered, Miss Torso's husband arrives back from war, the couple that sleeps outside is training a new puppy, Miss Lonelyhearts and the musician with the studio apartment have linked up romantically. Even pessimistic Jeffries, bound yet again in his apartment with two broken legs, has found resolution, finally accepting Lisa as an equal. As the movie ends, the shutters on the window are drawn  he doesn't need them anymore."

","James Stewart, who must have been Hitchcock's leading man more than any other actor, rivaled only by Cary Grant, plays a wheelchair bound photographer who is having doubts about his relationship with lovely socialite Grace Kelly (who kind of looked like Nicole Kidman in her day) and who's only hobby at the moment is spying on his neighbor's during a heat wave. That's when he thinks he spots a murder, but is it for real or is his imagination running away with him?<br/><br/>The only thing missing from this entry would have to be the dysfunctional relationship between a man and his mother. You've still got the creepy imagery, the ""nowhere to run, nowhere to hide"" feeling, and the beautiful blond. I think James Stewart must have been liked by the audiences of his day on account of his being so unpolished (you know, his funny voice and what not), but he makes for a good confused hero and this makes for an entertaining suspense tale. That's future Perry Mason star Raymond Burr as the film's little seen villain, by the way."

","'Rear Window' tells the story of a widely travelled photojournalist, played by Jimmy Stewart, who ends up wheelchair bound with a cast from hip to toe. This character, 'Jeff' Jefferies, used to excitement and covering wars and events around the world, suddenly finds himself in his small apartment with nothing much to do except watch his neighbors.  This man seems to be afflicted with a need to watch and observe the world, and isn't happy watching TV or reading books to pass the time, because he never does throughout the film. He does however, find a human drama by observing his neighbors across the courtyard, and he can interpret who they are and what they do by watching their activities throughout the day, and night! However, with one neighbor, played by Raymond Burr, he suspects a sinister and much darker reality, he thinks the man has murdered his wife.<br/><br/>  The film is not a typical film of voyeurism, because of Hitchcock's choice of Stewart to play the photographer Jefferies. Stewart is the decent and normal 'everyman', not a twisted and perverse 'peeper'. If the photographer was played by Robert Mitchum or William Holden, men who have played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in their career, maybe the film would have a different meaning. With Jimmy Stewart however, we can be assured that Jefferies is studying his environment and not becoming gratified with what he's viewing. That said, his viewing becomes close to an obsession when he believes a murder has occurred, but not quite to the unhealthy degree as the obsession he portrayed in another Hitchcock classic, 'Vertigo'.<br/><br/>  The film is classic, and it is both a time capsule and relevant to today. The lack of air conditioning during the film's heat wave forces people to leave their windows and blinds open, where as today they would most likely be out of view. The relevance is in the relationship between the 24/7 cable news, 'Americas Most Wanted', video and photo obsessed society of today, that voyeurism and the public's desire to provide breaking news is applicable. In this era, we are all like 'Jeff' Jefferies, and that is what makes 'Rear Window' more than a quaint period piece."

","Rear Window is another genius film made by Alfred Hitchcock.  The depth and directing of this movie is amazing. There is no other movie like it and maybe never will be.<br/><br/>Rear Window is about a wheelchair bound man named L.B. Jeff Jeffries who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg and ends up spying on his neighbors through his apartment window. He notices something fishy while watching his neighbor and the story becomes suspenseful.<br/><br/>Though the movie starts out slow, which is the only negative thing to mention, it definitely becomes more exciting as the movie goes on. The whole film takes place in one area, L.B. Jeff Jeffries's apartment and the view he has of the outside and of his neighbors apartments through their windows. It was a huge risk making this film using only that area for all of the scenes. Alfred Hitchcock is most likely the only director who could pull off making a film like this.  The camera angles and the symbolism of each of the apartment floors representing something different is inventive.  Each of his skills keep the movie interesting.<br/><br/>The acting was well-done, but it wasn't what made the movie. Jimmy Stewart who played L.B. Jeff Jefferies did well portraying his character like in most of the movies he is in. The glamorous Grace Kelly who played Lisa Fremont (Jeff Jefferies girlfriend) did a great job playing a sophisticated character.  Though the acting wasn't amazing, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly's chemistry on screen was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Although this movie wasn't as frightening as Hitchcock's other film Psycho, it is more creative. The depth and the cinematography of this film is remarkable and once again makes Alfred Hitchcock a genius.<br/><br/>This movie deserves 9.5 out of 10 stars."

","Rear Window is a classic suspense movie without all the blood and guts.<br/><br/>The whole plot takes place inside L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries (James Stuart) New York apartment.  He is recovering from a broken leg and is confined to his wheel chair.  Trying to get through the days while not doing much besides visiting with his Stella (Thelma Ritter) his nurse and Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) his girlfriend, he looks through the rear window to his apartment and observes his neighbors in the apartments across the courtyard. Miss Torso, Miss Loneyheart, a composer, newlyweds and a bickering couple captures his attention and Jeff is soon caught up in his neighbors' lives noticing the odd things that they do day by day.  One day he notices that the wife of the man across the courtyard is no longer in the apartment and the man is packing her things.  Jeff also notices that his strange neighbor is coming home at odd hours of the night with knives and ropes.  Soon Jeff becomes suspicious thinking that a murder has just been committed across from his own apartment. Hitchcock used a lot of symbolism throughout the movie.  When Miss Lonelyheart was depressed, she would be on the lower floor of the apartment, but when she became happier she would go to the higher floors of the apartment building.  The apartment of the suspicious neighbor was dark and uninviting.  The music from the composer's apartment would always start to play when Jeff and Lisa would talk about the suspicious neighbor.  It was very interesting to look for the symbolism throughout the movie because it took the theme of the movie to a deeper level.  Also, when Jeff is looking into all the different apartment buildings he seeing more than neighbors go through their daily tasks: he's seeing different stages of people lives.  I think that is what makes this movie so interesting and captivating in a way. Hitchcock's movies have multiple levels. I would rate this movie 10/10.  It is definitely something everyone should see."

","`Rear Window' is a great movie, if the viewer is into more drawn out plots. If they are only into movies that catch their attention quickly, this is not the movie for them. <br/><br/>This film had a very unique set.  The entire movie is filmed in an indoor set.  It also is filmed so that everything is inside the apartment of the main character.  Things happen outside, but all of the camera angles are simply looking out the window.<br/><br/>When compared to most movies, `Rear Window' is very good.  The only time this movie does not `measure up' is when compared to `Psycho', Hitchcock's more notable movie.  The Master of Suspense didn't really live up to his name in this movie.  This is supposed to be a suspenseful movie, but comparatively, it is not suspenseful at all.  Though good camera angles, and good music selection, did help things along, it did not seem to have the Alfred Hitchcock touch.<br/><br/>Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a seven out of ten.  It is good if you have the attention span for drawn out movies.  But if the viewer is looking for `entertain me, quick' they are looking at the wrong movie."

","Once again, the Master of Suspense does not disappoint.  Being a cinematic offspring with Hitchcock genes, one can expect the usual dose of intriguing mystery, baffling murders, beautiful blondes, never-ending suspense, and of course an occasional twist or two by the time the end rolls near.  Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a steady paced thriller that is guaranteed to keep your voyeuristic tendencies satisfied till the very end.<br/><br/>What's so special about Hitchcock's films is the fact that even though they seem to follow a certain suit, containing mysteries and murders, every one of them is original and one-of-a-kind, keeping them exciting and enticing to watch from time to time.  This film achieves its excellence with its unique panoramas and buttery smooth cinematography.  Hitchcock captures the very essence of L.B. Jeffries' neighborhood and its peculiarity without ever leaving his apartment, thus providing the audience an innovative cinematic setting with an obscure first-person view.<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart plays the role of L.B. Jeffries, an adventurous photographer restricted to a wheelchair while waiting for his broken leg to mend. Confined in his New York apartment, he spends his time observing his unusual neighbors through his rear window provided with the subtle distractions of his blonde bombshell of a girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who gives him the TLC he needs, and his trusty house nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), who provides the laughter for both him and the audience.  In a flash, the film takes a different route with Hitchcock finesse and Jeffries is left with a view that leaves him baffled and stirred...<br/><br/>The suspense that progresses and builds throughout the story is nothing short of breathtaking.  Many will be pleased with the intensity that binds this film's storyline as it fastens its pace.  Even in this film Hitchcock still manages to hook the audience with perfect timing and skill that can only be attained through his many years of experience.<br/><br/>Many modern-day teenage viewers will complain that the beginning is rather slow. Without an objection, this reviewer can relate to their angst, but also reminds them that the reason for the slow pace is so that they can identify each of the characters as well as what's happening in the story as it picks up its speed till the very end, where hopefully, will have already stimulated their senses enough for them to enjoy the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this film is yet another favored classic to add under Hitchcock's belt for its simple, but forceful storyline and cinematic symbolism.  Rear Window is a great film for anyone in the mood for a good mystery; just be sure to keep your voyeuristic tendencies at a safe, sane, and legal level."

","Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece `Rear Window,' was something a bit different for the time. Known as the master of suspense, Hitchcock, used camera angles, plot structure and an overall atmosphere to give a sense that you're in the movie. `Rear Window' was filmed on only one set and in one room making this movie truly unique. This movie stars James Stewart as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Lt. Thomas Doyle and Thelma Ritter as Stella. All of who give a wonderful performance and gibe the story life. Jeff, who is the main character in the movie, is a professional photographer who travels the world and is unfortunately stuck inside his apartment because of a broken leg hi had received. This film is viewed from his prospective as he views his neighborhood and his fellow neighbors. Hitchcock's choice of music was very interesting for this film because there is none, or at least no official sound track. All music that was used in the film was from his near by neighbors, or music playing on the street, which in turn was in sync with what was going on. This films battles a lot of controversy over ethics and morals as James Stewart `peeps' out his windows of his apartment, is it okay? Is it wrong? Although Hitchcock is known for his fantastic horror movies, this is a great mystery movie to watch. Hitchcock did a great job casting this film, James Stewart was a perfect choice, because many viewers at the time felt like they could identify with him. This film really gets you hooked and making you ask what exactly is next. I give it 8.5 out of 10 stars, for the spectacular work put into making the set of `Rear Window' and also the great job the performers and Hitchcock putting together this movie."

","Alfred Hitchcocks movie ""Rear Window"" is a great perspective on the different stages in a persons life. The stage is the largest indoor set ever made, the view is set entirely from an apartment.  The different levels show the neighbors at their best or worst. As these people develop, this shows how the different stages of life develop into other stages. The music is very unique during this movie, it is either played on a piano, on a radio, or sung. This is very different then many of his other movies, unlike the birds where there is no sound track. The music is uplifting and is a characteristic to the neighbors. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for this role, he is known and loved by many people, and that adds sympathy to his character. Although during the movie his ""sanity"" is sometimes questioned, it helps the viewer to get passed the fact that he has been stuck in his apartment for 6 weeks, and except his credibility. Even though the viewer is forced to accept it because it is all from his point of view. This movie is one of Hitch cocks best, although a mystery and not a horror film. The suspense keep the audience on the edge of their seat and the symbolism of life is a message to all."

","Rear Window is another one of Alfred Hitchcock's successes.  The movie starts off rather slow and the viewer might get a little bored, but once it gets into all the mystery there is no way anyone could fall asleep.  It keeps the audience on their toes and it is very entertaining to watch.  The entire movie is filmed in one community which makes it different from other movies and quite interesting.  <br/><br/>The movie stars James Stewart as L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries and Grace Kelley as Lisa Fremont.      The two work great together on camera and are both very talented actors.  James Stewart, who also starred in It's a Wonderful Life, is the perfect actor to play the part of Jeffries.        His character is an old army man and you can certainly tell through his acting.  Grace Kelley's character is classy and into fashion.  She is beautiful herself which only adds to this view of her character in the movie.  Overall, Stewart and Kelley are definitely the right people to star in Rear Window<br/><br/>The acting altogether throughout the film is almost never cheesy and is almost always very believable.  All the actors and actresses act so well that it's as if what's happening isn't a move and is really going on.  Even the people with very few lines are believable when they say them. <br/><br/>
The music is all digetic.  There is never any background music that was added in after filming.  It all comes from a neighbor's piano, a radio, or something in the movie itself.  The fact that there is no added in music just adds to the feeling that what you're watching is really happening.  It makes the movie seem less like a movie and more like real life.<br/><br/>There aren't really any special effects in Rear Window because it's not a special effects kind of movie.  There are however a few times in the movie where something or somebody looks very fake and you can tell it isn't really there or that what's happening isn't really happening like the audience sees it.  But those few times don't make a big impact on what the viewer's opinion of the movie is.  It is a very good movie and a few scenes that aren't so well put together don't change that.<br/><br/>Rear Window has to be one of the most suspenseful movies there is.  Yes, it isn't full of loads of action but it doesn't need to be.  This movie has shown me that a movie can be simple and not have much ""bad"" stuff to be a really good suspense movie.  Rear Window is an awesome movie and is definitely on my ""see again"" list."

","Not your typical Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Or Is it? People who have not seen many Hitchcock Movies, don't know, that  he does more than horror movies, but he does mysteries too. 	Alfred Hitchcock does a careful job at selecting the perfect cast for this movie. James Stewart as L.B. Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Freemont. He especially does a great job of casting Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald. Raymond was in his thirties when this movie was made, but they made him look twenty five years older. Throughout this movie, Jeffries is stuck in his apartment with a broken leg. He is not left alone though. Stella (Thelma Ritter) comes in every day in the morning to take care of him, and Lisa (Grace Kelly) visits him at night. Being stuck in his apartment all day has him bored to death. He has nothing better to do than to look out the rear window at others, either walking around, or across the court yard. Jeffries has a suspicion that Lars Thorwald (across the courtyard) has murdered his wife. Both Stella and Lisa thought he was just going nuts from being cooped up so long in that apartment. But they started to believe him.<br/><br/>There are a few differences in this movie compared to psycho. This movie is in color, not black and white. It is a mystery, not a horror film. The back ground music in this movie is either a radio, somebody singing or playing a musical instrument. Not Dissonant string arrangements.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter what anyone says, this is without a doubt one of his best movies. If you don't like horror movies, but you are interested in Hitchcock, then you should rent this movie. Even though this is not a horror movie, Alfred Hitchcock still keeps his word at holding all of us in suspense. <br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I was literally riveted to my seat. At the beginning, I was inclined to feel the same way as Lisa and Stella. It was apparent that Jeffries had become too involved with the lives of his neighbors and it was this involvement which initially turned Lisa and Stella off. However, as they became concerned about his interest in the neighbors, they started noticing that Lars Thorwald's wife was no longer around. This movie is filled with suspense. I found myself becoming interested in the lives of Jeffries neighbors even though I knew they were just fictional characters. Just as I was drawn in to their lives, I found myself following Thorwald's actions. When Thorwald realized he was being watched and it became apparent that he was going to come after Jeffries, I found myself becoming anxious because I knew that Jeffries was alone and because of his injury, he could not escape Thorwald. Did Thorwald Murder his wife? Find out by watching this suspenseful thriller!"

This Hitchcock flick has to do with Jeffries possibly seeing a murder by one of his neighbors. <br/><br/>The set for this film was gigantic in the sense the studio was smaller that the set. The entire movie being shot in a studio Hitchcock did a great job at making it seem believable. Also, there was no score for this movie. Only background music was used as the score. <br/><br/>How the characters did were pretty good in the sense most of them had no dialogue. The way it was filmed was to show the protagonist `spying' on his neighbors out of boredom.

This movie was filmed entirely in one set that was built indoors this is part of the genius of this movie. The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of one mans apartment and in the entire movie the view only leaves the apparent once. The view of this mans window over looks a courtyard that is in the middle of four other apartment buildings. Each building has several windows facing the courtyard and the viewer through this window learns much of the occupants. Each of these occupants seemingly represents an aspect of the human condition.<br/><br/> Also apart of this movies greatness is the casting. The main character is cast very well and is very convincing. In the movie the viewer finds them self feeling as if they are the main character and becomes extremely connected to him. Also very well cast is the girl friend of the main character. The viewer gets very distinct impressions of her that change as the movie continues. <br/><br/>The sound in this movie is very unique because there is very little music and sounds that are out of place. Though this movie is considered to be a classic Hitchcock film the lack of unexplained music makes it stick out from his other movies such as Psycho which is full of it."

When it came to making the set, Paramount Studios allowed him to destroy the main floor to use the basement as a part of the set, making the set the biggest indoor set made (probably for that time) Hitchcock also explored with the dialog, there were a select few people talking. The way the actors acted was their dialog. He also puts you into the movie by making you guess what's going to happen and also the excitement, he does this by showing you what happened then Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) reaction to what just happened. Stewart also in the move resembled himself so it wasn't hard for him to act. When Hitchcock was shooting rainy scene he told one actor to go one way and the other another way, and they didn't know about the water so when you watch the movie watch it closely.<br/><br/>When the movie was made it actually was based on a true story when a man killed his wife and tried to cover it up, that didn't work.

Hitchcock's method has lost its edge in the last half-century thanks to a fleet of imitators (Spielberg included) and advancements in other techniques that have created visions into the world of film.<br/><br/>This is one prototype vision.  This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The world here is skewered, much like 'Truman Show'.  Whereas Weir wanted reality in disguise, this is plain reality looking fake.  Varying detail is spread over everything, causing the effect to less look authentic than 'West Side Story'.  This almost resembles 'Streetcar'.<br/><br/>Here is where Hitchcock separates the film world from the stage world.  This movie is only a freak mutation of both that uses Stewart as the stationary viewer.  We watch Stewart.  We know Stewart has a flat persona that's been continuously belted since 'Mr. Smith'.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculously simple by today's standards and the photography is lethargic, but Hitchcock has another element...Kelly.  She makes the movie flow, not Stewart, and when the culprit is caught, she is the winner.  And so are we.  Hitchcock made a mistake by using Hedren in 'Birds'.<br/><br/>The other Hitchcock is, of course, 'Psycho'.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."
"bshotzbarger","Null","1","3","22 April 2003"," Thematic Elements
","Directly quoting from Webster's Dictionary, a theme is `the subject of a work of art.'  If this is true, which it undoubtedly is, then perhaps the main theme in Hitchcock's masterpiece Rear Window is the notion of appearance versus reality.  Accordingly, the underlying message of such a theme is that what one sees in everyday life could in fact be nothing more than a facade, or simply put, a mere deception of one's genuine character.<br/><br/>How Hitchcock portrays this particular theme is quite subtle.  But through the eyes of L.B. Jeffries, the audience is revealed to the extremely personal side of life by spying on several local neighbors whom both Jeffries and the audience can view from a rear window.  Of course, the personal side of life in this film encompasses the actions and secrets that are occur in the home and hence this is what really constitutes the reality of individuals.  Therefore, what is done in society and in public by people can be interpreted as being solely superficial.  Thus, as Jeffries continues his acts of voyeurism, he discovers several truths that contrast the perceptions of these people held by the rest of society.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, this is a very common theme among many Hitchcock films. For example, the character of Charles Oakley in Shadow of a Doubt gives the appearance of the very intelligent and likeable guy to many of the local dwellers in Santa Rosa, California.  However, once his niece Charlotte becomes aware of his personal secrets, her appearance of him forever changed into the image of a ruthless killer, which in reality Uncle Charlie was all along.<br/><br/>One scene that demonstrates this theme is when the husband of the newly wed couple is resting on his elbows and leaning outside the window.  To the local neighbors and society in general, this newly wed couple would more than likely portray the appearance of happiness out in public due to the fact that they are a recently married couple.  However, what the audience sees through Jeffries point of view is that in reality the husband is obviously displeased and bored with his current situation, which is distinctly represented by a look of misery.<br/><br/>Another scene that contains the concept of appearance versus reality is when the boyfriend of the ballet dancer finally returns home from some kind of military service or war.  For a majority of the film, this dancer is given constant attention by several men.  Though, this occurs in her bedroom, the appearance this gives to others who know her either in town or in the same building is that she is very promiscuous.  In truth, this idea of her being very sexually active is far from reality.  Regardless if many men are pursuing her, this character never makes advances towards them sexually, but she also never denies them the luxury of her company.  And when her boyfriend finally comes home, the audience is well aware that this is the only man that she has been waiting for and loves because of the ecstatic reaction she displays towards his homecoming.<br/><br/>There are several film techniques that Hitchcock utilized to highlight this main theme.  One area that added to this thematic atmosphere was the lighting in Rear Window.  True to his reputation of being a cinematic genius, Hitchcock used the lack of light and unique shadows to characterize times when people did not want their personal lives or reality to be discovered and known by others.  In some sense, by hiding in these shadows, the characters felt comfort in the dark blanket that served as a barrier for them against individuals in the outside world who were trying to uncover their secrets.<br/><br/>Perhaps the scene that best demonstrates this technical characteristic is when a local dog in the film is found dead.  The female owner of the dog upon discovering this tragedy is clearly outraged and horrified.  She in response creates a vocal ruckus so loud that everyone in the neighborhood looks out their window or walks onto their deck to see what all the commotion is about.  One neighborhood by the name of Lars Thorwald however does not get up to see what is happening.  Jeffries attempts to see what Thorwald is doing, but his efforts are soon thwarted when he realizes that Thorwald has turned off all of the lights and can no longer be seen through Jeffries' telephoto camera lens.  Thus, in order to escape the reality that Jeffries suspects of him, Thorwald hides in the darkness while smoking a cigarette of his apartment.<br/><br/>The camera angles used by Hitchcock also articulate this theory of appearance versus reality.  Many of the shots that comprise the neighbors within this film are that of close-ups.  In particular, these close-ups serve as representations of the point of view of Jeffries when he is spying on his neighbors through his camera lens.  But another way to define these close-ups is that they also represent the truth of these individuals that are being spied on because they are so up close and personal.  Wide-angle shots are not very personal and give the outer appearance and surface of a given subject only.  While a close-up on the other hand gets past the surface of something and really gets down in depth about one specific image. Symbolically then, the close-ups of characters within this film could serve as a method to get passed the superficial images portrayed by these people in society.  And thus, they serve as the ultimate means of seeing the truth and reality of these characters.<br/><br/>An example of a scene that depicts this use of close-ups is when Jeffries is watching a character that is dubbed the title Miss Lonelyhearts.  At first Jeffries only sees the surface of this character from afar as she happily prepares a fancy dinner for two in her apartment.  However, it is only after Jeffries watches her closely that a close-up reveals the truth regarding the situation, which is that there is no one there at all but herself.  It is then found out that Miss Lonelyhearts is indeed a very melancholy woman who is looking for love, but unable to find it roles-plays scenarios of romantic evenings in her spare time.<br/><br/>In the end, Hitchcock with the use of technical brilliance accomplishes the perfect mood and theme for this movie.  For that reason alone, Rear Window stands as one of the greatest films within the Hitchcock collection.  A film that at first appears to be nothing more than the voyeuristic journey of a photographer quickly adapts to offer an insight look into the notion of appearance and reality that dominates peoples' lives."

","Why is it that today's thrillers have to have blood guts and gore, what the directors today don't understand that it is what you don't see that makes something scary.

"pjcarline","Null","1","3","9 October 2002"," Love Thy Neighbour?
","Rear Window is arguably Hitchcock's finest film. It encapsulates a tale of intrigue, suspense, paranoia and voyeurism, but also features an underlying tone exploring the subject of human relationships and love.<br/><br/>
L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound photographer recovering from a broken leg. His frustration and boredom at being confined within his own home leads to an obsession with the lives of the people through his rear window. The wealth of relationships before his eyes highlight the various stages of coupling, and Jefferies is forced to examine his own love life, following a recent proposal from his doting beau Lisa (Grace Kelly). Using binoculars and high power lenses, Jefferies is alerted to the suspicious behaviour of Lars Thorwell (Raymond Burr), and becomes convinced that he has witnessed the events surrounding a murder. Soon, both Lisa and his unflappable nurse (the wonderful Thelma Ritter), become convinced that something is seriously awry. When cynicism comes from Jefferies' friend on the force, Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey), he is forced to examine his actions, intuitions and motives as the plot unfolds.<br/><br/>Hitchcock creates a tense environment, with the small, unchanging set complemented by incidental street noises, and the occasional playing of a local pianist. Like Jefferies, the viewer becomes absorbed with the lives of ordinary people, as the many incidental characters embark upon their daily routines. It is a thriller which entices the audience into sharing the intrigue, emotions and suspicions of the main characters, as the subtle script weaves its way to conclusion. Rear Window is a tense, yet understated mystery, and a delightful exploration of human nature."
"toolkien","Null","1","3","24 June 2002"," Very good on many levels
","For some of the (younger???) viewers who have commented on Rear Window's lack of charm au courant, I'd like to say ""Open your eyes and ears, and use that grey matter between them."" Once upon a time, movies didn't involve explosions and zooming surround sound. They were about dialogue and the unfolding of events, pausing long enough for the viewer to participate in the plot, being allowed to think ahead, and make sense of what came behind. It involved more than one level of the brain. Well done movies such as Rear Window quickened the heart's pace as well as stimulated the mind.<br/><br/>The visuals are wonderful in Rear Window. The 'creeping camera' shots at the beginning of the film states where, what, who, and why in the matter of a few moments without a bit of dialogue (when is stated early on but uses dialogue, unless I've missed it in the earlier shots). The colors are wonderful as well and the dreamlike quality of the court's interior, versus the harsher shades just outside, tells the viewer that there is something otherworldly about this particular location. It sets up the real story told in this movie; it's a study of male/female relationships at various stages, from miss lonely hearts to the violent Thorwalds and everything in between. The suspense is the (interesting) hook keeping the viewer watching. You can compare and contrast the occupant/s of each apartment to one another, as well as Jeffries' relationship to Lisa, and possibly to your own.<br/><br/>I'm not an art house movie aficionado. I enjoy actions movies with the best of 'em; there's nothing wrong with a bit of escapism like Die Hard. But I can also appreciate a movie that doesn't rely on boobs and explosions to entertain and possibly makes a synapse pop with electricity once in a while. If explosions are all you can understand, and more than one dimension to a movie brings on a migraine, then by all means don't buy or rent this movie."
"Mickey-2","8","1","3","26 June 2002"," A stylish mystery by the master of suspense that only gets better with age
","Alfred Hitchcock had the ability to take an ordinary citizen, project a possible mishap, or even worse, a capital crime on the person, and then completely involve the viewing audience in living through the solving of the matter.  That talent is superbly used in the 1954 classic, ""Rear Window"", which starred James Stewart and Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>The story is a very simple one; James Stewart portrays a photographer who lives in a New York apartment building with a rear window that faces other apartments in the complex.  Due to an accident he sustained while on assignment, he is recuperating from a broken leg, and that has him confined to a wheelchair.  Still, he is somewhat mobile, and his mind and ability to sense things, is very active.  Grace Kelly, in a stunning portrayal of his girlfriend, adds a screen beauty that very few were able to duplicate. Stewart and Kelly both begin to suspect that one of the neighbors in the complex has committed a murder, and they face the tough task of convincing the local police of such an happening.  Wendell Corey handles this role in good fashion.  Eventually, Hitchcock neatly wraps all the elements together in his usual manner, and the viewing audience sees the Suspense Master unfold a truly classical masterpiece. Well worth the chance to view."

","For me, 'Rear Window' is Hitchcock's best movie.  It provides the best examples of what makes Hitchcock the ""Master"".  This movie sinfully combines his trademark witty humor with his eye for deceptive suspense.  James Stewart is at his humorous best, while Grace Kelly is in her most glamorous role.  The witticism displayed along with the natural lure to voyeurism is joyfully entertaining, and they provide loads of entertainment before the intrigue and suspense really gets cooking latter on in the movie.  Simply a wonderful movie. It is so frustrating not being able to purchase the video (currently not in print).

","Rear Window(1954) in its restored edition is better than ever with improvements made with the look and sound of the film.  It is Alfred Hitchcock's second great film right after Vertigo(1958).  Rear Window was Alfred Hitchcock's first box office hit.  The colors of the movie are fresher and make the movie seem brand new.<br/><br/>
Alfred Hitchcock's top five movies are 1.Vertigo(1958), 2.Rear Window(1954), 3.Psycho(1960), 4.The Birds(1963), and 5.North By Northwest(1959).  It is filled with terrific scenes of suspense and nerve wecaking mystery.  James Stewart is great as usual as a curious photographer.  Thelma Ritter adds some morbid humor to the film with her dialogue.<br/><br/>
My ten favorite Hitchcock films are 1.Strangers on a Train(1951), 2.Notorious(1946), 3.The 39 Steps(1934), 4.Vertigo(1958), 5.Rear Window(1954), 6.The Birds(1963), 7.Frenzy(1972), 8.North By Northwest(1959), 9.Rope(1948), and 10.Marnie(1964).  Raymond Burr is menacing as the mysterious salesman.  The protagonist is someone who likes to look into the lives of his fellow neighboors.  Grace Kelly is alluing as Jeffery's girlfriend.<br/><br/>
Rear Window(1954) deals with the theme of voyeurism although without the explicit nature of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom(1960) which took a more extreme viewpoint.  This movie is filled with Hitchcock humor.  This is a film that will stand the test of time as all great movies eventually do.  It is best to see it on the big screen because it is the best way to View Rear Window(1954)."

Plus, it's laden with symbolism--so much, in fact, that I won't go into detail here; many film review web sites offer extensive summaries of the movie. The apartment complex in which the movie is set entirely in seems so familiar, so very possible that when James Stewart suspects a neighbor of murder, you suddenly find yourself wondering, Well, what would one do?? All the so-called evidence he has is purely circumstancial: only what he witnesses in his neighbor's apartment through his window.  The best, most intense moments come near the end.  I will not reveal what exactly happens here but when one specific person looks up and realizes he's being watched, it's the creepiest moment I've seen on film."

"Sisiutil","9","1","3","14 January 2002"," A welcome change of pace from current thrillers
","I finally got around to watching Rear Window for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I couldn't help contrasting it--favourably--with modern thrillers. <br/><br/>Unlike a modern thriller, where the movie-makers try to jolt you within the first few seconds, Hitchcock was content to take his time. He spent the bulk of the first act on character development. Instead of cheap thrills, he used complex, interesting, appealing characters portrayed by skilled actors to draw us into his story. <br/><br/>I confess that it took my MTV-shortened attention span some time to adjust; I kept wondering, during the first half hour or so, when the plot was going to get under way. But I was never bored. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly had great chemistry and were fascinating to watch, and Thelma Ritter was a hoot. The characters hooked me and pulled me into the story. By the climax, I was squirming anxiously as I watched these people I'd come to know and care about getting into danger.<br/><br/>There's also a depth to this film that most modern thrillers lack. Rear Window raises a lot of disturbing questions. Where's the line between neighbourly concern and voyeurism? Can men and women ever be really happy together? And can you always believe what you've seen with your own eyes? This film isn't just chewing gum for the mind, occupying your attention for a couple of hours and then forgotten. I didn't find it as heart-pounding as Psycho, but I was entertained and enthralled nonetheless. Great stuff."

","I am personally a fan of Alfred Hitchcock films, so my opinion may be a little bias.  Having said that, still, this is a film that anybody that watches movies should check out.  <br/><br/>    It says much on the morality of peeping into other peoples lives, and if we even have the right to.  The genius of all of that is, is that we too get caught up in these lives that we view from afar.  We view them through the eyes of Stewart, but still, we are never any better.  And we always want to know more.  If that doesn't interest you, however, you can still watch a great story unfold.  A mystery that keeps us guessing until the end, and possibly after the movie ends.  I won't ruin any of that for all of you though. <br/><br/>    Hitchcocks direction is excellent.  As with all of his great films, for instance 'The Birds' and 'North by Northwest', the pacing is great, and we never get a chance to get bored.  Excellent, as well, are the performances from the entire cast.  Whats best is the whole world that is created for us, from afar, based on assumptions that are speculations at best.  Hitchcock never does tell us exactly what is going on.  That is best left up to us to decide if what we see and what we are being told that we see are the same thing.<br/><br/>    This film is so multifaceted that I really can't describe it all right now, you will have to see it all for yourself.  It has a point that is relevent still, even more so today with the huge success of reality television, and the media lust for celebrity gossip(paparazzi).  Take that away, and still you get a great suspense movie.  We are all voyeurs, and through Stewart's eyes is each and everyone of us peering into the lives of everyone else.

","This is the master director's greatest film, slightly edging out ""North by Northwest"" and ""Vertigo.""  Even the absence of a score by Bernard Herrmann cannot dim this masterpiece.  Everything comes together in a seamless whole. To begin with, the set is impressive.  The fact that the viewers are seeing so much happening in so many different people's lives makes them forget that, except for one or two scenes near the end, the camera never moves from the protagonist's apartment.  What Jeff sees we see and nothing more.  The voyeuristic fantasy is so complete, we forget that no one in his or her right mind would put on a brassiere, attempt suicide, or commit murder in front of an open window.  I can't help wondering whether this looking in on so many people's private goings-on had anything to do with the still new medium of television, which enabled people for the first time to sit in the comfort of their own living rooms and watch, as if through an open window, the antics of Lucy and Ricky, Ozzie and Harriet and others in the supposed privacy of their own homes.<br/><br/>I mentioned the score.  This film apparently marked Hitch's last collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, who scored the earliest of the director's American films, including ""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion.""  Yet it's not a conventional score.  Apart from the opening theme, the music is part of the action and pours out of various apartments overlooking the courtyard, particularly the penthouse apartment of the songwriter, whose evolving composition provides a melodic--and sometimes not so melodic--backdrop for the developing plot.  (What a noisy place!  And this was in the days before boom boxes.  Yet somehow it looks like a delightful neighbourhood to live in.)<br/><br/>Then, of course, there are the three stars, Stewart, Kelly and Ritter, who are wonderful together.  In many respects all three are character actors, but the characters blend in so charming a fashion that the viewer is taken in as much by the personalities as by the suspense-filled story line. Each character is surrounded by a certain ironic twist.  Stewart is the adventurer whose wanderlust is forcibly curtailed by confinement to a wheelchair.  Kelly is the pampered socialite who nevertheless summons up the courage to collect clues to a suspected murder in a most unconventional way. And Ritter is an apparently ordinary insurance company nurse whose homespun wisdom makes her part psychoanalyst and part clairvoyant.  The chemistry is marvellous and would be difficult to replicate.<br/><br/>What about the 1998 made-for-television remake?  It's interesting enough entertainment in its own right, but not as a remake of the 1954 film.  The original is definitely the one to see."

What comes out of it is one of the most influential films of all time, and arguably Hitchcock's best (though others, including ""Rope"", could claim that honor).<br/><br/>James Stewart is an impressive lead, and this is likely the finest role for Grace Kelly in her relatively short Hollywood career (before getting swept off to Monaco).

","Rear Window is an suspense film directed by Alfred Hitchcock.It was written by John Michael Hayes that was based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"".The film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, and Thelma Ritter.<br/><br/>Laid up with a broken leg, photojournalist L.B. Jeffries is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa, the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as ""Miss Torso"",a professional dancer with a healthy social life or ""Miss Lonelyhearts"",a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered traveling salesman Lars Thorwald, who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. <br/><br/>Rear Window is arguably the second best film of Alfred Hitchcock next to Vertigo.The new-of-a-kind movie during its year of release makes a murder mystery tense as well as entertaining.In it,Hitchcock's genius delivers as one of the most elegant entertainments ever made in Hollywood, and also one of the boldest and most personal of the his films since it is a work that's almost perverse in its giddy celebration of the thrill of voyeurism."

","One of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films, ""Rear Window"" finds actor Jimmy Stewart playing Jeff Jefferies, a photojournalist confined to his apartment due to a broken leg. Stuck in a wheelchair, Jeff finds himself becoming a Peeping Tom, spying on those who live in the apartment block opposite his urban complex.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds, we become aware that each apartment window Jeff spies on reveals an aspect of his own psyche, much of it having to do with his feelings of inferiority - which he hides by pretending to be a macho journalist - fear of commitment and sexual unease. Jeff thinks of himself as a ""camera bum"", a guy too lowly to be with Lisa, the gorgeous woman (played by the always sublime Grace Kelly) who's madly in love with him. ""She's too perfect, too talented, too beautiful, too sophisticated, too everything but what I want!"" Jeff moans, as he begins to project his insecurities onto the various characters living in the building opposite his. And so Jeff notes the dissatisfactions of a pair of newlyweds, the banal lives of an elderly couple, the frictions between a pianist and his lover and the arguments between a knife salesman and his wife. <br/><br/>Eventually, what Jeff sees across the courtyard becomes so intertwined with his own insecurities that he practically wills the travelling salesman into murdering his wife. In Jeff's warped mind, the salesman, who like Jeff is always away from home, always at a pit-stop between assignments, MUST murder his wife if only to decisively prove that things will never work out between him and Lisa!<br/><br/>Then the film gets really twisted, for Lisa TOO wants the woman dead. She exploits Jeff's obsession with solving the film's murder mystery in order to counter his misogyny by proving herself a fit companion for him. In a sense, Jeff ""concocts a murder fantasy"" to prove that their relationship is doomed, whilst Lisa ""goes along with the fantasy"" to prove that she is as tough and rugged as her dear Jeff (and only then does life in the apartment across the street become happy). It's like a freaky sadomasochistic game in which wive's offer themselves as corpse's to remasculinize men and lovers lovingly mend bridges with murder.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Hitchcock's roaming camera (linked with curious cats and dogs, the latter killed for sniffing about) elegantly explores its urban surroundings. But what it finds is only a world of characters happy on the outside but afflicted by terrible loneliness and frustrations on the inside. And Jeff, of course, no more responds to the mental anguish (deaths, abuse, suicides etc) of these characters than he does to Lisa's suffering. They're all stick figures, existing for Jeff's own private amusement.<br/><br/>While Jeff and Lisa project their respective fantasies upon the mirror building, back in their own apartment, in their own world, they're still the same old conflicted couple. This dichotomy has led to about six decades of writers reading ""Window"" - a film which even pauses to discuss the ethics of watching (shades of ""Rope"") - as an allegory for the cinema experience. With such readings, the apartment Jeff spies on is typically read as a theatre screen, a blank slate upon which we project our fantasies, while in reality we sit, like Jeff, stymied and crippled. The film also explicitly links boredom to voyeurism and cinema to a kind of perverse, dehumanising thing, man interested in his fellow men only insofar as they provide morbid, detached amusement. Jeff's seen and catalogued the world, but is afraid of getting close to anything.<br/><br/>Of course ""Window's"" ""highbrow"" readings only came later. Upon initial release, the film was simply read as being – pick one - a pulpy thriller, a comment on post war complacency, a comment on the dark shenanigans that go on behind closed curtains and a light romance in which our sexy stars learn to ""change"" in order to better accommodate their partners. These may all be true, but Hitch does have Jeff defeat ""Window's"" villain with a (film) camera, opening a whole can of interesting self-reflexive avenues.<br/><br/>This self-reflexivity is pushed further by Brian De Palma in ""Body Double"", essentially a sleazy hybrid of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Window"". Here De Palma takes the impotency of Scotty from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and applies it to a voyeuristic character called Scully in ""Body Double"" (Scotty has vertigo, Scully has claustrophobia). The film then goes on to have Scully ""watch"" a pornographic movie after his ""female neighbour"" dies (she's the echo of the knife salesman's wife in ""Window""), as he is no longer able to voyeuristically watch women in real life. The con is, both Scully's neighbour and the woman in the movie are the same character, both self-consciously ""acting"" or ""performing"" on ""stages"" for Scully, who is himself both a performer (a failed actor) and too impotent (due to social phobias) to act. The simple reality/fantasy, subject/object, audience/screen, spectator/spectacle paradigm of Hitchcock's era increasingly breaks down as the film progresses. Instead we get a continuous succession of layers and meta-screens, everyone actors playing actors playing body doubles or doppelgangers. It's no longer a case of Scully, like Jeff, seeking out voyeurism, or even seeking out decontexualised voyeurism and the surrogate fantasies of film and television, but that under postmodernity, everybody is a participatory image, everyone is in someone else's ""movie"", everything is someone else's desire, a mutual charade in which everyone is enrolled. This, of course, is Lynch/Cronenberg territory, themselves two directors who owe huge debts to Hitchcock (""Body Double"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Existenz"" etc, all successors to ""Rear Window"", all coincide with either the end of the beta-max-VHS war and the boom of the internet generation. IE – they mark shifts in our evolving relationship with voyeurism).<br/><br/>9/10 - Stylish, audacious and packed with excellent banter. Worth multiple viewings."
"PeterRoeder","8","1","4","15 September 2009"," Very interesting
","I just saw this movie again, and it is very interesting. Along with Vertigo it is one of Hitchcock's most interesting movies. It is really scary the way we are slowly drawn into the murder, and given little clues and diversions. Hitchcock is a master at that, and like in the other movie with James Stevart (Vertigo) this movie is almost bordering on the supernatural. This is what makes it so scary. It is not the same horror as in Psycho but it is extremely eerie and disturbing. We wonder what is going on, and are constantly forced to be extremely careful in evaluating what we see on the screen. The story unfolds very nicely leading up to a good climax. I think Vertigo is even better than Rear Window, but in a way they are telling the same story, and both of them are very weird, bordering on the supernatural and playing with what is possible in the real world."
"Steffi_P","10","1","4","12 August 2009"," ""A cold and lonely, lovely work of art""
","A director's ego can ruin a picture. Young film-makers want to get noticed, and drown their work in showy and obvious technique. This is a problem with Alfred Hitchcock's earliest efforts, where his aims were the same as they ever were; yet his means were contrived and jarringly noticeable – dissolves, whip pans, double-exposures – camera tricks that draw attention to the artificial nature of the business. Luckily, by the 1950s he had learnt that his reputation was far better served by staying within the realms of cinematic convention, and learning to employ it to suit the story's needs.<br/><br/>Like Rope, an earlier Hitchcock thriller set entirely in one apartment, Rear Window is a based around a unique and unusual premise. But it is an oddity only in terms of story and setting. As far as the mechanics of cinema go, it is an unpretentious deployment of long-shots, mid-shots and close-ups, basic camera moves and functional shot compositions. It just so happens that Hitchcock is using these methods exceptionally well. And, mundane as they may seem, he is using them to create electrifying suspense.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the most important and simple ""rules"" of the shooting Rear Window is that, even though the focus is outside, the camera stays within James Stewart's apartment. But it's not enough for Hitch to make us look out of that window, he has to make us want to look. He starts this before the little neighbourhood drama even begins, just making the exterior slightly more pleasing to the eye than the interior. A less intelligent director might do this with vibrant colour schemes or freakish shadows, but Hitch keeps everything naturalistic and unobtrusive – whites and greys for the apartment, warmer browns and oranges for the courtyard. And while there are many (wonderful) subplots within the various homes, Hitch has to gradually draw our attention to that of the Thorwalds. Again, he does the opposite of what a naïve director might do – he makes the Thorwalds' apartment the plainest, with small windows, no creeping plants or drainpipes on the walls outside, sparse décor inside. This means when the camera is pointing at that apartment, we are completely focused on what goes on inside it.<br/><br/>There is a delicate balance going on in Rear Window, because while the events going on outside the window must hold our interest, what goes on inside the apartment must put up healthy competition. If we cannot sympathise with Stewart or worry for Grace Kelly, the picture would lose all sense of danger. The love story between these two is given just enough weight in the screenplay for this to work without distracting us from the main business of the story, but Hitchcock helps even more, ensuring that at the start of the scenes between Stewart and Kelly the focus is always inward, making us forget the outside for a second. Then, gradually he brings the window back to our attention with lighting and shot composition, pre-empting Stewart broaching the subject of his suspicions. The upshot of this is that we should now like these characters, but also be as interested in the goings-on outside as they are. Hitch is aware that we will also become caught up in their mounting fear, and start to feel conscious about not being spotted. He begins to add some foreground framing in the exterior shots as if we, via the camera, are hiding.<br/><br/>One of the great things about a picture made of fewer elements, is there is less that can go wrong. This is especially true when you only have a handful of cast members. James Stewart did not do his best work with Hitchcock, but he played some of his most, shall we say, appropriate roles for the Master of Suspense. As the innocent yet strong-willed ""everyman"", he was not so much required to act as to simply be. His L.B. Jeffries could be the lead in a vacuous comedy, and here he allows just a little pressure to be applied to his regular persona, breaking into a sweat once or twice but never coming near the breaking point he would reach in Vertigo. Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey are also simply there to fit their usual types, and each delivers a steady performance without once stepping outside their comfort zone. But who cares that the actors are not stretched? After all, the real drama is going on outside."
"griffolyon12","10","1","4","5 July 2008"," One of the most suspenseful films of all-time!
","Rear Window is easily one of, if not the finest crafted mystery suspense/thriller of all-time. The story is about a man who is confined to a wheelchair within his apartment for eight weeks. During those eight weeks the man takes up the hobby of watching his neighbors through his window, and eventually he witnesses what he believes to be a murder.<br/><br/>The film was directed by the amazing Alfred Hitchcock, who is easily the greatest filmmaker of all-time. Hitchcock gave this film the proper amount of comedy, romance, and suspense to keep the audience enthralled; a large component in his achieving this though came through the magnificent script. The script features tight, witty dialogue that never falls flat, and flows at a pace that only a classic such as this can achieve. Of course the film would be nothing without its cast, Jimmy Stewart alongside the beautiful Grace Kelly, both are stellar actors and deliver pitch perfect performances, as well as the rest of this small, yet flawless cast.<br/><br/>It is rare for their to be a film that is so timeless, this film is just as entertaining today as when it was released in the fifties. No matter how much people try to re-emulate the film for modern age, they always fall flat. Rear Window is a true classic through and through, and is easily worth seeing.<br/><br/>I give Rear Window a flawless 10 out of 10!"
"Tippy_Cup","10","1","4","2 July 2008"," Even if just for the first shot of Grace Kelly. Watch Rear Window.
","I saw Rear Window when I was about twelve for the first time. I remember thinking it was good, I liked the story itself as well as realising that a huge chunk of the films awesomeness stems from it's ability to put you right there in the apartment with Mr Jefferies.<br/><br/>I just watched it again last night, and now being 24 I see a whole lot more. This film is so finely crafted, I'd say it's perfect shot for shot. If there are any qualms that I have with the movie, it's just that Thorwald doesn't cover his eyes after the second or even the third flash that Jimmy Stewart sends his way.<br/><br/>I think for many people my age, the mood to watch many of these pre 60's films, comes about much differently then the feeling of wanting to watch something newer. I don't know, perhaps it's the sass of the jaw droppingly hot female leads (Kelly in this being a GREAT example, holding her self as a proud woman when it wasn't so common, makes you think many many dirty dirty thoughts(but in a good way, lol)). The pacing the colouring, the dialog, etc. <br/><br/>Pretty much, American artistic produce was just so damn good in the 50's. The original EC comics(Tales From the Crypt, Vault of Horror, ShockSuspenStories etc.), the cars, the clothes(for girls, it's weird how stuff that was supposed to be modest, seems so hot today, the way it showed of curves etc. Pretty much more sexual then a really short mini skirt)<br/><br/>OK, now I'm off topic. Good movie. One that EVERYONE that has ever enjoyed any film should watch. 10/10<br/><br/>(reviewed after third (maybe only second, but first time within ten years at least anyway) viewing)"

I loved the setting, too. It's a delicious slice of Americana and it oozes with beautiful images of times past and Hitchcock achieves it all from one view from one apartment. <br/><br/>The plot is simple, easy to follow, believable, and fun.

"dkncd","10","1","4","4 November 2007"," Rear window ethics
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" starts with a shot of its setting, a small apartment square compromised of bright Technicolor yet ageing brick buildings. It seems as though it could be the setting for an adaptation of a Broadway musical, but as this is a Hitchcock film it's not too surprising that no one starts singing and that darker designs lie beneath the benign surface. The people that live in the confined apartment setting have a captive audience, L. B. Jefferies, who is confined to his room in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg. Jeff occupies his time by scrutinizing the lives of those around him by peering through their windows. Eventually he sees what he deems to be suspicious conduct from one of his neighbors and conjectures that something sinister is afoot.<br/><br/>James Stewart lends his usual charm to the role of Jefferies, but is appropriately also somewhat unnerving as well. We are frequently left with a sense that he crosses moral boundaries, yet we can't help being equally fascinated with what he observes. Grace Kelly is dazzling in her role as Liza and creates an admirably persistent character. Wendell Corey is well-cast as a cynical detective and Thelma Ritter also as the vocal Stella. Raymond Burr manages to make an impression despite performing largely at a distance from the principal characters.<br/><br/>The mystery story developed draws in viewers as the main characters are drawn in, which is the film's main appeal. Various subplots are developed and are interesting without detracting from the film's overall story. The film also develops suitable tension, in particular near the ending. Impressively, ""Rear Window"" manages to be consistently engaging though confined to a small setting."

","Rear Window Review The plot of the film is Jefferies sitting in his apartment getting really bored. He decides to take up spying to entertain himself and comes across something very disturbing. He tries to no avail, at first, to convince his friends of what he has seen. His friends soon start to believe him. But is it too late for the ones lives at stake or will they be able to save them.For this film I found that one of the ideas of the film is focusing on watching the crime, or even discovering it. It is very well done video in that respect. This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's thriller films when many of his others are horror. Even if you like horror better, but like Hitchcock, you will like this film. The acting in this film is phenomenal, for he picked the perfect people for the parts. The set was only the courtyard and L.B. Jefferies' apartment. The cinematography is great I felt. Even though there was not much scene movement it was done very well. They make the courtyard look real yet at the same time not. The music was really well done. One of the characters that Jefferies watches is a song writer and helps out in the movie with some of the soundtrack in a minor but very cool way. The actors were amazing or so I felt. With James Stewarts Jefferies and Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Thelma Ritter as Stella, he couldn't have picked a better crew. Over all anyone and everyone should see this movie in their life time."

He spends his days looking out of his rear window. One day he notices one of his neighbors having a big argument, and in the next couple of days the female part of this argument fails to appear and Stewarts character starts to suspect some mischief. This ends up in Jimmy's character, Grace Kelly's character and Thelma Ritters character investigating, and discovering several shocking facts.<br/><br/>As i said, this movie is my personal favorite, some people might find it boring, slow paced and so on.

James Stewart could play characters like this in his sleep, but that fact does not make his performance any less entertaining. Some of the ice melts off of Grace Kelly's facade, and she gives the wittiest and sexiest performance of her career. And who can say enough about Thelma Ritter? A truly unique character actor in the history of cinema, Ritter always played the audience's id, thinking and saying all of the things all of the other characters in the film were too polite or nervous to think and say themselves. She could recite a weather forecast in that sardonic, world-weary monotone of hers, and it would still be funny.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was always able to blend suspense, romance and social commentary to varying degrees of success, but almost always better than most other directors could manage.

Then it went into hibernation for years and years, and I was very happy to see it back. It still is a masterpiece and is a sorry comment on movies today which rely more on technology and violence to hold an audience rather than characters and plot. A really talky film, it's an entire four course meal that truly satisfies. What has always impressed me is the final scene with Thorwald where you actually feel sorry for the guy. It's a rare film maker that can make you do this, after setting him up as the villain for two hours. This film can be studied for the wonderful use of camera alone and still be compelling.

The ending may seem predictable, but the film manages to keep the suspense on. And there lies the beauty of it.<br/><br/>It is not just another spy movie. The film also gives interesting insights of the fifties society. All the neighboring characters represented some portion of the community. The talented musician, the sculptor, the childless couple, the happily married new couple or the sexy ballet dancer -- everybody's lives reflected some part of the photographer's own life and feelings. The film restricts itself in only one set, but that never gets it boring. That's where the brilliance of Hitchcock lies, perhaps."

","This narrative is not about ""voyeurism"" as some have opined; it is about human self assertion in the world of reality, not of people. It also has to be one of Alfred Hithcock's signature noir achievements; it is both popular an estimable for many reasons, I suggest. The set is one of the most memorable and imaginative eve--group of New York apartments across a courtyard, visible from his window to wheel-chair bound photographer Jimmy Stewart as he recovers from an accident suffered while photographing at an auto race track. Bored, he begins observing his neighbors, in a detached, using optical instruments where necessary and taking a few photographs. His would-be-fiancée, pretty Grace Kelly, begins by distrusting his entertaining himself in this manner; but his loquacious maid Thelma Ritter approves of his ""hobby"". When Stewart believes he has discovered a murder perpetrated by Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald, a true figure of menace, he enlists the help of his police detective war buddy played magnificently by Wendell Corey. This is noir because the authorities charged with helping in such a case--his best friend--refuse to believe him. What follows is a double climax that is most exciting. Thorwald catches Kelly searching in the murder apartment, so Stewart has to call police to get her away; and then Thorwald penetrates his anonymity and comes after him, to try to kill him. Kelly does well as Stewart's snooty but courageous girl, and Ritter is in top form as an enthusiastic co-conspirator. No one else is given much to do in the film except to be background characters; but this talented group includes Jesslyn Fax, Frank Cady, songwriter Ross Bagdasarian, Judith Evelyn and Georgine Darcy. This script has been adapted from a fascinating story idea by veteran Cornell Woolrich; John Michael Hayes and director Hitchcock also contributed. This is an expensive-looking production wherein Waxman's subtle score, intricate settings, costumes, art direction, lighting, cinematography and sound are all far-above-average. Stewart has one of his best roles ever here, and Burr despite a lack of lines made a strong impression as the white-haired killer so much older than his own years. The film is perhaps overrated in importance; but it would nearly be impossible to overvalue the skill exerted by Hitchock in camera use or the cleverness of his management of space and time in achieving what we see here. The result is a polished gem of directing, from the daring opening 360 degree establishing pan shot that introduces us to Stewart's presently-limited world of action (with his broken leg) to the exciting climactic battle with Thorwald involving flashbulbs as a defense and police racing to save him before it's too late. Kelly throughout wants him to become a society photographer and marry her; Stewart wants to continue being a free-lance observer of the world in dangerous places. So the underlying theme of this low-key narrative is ""how people need to find out what makes them happy""; the film is Stewart's evidence as ""Scotty"" that he needs to be who he is--a man who slakes his curiosity in the world by observing and remaining just a little detached. A most watchable minor masterpiece; artistically, it's no ""Vertigo"" or ""Duel in the Sun""; it is an undeniable and original classic mystery."

","I love Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' and 'Notorious', so I thought I'd enjoy Rear Window since it's his highest ranked film on IMDb. I thought wrong. As a matter of fact I think this film was just a tab above average, and definitely not as good as the two other films mentioned above. My main beef with Rear Window is that there was simply not enough condemning evidence before the dog got killed to suspect a man of possibly committing murder.<br/><br/>First of all, I didn't think it's too out of ordinary for a jewelry dealer to go out at night. He might be doing business with someone only available at night, and he might have forgotten to bring a few things that the buyer wanted so he came back a couple of times. Maybe he had a argument with his wife and went out a couple of times to clear his mind because he couldn't sleep. Maybe he was smuggling drugs this one time or some other illegal merchandise, and as bad as this is that's still not murder! The possibilities are simply endless.<br/><br/>Second of all, I have knives and saws in my house, and if I'm moving I'd certainly pack everything. Does that make me a murderer if a neighbor should see me packing these things? I wouldn't write this if I am. I think it's quite ridiculous to suspect the husband of CUTTING UP HIS WIFE'S CORPSE simply because he was packing up his knives and saws for relocation.<br/><br/>I have a problem with the purse as well. How in heck did Jeff and Lisa come to the conclusion that the purse they saw was the wife's favorite? My mom's got more than one purse, and she never takes all of them wherever she goes. And how are they so sure that the ring was the wife's wedding band? I bet neither of them had met the wife in person let alone taking notice of her ring.<br/><br/>Lastly, if I was the neighbor, I would laugh off Jeff's accusation, and tell him to get a real hobby 'cause he's got nothing on me. Instead the neighbor freaks out even though he was cool as a cucumber while disposing of his wife's remains.<br/><br/>With all this said, I think the overall plot really fall apart due to these holes. But I did like the concept of Rear Windows. I thought it was really clever how Jeff used his photos to conclude that the flower bed was disturbed, and I enjoyed the suspense when the two women went sleuthing while Jeff watched for the neighbor. I just think there should be more condemning evidence planted to make this film more believable.<br/><br/>All in all: 7/10"
"Jennydavis131","6","1","4","14 March 2004"," slow but good
","This film is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular movies. The movie seems to start out slow and doesn't really pickup the pace until the concluding end. The film is about a man  L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries  played by James Stewart. Jeff has a broken leg and sits in a wheelchair, spending his time spying on his neighbors through a courtyard. When Jeff starts to suspect that one of his neighbors may have killed his wife, he asks his girlfriend Lisa, played by Grace Kelly, what he should do. At first Lisa thinks he might be going mad until she starts to get into the courtyard drama herself. As Jeff's curiosity grows toward his neighbor's abnormal behavior, the suspense starts and you're on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The only great thing in this film is the acting.  Since Stewart can't move much, he uses facial expressions. Those expressions seem to say it all, it adds a lot to his characters behavior. Grace Kelly's performance is also good, as she plays the concerned girlfriend and detective at the same time.<br/><br/>
The reviewer noticed the most peculiar thing about the music in the film. There was no actual background music placed in the movie, all the music that is heard comes from the neighbor's piano or someone's radio/record player. The reviewer has never seen this before in a movie. <br/><br/>This is actually a good film if you can sit through the first hour and a half. The reviewer would recommend this film to people who love Hitchcock , and or old thrillers."
"slugbelle","9","1","4","1 March 2004"," ""Rear Window"" is great and the theme is worth it.
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" lasts in many reviewers' minds simply because of its quality.  The sets and characters add perfectly to the idea and feel of the film.  One of the largest indoor scenes was made for this movie, and used to expose the vulnerability of privacy in daily life.  Jimmy Stewart all alone in an apartment for hours with nothing to do but watch people go by in their own way.  All the while, with his lovely girlfriend trying to win his heart even further.<br/><br/>Along with suspense, great actors, and excellent scenes, Hitchcock silently seeks the right of privacy.  From any open window in the summertime a person can see out, and with a lack of television or an occasional visitor it's much more likely that that window may be his only form of entertainment. <br/><br/>
""Rear Window"" is an excellent movie; it uses small things that make it unique.  During the entire film, no background music is played, just the sounds from neighbors and down the street, making the connections even more exciting.  It is definitely a film to watch, but with the attention that it was something new, and something real.  Not paying attention to detail and specific supports would ruin the movie, but if looked at it is truly a masterpiece."
"JPTaylor","8","1","4","29 February 2004"," It's Hitchcock. What else do you need to know?
","Rear Window, one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous and revered pictures, along with others such as Psycho and Vertigo.  Although the film starts out with a rather slow and meandering pace, it ultimately has the viewer intensely interested.<br/><br/>Its plot  is simple - it's the kind of movie that could be explained to someone in a sentence or two, probably eliciting a ""Hey, that does sound like a good idea for a movieÂ…"" response.  Jimmy Stewart plays L B. Jeffries, a photographer with a broken leg.  Normally a man of action, looking for adventure, Jeffries is now relegated to sitting in front of his window in his wheelchair for hours at a time.  With little else to entertain him aside from the ever-beautiful Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his generously advice-giving nurse Stella(Thelma Ritter), Jeffries looks out the window. And watches.  And watchesÂ…<br/><br/>The cast, while good, is not really the memorable part of this movie.  Jimmy Stewart is, well, Jimmy Stewart.  Grace Kelly is a great supporting actress that performs excellently with what could have been a bland role.  And Thelma Ritter provides the comic relief, convincing as lovably quirky with a straightforward and gruesome sense of logic.<br/><br/>The film succeeds largely because of it's theme.  It taps into the universal human fear of the unexpected return glance - we spend the entire film praying that it wasn't Jimmy Stewart any given stranger was looking at. This works because the entire film is centered on the lead character's point of view.  For almost the entire movie, we never see a camera angle outside of a single apartment - a feat that gives the characters and the audience a feeling of safety that makes the climax all the more suspenseful. This could not have been accomplished without the film's brilliant cinematography.  The movie effortlessly pulls off extremely complicated panoramas, letting us see the entire neighborhood, with all its quirky details, before revealing that this is all seen from the perspective of a single apartment.<br/><br/>The suspense that results is excellent.  Hitchcock has the ability to make a silent phone call more terrifying than anyone else could make the deepest circle of Hell - he seems to possess a brilliant sense of timing and of the audience's reactions.  While it is more of a mystery than a thriller or horror, Hitchcock still manages to manipulate the audience's breath.<br/><br/>While the movie was amazing technically and thematically, some might find it to be too slow-paced and unfocused.  For example, I was not particularly interested in the romance that was seemingly inserted into the movie to fulfill some Hollywood checklist.  And without going into specifics, there were a few places in the movie that seemed rather ridiculous.  Still, Hitchcock's masterful control of suspense and its overall intelligence ultimately outweigh any complaints."
"perfectbond","8","1","4","14 November 2003"," Perfect craftsmanship
","Rear Window is a perfect example of a filmmaker's craftsmanship. In the setup, Hitchcock lets the viewer indulge in his or her natural predilection for voyeurism along with the protagonist. The huge apartment set is perfect for this. There are enough clearly delineated characters that the viewer can usually find at least one to identify with, marginally if not more (besides everyman Stewart of course). Even the villain elicits some sympathy for his circumstances. The actors aren't really challenged by the material but they perform admirably and the incremental increase in the suspense is perfectly paced. I should also mention that glamorous Grace Kelly models some very chic fashions. Another winner from The Master, 9/10."

If one removes those, one is still left with an incredible juggling of multiple agendas in multiple locales at one!<br/><br/>I watched this movie again for probably the 50th time, and was again spellbound by the physical layering of the filmmaking.  Alfred Hitchcock balances action within Stewart's apartment, in the outside courtyard, in several apartments surrounding the courtyard, in hallways leading to those apartments, in an alley leading to the street, on the sidewalk, on the street, to the sidewalk across that street and in the cafe beyond that.  An unbelievable logistical accomplishment.  How very much that personifies the same layering within one of the most superlative scripts ever written.

"Primtime","9","1","4","20 January 1999"," My favourite Hitch
","Rear Window really has to be the Seinfeld of Film. The film really is about nothing, yet succeeds in being one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is superb, plot is very original and of course Hitchcock's direction brings the ordinary to extraordinary.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the theme of privacy or otherwise the lack of it. Jimmy Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer who is confined to his home and his wheelchair after an accident. With nothing to do, he spends his days watching the antics of his neighbours through the rear window of his apartment. Other than daily visits from a nurse (Thelma Ritter)and periodic visits from his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), he basically eats, sleeps and watches the every action of his neighbours.<br/><br/>The story takes an interesting twist when Jeff figures that one of the neighbours he has been wacthing has killed his wife. Jeff brings this up with his girlfriend, nurse and an old wartime pal who is now a detective. At first, each of them have their doubts about Jeff's beliefs, however, it is only a matter of time until each of them are drawn into the situation as well. The last half hour of this film is done perfectly; incredibly suspenseful and yet not overpowering or unbelievable.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly's performance in this film is probably her best. The introduction of her into this film is remarkable and probably the object of many mens' fantasies. She maintains a level of being something more than just Jeff's girlfriend throughout the film and has incredible chemistry with Stewart, something that isn't seen in most other films. Thelma Ritter plays well in a slightly comical role as the nurse who stays true to Jeff even though he is a man that she hardly even knows. Orson Wells has such a minor role in this film and spends 95% of his screen time being watched, not heard. However, in his confrontation, he strikes fear in the viewer without even being heard before the scene.<br/><br/>This film is on my top ten list and deserves more exposure than other more popular Hitchcock films (Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho). Hitchcock surely did well here.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

"lady4u68","10","1","5","22 May 2005"," one of my favorite movies!!
","I first saw this movie when it was on Turner Classic Movies a few months ago. It has become one of my favorite movies in this short time. My least favorite part of the movie is the romance between Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly's characters. It's hard for me to get past the fact that there was over 20 years' age difference between them in real life, but that's beside the point that this is a great movie. I still rate it a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. (Besides, it's perfectly acceptable in real life for a man to have a wife/girlfriend 20-30 years younger than him). Anyway, the acting is just wonderful! <br/><br/>I like Thelma Ritter's supporting role of Stella; she has some funny lines. I just love the plot, and the other inhabitants of the apartments around Jefferies. The first time I saw the movie, I thought Lisa was going to be killed when she was caught in Thorwald's apartment, while Jeff watched helpless across the courtyard. That would have seemed to me to be a typical plot twist in a Hitchcock movie. I think the scene near the end when Raymond Burr comes over to Jeff's apartment to confront him, and ultimately try to kill him, is just great. I think it's so chilling how Hitchcock had the set lit, so you can only see Thorwald's glasses and eyes; it's just so menacing to me. Every time I watch a Perry Mason rerun on the Hallmark channel now and see Raymond Burr, I think of his role in this movie. Anyway, just a great movie, one of my favorites. I highly recommend buying the DVD."
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","5","18 May 2005"," a classic in the true sense of the word
","""Rear Window"" begins with some curtains opening in front of a window, as though the curtain in front of a movie screen is opening. Then, in several shots of the apartment, we learn through some photographs that reporter L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), the apartment's inhabitant, is wheelchair-bound due to an accident. Jeff passes time looking at the various goings-on in the surrounding apartments. Currently, his only true companion is his neighbor Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). Then, after observing some unclear incidents, Jeff begins to get suspicious that one of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may be up to something.<br/><br/>Whether or not Thorwald did anything is not really the movie's point. ""Rear Window"" is almost like several movies within one: Ms. Lonelyhearts, the Musician, the Dancer, and others (the opening scene reinforces the movies-within-a-movie theme). Hitchcock uses the ingenious trick of giving the audience Jeff's POV shot (that's point-of-view, for non-movie buffs), particularly when Jeff looks through the camera lens. Of course, Hitchcock would later famously use voyeurism in ""Psycho"", but here, it is essentially part of the plot.<br/><br/>Aside from camera angle, the characters are important. Jeff is the main character, but Lisa takes an unusual approach. She introduces herself as: Lisa (she turns on a lamp)...Carol (she turns on a second lamp)...Fremont (she turns on a third lamp). This not only makes her more imposing, but it figures in the question of who ""wears the pants"" in this apartment (which comes up again in the movie's final scene).<br/><br/>I guess that ""Rear Window""'s overall point is that no one truly knows anyone else. But, as Hitchcock said in promoting the movie: ""If you do not experience a delicious chill while watching 'Rear Window', then pinch yourself. You are most probably dead."" I couldn't have said it better myself."

","Rear Window is highly over-rated, but still enjoyable. This tale of voyeurism benefits greatly from Hitch's technical brilliance and a charming and believable turn from Jimmy Stewart, but suffers thanks to a dreadfully out of tone score and a lack of suspense, although that's probably because it was made nearly 50 years ago.

","There's already enough praise for this near-perfect film on here so i won't waste time saying things others have said more eloquently. I just happened to watch both rear window and eyes wide shut recently, and wondered if anyone else had noticed the numerous similarities between the two films? The theme of voyeurism, and the way the two great (greatest?) directors lure into replicating the star's observations and mentality is the most obvious link.<br/><br/>However, the first connection i noticed was the use of colour in the films- both are consistently placing orange and blue together throughout, especially in rear window. Are these the colours of voyeurism? or paranoia??? Kubrick also used oranges and blues alot in the shining, another film which explores the themes of observation, (self-created) illusions, reality and paranoia (the 'overlook hotel' anyone?). I'd really like someone to discuss the colours used in these films and their effects with me, as i basically have little knowledge of what these are supposed to represent.<br/><br/>
Beyond the colour scheme, there is also the remarkable similarities between Grace Kelly and Nicole Kidman in appearance and manner- knowing how meticulous kubrick was i can't help but think he perhaps cast Kidman  with this in mind.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Tom cruise, and where my argument either fails, or is perhaps inhanced, depending on your view of the films. James Stewart gives perhaps the most charismatic  performance of his brilliant ouevre-  while Tom Cruise is almost unbearably shallow, egotistical and repulsive. However, i think it could be argued that the two protagonist's have many connections- both are vain (Stewart's character has his own photos all over his house and seems a touch conceited when discussing his career), stubborn, and perhaps, and this only implicit in eyes wide shut, impotent- Stewart's physically unable to move, and the film cuts with the implication that he and kelly will have sex one night, but then in the morning it doesn't appear that they did. Could be argued that both films centre around the imaginations and intellectual compensations of frustrated men, who attempted to reassure their masculinity by by looking for adventure? The crucial difference is that in eyes wide shut nothing is resolved, and no one is satisfied, and that in rear window Stewart is vindicated, everyone (including the audience) is satisfied, and all is resolved- hence we feel enjoyment and are not left feeling uneasy for complying with his voyeurism, while at the end of eyes wide shut most people are left feeling manipulated and dissatisfied. hmmmmm...."

Not a lot happens in the first eighty minutes, and then a lot happens in the last half hour, and it just all feels off. There's only so many scenes of James Stewart watching his neighbours that I can watch before I start to feel a little bored. I get what the film's trying to say about voyeurism and all that, and the set the movie's filmed on was definitely impressive for its time, but overall I found the film a bit of a chore to get through.

","According to today's viewing requirements, there are also some regrets in the filming of ""Rear Window"".

The stage effect of the film is strong, and the neighbors outside the window look very much like performing oboe on the stage. Nevertheless, this 1953 film still highlights its strong artistic appeal. Hitchcock is great!"

","I saw this movie in my teens and I dare say I owe it a re-watch but I remember it as a slow and flaccid affair that doesn't do much with its theme of voyeurism.<br/><br/>Instead it is just a straightforward thriller that could have been a neat twilight zone episode or certainly a good 20 minute film but is stretched way too thin with a romantic subplot just shoehorned in.<br/><br/>I can't help but think he could have just ignored everything and been fine. The movie doesn't even explore the nature of his obsession, you just have to role with how he puts himself in peril even though he has a broken leg. I guess he's trying to be a conscientious citizen but he's not going to bring the wife back to life and it isn't worth putting an uxorcidal husband to justice if another person has to get killed in the process.<br/><br/>People call it a classic and i don't like to think I'm unable to appreciate those but this is another one of those Hitchcocks where you get a lot of showy cinematography around a tepid, over-long story.<br/><br/>It also has no atmosphere, the tone being more like a sitcom, making the moments of tenseness seem jarring rather than creepy."

Clearly still a good film but rather drawn out and theatrical without, if truth be told, very much going on. James Stewart is fine but I've never been a fan of Grace Kelly.

"skipari","7","0","2","22 August 2016"," Overall good, but some unexpected yet significant flaws
","The symbolic allusions of ""Rear window"" and its perspectives on human frailty, relationship and gender role issues all condensing into the interestingly put conflict around (vain) voyeurism (and rudimentary self-confrontation) would be one reason to like this film. The setting is quite impressive for the time and the makers obviously had an eye for the details, so it is definitely worth looking deeper into the film during some scenes. It has got plenty of moments of really well-placed laconic humour; some things even appear ironic or satirical to me (like the aftermath of the dog-strangling), which I am not sure they are always entirely meant to be... Anyway, what actually put me a little off the film was the blandness of its plot-development and particularly the ending, which (to me) seemed so predictable, one would not even have predicted it, thus its lack off deepness and the inconsistency with the film's meta-critique on human nature what about an alternative ending, that had potentially played out there instead, as when Miss Lonely-heart could have attempted pill-overdosing suicide right in front of the 'bystanders' eyes who'd rather fantasise about a pathetic murder-story than recognising some serious problems and taking on a conflict around their social responsibility, which seems a little construed as it is like this there are also plot wholes which to me get quite significant: E.g. Who is the woman that leaves the apartment in the morning together with Thorwald and what about the inspector's reports? It's not that I think that this were necessarily important information for the viewer, but because the ending gives away all of the film's ambiguity howsoever, these sources of doubt and suspense seem absurd and have to be perceived rather like mistakes. I don't want to be too hard on the film though, the acting is done as professional as one could wish for and I like the straight-forward camera work, so my overall impression is still positive, although I don't consider this the classic that most people regard it as and in my mind it falls a little short of Hitchcocks best films. 6,5 points (make for 7)"

","Dear Alfred Hitchcock, <br/><br/>the mating dance between James Stewart and Grace Kelly was tiring. Kelly wore some amazing costumes but I simply could not think of her as a sexy woman who was coveted by Stewart's character. The people who inhabited the apartments were all boring at best. The main plot was so damn unbelievable! Stewart's character could look into everyone's apartment, but nobody could see him looking. But then the film was made in 1954. I guess it is a pretty racy for a film made in the 50s.<br/><br/>Your film is almost like a rallying cry against individuality and personal freedom. The loud and clichéd lament by the woman whose dog dies was quite cringe worthy. We are hit on the head with the demerits of the breakdown of the family system and the emptiness of the resultant loneliness. There are two single female characters and a lonely male pianist in the apartment complex. <br/><br/>I watched the film on Blu Ray. It was nice to look at. But the exchanges between Stewart, Kelly and the lady who played his masseur were sleep inducing. The film deserves a re-imagining.<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin."

"m13152295","10","0","1","4 August 2016"," The Great Alfred Hitchcock
","Maybe a lot of people are Hitchcock fans because of ""Psycho"", but I was because of the weird ""Rear Window"" and completely hooked on Hitchcock. To say why I so love, the ""Rear Window"". The reasons are the following several points: the first is, of course, Hitchcock trademark suspense and thriller, although the film in the performance is not as good as ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"", but rely on peeping the subject is in accordance with very own set. From the use of the telescope to observe the suspect activity to suspect a step by step approach the protagonist, in show story Hitchcock still display the horror of its powerful manufacturing ability. I believe that every fan friends will be at heart a tight, with the protagonist and the excitement of life and death. Second, excellent perception of shooting technique. Hitchcock in addition to known as the master of suspense, he is also famous technical innovator; whether it is the one shot in the ""Rope"", or the famous stairs lens in ""Vertigo"", Hitchcock to smell a very strong shooting technique. In the ""Rear Window"" Hitchcock is used more first person peep lens and a smooth sliding lens; the former audience have a strong sense of substitution, while the latter is director story window, have played a great role. It can be said that, because of the excellent shooting technology, can make the ""Rear Window"" exudes the greatest charm. Third, the realistic significance of the subject matter of the peep. Each person will have so a little peep of mind, have wanted to spying on the neighbours or is the opposite building tenants living conditions; and the ""Rear Window"" James Stewart played the role, small to meet the our voyeuristic desire. The last point is Hitchcock's highly attractive storytelling ability. Until the end of the story, who is the murderer we do not know, the strange and strange nursing work and the story of the end of the story is covered with mist. If the screen before you who is the murderer and 100 think not to get its solution, even in the process of thinking feel creepy. Then you will in the Hitchcock's trap, in the nether world of Hitchcock should also grinning from ear; for audience obsession and indulge in them is the results he wanted. As to who is the murderer, he does not care about it."
"C22Man","10","0","1","11 July 2016"," Masterpiece of Suspense, Voyeurism and Film-Making
","The true strength of Rear Window lies with Alfred Hitchcock's understanding of voyeurism. How spying on people and seeing things we shouldn't can be thrilling. For the entirety of the film we're looking through the eyes of our main character Jeff, looking at things he knows he shouldn't be. We become connected to Jeff and when he can't stop himself from seeing and believing things he shouldn't, nor can we. This is the genius of Hitchcock. His main character becomes a vessel. We live the film through him. We share all of the opinions, concerns and limitations he has as a result.<br/><br/>Jeff is a notable photographer laid up after breaking his leg and in a cast up to his hip. It's established that he's man of action, a veteran of war and used to globetrotting wherever the job takes him. Hitchcock notes all of this smartly with subtle visuals and dialogue. It's no surprise that being stuck in his apartment leaves Jeff bored, so to pass the time by he begins to spy on his neighbours. His nurse Stella, detective friend Doyle and fiancé Lisa are initially concerned by his behaviour. This conduct is tied to Jeff. He's unable to commit to Lisa and it reinforces her view that'd he rather live through others than himself. The relationship creates an interesting dynamic, as if he gets more gratification spying than from Lisa. Both James Stewart and Grace Kelly are perfect here. Stewart always convinces as the normal guy in over his head and Kelly's elegance adds layers of charm to Lisa.<br/><br/>Jeff's prying has unexpected consequences. He becomes convinced that a salesman named Thorwald, who lives in the apartment opposite, has murdered his wife. He sees newly dug spots in the flower bed, a suitcase bound by ropes and the wife completely absent. The film excellently follows a thread where we don't feel cheated because, even though he can jump to conclusions, we see Jeff work everything out. We see him piece together the information and consider its importance. Initially nobody believes him, but little by little and as more becomes apparent it turns out he might just be right. This is all visual story-telling done to perfection. We don't even need words to understand what is taking place. What we see through the lens and piece together is enough. <br/><br/>It's intriguing how the seduction of crime is used. Not in taking part in one, but in discovering it. Jeff is snapped out of his boredom when he thinks he's caught someone up to no good. It gives him something to concentrate his efforts on. When Doyle initially tells him that the he has evidence that Thorwald is innocent Jeff is greatly disappointed and so are we. Not because we want someone to be dead, but because we lose the wonder of figuring out what happened. The film plays with moral and psychological issues like that brilliantly. Jeff isn't a detective or a do-gooder, he' simply a normal person. It makes the character more relatable. He sometimes lets situations occur he shouldn't because there's nothing he can do to stop them, he's just an observer. When he wants police action there is nothing he can do. When he can't prove anything he feels frustrated. We can ask ourselves what we'd do in those situations. Probably something similar.<br/><br/>For me this is the film that secured Hitchcock's position as the master of suspense and as a master filmmaker. Initially the film seems relatively smooth, yet once Jeff believes he's found a murderer the feeling of unease just keeps on building and building. I no problems in saying that the films climax is one of the most nerve-wracking I've ever witnessed in a film. As Jeff is wheelchair bound we know there is little he can do if spotted and that adds an extra layer of vulnerability. When Lisa risks her neck to investigate there is no way to alert her of danger. We share that same sense of helplessness. Apparently Hitchcock shot all of the film from inside Jeff's apartment, providing a real authenticity to what we see play out. In fact, I think the set itself deserves a mention for just how well-crafted and intricate it is. <br/><br/>The heights of suspense, tension and threat reached in Rear Window are so great that very few films have ever been able to come close to following it. For a film that has little connection to policing, serial killers or the unknown that is some achievement. It's also why the film is held in such high regard to this day. It connects the audience directly to the main character. Everything he does we have to follow, almost as if we ourselves are sharing the secrets that he discovers. It also explains why the film's suspense works so well, we are equally as scared of being found out. Tapping into all kinds of thoughts and fears whilst remaining effortlessly gripping. It showed perfectly that Hitchcock was a master of his craft."

","Actually I don't know why I put the ""(1954)"" up there. It's not like I ever want to see the remake.<br/><br/>In my fifth examination of Hitchcock, following Psycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite so far. And that said, it's still incredible work here. From the direction to the incredible script to the originality from back then and even today to the acting to the ultimate suspense, everything worked extremely well together.<br/><br/>Twenty years before another great director, Steven Spielberg, would achieve giving extras (the town folk in Jaws) living and breathing souls, Hitchcock already mastered it here in multiple and beautifully choreographed apartments and their tenants. Who could argue that Hitchcock wasn't just the master, but he was always decades ahead of everyone else?<br/><br/>A photographer on his last week of being in a cast witnesses what he thinks are clues to a murder that may or may not have happened across his courtyard and in an apartment their windows face. No one believes his suspicions at first, but then everyone's on board, with the exception his ex-war buddy turned detective. Was he right? Will he get the evidence he needs since he's wheelchair-bound? Will he ever be nice to his too-good-for-him girlfriend?<br/><br/>The movie is so contained and yet so interesting. Only one shot takes place outside of his small apartment and the camera doesn't range outside of the courtyard and into the view of the other apartments from the photographer's point of view. That alone is noteworthy, but Director Hitchcock (and writer John Michael Hayes) didn't stop there. The interactions were spot on, the mystery was believable and it was even fun being a peeping tom right along our ""hero."" Not to mention, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the appropriate comedic relief bantersfrom a movie more than 60 years old. <br/><br/>Also funny, maybe it was just me, but I've started and stopped this movie a few times over the past couple of decades. For reasons, I don't recall. But, once I finally allowed myself to carry through to the end, I was, of course, not disappointed. You shouldn't be either.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Now, I wasn't around in the 50s, but I guess the only thing I didn't buy was how an incredible dame like Grace Kelly would fall for the 21-year-older (who looked even older than that) James Stewart. I guess, to each their own, but he was never really pleasant to her, in addition to the age difference and attractive-scale. Humph."

","Alfred Hitchcock often liked to set himself a challenge when it came to settings for his thrillers. The entire action of ""Lifeboat"", for example, takes place in a lifeboat on the open sea. The entire action of ""Rope"", shot using the ""ten minute take"" technique, takes place in a single flat, as does most of the action of ""Dial M for Murder"".<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is equally confined in its setting, and stars James Stewart (who had also starred in ""Rope"") and Grace Kelly (who had earlier in the same year also starred in ""Dial M for Murder""). Stewart here plays L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, a freelance photographer, who is temporarily confined to a wheelchair in his New York apartment after breaking his leg. The whole of the action takes place in Jeff's apartment and in the neighbouring apartments which he can see from his windows. For much of the film nothing much happens. Jeff gazes out of the window at his neighbours, most of whom have left their own windows open because of the hot weather. He holds a conversation with his nurse, Stella, and another more serious one with his girlfriend, Lisa. Lisa, a socialite from a wealthy family, wants Jeff to marry her, but he is not keen because he thinks she could never fit in with his adventurous lifestyle and he could never fit in with hers.<br/><br/>And then, something Jeff sees from his window makes him suspicious. He comes to believe that one of his neighbours, Lars Thorwald, may have murdered his wife. Unable to leave his room, however, Jeff has to rely upon Lisa and his old army friend Tom Doyle, now a police detective, to investigate, even though both (especially Tom) are initially sceptical. (Thorwald, interestingly enough, is played by Raymond Burr who would later himself become famous for playing a wheelchair-bound detective, the title character in ""A Man Called Ironside"").<br/><br/>Few reviewers seem able to comment on this film without using the word ""voyeur"" or ""voyeurism"", yet I do not think that these are necessarily appropriate words in this context. Jeff may be a ""voyeur"" in the original French sense of ""one who sees"", but he is not really a ""voyeur"" in the English sense, which generally implies both a sexual motive and an invasion of someone else's privacy. Admittedly, one of Jeff's neighbours, whom he nicknames ""Miss Torso"", is an attractive young woman who likes to exercise in a revealing top and shorts, but as she is happy to flaunt her charms in full view of everyone in the block of flats, it can hardly be said that he is violating her privacy. Given his interest in the psychology of the criminal or deviant mind, Hitchcock would doubtless have loved to make a film about a ""voyeur"" in the full sense of that word, but in 1954, with the Production Code still in force, that was never going to be a possibility. When Michael Powell did make such a film, ""Peeping Tom"", several years later (in Britain rather than America) the resulting critical backlash severely damaged his career.<br/><br/>The film is often referred to as being among the greatest movies ever made, but I've never really understood why. I probably wouldn't even rank it among Hitchcock's top ten. It lacks the two factors which are the hallmarks of the director's really great thrillers- genuine suspense and psychological insight. Hitchcock gives us a number of compelling psychological portraits of his villains, such as Uncle Charlie in ""Shadow of a Doubt"",Alex Sebastian in ""Notorious"", Bruno in ""Strangers on a Train"" and Norman Bates in ""Psycho"". Thorwald by comparison is a mere cardboard cut-out. For most of the running-time the film is largely suspense-free, until the end when Thorwald breaks into Jeff's apartment and tries to push him out of the window, but nobody will ever include this moment among Hitchcock's great cliff-hangers, certainly not when compared to similar moments in the likes of the original ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The 39 Steps"" and ""North By North West"".<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's all very cleverly worked out, and Stewart makes a personable hero, although Kelly as Lisa is little more than window dressing. It's more than just minor-league Hitchcock (unlike, say, ""Stage Fright"" or ""Torn Curtain""), and I would certainly rate it more highly than the dull ""Dial M for Murder"". It's a reasonably made thriller, but no masterpiece. 7/10"
"Horror-yo","7","0","1","18 May 2016"," Strong Hitchcock, as usual
","This here is a strong Hitchcock film with Stewart playing the lead role of a newly handicapped man haunted by boredom who seeks a bit of entertainment while he's stranded in his little apartment unable to walk; but in a deeper aspect, seeks a certain quality out of his lady, here the beautiful Grace Kelly, whom he judges is too 'ordinary'. The film is well executed, the story well developed and the climax of the events leads to a climax in the emotional department at the same time, like a catharsis for the characters. Not easy to make a film based on such a simple premise, and yet, Hitchcock does it again. The film never gets complacent and seeks to constantly bring just enough to justify its playing time, while not going overboard or derailing from the plot, something mediocre films tend to do when the plot is this simple and they need to inject a dynamic into the events. A film with purpose that doesn't just tell an intriguing suspenseful story. Another solid Hitchcock."

","Jeff Jefferies is a photographer who likes to spy on the lives of his neighbors through the rear windows, until it begins to suspect that one of them killed his wife. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is written by John Michael Hayes, with the participation of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>This is one of the most famous films of Hitchcock and has been several remakes target. Like many of the films of this director, it could almost be staged as a play, given that almost all the action takes place in the same place: the apartment of the protagonist. The script is excellent, although moments of too much predictability. The performance of the main actors is impeccable and striking, and I consider this one of the best films of Kelly's career. The photograph also deserves a very positive note. The rest (soundtrack, costumes, scenery etc.) is reasonable without surprise or particular attention.<br/><br/>I always heard people talk of this movie when it came in Hitchcock's name. But to see the film, I was of the opinion that this director did some more interesting and remarkable films. Either way, it's a good movie, it is worth to be seen and appreciated, and that will please a lot to most suspense fans or thrillers."
"PrashunChakraborty","9","0","1","14 April 2016"," Another great notch in Hitchcock's belt
","I love Hitchcock movies and this one is no different, I watched this last week so needless to say I am late to the party. However this is one of the hallmarks of a good film that it ages properly and is still relevant even though 60 plus years have passed since it's release. Since it's a Hitchcock film the less spoken about the plot it's better so that you guys can experience it for yourself. So the plot goes like this, an ace photographer (L.B. Jefferies played by James Stewart) injures himself in his previous assignment, now this curious mind who is on a wheelchair because of his cast has developed into a peeping tom because he is restless fellow to whom reading a book would be far less interesting than analyzing and judging his neighbors. While this starts out as a harmless pass time it soon devolves to murder or at least some suspicion of it. In the mix of it all is Jeff's girlfriend played by Grace Kelly who looks good, I mean so gorgeous I don't think anyone has ever looked as good as her in any movie. Other present are, Jeff's skeptic cop friend and his nurse who is his moral voice but eventually jumps in with both feet later on.<br/><br/>I have always believed Hitchcock makes complete entertaining films, and this one is no different, it's sexy, has romance, murder et al. It could even be argued that romance is perhaps the more dominant genre in Rear Window than the thriller and murder mystery aspect as Liza Jeff's girlfriend plays his detective partner when he is shunned by his therapist and cop friend. Does Liza believe the ludicrous stories of Jeff? Is she doing all this just to win Jeff's affection? The movie leaves this all in the air for the audience to think and ponder about and refuses to spoon feed it to us. Liza is opposite of Jeff, he craves adventure she loves fashion, he likes to keep moving from place to place and she likes to lay down roots the movie shows the audience how different they are and we wonder why did they hook up in the first place? The answer is there in the film, these two love each other and these are shallow differences and they are more compatible on a deeper level. The film also can be quite meta and talks about neighbors being selfish and not caring for one another and the loss of simpler times when people weren't so cold and isolated. All in all I really liked this movie but would still place it below the holy Hitchcock trinity of Vertigo (my favorite), Psycho and North by Northwest."

"lordchootapa","10","0","1","31 December 2015"," Innovative Setting, Brilliant Character Study
","To me, setting is one of the most important factors in any film. The main draws of The Searchers for me (far from John Wayne's Ethan Edwards or the 'groundbreaking' take on racism) was the beauty, isolation and vastness of Monument Valley; While I love all of East of Eden, you can't beat the beautiful landscapes and scenery that surround the area the story is told in; Even though The Wizard Of Oz's painted backdrops are painfully obvious, the cheesiness is what draws me to the movie. What I'm getting at is that even if I don't particularly love a movie's plot, characters, acting, what have you, it's really the setting and sets that make or break a movie for me. Rear Window has a top-notch, fascinating set that I fell in love with from minute 1 (or 2, I can't remember how long the jazzy credit sequence is).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie has it all, namely a compelling plot that stems from an innovative idea (man breaks leg and has to stay in his apartment, man occupies himself by watching his neighbors out his window, man sees something he's not supposed to see and spends the rest of the movie trying to prove that he saw what he wasn't supposed to), to put it in the simplest terms. It's this plot and the idea of a forced-static setting that makes this movie so hard to turn away from. Apparently, Hitchcock only filmed from the same room that James Stewart and the audience are 'stuck' in for the duration of the film. This increases the sense of suburban claustrophobia, being too close to people it seems you should be able to trust, if for no other reason than the fact that you can see what they are doing at all times, just by peeking out your window. You're really there with the characters, hearing the neighbor's noises and looking right into their homes and, moreover, their lives.<br/><br/>If nothing else in a film matters, characters do. I feel that Grace Kelly kind of steals the show. It may seem like her character undergoes a change over the course of the movie, but this is not the case, we've just been looking at everything from Jeff's (Stewart's) perspective: Early on, he gripes about Lisa (Kelly), saying she's ""too perfect"" and complaining that a person of her social standing and class would have no place in his supposedly rough-and-tumble lifestyle as a photographer. A little later, after Lisa puts the note under Thorwald's door and experiences a close call almost getting caught, she rushes back to Jeff's apartment, and as she remarks excitedly on her quest, we are given a closeup of Jeff's suddenly lovestruck face. This is where you see a transformation in Lisa, and see that Jeff is really falling for her now. In actuality, this is a transformation in Jeff: He never gave Lisa the chance to prove that she's more than a pretty, privileged face, but once she does it on her own, he begins to really fall for her, seeing that she might actually have a place in his adventurous lifestyle. By the time Lisa sneaks into Thorwald'a apartment and pokes around (eventually getting caught red handed), Jeff is in obvious pain at seeing Lisa in such a dangerous situation, and we know he's hooked.<br/><br/>Stewart, to me, is less charming, and maybe the only flaw in the movie. His ornery behavior to every single person he encounters (and they're all visiting him in his own home while he's wheelchair-ridden) is annoying and does not aid his character development at all: it seems like L.B Jeffries can only get better from the start, but he's been such a jerk that the last 15 minutes of realizing he really DOES love Lisa don't really redeem him in my eyes. Speaking of Lisa, she is obviously far younger and more attractive, yet he acts like HE'S the real catch of the two (Kelly only helps this vibe along, drooling all over him and practically begging him to include her in his future). It's all a little hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Don't worry, though, this movie is hardly about romance, or even really about the relationship between Lisa and Jeff: it's a fascinating study of the average neighborhood, populated with newlyweds, mature married couples, popular young women, lonely older women, people who seem happy around others but are miserable alone, artists, grouches, and occasionally, people who reach their breaking point. And all this is viewed from one man's apartment window. <br/><br/>The set is believable, the people even more so, and It's the innovative idea of forced-static setting that makes it so important to see at least once."

","To start out I have to say how much I love Alfred Hitchcock and his films. And this film is just another testament to that fact. I absolutely loved this film from the beginning to the end. I got sucked in right from the beginning and not just because of the plot, but because of how amazing the set was. I thought the set was absolutely marvelous and I was glad that the whole movie took place within it and from the view of James Stewarts' character's apartment. Another aspect of the movie that I was very drawn to was the fact that film had a main storyline, with the husband across the way potentially having murdered his wife, but the film also follows the storyline of the other people in the apartment complex throughout the whole film. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack to the movie and how it was played on the piano by one of the neighbors, whose story was one that was also followed. Besides all of that, the main plot to the movie was great as well and I love that it was done from the view of the main character's apartment the whole time. Not only was this a cool and interesting way to film the movie, but I think it as an excellent way to build up the suspense. A good example would be in the scenes when they view the neighbor sitting in the darkness of his apartment with only the end of his cigar being visible. Overall, I loved this film through and through and I plan to watch it quite a few more times in the future."

","This movie is maybe a little silly and a little dated by today's standards, but that does not matter. It is still a very good movie, with both suspense, love, human interest - and a little humour as well. The murder mystery is not that very exciting, maybe, but it kept me guessing to the end.<br/><br/>By the way, I knew an old woman once, who did the same as the main character in this movie: she watched her neighbours all waking hours and invented fantastic stories about them. If one of them got a table with a certain thickness delivered, she believed that the person smuggled something inside it. If a woman often had her brother as a visitor, she believed that they were having an incestuous relationship... and she would not listen to reason. So I could relate to this situation! :-) <br/><br/>Grace Kelly did not rub me the wrong way, as she usually does. Probably because she was only playing herself - a spoilt, shallow and quite unintelligent brat. She could not go wrong on that, could she! James Stewart was lovable with his wholesome and decent aura, as usual. He was at his most attractive here; still extremely handsome and virile-looking, but with the graying hair and first wrinkles of the dependable and experienced middle-aged man."
"stevedoc1965","9","0","1","26 March 2015"," A movie within a movie within movie!
","This movie is a ""movie within a movie within a movie"", and for that reason alone it is genius. First, we have the cinematic frame of the audience with us as viewer. Then we have Jimmy Stewart's rear window in his apartment, which becomes the camera lens onto the frame of the courtyard and the windows of the apartment block facing his. Each facing window then becomes a smaller movie screen revealing a vignette. Rear Window makes a strong statement about the act of voyeurism, (the greatest movie in this regard is the outstanding Peeping Tom, I think) something we instinctively know is wrong but cannot resist, as Jimmy Stewart's character reveals with his frequent use of binoculars. Rear Window is ultimately about the nature of film, wrapped up in a compelling murder mystery that informs us about human nature and our compulsion to watch. I think it really ought to be high on anyone's list of all time greats."

","Starting off, it seemed like an OK film, I mean it was made in the 50's and it showed. However, things got rolling when Jefferies first suspects the murder and suddenly the audience is very involved. Most of the time we see what Jefferies sees, but sometimes we get a glimpse of more. This and the fact that we see only windows from other buildings, is very Hitchcock like, in the sense that he was heavily influenced by psychoanalysts like Freud.<br/><br/>He plays a lot on the sense of frames: the screen we're watching it on –> the camera lens –> the window Jefferies looks out of –> the windows of the neighbours he/we see through. And essentially he is the voyeur and we are the voyeur x2.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good overall, Stewart does an all right job, though isn't very convincing in his argument. Kelly was good too, and her character was well established, though the romance scenes between them were very stale and awkward to watch. However, Raymond Burr really transmits the aura of his character so well and we as the audience can feel a kind of tension surrounding him.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't know what this film was about until I watched it, and didn't know if he did or did not kill his wife. So I was trying to figure it out as the film progressed, and it was very engaging. The last scene was really well done, when it got to the climax I think I was unconsciously tensing up. The look gave me the shivers. <br/><br/>Side-note: Heard that the movie 'Disturbia' was based on this.

All the neighbors seen out his rear window are interesting characters even though we only learn bits and pieces of their lives as seen through the eyes of the injured Stewart. The actors who played these roles did a great job considering their screen time was limited. The neighbor who was the murderer was seen more than the others through the window, but even he didn't speak much until the end of the movie so there was a lot of great acting with facial expressions and body language. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.

","There's nothing to be said of this movie that hasn't already been said. It's magnificent. The film is a shining example of Hitchcock's mastering of pace. There are films that bring you slowly into a place where you don't realize what's happened and you know there's no turning back. Rear Window is that kind of movie. It creeps into the film and by the time the action (the murder) takes place, you're too invested to get out.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Grace Kelly and James Stewart and I think the pairing is an excellent choice (Though Cary Grant will always be my favorite of that era).<br/><br/>All in all, if you're expecting the kind of suspense film that throws you right into everything, check out something else.

The detective movie aura presented isn't one with rich and intriguing details, rather it's one with so many parts built of hunches and intuition, yet it proves to be a classic after all. I like how the movie played with the mood, downplaying and emphasizing back and forth both the mood and the pace. After watching North by Northwest, Psycho, and Rear Window, in that order, I now have a greater regard toward how Alfred Hitchcock handles his movies' concepts, plots, and the general direction. James Stewart performed better in other movies, in my opinion. But I like how Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter acted out.

","James Stewart fans will enjoy this movie. Stewart drives this movie forward. The movie also provides an interesting glimpse of contemporary urban life. Although the movie is a crime drama, it depicts the compartmentalization of existence and the isolation of individuals in large groups. People live in the same building, yet there is no sense of community. A murder can take place and nobody would even know it. The most nefarious acts could take place and nobody would know it. People living in close proximity yet emotionally so disconnected. This is captured by this movie. The social statement may be unintentional yet it is unmistakable. The format of the story itself does not seem complicated: a man watches his neighbors and believes that something bad has happened. The problem is in trying to prove it. Hitchcock uses several clever devices to heighten the suspense. But it is the acting of James Stewart that takes precedence. This is James Stewart at his best."

","Amongst all the movies Alfred Hitchcock has made in his illustrious career, Rear Window (1954) is certainly one of his best. This movie managed to keep me so engaged from start to finish and has certainly cemented its place amongst the greatest movies in the mystery thriller genre.<br/><br/>Rear Window is about a photographer, LB Jefferies (James Stewart), who after breaking his leg in an accident is confined to a wheelchair in his apartment. Therefore, he has grown quite stubborn and frustrated. He has a therapist, named Stella (Thelma Ritter) treating him and a young and beautiful socialite girlfriend named Lisa (Grace Kelly) whom he is not keen to marry. In this seemingly boring life, he spends his time by looking at his neighbors through his window. One night, he hears a woman screaming and sees a man exit from the house where he heard it. Throughout the night, the same man is seeing entering and exiting his home making mysterious trips. This is enough to make him suspicious. Tension grows when in the morning; the man is seen cleaning a knife and saw in his house. Jeff is convinced that he has killed his wife. I do not want to spoil what happens next.<br/><br/>One element that makes this movie intriguing is the absolutely brilliant cinematography. The whole crowded neighborhood is wonderfully captured by the eye of the camera. All the neighbors seem to be so close to each other. Throughout the movie, the camera occasionally moves around the neighborhood slowly moving from house to house, introducing us to new characters. A woman who is always exercising, a songwriter, a lonely and desperate woman, to name a few. This only adds to the mysterious feel of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock's direction makes us feel something is wrong but we don't know what and that leaves our eyes glued to the movie. The soundtrack was complementary to the cinematography, adding to the beautiful cinematic portrayal of the mysterious atmosphere.<br/><br/>I have to compliment Thelma Ritter, Grace Kelly and especially James Stewart who gives a stellar performance as Jefferies. You could literally feel the desperation in him on unraveling the mystery.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. At times it gets a bit slow but that is justified as this adds to the suspense. If you are planning to watch it, prepare for edge-of-the-seat stuff throughout and I certainly recommend you to watch it."
"ComedyFan2010","10","0","3","20 June 2014"," Voyeristic suspense
","I think this movie is a real masterpiece. Hitchcock's original style combined with a great cast deliver a beautiful outcome.<br/><br/>First of all I really enjoy the atmosphere of the movie. It is a combination of suspense and voyeurism. It is achieved by keeping us inside Jeff's apartment all the time. We look with him out of the window and this is how we get to know his neighbors and collect information and clues about the potential murder that occurred. One is always a bit on the edge wondering what really has happened and one also develops an interest in other residents of the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Hitchcock achieved it well by creating some outstanding residents. No, they are not the main characters and we don't even get to know them all that well, but they all have their little issues and quirks that grab our attention. Be it the great dancing of Miss Torso or our empathy for Miss Lonelyheart. He also went through doing a great casting. All those small characters are portrayed by great actors who can deliver a feeling and character without doing or saying much. Ross Bagdasarian who was the songwriter in this movie has a great resume in composing himself and his songs are still used now as soundtracks, over 40 years after his death.<br/><br/>The main cast was also great. I was not a fan of James Stewart in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but he was absolutely great in Rear Window. It was his acting and reactions towards what he saw outside his window that lead us towards our own feelings and ideas in this movie. And also that moment when he realizes that Lisa is the right woman for him, he never says it but we can see it in his face that he changed his mind about her, now she doesn't seem so different than him and unable to go for an adventure.<br/><br/>Grace Kelly also was shining in this movie. Didn't know her as an actress before, just as a well deserved beauty icon. But this movie showed her acting talent to me. We see her being the graceful woman with interest in fashion but we also get to see that spark in her when she is so eager to go out of the house to investigate the issue. She is very believable in it. Her character is also very great for a main female character in the 50's as she is the one who does the dangerous work since Jeff is in his cast. Sure, she doesn't want to give up her fashion magazines at the end, but why should she? She can have it all in her life, the adventure with her man, and her own personal interest.<br/><br/>One should not forget about Stella. The supporting character that provides us some laughter in tense situations. Thelma Ritter was great in this part. Made me check her credits and she sure had an impressive career, many classics on that list.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we have the guy who possibly has committed the murder. Raymond Burr did it perfectly. He has some magnetism that combined with the clues makes one think that he could do it. And yet there is some sadness and something else in him that makes one feel for him and hope that he is innocent.<br/><br/>A movie where everything was done right. And a very well deserved classic. Makes me want to grab binoculars and start exploring the lives of my neighbors.But in our time everyone, wisely, is using blinds."

REAR WINDOW is, above all, both a flawlessly stylish and a flawlessly thrilling movie with consideration of the viewpoints of American audiences who saw the Master of Suspense as primarily an 'entertainer' and emphasized 'thrill' and the French New Wave critics, namely Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol who perceived his films as 'exceptionally artistic' and emphasized his style above all. Where do the flawless thrill and style manifest themselves? <br/><br/>REAR WINDOW does not display anything stupendous. On the contrary. Its setting is merely an apartment and a garden. It is, of course, the movie that features Hitchcock's favorite leading man, a sort of 'psychological' self-portrait of the director...<br/><br/>JAMES STEWART: the quintessential portrait of a man in his abilities vs. disabilities, his illusions vs. disillusions. Unlike his acrophobia in VERTIFO, Stewart is placed within the unforgettable claustrophobic realms. We might openly admit that he entirely plunges himself to the role in this very much claustrophobic setting (a Greenwich apartment with a view through the rear window). The intense capability to observe others, which at times crosses the hazardous borderlines of hard social relations, magnetizes viewers to such extent that we feel as part of the whole story. In that respect, Charles Ramirez Berg nicely points out that the film ""made viewers voyeurs"" and ""Hitchcock provocatively probed the relationship between the watcher and the watched involving, by extension, the viewer of the film."" It is not ""Hitchcock's sadistic voyeurism"" (Laura Mulvey ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"") but James Stewart's accurate and balanced combination of wit and suspense that creates a memorably a likable and very authentic personality linked to viewers' preferences and assumptions. But no vital character can ever stand on his own, he is surrounded by...TWO WOMEN of course, one who serves and one who loves.<br/><br/>Before getting into the wonders of the major female strength of the movie, Grace Kelly, let me say a few words about THELMA RITTER as Stella. Revealing certain Hitchcock-ian features of the main character's 'mother', she supplies the movie with considerable irony and wit. Being a deeply down-to-earth character, her lines are deliciously edgy and hilariously to the point. Amidst other most hilarious and memorable lines, when it comes to marriage reflections/decision, she 'spreads some common sense on bread' saying: ""Nothing has caused humanity so much trouble as intelligence."" As an amorous companion and a true center of attention no matter if the viewer is male or female comes...<br/><br/>GRACE KELLY: Hailed as ""the quintessential Hitchcock beauty, elegant, strong-willed, witty, sophisticated, very very stylish and sexy"" (Carter B. Horsley), she embodies something that may be called magnetism on screen. Her character is shaped by the director's preferences to some extent, her stylish glamor is revealed through her familiarity with New York's ""21 Club"" (echoing Ingrid Bergman in SPELLBOUND) and yet, she is clearly given considerable freedom to supply her Lisa with charming vitality, delicious sensuality and natural temperament. Being memorable in all of her scenes, one of the lines exceptionally depict her female character alongside Hitchcock's MacGuffin and Stewart's male perfectionism, ""a great talent to create difficult situations."" <br/><br/>Among the supporting cast, Wendell Corey is worth attention as Lieutenent Thomas Doyle who embodies skepticism and depicts ""the right amount of New York casual wit and suspicion."" (B.Horsley). Raymond Burr, whose resemblance to producer David Selznick seems uncanny, is convincing as one of Jeffries' neighbors, one of his 'phantoms,' the villain Lars Thorward and helps the climactic moment resist the temptation of cheap thrill and fear. Other of Jeffries' neighbors contribute highly to visual aspect of those who build pretty unique situations and associations.<br/><br/>REAR WINDOW, undeniably less well known masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock, is truly flawless in its style and thrill memorably delivered by skillful direction, touchy script by John Michael Hayes, catchy tune by Franz Waxman, powerfully claustrophobic mood and marvelous performances. A masterpiece of its genre."

","If ever you needed an example of cinema as an art form, this is it. Amazingly brilliant. <br/><br/>The plot and dialogue are great on their own, but, as always, it is Hitchcock's direction that turns this into a masterpiece. He pulls out every trick here - the clever setting of a man being able to view other people's everyday lives from afar, the camera angles, the scene setting, the character building, the growing suspense. In the end the plot doesn't matter, you just want to soak in all of Hitchcock's cinematic genius.<br/><br/>Another key factor to the brilliance of this movie is the Jimmy Stewart- Grace Kelly interaction. They are both superb in their roles, but together they are even better. <br/><br/>For me, this is Hitchcock's magnum opus. Yes, even better than Psycho, which to some may be a sacrilegious thing to say, but it shows how good it is. <br/><br/>Surely one of the greatest movies ever made."

","As most people who enjoy films, I am a huge Hitchcock fan and this is definitely one of his best works, and my personal favorite. It is shot beautifully, the narrative is told well, and it keeps you entertained. The film centers on a photographer named L.B. Jefferies, while stuck in his apartment in a wheelchair becomes increasingly more voyeuristic in watching his neighbors which leads to the series of events that kicks the film into more of a thriller territory. There are parts that are very suspenseful and very realistic in how they play out. The only problem, which is a slight one, in this film is, without spoiling anything, the relationship between Grace Kelly and James Stewart. I highly recommend this film to anybody."

","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? A wheelchair bound photographer spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. The best and most famously triumphant pieces of America's cinema industry often make it into a legendary category: an elite club of perhaps thirty or so of the best of gangster, prison, thriller and western films ever to come from the continent. Foremost, one of the most worthy of the all the members is the immaculate, clever, savvy and unstoppable Rear Window. Hitchcock's arguable masterpiece shows how much diversity and resilience the mind can draw from one theme, three principle characters and one setting alone. Of course, Hitchcock is the renowned guru of such an exploit in cinematography, but Rear Window exceeds any of its peers in its presence, power, substance and style. The film moves as a fluid, lucid object in its entirety, to an unfashionably tense end executed end without violence, gore, or any other modern day routine condiments. But above all, Rear Window strives towards its place as a mythical, voyeuristic and popular icon because it's made in a way that does not only show great filmmaking, but exquisite film watching. Hitchcock disregards the restraints of: ""if you can see the enemy, the enemy can see you"" and allows to audience to have a vantage point that's not completely transparent, locking them in sync with the experiences of the characters. Rear Window successfully becomes a film that isn't looking to be praised for profound preaching or artistic merit, but resides happily, proudly, as one that aims to immerse and to play with the nerve and patience of the audience. And despite everything, the film is amicable. It's not gruelling or bleak, the dialogues are warm and inviting, it's laced with an established and assured romance with the lead female role (whom Hitchcock usually chooses to use as a tool of misfortune) and the climactic scenes of action are only as raucous as they need to be to keep the audience gripped. With the stylistic heights of the film coming from every angle, it doesn't need to be. Bleakness is recognised in Rear Window as a utensil that must be used appropriately and in moderation, and instead we are welcomed with a sweet, thickly textured, exhilarating thriller for the ages. It's difficult to write extensively about Rear Window without going into detail regarding particular scenes and their power or impact. The final confrontation scene is, by personal and popular vote, the highlight of Rear Window, one of the greatest successes of cinema history, with Hitchcock picking minimalistic technique:, dark pastel filters and a deadpan soundtrack of both speech and music to create the holy grail of mid-century thriller moments. Yet the real triumph of Rear Window is its perfect balance, maintained with utmost consistency, rid of inconvenient ideals and leaving optimal conditions for the masterpiece of voyeurism to play itself out for 110 devilishly good minutes."

",". . . Knew Too Much. Director Alfred Hitchcock was well-known for having a wide heartless streak toward many of his characters, though his actual treatment of cast and crew will remain open to debate forever. While it's easy to tolerate a certain level of Expendability for ""the master of suspense's"" many murder-centric plots, I find it a little harder to take when children and animals are involved. Though two years after REAR WINDOW's debut, young Hank McKenna is threatened through almost the entire story of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, is a hair on his head REALLY harmed? On the other hand, to turn the future Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) into a vicious dog killer goes beyond my pale, meriting at least a one point rating deduction for REAR WINDOW. It's bad enough when a guy named Lars offs his spouse; but C'Mon, Fido, too? We're entering Wicked Witch of the West territory here. Hitchcock gave James Stewart--who otherwise lived A WONDERFUL LIFE--three of his most loathsome roles (NOT counting his outing as little Hank's daddy), and there's a coldness to ""Jeff's"" opportunistic voyeurism in REAR WINDOW that suggests it's only a matter of time before this character slides a lot further into the wrong side of the law!"

","L.B Jeffries is a photo journalist for a magazine who is temporarily signed off work due to an injury that he has received as a result of what can only be descried as an 'occupational hazard'. He was run over whilst taking pictures of an oncoming vehicle for his magazine company. As a result, his leg is in plaster for a period of around 7 weeks and he finds himself stuck in his apartment with nothing to do except look out of the window and see what happens;<br/><br/>The main thing about this film that hooks you in is the 'paranoia'- for the first 5-10 minutes of the film, Hitchcock pans the camera round the surrounding properties so immediately you are interested in the film and you want to know what happens next. The second thing is the trust that Hitchcock has in his audience; at the start we just have L.B Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart's) paranoia, but then we quickly find that Jeffries missus Lisa Carol Freemont (Grace Kelly), his masseuse/physiotherapist Stella (Thelma Ritter) and Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) are all hooked into Jeffries' paranoia and we, the audience are all hooked in as well. I found that once the film got going, that I was totally hooked in. At the start, there are many characters that Hitchcock introduces that have no relevance to the plot, but the very fact that they are included in the film increases the suspense and the mystery - the audience are never quite sure what is going to happen next. This is where Hitchcock's strengths lie - his interaction with the audience and his way of involving them in his story. The final showdown between Jeffries and Thorwald was exceptional and proved to be a great finale to a great film. <br/><br/>This film is absolutely brilliant, there is no doubt about it, but I did have a couple of problems with it;<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I'm a picky sod so here we go; First thing that bothered me was why did Jeffries keep his light on when spying on his neighbours? It would have (and clearly did) make it easier for him to be spotted. Why not just turn the lights out and observe his neighbours? With his high powered camera lens and binoculars, was all this necessary? Secondly, when Jeffries rings Thorwald and arranges a bogus meeting at the Albert Hotel and Thorwald full of paranoia agrees to meet him, why did Thorwald leave all his windows open knowing that there is an entry via ladder close to his top window? Even though Thorwald has been threatened (by an unknown assailant) at this stage, you would still have thought that Thorwald would have closed his windows - as a matter of basic precaution and more clearly common sense(this was clearly a plot device that was introduced to create tension, but it lacked plausibility).<br/><br/>Despite these gripes, this is a brilliant film from Hitchcock (with only arguably) Psycho being superior to this film (from Hitchcock's films that I've seen). I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend this to everyone. If you love Hitchcock, watch this."

","A mild-mannered wartime photographer finds himself immobile, stuck in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. Overawed by the lack of adventure, L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies (James Stewart) opts for the only available form of entertainment - peeping on his neighbours and watching the ongoings from his rear window. Soon he finds himself fascinated with the quirky people, who surround him. He witnesses an odd couple sleeping on a balcony, who send their dog on walks by lowering him in a basket, wryly smiles seeing the closed curtains of a newly-wed couple or spies on a beautiful ballet dancer just opposite him.<br/><br/>His fiancée Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) remains critical of Jeff's behaviour, but decides to remain silent, as the relationship has seemingly become strained with Jeff unsure of whether the fashion-obsessed women is a right fit for an adventure-crazed photographer. Thus Lisa takes an interest in her boyfriend's newly found hobby. When the bed-bound wife of one of Jeff's neighbours suddenly 'moves away', a new whole area of obsession starts to form, as he suddenly suspects foul play - murder! A timely classic and a must watch for anyone who needs to know the basics of crafting a thriller. The action itself is confined mostly to one room, whilst the camera peers out of the window to observe the world outside. Despite this lack of dynamism, ""Rear Window"" builds a superb atmosphere, slowly straying from the hilarious off-the-wall neighbours and focusing onto a mystery, which for the majority of the movie we are unsure as to whether or not the whole crime is purely in the mind's eye. Even the acting of an bygone era, works perfectly creating a sense of both confinement and suspense, where J.B.'s darkly comedic character is as immaculate as ever. Add to this the lovable duplicity of Liza, who stands by her man, never doubting him outright and only in the last scene do we receive a true sense of the brilliance of her character - the initially simplistic and limited woman, who gains depth throughout, but the true coup de grace of Hitchcock's brilliant movie derives from this scene, which forces us to rethink the whole movie from the point of view of Liza, arguably the truly key protagonist of the movie."
"freemantle_uk","10","0","1","22 December 2013"," One of Hitchcock's best!
","Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most highly regarded films and it is deserving of that distinction. Rear Window is a tout thriller that uses the minimalistic setting to the fullest as a invalid man becomes a voyeur of his neighbours and their activities and soon suspects one of his neighbours murdered their wife. Hitchcock expertly brings up into this world as we see the events and lives of other people from a distance and see the world through L.B. Jefferies' (James Stewart), making the world of the apartment courtyard with his camera pans and movements. As well as the entertaining murder mystery Rear Window was a film with snappy dialogue and character relationships whilst looking at different types of households and people in the different apartments, and how the idea of tight neat community was even dying back in the 50s.<br/><br/>The Simpsons also made a very funny parody with the episode ""Bart of Darkness"""
"StevePulaski","10","0","1","9 December 2013"," The right thriller at the right time
","The opening shot Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork Rear Window is a chilling one; one that shows off the film's bold colors, common setting, and artistic voyeurism. It simply shows the small courtyard outside that can be viewed through the rear windows of the Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, specifically James Stewart's character's, as the bright red blinds roll up, revealing each individual section of the window. Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting. After a few minutes of a relaxing and almost romantic stroll through the wonders of Greenwich's backyard we meet out main character.<br/><br/>His name is L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart), a professional photographed now confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. He remains in his apartment during a brutal heatwave, where he and his neighbors keep their windows open all day and night. Jeff passes the time by watching his neighbors go about their daily routines; one of which is a young, attractive dancer he cleverly names ""Miss Torso"", a woman who often sits all by her lonesome, a pianist, a sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a wife confined to her bedroom because of an illness.<br/><br/>Jeff frequently gets visits from his wealthy and gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), but while the two have notable chemistry and know how to take care of each other well, Jeff simply views her as too perfect. He confesses this to Stella (Thelma Ritter), the sassy, home-care nurse he has been assigned to and states how he would much rather have a woman with more visible flaws than one who seems to ooze perfection and gorgeousness with every step she makes.<br/><br/>One night, however, this thought becomes nothing but a faint memory when Jeff awakes to the sound of a woman screaming and glass breaking. The noise comes from Thorwald's apartment, the apartment directly across from Jeff's rear window. Jeff then sees Thorwald leaving his home and is troubled by the sudden disappearance of Thorwald's wife over the next few days. Frequent spying and self-contemplation (along with bouncing the ideas off of the heads of Lisa and Stella) leads Jeff to arrive at the conclusion that Thorwald murdered his wife for reasons unknown to him. He then spends long hours watching Thorwald's every move, trying to arrive at a sensible conclusion for an action that is unjustifiable.<br/><br/>Hitchcock achieves the power and impact necessary for a film like this thanks to his act of making the audience a voyeur in their own right. We can judge Jeff about snooping and eavesdropping on his neighbors all we want, but are we looking away during the film? Are we the ones covering our eyes when Jeff pulls out binoculars to see across the courtyard? If not, and we're criticizing him for his actions, we are not only hypocrites but we are condemning ourselves and our own actions. We are disagreeing with our own practices and not even recognizing them.<br/><br/>Hitchcock leaves us with this uncomfortable feeling of seeing something we're really not supposed to or overhearing things that weren't intended for our ears. This kind of filmmaking is wonderful, especially for the time when audiences were most often used to being in a place of comfort. Films of the fifties, like Singin' in the Rain, offered a happier escape and put us in a place of joyful exuberance. Hitchcock dared to make us feel uncomfortable and make us feel unsettled at all times. He utilized lengthy shots, establishing a mood by showing off all the simple, day-to-day occurrences in a typical courtyard in America. These lengthy shots are key to the film's success. The only thing better than Jeff and Lisa conversing about everyday life or their relationship is when the scenes do the talking for us and that's key to Rear Window's success. It keeps a simple story relatively basic but also dares to let us experience the environment without the burden of chatter.<br/><br/>Every Hitchcock film has, what he has dubbed, a ""MacGuffin,"" or something tangible (or intangible) that the characters in the film are searching for that we, the audience, may or may not care about. The MacGuffin here is simply proof, proof in favor of Jeff's case. With this MacGuffin, the audience is put in an odd place. We want Jeff to achieve the satisfaction of him being able to prove his case and not be made a fool of, but we also want this all to be a misunderstanding and find that Thorwald's wife isn't really dead. The way Hitchcock goes about trying to give us a two-faced MacGuffin is enticing entertainment.<br/><br/>Rear Window is invigorating with tremendous features that make thrillers interesting. From lengthy shots, to great performances, to an interesting premise, and the idea of repercussions arising from unintentional actions. My knowledge and resume for Hitchcock films is depressingly low for a cinephile, and seeing Rear Window was a ""right place at the right time"" event considering my relatively low faith in modern thrillers and crime capers.<br/><br/>Starring: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr. Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock."

","I literally just finished watching Rear Window, and felt I have to write a review.<br/><br/>This is actually the first and only Hitchcock film I have watched. I am definitely watching more Hitchcock from now on. I wasn't too sure about this movie at first but as Hitchcock has received so much critical acclaim for his movies, I forced myself to watch it, I was not disappointed. These are the reasons why:<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>A professional photographer for a famous magazine, who is wheel-chair bound, suspects that one of his neighbours he can see through his window (into the courtyard where all the other apartments are) has committed murder.<br/><br/>Surely most of us movie lovers have come across this type of plot from many okay movies in the past. This version is spectacular and goes up to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The concept of the plot is a very complexed and unusual one.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Like always James Stewart (my idol), does a great job at a dramatic performance as professional photographer J.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries. Grace Kelly looks glamorous as usual.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing to point out is the cinematography. It is all set in the courtyard of the many apartments the neighbours live in. The furthest it goes is to a tiny passageway leading out of the block. It just looks amazing. This was actually a low budget film, according to my research (that is how much of a film geek i am).<br/><br/>That is all I have to say. Make sure you add this to your list of films you must watch before you die.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.<br/><br/>Upcoming reviews:<br/><br/>Inception, Back to the future, City lights, The Philadelphia Story, It's a wonderful life, Raiders of the lost ark."

","There's something about Hitchcock. Most of his films are fun for their craft and understanding of what works cinematically, but for me they are mostly one-time films. There's one exception, however, and that's ""Rear Window"" (1954). Surprised you there, didn't I. ""Vertigo"" (1958) I like, yes, and while much of it struck me equally as magical as before, the jaded ending spoiled it for me: it was too expository, somehow too clean.<br/><br/>Here the ending is a bit too explanatory to my taste, and everything happens a bit too suddenly when things get going. But the amazing sequence of events that leads us there more than makes up for it. Much has been said about this film's voyeurism in the filmic sense: we gain emotional satisfaction when we are granted godlike access to other people's lives, be they real or fictional. This, however, is important in regards to a form of art that's so deeply all about us seeing things. Stewart plays a photographer and we're constantly reminded about his point of view — what did he see? Does what he saw really mean what he thinks it does? In other words, how does what we think we see relate to what we think is happening. In addition, the camera-eye is pretty marvelous: we stay the whole film in Jeff's room, in his point of view. Hitchcock devices it brilliantly: he's in a wheelchair so he can't move out, and neither can we. He uses surrogates, and they become our surrogates as well, meaning that effectively we become so close to Jeff as actually becoming him.<br/><br/>Writing about it makes me want to see it again."

First it allows for the voyeuristic tendency in everyone. It is something hidden that Hitchcock has dug up and presented wrap in a pretty bow. Second he has the perfect everyman in Jimmy Stewart. Third Hitchcock has dug his little hands into our brains. He knows that we all make up little stories for all those we spy on. I love that even the voices from the neighbors are muffled as we strain to hear them.<br/><br/>It is the perfect film because none of it is wasted.

","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is one of his best films. Now that's saying something considering that he has also directed Psycho, Vertigo, The Birds, Dial M for Murder, and many more. So, what makes Rear Window so good? Well, he was able to tell a 112 minute story using only one apartment building and the view from its window. Not many other people can do that and have it turn out well. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Jeff (James Stewart) in a wheelchair with a broken leg at his apartment. The only way he can pass the time is by watching the neighbors go about their daily activity. One day he notices that one of his neighbors', Lars Thorwhald (Raymond Burr), has gone missing. He soon draws the conclusion that he murdered her and he draws his girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and another friend Stella (Thelma Ritter) into this same opinion. But Jeff's old friend from the war, Det. Doyle (Wendell Correy) does not have the same idea. Jeff then feels a need to prove that he is right, which is what the second half of the movie consists of. <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant use of different camera angles, and especially the way he set up the view from Jeff's apartment are legendary. If any other director had tried to do this it would end terribly as we learned from the 1998 remake starring Christopher Reeve, and the Shia LaBeouf movie of the same concept Disturbia. You would think that people have learned not to try to remake Hitchcock because of horrible remakes like Psycho or A Perfect Murder (Dial M for Murder.) Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, and even though it is not as suspenseful as some of his other works he make up for it in mystery and the funny fact that although Jeff is watching everyone else, we are watching Jeff."

And thanks to its tight editing, terrific performances from James Stewart, Grace Kelly & others plus clever use of music, the tension & excitement never leaves the film for one instant.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rear Window is a masterpiece of suspense & mystery that's difficult to resist & impossible to ignore for its tale of a man peeping into his neighbourhood reflects the same about our society which is filled with people more interested in their neighbour's lives than their own. One of the finest examples of its genre, Rear Window reminds why Hitchcock is still without an equal when it comes to thrillers and is a thrilling & unforgettable cinematic experience that mustn't be missed."

","This movie is on everyone's Top-Something list. Rightfully so. It is amazing that 99% of the movie is told from the single room. Hitchcock is at his best. He manages to keep the viewer is on the edge of his/her respective seat throughout the whole movie. He keeps the viewer in suspense through the whole thing. It is a very unique quality from a director who can keep one engaged and unless it's pointed out, you don't even realize that you haven't really changed scenes.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is pure genius in this film.

","""Rear Window"" is an another Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. This movie has to do with a photographer who spies his neighbors only from his apartment and he is convinced that one of them has committed a murder.<br/><br/>James Stewart plays as L.B. 'Jeff' Jefferies a photographer of a newspaper and the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont who is a high society fashion consultant and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I like more this old version than the new one with Christopher Reeve and Daryl Hannah. I can not compare these two because the differences between these two films are many and the time difference (44 years) are too much, but I stay in my opinion that the old version is better than the new one."
"ward93","10","0","1","18 August 2013"," Why I like this movie
","Action photographer and journalist,""Jeff"" (played by Jimmy Stewart) is wheel chair bound with a broken leg. His only activities during his convalescence are visits from the insurance nurse (played by and watching his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. He has visits from his glamorous model and dress designer girlfriend, Lisa (played by Grace Kelly) while he plays peeping Tom on his neighbors. Jeff watches his neighbors daily, even naming them (ex. Miss Torso, a dancer; Miss Lonely Heart, has dinner parties with imaginary friends; and the music man). <br/><br/>From the opening scenes of Rear Window, the transitions and pace of the film are apparent. Immediately, we know what the main character does and how he became wheel chair bound. The film flows from the image of a thermometer to Jeff; his broken leg and wheel chair. The scene smoothly transitions to the broken camera and crash pictures on his wall and lastly a negative film image of a woman. This scene and several others are shot without spoken word. It is the transition of the images that speaks to the viewer and creates the suspense of what may or may not happen. The timing and transition of each piece of film tells the back story so we have information about Jeff and why he is viewing his word through the rear window of his apartment building.<br/><br/>In 1 hour and 55 minutes, you are taken on a suspenseful ride of psychological terror. The movie follows an indirect –subjective point of view, as we are drawn into the action. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, has once again pulled the viewer into his world of voyeurism and suspense. This movie is in his typical style where the blonde is elevated to a status and the male role either feels he is not good enough as in Jeff in Rear Window, or obsessed with her like the character Norman Bates. As in both movies the female lead is in jeopardy creating a back story to the suspense."

","Rear window is a great film. It couldn't have been any better. Direction is absolutely top notch, characters so strong, wonderfully scripted. Great acting, attention to details is of highest standard. I loved the role of Grace Kelly in the film. not only she's the most beautiful actress I've ever seen, but I was so impressed about her real life and depressed by her fate. Cant't wait to grab the new Nicole Kidman movie based on her life, Grace of Monaco. This is the best Hitchcock film I've seen yet, and I would certainly recommend it to all. Why 8stars then? just a comparative rating with all the movies I've seen. 1950s was surely the best decade of Hollywood in my opinion."
"simon-fredriksson","8","0","1","11 July 2013"," One of Hitchcock's best
","The first film I saw by the British director. And it's a gruesomely dramatic Hitchcock movie. James Stewart (1908-1997) plays a photographer who has broken his leg. From his New York apartment he scouts the neighbors and believes himself to be a witness to a murder. Two female friends - played by Grace Kelly (1928-1982) and Thelma Ritter (1905-1969) - helps him solve the case. The film received four Oscar nominations, including best screenplay and directing, but did not win in any of the classes. Still counted as one of the director's best films. When it was filmed, it was filmed entirely indoors at Paramount Studios, this was the largest studio building ever in Hollywood. Cult Fact: This was the only film where Grace Kelly was smoking a cigarette. She refused to do it on any other film."
"cleary-joshua","9","0","1","3 July 2013"," A fine example of Hitchcock's extreme cleverness and subtlety...
","Alfred Hitchcock was a master director, and Rear Window is a fine example of his extreme cleverness and subtlety. It's strange reviewing this film first after all of the Star Wars films, because they're complete polar opposites. Rear Window is a prime example of Hitchcock's genius, since, apart from one or two shots, the entire film is shot from James Stewart's apartment. This means that all action in the film, whether of Stewart and Kelly inside or the inhabitants of other apartments, is seen from the point of view of Stewart's character. This completely changes the way that we might view the film, since you're seeing it in the same way as Stewart – as a voyeur, peeking into the private lives of the other people on the block. It's extremely effective, and adds to the suspense of the film greatly.<br/><br/>The story itself is both interesting and clever, with the main character trying to convince others that he has witnessed a murder, and attempting to find proof in what he sees whilst spying on his neighbours. Hitchcock introduces a large number of characters who we never properly meet, yet we feel that we know them very well. For example, ""Miss Lonelyheart"" is a character who at one point is about to commit suicide, and Hitchcock provides us with a good background to her story, as well as a fitting conclusion to it. The clearest evidence as to how much we have been spying on these people is their changes at the end of the film. We can clearly see how each group, whether it is the married couple, the songwriter or the dancer, has continued living and changed in the process.<br/><br/>The murder case itself is very cleverly laid out, as is Stewart's logic throughout. Hitchcock knows exactly where to point the camera, constantly hinting to things which are later figured out. I was very proud that I figured out what the dog was doing far before any of the characters, since Hitchcock seemed to show him to us too frequently for his actions to be ordinary. The final battle is a bit over the top, but I thought Stewart's use of flash bulbs was a clever defence technique. However the build up to Mr. Thorwald entering his apartment is very tense and a tiny bit scary.<br/><br/>On the whole this is an intelligent crime thriller, with a great insight into humanity's ""spying and gossip"" nature."

"Sonic_Ocean","10","0","1","29 May 2013"," A Window of Opportunity
","If there is a movie that is just as influential as 'Psycho' for its genre, it would probably be Alfred Hitchcock's thriller masterpiece, 'Rear Window.' With its focus being voyeurism, it takes us through the eyes through Cary Grant's eyes as we the audience are with him spying on the rest of the neighborhood around him. As he begins to feel a strong sense of suspicion from one of his neighbors, we start to feel the tension escalate throughout the movie and how this is executed by Hitchcock is just mindblowing.<br/><br/>The movie already has enough suspense that Cary might be spotted and how this movie makes one feel a sense of paranoia is suspense at its utmost best. The sense that our characters might be in grave danger or they might just be making this all up in their hands adds a lot of psychological thrills to the story, because we the audience are trying to figure out the answers to a mystery where we don't have any proper evidence. I have honestly seen this type of story being mimicked by many movies/TV shows today and that just goes to show the amount of influence Hitchcock has on film.<br/><br/>From the performances to how the movie takes place in one location, 'Rear Window' is a work of pure art, but what I love is its consistent atmosphere that comes from its urban environment. The sense of claustrophobia alone adds to the suspense. It gives a great sense of just how vulnerable our characters are to begin with and as they get deeper into their suspicions, they are making themselves even more vulnerable and increasing their chances of danger and the film captivated me from start to finish. 'Rear Window' represents our curiosity in how this obsession can take control of us, no matter how hard we try to look away. Watching 'Rear Window' or any other film, it shows we all have this impulse within us to look into another world that holds a perceived mystery to us, but in this case, it's purely worth it."
"sledgehammer86","9","0","1","25 May 2013"," Highly effective and enjoyable movie about observation
","After Dial M for Murder's obsession with the small details, Hitchcocks takes this style further in Rear Window. Filmed in and from just one room, the camera sways and dances along the windows of the neighbours' houses as life happens. Zooming in there is a lot to be found: Hitchcock manages to create small visual passe-partout stories for each window. This visual style of telling a story is highly effective: we, the viewers, are obsessively watching and trying to pick out the little details just as the main character is. On a pure entertainment level, the plot is suspenseful and always interesting. James Stewart manages to keep the attention. Grace Kelly has grown in her acting since Dial M for Murder and is quite captivating here."

","Pretty good for the time period which this movie was from. Most movies from this time period bore me, as I always find that they don't have enough drama, suspense, or action in them.

I thought he was over analyzing and that Thorwald was innocent. It was therefore a surprise for me at the end when I found out he wasn't.<br/><br/>I think Hitchcock did a good job of showing no completely clear signs of guilt to keep the viewer guessing the whole movie.

","I, up til now, am extremely disappointed with how my life, in terms of movie watching has been. I have, up until today, NEVER watched Rear Window. I went in with high expectations after seeing Hitchcock's brilliant Psycho and my high expectations were blown away! I loved everything about this movie. In my opinion, it is one of the few movies that define a flawless, classical masterpiece! The acting by everyone is brilliant which makes us interested in each of these characters. Normally old people like Stella, who is quite a main character, can get really frustrating but here we like a character like her. I also enjoyed Lisa's character and Jefferies great.<br/><br/>The premise behind the movie is simple. A man, through his window begins to feel suspicion over a salesman who resides in a nearby apartment and begins to spy on him. With the help of Stella and Lisa, they attempt to bring the man into custody for the believed crime of murdering his wife.<br/><br/>Even though the film has no real plot twister, it is thoroughly entertaining. The feeling of darkness, isolation and fear are clearly shown in this film, almost better than they were in Psycho.<br/><br/>The story from start to finish never really slows down at any one point.

","Rear Window is perceived to be a Hitchcock staple, and with good reason. You've got your star protagonist; a young, blonde leading lady, and a real- world scenario that provides plenty of his trademark suspense.<br/><br/>In one of those premises that is just meant for film, Jimmy Stewart is an injured photographer who gets interested in his apartment block. And for the first half hour, that's all that happens. We meet his not-quite- mutual girlfriend Lisa, charmingly played by Grace Kelly. Then we look at the neighbours and see a bit of who they are. One in particular catches Jeffries' eye, a salesman who likes to take late night walks...<br/><br/>And thus the caper begins. How can you build a case from an apartment, bound to a wheelchair? That's where all of the action takes place, leading to a certain enclosure in the film, but also a sense of home. <br/><br/>The question becomes, did he even do it? Jeffries works to prove it, but we also need convincing too. And Detective Doyle doesn't believe it, and our own loyalty wavers too. Once the film picks up, and it slowly picks up until the tense finale, we aren't quite sure which way the story will go.<br/><br/>First, eat while watching the film. The first act is slow, and maybe even a bit too long. Second, it's certainly dated, more so than say Psycho or Rope (I give Rope the slight edge to this film). Certain elements, including one very important camera flash, breaks the otherwise sublime tension that had been building to a crescendo the entire film. The falling action is also quite weak, an issue that soured the ending of North by Northwest as well. If you've enjoyed Hitchcock's other work and look past these issues then Rear Window will knock you out, but in the grand comparison these are issues that other films don't have.<br/><br/>Is Rear Window a great film? Yes. Is it one of the absolute best films ever made? Not quite. It is one of Hitch's finest, but that doesn't make it faultless- his films all have the same issues with slow beginnings and fast endings. Nevertheless it is a wonderful 50's thriller that makes for a fun time. 8.5/10"

","They say that acting is reacting. If that's the case, then Jimmy Stewart's performance in Rear Window is one of the greatest ever recorded on film. During most of the movie, we are watching him watching the people across the courtyard enclosed by the apartment complex in which he has been cooped up. We literally witness the events of the film through his eyes. Those eyes eventually witness what he believes to have been a murder, but he has a tough time convincing his three confidants: his girlfriend, Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his caregiver, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his longtime friend, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey). John Michael Hayes' screenplay is a lesson in misdirection. Not only are we distracted from the central mystery by the lives of the inhabitants of the apartments surrounding the one occupied by the alleged murderer, we become concerned with the challenged relationship between Jeffries (Stewart) and Lisa. Little by little, the focus shifts more and more toward the investigation of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), Jeffries gains more evidence against his suspect, his confidants buy into his theories, and the comforting separator between Jeffries' apartment and that ""private world"" across the courtyard breaks down, until a moment when Thorwald looks up and peers across the divide, directly into Jeffries' camera-turned-spyglass, evincing genuine chills. Hitchcock couldn't be more in his element, directing a voyeuristic murder mystery about a temporarily disabled photographer, replete with blonde bombshells, macabre innuendo, and sweat-inducing suspense. Rear Window has no shortage of humor, intrigue, and romance, but its signature thrill is one to which all avid moviegoers can relate: the thrill of watching other people, who don't know they are being watched."
"Kane20","10","0","1","23 October 2012"," Review - Rear Window
","As of right now, I have only seen three of Alfred Hitchcock's films: Psycho, Vertigo, and now Rear Window. I have to say, I already like the way Hitchcok creates suspense, and also his methods of storytelling and tampering with narrative elements. A number of people, including film critic James Berardinelli, consider Rear Window to be Hitchcock's best film. As of right now, I personally agree; I've only seen three of his films, but Rear Window is my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>Rear Window is appropriately named. The protagonist, L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart), is a professional photographer with a broken leg, and is therefore confined to his apartment in New York. He spends the time watching his neighbors from his rear window (see, I told you the film was appropriately named). Soon, however, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors might have murdered his wife, and he becomes obsessed with this mystery, and eventually he even gets his girlfriend to help him investigate.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the film was the way the story is told. Just like Vertigo and Psycho, Rear Window has a strong and unmatched uniqueness and, even though elements of the film have almost certainly been used in films between then and now. What I really found interesting is the ""restriction"" of the film; except for a brief spot near the end, the film is entirely restricted to inside Jefferies's apartment and his view from his rear window. The events of the story that happen outside of the apartment are either only mentioned in the dialogue or seen from the window.<br/><br/>However, despite this restriction to voyeurism, it's actually somewhat interesting watching going-ons outside in the courtyard and through the windows of other people's apartments, even though we are watching these things from a distance instead of having the scenes be set in those actual areas. Even in real life, a lot can often be learned even just by watching, and it can be quite interesting. Also, the suspense in the film handled very well. And I should also point out that, like in Psycho and Vertigo, the the story is not entirely predictable; Hitchcock cleverly throws in some things that flout the audience's expectations.<br/><br/>In addition to all of this, the actors, especially James Stewart, put on good performances. They are likable and believable. Jefferies is a semi-interesting character, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Lisa, is handled pretty well. The other performances are good too. Overall, the performances in this movie are another factor that make the film great, and they are especially useful given the ""containment"" of the film's story.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Rear Window is a great movie, with interesting storytelling, good characters, good acting, and strong suspense, among other things. I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in film.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/"
"filmfan1991","Null","0","1","19 September 2012"," Hitchcock's Voyeuristic Masterpice
","How do you take a simple story that remains in one place for the duration of the movie, never leaves the room and only looks outside into the neighborhood without leaving whilst still remaining suspenseful? You get Alfred Hitchcock as director and you get Rear Window.<br/><br/>It follows the story of a wheelchair bound photographer played by Jimmy Stewart who starts to suspect that his neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) across from his apartment has committed murder. Through the story he gets the help of his beautiful girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse (played by Thelma Ritter) to solve the mystery.<br/><br/>They don't call him ""Master of Suspense"" for nothing. Hitchcock takes his audience on a journey of voyeurism through a tiny neighborhood that was built on one set. Whatever Jimmy Stewart sees in his neighborhood the audience sees because the movie makes us voyeurs just like he is. Most of the camera work and cinematography involves panning and tilting inside the neighborhood without ever entering any of the other apartments hence the theme of voyeurism. When its not looking outside it stays in the one apartment that Jimmy Stewart always stays in. In most movies this idea would be boring because not much would happen but with Hitchcock at the helm and great writing by both John Michael Hayes and Cornell Woolrich, you get a fantastic suspenseful film.<br/><br/>Performance wise, everyones great all around. Jimmy Stewart is great as Jefferies (the wheel chair bound photographer). Grace Kelly is great as Jefferies girlfriend who uses her intuition to help solve the mystery. Thelma Ritter is great as the down to earth nurse and Raymond Burr is great as the mysterious neighbor Thorwald.<br/><br/>For a movie thats nearly 60 years old it has that timeless quality to it making it all the more better as a classic and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. 10 out of 10 stars."
"Tweekums","10","0","3","30 August 2012"," Was anybody murdered?
","This Hitchcock classic isn't so much a whodunit but a 'did he do anything?'. James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, Jeff to his friends, a photographer used to working in the world's trouble spots; now however he is stuck at home in New York one hot summer with a broken leg and nothing to do but look out of the window. Through this window he watches the activities of his neighbours; there is the woman who exercises in her underwear, an apparently lonely woman, a man who lives with his nagging wife, a musician and a couple who are sleeping on the fire escape in an attempt to keep cool. The only company Jeff has is his nurse Stella and his beautiful girl friend Lisa. Even when they are visiting he can't stop watching the neighbours though. One night he sees something odd; the man with the nagging wife, who we later learn is called Lars Thorwald comes and goes several times with a suitcase and in the morning there is no sign of his wife. Jeff is convinced that he must have murdered her; his friend Lt. Doyle is less than convinced though... several witnesses corroborate Thorwald's story that his wife went away by train. He tells Lisa and she is initially sceptical but when he tells her how he has seen Thorwald examining jewellery in his wife's favourite handbag she believes him... after all what woman would go on a trip and not take her favourite handbag or jewellery? They continue to investigate; if they are wrong they will look silly but if they are correct they could be in a lot of danger!<br/><br/>This film is rightly considered a classic; the camera seldom leaves Jeff's room; when we see things happening outside we only see what Jeff sees from his window. This means we don't know whether Thorwald killed his wife of not until the very end; the evidence we see earlier is merely circumstantial and contradicted by what Lt. Doyle hears when he investigates. James Stewart does a great job as Jeff; he is rarely off camera and as the character has a broken leg he can't even stand up yet he still gives a dynamic performance. He is ably supported by Grace Kelly, who plays Lisa and Thelma Rita who plays Stella. Hitchcock's did a great job directing; the way he showed the view from Jeff's window helps put the viewer in Jeff's position; this was particularly effective when he watched on impotently as Lisa searched Thorwald's apartment when he returned and caught her. This is definitely one to watch; a mystery with a twist and no content that is likely to offend anybody."

","A small, local cinema screened this film last night, out of doors, under the jet black, warm summer night's sky, making its use of ambient noises and sounds even more effective. When rain awakens Jeffries and his neighbours during the night, it sounded like it could very well have started pouring down with rain on us, the audience, sitting out there, just as it had 24 hours earlier. The sounds of cars passing by, and the noise of people walking around us just blended right in with the film. <br/><br/>A wheelchair-bound photographer, bored out of his mind in the seventh of eight weeks with his leg in a cast, spies on his neighbours to amuse himself. We learn of how Jeffries ended up with his leg in a cast by the photos on display on his desk. A clever exposition requiring no further dialogue. We learn in a matter of seconds what others might have devoted several minutes to. The film's first thirty to forty minutes are a comedy, with a bit of romance between wheelchair boy and his girlfriend added into the mix, but then the tone slowly changes as Jeffries realises that there is something not right in the apartment across from him. The more Jeffries spies on his various neighbours, the more he suspects that one man across the quad murdered his wife. <br/><br/>To reveal anything more about the plot of this film, one of my favourite of Hitchcock's, would be a crime. To witness this film anywhere else but on a big screen is also a crime against the film itself.

","As my best friend and I make our way down IMDb's top 250, Rear Window ""reared"" its head at us. We had no idea what to expect as our exposure to that era was quite limited. We were not disappointed, however...<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart is fantastic as the wheelchair-bound photographer warding off the advances of the radiant and persuasive Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) as he recovers from a broken leg and engulfs himself in observing (spying?) on his neighbours. Soon enough he manages to convince Lisa that he's witnessed a potential murder and both of them try to solve it, culminating in Lisa sneaking into Thorwald's apartment to find the deceased wife's wedding ring (No wife would go without her ring unless she were dead...) and it all comes to a dramatic conclusion with some inadvertent humour thrown in as Lisa gets arrested in her home invasion but has a scant fifty cents in her purse (Socialites living off others' good graces...) and Stewart breaks his OTHER leg in the final confrontation, leaving a wry Grace Kelly at his bedside (not a bad way to go if you ask me. :) ) Excellent film, especially in its use of zoom and focus on the apartment dwellers supplemented by a quirky cast of characters that will leave you laughing and shaking your head at the same time."
"thegodfathersaga","10","0","1","13 April 2012"," Rear Window
","For most of the film, we literally share the vision of James Stewart, and so the theme of voyeurism is strongly instilled and layered in the heart of the film. The construction is perfect, the most notable being the unity of place, which is also a technical feat since the camera stays in a single room pretty much throughout the film. it also evokes masterful visual storytelling and clever use of music. Besides the simple appeal of voyeurism, the film attracts through the wealth of detail: it is really a small world in scale that James Stewart has in his yard, and he can't help but react to it. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful, and i loved how the camera treats her. There is no dead time, tension and suspense skillfully build gradually and becomes almost unbearable towards the end. Rear Window is a great movie."
"longtennenbaum","8","0","1","2 April 2012"," Great movie!
","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn't trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in it,--it's a work of art."
"scifisuede","9","0","1","1 April 2012"," Captivating!
","I'm fairly new to Alfred Hitchcock's work - Rear Window being only his third film I've seen after Psycho and The Birds - but I'm a fan already.<br/><br/>Rear Window raised my interest due to the topic it carried: the lives behind individual windows of a packed community. And, this theme was executed brilliantly. The main character is wheelchair-bound due to an accident, leaving him with not much else to do but watch his neighbours through his apartment window. The character of each neighbour is unique, interesting, and realistic. They are being portrayed as what they truly are when they think nobody's watching. I guess we all have to admit that we do behave differently in public and in private - and this film puts a spotlight on this issue.<br/><br/>However, despite that, it's not a depressing film at all. Even with the major plot line of the main character suspecting a neighbour of killing his wife, I don't find this film dark nor depressing. It's simply captivating. The main characters are charming with warm interactions and funny dialogues between them. The neighbours are interesting to watch and you'd actually care about what happens to them. There are nail-biting thrilling moments which build up slowly to the climax, bringing you along for an unforgettable ride - I found myself on the edge of my seat without even realising it. Overall, it's one of the must-see masterpieces of the cinematic history."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","7","0","1","17 March 2012"," Very solid, if not exceptional.
","When talking of Alfred Hitchcock's, most people name Rear Window as one of the finest works of his legendary career. While I think it's a very good film, I can't say I agree. The premise is genius. Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a photographer who is stuck in a wheelchair for another week until he gets his cast off and finds himself passing the time by spying on his neighbors. Hitchcock is brilliant here at making this small world feel so alive and always moving. No matter who Jefferies is watching at the time, you can always here plenty of different things going on in the other apartments in the courtyard.<br/><br/>Each resident is given their own story and formed character to create this full environment for Jefferies to exist in. It never feels like the characters are existing just for the basis of our story, but rather that they genuinely do exist in their own private lives and we are spying on them out our window. The film opens up some interesting topics on voyeurism, how in private people will do things that could seem incredibly strange or suspicious to someone who is watching from an outside perspective, and whether someone would have the right or moral obligation to try and do something if posed with a conflict such as the one Jefferies faces.<br/><br/>Written by John Michael Hayes, adapted from a short story by Cornell Woolrich, Window begins to focus itself on a mystery that opens up when Jefferies suspects one of his neighbors of murdering his wife. The culprit is Lars Thorwald, played by the great Raymond Burr, and Jefferies finds himself obsessed with finding out what happened to Thorwald's wife on a night where he heard a scream and Thorwald left his apartment several times with a case in the dead of night. This obsession drives him, eventually bringing in the help of his girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), his caretaker Stella (the delightful Thelma Ritter) and detective friend Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) to try and uncover the truth.<br/><br/>My only complaint with the film is that it didn't really drive me. I thought that the staging of everything was brilliantly done, but the actual unraveling of the mystery just didn't compel me at all and left things kind of flat for several stretches in the middle of the picture. I have to admit that I've never been much for Jimmy Stewart as an actor. I find him likable on occasion but for the most part he's so non-engaging to me, and I think my lack of interest in him may have been the cause of my lack of interest in a lot of the mystery. I've always considered Hitchcock, as many do, the master of suspense and been able to admire his ability to bring intensity out of even some of the most mundane sequences.<br/><br/>An experience such as Stewart following Kim Novak's character in his car in Vertigo could have been a dull endeavor if another director had been behind the camera, but with Hitchcock he turned it into a gripping journey and so I was disappointed that he wasn't able to do much of the same for me. It didn't really hinder my appreciation for long though, as the film builds to it's climax where the tables are turned and Thorwald begins to become aware of those conspiring against him, turning this tale of voyeurism into a thriller of potentially grave consequence.<br/><br/>The set up of placing characters like Fremont and Stella in danger while Jefferies has to sit paralyzed, completely unable to defend those he cares about from the violence occurring right before his eyes, added a ""can't turn away"" suspense in the final act that was absolutely worthy of the Hitchcock name. That final act sings with a power that completely made up for the dragging bits in the middle. Not one of Hitchcock's best, but a worth addition to his wildly impressive career."
"jwardww","8","0","1","23 January 2012"," Had Richard Egan replaced Jimmy Stewart
","This film has a great story, setting and Edith Head costumes, but the romantic underpinnings are impossible to believe. Is it too much to ask for a convincing romantic coupling in an A-list murder mystery? Richard Egan was appreciably more masculine and charismatic than Jimmy Stewart; and his career was sufficiently established for his casting not to represent a major risk. He also had a superb physique (see Demetrios and the Gladiators), which would have been the believable result of his adventurous occupation. His physical condition would have made it OK for him to appear shirtless or in underwear, attire apposite both to his broken leg and dangerous lifestyle. He never would have had to sport the ridiculous, grandmotherly pajamas Stewart does to hide his premature senescence. In fact, during the massage scene, one is actually more attracted to Thelma Ritter's personality and energy. Though Stewart's character condescends to Ritter as a much older woman, she is actually only 6 years his senior. Egan was a rugged, deep-voiced Californian who exuded a paradoxically gentlemanly refinement. He was an alpha male with the luster of a graduate Stanford education. At the time Rear Window was made, he actually had a lot of work and was probably not available. That is a pity, because his presence would have made it an artifact one would have liked to return to again and again. In 1954 he was busy holding his own against Tyrone Power, the pretty boy in Untamed who wins Susan Hayward's love. In that bodice ripper, Egan is made to seem too brutal and crude a match for the social climbing Katie (her GWTW consolation role). But that's what would have made him so right for Rear Window. At a glance, you believe he would seek the thrill of photographing mountain climbers in Nepal, race car drivers, Texan rodeos or tangle with Raymond Burr, but also have the physical magnetism and refinement to attract someone like Lisa Fremont. Yes, it seems many young women at the time were OK with men 21 years their senior (though most frequently in the minds of Hollywood producers). But even Grace Kelly, so frequently cast with granddaddies, found a real prince only 6 years olderâ€”a coup de grace. The casting of Stewart enervates the sexual excitement of Lisa's sleepover, rendering her lightly-packed Mark Cross bag powerless to titillate. If she were going to throw away her privileged existence in a very nice building at Park and 63rd by slumming with a photographer in the Village, it would hardly be with the glum actuary played by Stewart. With him one feels certain her honor is completely safe, in or out of the Edith Head negligee. That would not have been the case with Egan playing Jeff; and the movie would have survived with a more appealing adult sensibility."
"Hoagy27","10","0","1","18 December 2011"," The Devil's in the Details
","Hitch's attention to detail has never been better. From Raymond Burr's straw hat to the reflections in Stewart's lenses to the soundtrack with invisible kids playing, everything is calculated and perfect. Stewart's features are flawless as well. His facial contortions as he satisfies an itch under his leg cast are uncanny. I found myself sticking my tongue sideways between my teeth right along with him. A full load of Hitchcock suspense is delivered in measured doses right up to the climax. The cigarette smoking in the dark bit was one of the most frightening scenes I remember from my childhood movie watching. The final shot is a complete mystery to me."
"ringfire211","8","0","2","15 December 2011"," Very good Hitch.... but not exactly great
","When it comes to Hitchcock and 1954 I'll take DIAL 'M' FOR MURDER any day over REAR WINDOW. I've noticed more issues with this film this second time around than I did on my first viewing. It's still a very solid movie with that meticulous Hitchcock touch in every scene - the way Hitch's production team recreated that whole apartment complex on the back lot and the classic camera movements of cinematographer Robert Burks. But I was a bit less impressed with it this time around and I noticed some guffaws that I didn't notice before. The film actually feels a bit too long - especially for a film which consists of a single set and of a guy sitting in a wheelchair and spying on his neighbors for the entire run-time. I mean it has the run-time of your typical Bond film. I think 30 minutes could have easily been cut and it would have made for a tighter picture.<br/><br/>Then there is the rather far-fetched idea that a girl like Grace Kelly is basically throwing herself at the feet of Grampa Jimmy Stewart who is just a sour puss and wants to do nothing but look through his binoculars the whole day. I really didn't notice this laughable concept the first time around for some odd reason. I mean just one look at Grace Kelly would have cured me immediately. Voila!! Leg instantly healed!! But this old geezer just wants to lounge around his rear window.<br/><br/>Then there is the laughable scene with Raymond Burr taking like 5 minutes to reach Jimmy Stewart who is sitting like 7 feet away in his wheelchair. Burr takes a step... then... BAM... a flash goes off... Burr stops... rubs his eyes... takes another step... BAM... flash goes off again... Burr stops... rubs his eyes. Hey buddy, listen, how about just lunging at that helpless cripple instead of doing this laughable Frankenstein's monster/mummy walk? And then there is the really laughable sped-up footage near the end as the cops rush over to help Jimmy Stewart - like in an old silent movie. And the ludicrous way in which Jimmy falls out his window. I swear that was a howler!! Hahaha!!<br/><br/>Had it really been that long since I saw this film last? I don't remember it being such an unintentional comedy. Needless to say FRENZY has now taken the #5 spot in the Hitch pantheon and I guess REAR WINDOW is now at #6. I guess it seems like I'm bashing this film. It's just that for some reason I saw many more goofs this time around and for such a masterpiece that's one goof too many. I still think the film has a wonderful look and an amazing set. The spying of the neighbors is very well done. Grace Kelly is to die for!! And Jimmy is good as always. I just didn't buy into their romance (or lack thereof). Even in the suspense department I think Hitch has done much better in other films."
"Bigt29","Null","0","1","21 November 2011"," A few thoughts on Rear Window.
","When I first heard that we would be watching this film in class, I wasn't too excited. It looked old, it looked boring, and the actors looked kind of fake. I thought to myself 'so what, two hours of a guy in a wheelchair looking out his rear window at his neighbors', what's the big deal? After watching the movie I'd like to change my opinion. This movie made a seemingly uninteresting scenario into an enjoyable mystery. I'm not going to go as far as to say ""It will leave you on the edge of your seat"" because it probably won't, but it is a classic thriller. The beginning is a little slow, but get past that and it's rather good. I can see in the 50's how this would strike people as a horror/thriller. It plants a disturbing seed in your mind, and that is the fact that nobody can be sure what their neighbors are doing behind closed doors. Nobody can be sure who anyone truly is inside.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty stand up too. I thought it was a little fishy though how one second he didn't want to be with the girl at all, then the next he accepted it and wanted her to stay. The only sing that she changed was the fact that she packed light to stay at his house. This is a movie though, not real life, and I kept that in mind. I'm not sure why he wasn't able to call the cops and report it. Everyone said he would be labeled as a ""Peeping Tom"", but I don't think that's right. If he looked out his window he would be seeing the windows of the other houses and apartments regardless of if he wanted to or not. Just like if the people living across from him looked out their windows they would be peering into his apartment and into the apartments of the people living above and below him. I think perhaps the people should of thought about this consequence before purchasing the space. I'm not sure if I was supposed to be getting that deep into the movie, but it was something I noted.<br/><br/>In one part of the movie, Jeffries, Lisa, and Stella notice that the flowers were raised higher than they were prior to the suspected murder. I thought that was pretty clever. I think everyone has what it takes to be a detective, it just kind of depends on the drive you have for it. They really wanted to figure this murder out so they started piecing clues together and tried getting all the questions that were left open answered."

He got a lifetime achievement Oscar but it's not really the same."
"kpthazme","7","0","1","24 May 2011"," Good watch
","Rear Window is a typical Hitchcock movie with brilliant use of background sounds to keep the viewer engaged in its suspense. The entire movie is shown from the perspective of a person sitting at an apartment window looking on at his neighbors going about their daily lives in adjacent buildings. There are also interesting parallel story lines to the movie following the lives of the talented pianist, the lonely middle aged woman, the newly wed couple, among others. James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter have put in admirable performances in the roles of three people who are convinced that something is just not right. Definitely worth a watch."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","1","22 April 2011"," One of Hitch's best
","A taut, intelligent script and two wonderful performances from the leads make REAR WINDOW another of Hitchcock's masterpieces. The story, about a wheelchair-bound man witnessing a murder is the kind of simple, single-set setup that Hitchcock loved best and he makes full use of the premise by ladling it with humour, suspense and all kinds of tension. Stewart and Kelly make for an irresistible double act and the murder plot is delightfully dark and full of menace.<br/><br/>While it doesn't feature the kind of intricate plotting that makes DIAL M FOR MURDER my favourite Hitchcock yet, REAR WINDOW is nonetheless an iconic and influential high concept thriller and a real one off."
"cbrueggemeyer","9","0","1","21 April 2011"," Another Hitchcock Masterpiece
","think that the storyline for this movie was magnificent. Hitchcock, forever known as a great storyteller, created an interesting story that keeps the audience on their feet the entire movie. The character progression in this movie is meritorious. Jeffries, the protagonist, quickly turns from a curious photographer into an obsessed detective/paparazzo. The suspense scenes in this movie are phenomenal. Scenes like the confrontation of Jeffries by Thorwald makes this movie one of the best suspense stories of all time, created by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. <br/><br/>Rear Window contains some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a film. For this time period, the cinematography in this movie was extraordinary, and even today it continues to be a shining example of excellent cinematography. Rear Window's use of color imagery is phenomenal. Perhaps the best example of this is in the opening scene when we see Jeffries' view from his rear window. In this opening scene, we see a wide array of colors, different colors to represent different neighbors. If you look closely, you can see that the main color around Thorwald's apartment is red, symbolizing the bloodshed and overall evil that will occur in that small apartment. The editing in Rear Window is also very well done. Every scene in this movie seems serve a specific purpose, and all of the actors seem to know their role in every scene. The movie seems the perfect length, the length where you get the full effect of the movie without being hackneyed by the same characters and setting. Overall, I think that the cinematography and editing in this movie are outstanding, and they are two of the many things that add up to make this movie great.<br/><br/>The acting in Rear Window is some of the best I have ever scene in a movie. Every role seems to have an important purpose in the movie, and every actor seems to execute his or her role perfectly. It seems that Hitchcock and the actors were on the same page, and their geniuses combined to make this outstanding movie. Jimmy Stewart plays L.B Jeffries, a stubborn man unwilling to change his lifestyle to benefit those around him. Jeffries is an extremely tough character to portray. The man's obsession with getting to the bottom of his neighborhood dilemma borders on insanity, and his inability to love his beautiful and caring girlfriend make him one of the most diverse characters in all of Hollywood. Stewart executes this role with perfection. He displays Jeffries obsession easily and with aplomb, he also perfectly displays an underlying sense of depression that comes with being disabled and out of contact with the world. Grace Kelly plays Lisa Fremont, a loving, caring woman that wants nothing more than to settle down and live a life of leisure with her lover Jeffries. Kelly deservingly won best actress for her portrayal of Fremont. She displays Fremont's motivated, caring personality perfectly. She also gives the sense that Fremont is obsessed with something, as well. Although, unlike her lover, she makes it clear that she is obsessed with something completely different, she is obsessed with intimacy. This may sound far-fetched, but Kelly subtly makes it known throughout the movie that her only motivation for putting up with all of Jeffries shenanigans is the hope that one day they will become married. From the beginning of the movie to the end, she focuses all of her attention on convincing Jeffery to conform and settle down just like everybody else. Overall, the acting in this movie is unbelievable. This star-studded cast makes the movie one of the best movies ever made. <br/><br/>I believe that the music and sound effects in this movie are breathtaking. The music sets the course of the movie, and is most effectively used in suspense scenes throughout the movie. For example, the famous scene where Thorwald approaches Jeffries at the end of the movie. I believe that this scene is the most effective use of music and sound effects that I have ever seen in a movie. The scene begins with eerie music playing, and Jeffries sitting alone in his wheelchair, helpless. Then, the audience hears the soft, increasing sound of Thorwald's footsteps slowly coming up the stairs. Then you hear the door slowly creak, and suddenly intense music starts playing as the villain appears. In this scene, the music and sound effects create a chill in the viewer's spine, and it continues to linger there until the conclusion of the movie. <br/><br/>The direction of Rear Window is unmatched. Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the best director of all time, directed this movie. His famous filming techniques like use of color imagery, pieces of plot, and long, drawn out suspense scenes make this movie a classic. Through Hitchcock's exceptional characters and casting, he has effectively portrayed the overall emotion and conflict of the story line. This movie is just one of Hitchcock's great movies, and I believe it is by far his best. Movies like Psycho and Vertigo put up a good fight; by ultimately I believe that Rear Window was Hitchcock's best movie."
"mattkratz","10","0","3","16 March 2011"," a true classic
","This was classic Hitchcock in its extreme. It was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and I'm glad I did. It got me into his films. In the film, Jimmy Stewart plays a photographer who is cooped up in his apartment due to a broken leg. There was no such thing as the internet back then, so he has to spend his time spying on his neighbors. He swears he sees one of them (Raymond Burr) commit a murder. He tries to get his lady friend involved. Hitchcock knows how to build the suspense. Those scenes are done with subtlety and with what is not seen, and that is as effective as what IS seen.<br/><br/>Spying on the neighbors is fun, like the lady getting undressed, the lady with the dog, and the pianist. Try and catch Hitchcock's cameo in this film-he makes one in most of his movies. The final showdown scene is tense and suspenseful. Not only is this the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, it is also one of my favorites.<br/><br/>This is a classic, and the theme has been used many times, like in Disturbia and in an ALF episode. I'm sure I (and you) can think of other examples. This is Hitchcock at his best! **** out of ****"
"stephenrsanders","8","0","1","11 March 2011"," A Hitchcock masterpiece
","The uncertainty is what makes this film amazingly suspenseful. For about the first half of the film, we really do not know whether or not Jimmy Stewart's character has discovered that his neighbor has committed murder or is just going nuts from being stuck in his tiny apartment. At a certain point the movie shifts, it becomes clear that Stewart is on to something, but what exactly he has discovered and what he can prove still remain a central question until nearly the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>Then you have Hitchcock's amazing camera-work, allowing us to see into the tiny worlds that populate the apartment across the way, each with a little drama going on inside. The performances by Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are fantastic. <br/><br/>This is perhaps the most Hitchcock of Hitchcock films. Highly recommended."

","Apart from the unforgettable Psycho, and a faintly-remembered Dial M for Murder, I hadn't seen any Hitchcock film. As if on a whim, I thought of scouring the land for all his movies. This began with Rear Window. A man is indisposed with an injury. He does nothing but watch his neighbours lead their everyday lives. He soon reckons he's found something sinister in one of the homes. Rear Window is one of those films which I'd flatly refuse to analyse. It works superbly as a story. What a premise! The only thing that doesn't work for me is the constant distance he keeps from his girlfriend. How can any man say no to Grace Kelly?"
"Theothervip","Null","0","1","29 December 2010"," Still one of the best ever! Hitchcock in prime form.
","Rating: **** out of 4.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is really at the top of his game in the 1950's and REAR WINDOW might as well be his most successful. Here is a genuine Alfred Hitchcock movie sprinkled with suspense, humor, and romance unlike any movie of its time, and in fact, any movie today. While it's not as deep, dark and personal as his 1958 masterpiece VERTIGO, this is nonetheless his ultimate triumph in establishing his title; ""The Master of Suspense"". Has there ever been a more suspenseful moment in film history than the scene where one of our plucky characters brakes in on the suspect's apartment, while the suspect is just about to come home? Well, if there were, then it would have owed a debt of gratitude to this Hitchcock masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story revolves around L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart, in a role that's pretty much James Stewart in character), a photographer who gets wheelchair-ridden when he caught himself in an accident (Hitchcock did a much better job at telling you about Jeff's background in an early scene where the camera pans through his works and his camera, and eventually the last picture he ever took before the accident; a rear that was about the crash into him). Jeff, with nothing to do, basically does what every neighbor would do: look out the window and watch his neighbors' everyday lifestyle. Be it the ballerina, dubbed Ms. Torso (Georgine Darcy), or the hopeless romantic old lady, dubbed Ms. Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn), Jeff has seen 'em all, including a man named Lars Throwald (pre-PERRY MASON Raymond Burr) who one day stops talking to his demanding, invalid wife in the bedroom and starts cleaning up what seemed to be blood stains in the bathroom. Did Jeff see a murder happening just right across the block, or was it just a case of a Peeping Tom having delusions? Hitchcock occasionally puts aside this story and explores what many see as the core of the film: The romance. Jeff and his relationship to his high-class but spunky and stubborn socialite girlfriend Lisa Freemont (the irreplaceable Grace Kelly in her irreplaceable role) is one of the reasons why REAR WINDOW is one of the best. In fact, Hitchcock himself knew the importance of the love story in the movie, that he made sure that the whole plot revolved around it. The neighbors around Jeff's apartment, from Ms Lonelyhearts to Ms. Torso and a couple of newlyweds next door all suggest what might happen to Jeff and Lisa as time went on with their relationship. The Thorwalds represent the darker side of their relationship: the possibility that they would hate each other as an old married couple.<br/><br/>This along with a dozen more elements (performances, music, atmosphere, direction, EVERYTHING) make REAR WINDOW the quintessential Alfred Hitchcock movie. It's funny, it's romantic, it's clever, and it's suspenseful as hell. That last act had me by the neck and it would never let go. Now that's suspense!"

","Rear Window is an essential Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. It stands as one of his most mysterious and creatively superb films full of suspense, tension, and a few laughs provided by the strong cast. The amazingly talented and legendary James Stewart plays L.B. Jeffries, a photographer who is stuck at home in a wheelchair and full leg cast. Bored to death, Jeffries passes the time by looking at his neighbors across the street in their windows. What begins as kind of a creepy and odd hobby, eventually becomes obsession when Jeffries believes he may have witnessed a murder. He is convinced that one of the men across the way named Lars Thorwald has murdered his wife and is now trying to cover it up. Jeffries tries desperately to prove Thorwald guilty, while no one else around him will believe what he tells them. It makes for a very riveting film full to the brim with mystery and intrigue.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a combination of so many great elements. One of those elements is obviously the director himself, Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was a master of groundbreaking creativity in visual storytelling, and he utilized all kinds of new techniques in his films, Rear Window included. The entire movie takes place in Jeffries' apartment and the camera respects this aspect. Every shot towards the multiple people Jeffries spies on is set up at the appropriate distance that Jeffries actually is. Thus our view and audio is as limited as the actual character in the movie. In fact, every bit of audio in the film is in context. One of the people in Jeffries' neighborhood is an aspiring musician, thus all the music in the film comes from this man's apartment, and yet it is still very fitting music, as well as prevalent in most scenes where it is appropriate. Hitchcock also displays his innovative storytelling ability by telling multiple stories around the neighborhood, all of which adhere to Jeffries' view from his window. We have the story of the musician obviously, as well as a young married couple, and a lonely girl who is slowly becoming depressed when she can find nobody to love. Her story even intertwines with another towards the end of the film, allowing this neighborhood to be many individual stories, while also a collaboration of one. The main focus is obviously on the murder suspect directly across from Jeffries. And rightfully so.<br/><br/>Another thing which drives the excellence of Rear Window is a limited, yet fantastic cast. James Stewart is just unbelievably talented and never drops below a level of complete brilliance in this film. He combines a perfect element of drama and suspense with his own comedic flare which is both sarcastic and at times sardonic. Alongside him is his lover, Lisa Fremont, who is played by the beautiful Grace Kelly. She plays off of Stewart incredibly well and the two of them become an very believable set of characters. The movie focuses on their relationship and its past, and yet it never forgets what it is truly about, which is the murder mystery. Everything in the movie works very well with each other, and never becomes too much about one thing.<br/><br/>And if just being a fascinating and highly entertaining movie wasn't enough, Rear Window even raises some ethical questions concerning what Jeffries is doing as he spies on his fellow neighbors. The characters undergo a constant internal struggle of whether or not it is truly worth it to prove their suspects innocence or guilt. This is still a very relevant ethical debate in a society where we value our privacy more than anything in the entire world it seems. Rear Window keeps you thinking about things like this through its entirety, yet it never forgets that it is a movie where suspense and mystery are the central focus, and so it remains high value entertainment the whole way through. It's hard to find a balance between preachy and entertaining, yet Rear Window does a very good job at it.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock never ceases to amaze, and in his long list of films it's hard to find one that won't keep you at least mildly interested. Rear Window goes above and beyond mildly interesting and succeeds in becoming a fantastic mystery film with all of its own unique merits. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit abrupt and you can't help but wish for more, but everything else about the movie is so fantastic. This is a must see film."

","In film there are technical masterpieces such as Citizen Kane and Psycho and then there are true masterpieces. Those true masterpieces are not only technically proficient if not technically pioneering, they are pleasures to watch; they give us characters with whom we want to spend time.<br/><br/>We can visit those characters repeatedly and never tire of the same actions and dialog. There are maybe a dozen films that accomplish that for me, and Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, and Rear Window are at the top of that short list. They are as perfect as movies can be when it comes to inventing cinematic worlds in which attractive characters invite us to visit and frequently return."

","Rear Window is a smart thriller. With well-written dialogue, a great cast, and mounting suspense, it proves that a movie can be good even if the setting never changes. Although I liked the very end, which concludes the stories of all the different people Jimmy Stewart's character has been watching, the climax could have been a bit better. It ends too abruptly. Other than that, Alfred Hitchcock scores again. Not many other directors could have turned the somewhat simple story that Rear Window is into a great movie. Hitchcock would have turned 111 years old last Friday. Although he never won an Academy Award, he had a very long and successful movie career, and had a family that he loved very much."

","Bart Simpson breaks his leg when the family gets a new swimming pool. He is stuck in his room with a cast on his leg and he is bored out of his mind....oops wrong synopsis. Sub Jimmy Stewart for Bart Simpson and you have your story of Rear Window. L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries suspects his neighbour has killed his own wife and tries to solve the mystery while stuck in his wheelchair. The premise is pretty simple, yet Hitchcock gives us something more with this film, he gives us exactly what our society craves voyeurism. Even to this day we can't go by without thinking or wanting or actually trying to peak into the lives of others.<br/><br/>Rear Window marks my fourth Hitchcock film I've seen, yet it sneaks into my favourite spot. Is it boring for someone to say that one of the more popular Hitchcock films is currently his favourite? I don't care, I know a good film when I see one and Rear Window is just that. More than 50 years later this film manages to still be relevant today and hold up successfully well in the suspense department. The recent Shia LaBeouf remake Distrubia, while a good thriller, suffers from the technology syndrome. Years from now the film will be dated with that ankle bracelet technology holding Shia in, just like the giant cell phone Zack Morris carries with him everywhere. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and this is credited to Hitchcock and his attention to detail. <br/><br/>I absolutely love, adore and cherish the art direction in this film. How beautiful is the set design? Knowing that they used the basement as part of the set design only heightens my enjoyment of it. The second floor of the apartments was actually the stage floor. Stunning in my opinion. The opening scene giving us a glimpse into the lives of the people who live in the apartments around Stewart is marvelous. We never go into their lives, we just see it from Stewarts (and our) viewpoint. We never leave his room, save for the ending and a scene that involves the death of a dog. Those close ups of the people listening to the lady yelling seem out of place because we immediately jump out of Stewart's room and into the open area. It's alarmingly jarring and seems out of place for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Hitchcock ones again proves us that a good story (he most certainly had his hand in crafting the story) trumps everything else. How suspenseful can a film be when our hero never leaves his room, hell he never really leaves his wheelchair. Hitchcock manages to pull it off gracefully. It's nice to see where films today get their inspiration from. When the lights in the hallway go out at Stewart's apartment, I thought of No Country For Old Men. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense. <br/><br/>Grace Kelly is absolutely stunning. I never really cared for the looks of the actresses of the old 50's or 60's. None of them caught my eye, Grace Kelly think is the first one to do so. I don't even think Marilyn Monroe did. Her introduction shot is graceful and most certainly memorable. I can't finish this review without mentioning Thelma Ritter. She was hilarious and everything she did felt so natural. I absolutely loved her character. <br/><br/>Rear Window is more suspenseful today than most thrillers that come to theatres. The little glimpses into the lives of the people around the setting is what really drew me in though, the song writer, Miss Torso, Miss Hearing Aid, and the balcony couple. These are nice little addition from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock."

","Psycho is definitely Hitchcock's most shocking film, thanks to its infamous shower scene and gruesome finale, but as far as pure suspense goes, it doesn't get much better than Rear Window, which sees the director wringing every possible ounce of tension from his ingenious premise: a professional photographer, confined to his room with a broken leg, wiles away the hours observing the lives of the people with whom he shares a courtyard; when he notices one of his neighbours acting in a very suspicious manner, he comes to believe that the man has murdered his wife.<br/><br/>James Stewart plays L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, the poor guy confined to a wheelchair who notices unusual goings on in the apartment opposite; Grace Kelly is his adoring but seemingly incompatible socialite girlfriend Lisa; Wendell Corey is disbelieving detective Lt. Thomas J. Doyle; Thelma Ritter is L.B.'s advice-giving nurse; and Raymond Burr is the surly and burly salesman with the missing wife. This excellent central cast is supported by a raft of brilliantly developed incidental characters without whom the director's main theme of voyeurism would be worthless: L.B.'s spying is ultimately justified by the fact that he solves a crime, but by having his protagonist also invade the privacy of many other individuals, Hitchcock is questioning the ethics of 'innocently' snooping on strangers.<br/><br/>And the director makes us, his audience, feel just as culpable: not only do we join L.B. in his dubious hobby of peeping through the window, but as the viewer of the film, we are made to feel doubly guilty, for we are also poking our noses into the troubled relationship between L.B and Lisa.<br/><br/>In addition to all of this interesting investigation of the human psyche, we also get a damn good thriller to boot, one which sees Hitchcock at his very best, weaving a taut tale that delivers the mundane and the macabre in equal doses, but which builds inexorably to a hugely exciting climax. There are several excellent edge-of-the-seat nail-biters on the way to the final showdown between L.B. and the killer that sees the photographer fighting for his life as he is slowly pushed out of a window several stories up—it's a guaranteed heart in mouth moment if ever there was one.<br/><br/>After all of this intense action, Hitchcock rounds off the film with a superb ending that lightens the mood perfectly whilst clearly displaying the director's somewhat warped sense of humour: there's a happy ending for all of the people who have had their privacy invaded, Lisa has successfully convinced her man that she can be as adventurous as he is, but poor old L.B is still stuck in the same boat—he's in a wheelchair, and now he has two broken legs!!!"

","Alfred Hitchcock is known as the ""Master of Suspense"". By now, this seems a cinematic cliché, but it is so very true. The man knew how to direct films that keep you riveted to your seat, wondering what will happen next to the characters he has presented to you. Rear Window is a prime example of this.<br/><br/>Rear Window is the story of L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), a photographer who broke his leg while on assignment. While confined to his apartment in a wheelchair, he has three main links to the outside world: his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter); his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly); and his large rear window, which provides him a view of many goings-on in the surrounding apartment buildings. Jefferies comes to know a lot about the daily routines of these neighbors, and he becomes suspicious when one man begins to act in ways out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>In this film, the suspense is layered thickly. There were parts during which I sat with my mouth agape, wondering what would happen next to the characters investigating this potential crime. However, Hitchcock makes this more than simply a suspense film. There is *a lot* of character study here; we learn volumes about both the main characters and the neighbors that they view from the window. There is speculation on the nature and ethics of voyeurism, whether Jefferies, Lisa, and Stella really should be doing what they are doing. There is also a message about what a neighbor truly is, and how that sort of relationship has grown weaker in our modern world. (How much more so now, over 55 years after this movie's release?) <br/><br/>Rear Window is quintessential Hitchcock. Admittedly, I have not yet seen many of his films. (Other than this, I have only seen Rebecca and Psycho.) I think it's safe to say, however, that this film provides the same combination of elements that make his other films great: gripping suspense, characters we can really get to know, and thoughtful exploration of the things we humans do."

The set design and the cinematography allowing the viewer to witness all of the different characters living in this neighborhood is simply amazing and unforgettable, and Hitchcock was able to really pull me into every scene. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are magnificent together and I loved how the film had just as much intimacy and romance as mystery. Outstanding film!"

","Rear Window is a real gem and worth every second of your time it takes. It's one of those films that starts very slow and builds up to a thrilling climax. This has been my favorite film for a while now,probably because of the chemistry of actors James Stewart and Grace Kelly bringing outstanding performances to this banquet of a table.<br/><br/>Let's discuss the plot, L.B Jeffries(James Stewart) is a photographer having to rest in his two room apartment. His girlfriend Lisa Fremont a fashion designer(Grace Kelly) and Stella, a company nurse(Thelma Ritter) takes care of him while his leg is broken. One day,sitting and looking out the window he begins to see things he shouldn't see. One man across the way named Lars Thorwald(Raymond Burr) is caught by Jeff leaving his apartment 3 times and coming home 3 times. He asks Lisa what it means. She tells him that his wife must be welcoming him home.This causes a minor dispute between the couple. Then one day she realizes what could be happening. Together, The two set aside their differences and try to solve this puzzle. In the mix, is an old acquaintance of Jeff named Doyle(Wendell Corey) who doesn't believe Jeff. As the tension builds the murder is slowly solved with ease (The work of movie suspense pioneer Alfred Hitchcock (A true genius).). Thorwald in fact killed his wife and a dog living next door who was digging in the area where he buried a clue to the murder (we don't find out what it is). Thorwald finds out someone was on to him which leads to a battle for survival between Jeff and Thorwald. Jeff survives and Thorwald is sent to prison for the murder of his wife. And everyone else lives happily ever after (i guess?).<br/><br/>To wrap this up, Rear Window is a very intriguing powerhouse of suspense with spectacular cinematography by Robert Burks,great plot twists and development, superb acting and over all a cinematic gem that should be seen by those looking for suspense and mystery. P.S this is quite family friendly movie. So,sit back and relax and enjoy Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. 10/10 stars. Two thumbs up. whatever will please you. Highly recommended. Check it out.<br/><br/>On a Quick Note did any see the flash of light coming from up on the higher levels of Thorwald's building in the opening scene please respond on the message board or something.

","I love a good suspense-thriller, and Rear Window is one of the best classic examples of the genre. It's excellently paced, and balances tension and levity. There's no doubt that it holds up well 50+ years after its creation.   <br/><br/>Grace Kelly is my favorite of Alfred Hitchcock's leading ladies, and her pairing with Jimmy Stewart really pushes Rear Window over top. For a movie with so few main characters, it was absolutely essential that the two leads have chemistry and be capable actors, and their were few other people at that time who satisfied both those requirements more than these two.<br/><br/>Limiting the story to what the protagonists can see from their apartment window was an intentional creative constraint that helped Hitchcock to fully develop the themes of the movie. I never knew that such a singular point of view could offer such a riveting and interesting experience. I don't exactly consider Rear Window to be the ""best"" Hitchcock movie, but it is my favorite that I've seen so far."

","Bound to a wheelchair following an accident, a photographer passes time by spying on his neighbors and believes that one of them has committed a murder. Hitchcock was at the peak of his creative powers in the 1950s, and this is one of his masterpieces. He's quite innovative in using a single, confined set to tell his suspenseful story. Stewart perfectly conveys the frustrations, fears, and vulnerabilities of the hapless photographer. Kelly's brief career peaked in 1954 and this is arguably her best film. Ritter is marvelous as Stewart's wisecracking caregiver. Interestingly, Burr, who plays the murder suspect here, would go on to play the wheelchair-bound cop Ironside on TV."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","0","5","5 February 2010"," One of the most tense thrillers.
","It are often the most simplistic movies that are the most tense ones. ""Rear Window"" is a movie with a very simple concept and the entire movie is set at just one location but yet it manages to become a great and tense, mystery/thriller.<br/><br/>This movie is voyeurism at its very best. In essence everybody is voyeuristic. People love to watch other people. Just like at all the reality shows we have got now days. Those shows exist because there is a popular demand for it, not because they are all so brilliant to watch. But everybody is just interested to look in other person's lives and when something strange or unusual occurs across the street you'll all be watching through the window to see what is going on or what happened. This movie seems to understand this human nature and it exploits it with a great story about a man who suspects his neighbor from across the street to have killed his wife.<br/><br/>It's a very simple concept that is being executed to the max. We as the viewers also don't know what has happened, since we, as well as the movie its main character, are stuck in this one room, that looks out on the rear side of a building-block. It makes the movie its mystery work out well, since we only get provided with little pieces of information all the time. It's pretty much a big mystery what had happened all across the street and if the neighbor is indeed guilty of killing his wife, or has she just simply left town, as he claims, for the fresh air to cure her illness. The movie can go either way with its story all of the time, which really adds to the overall tension and mystery of the movie. Hitchcock really manages to build up the mystery and tension well with this one.<br/><br/>This movie is also visually and technically a great accomplishment. Hitchcock has always been a director that tries on some new experimental stuff for its movies and found new ways to tell a story. This movie is entirely set at one location, that got build inside of a studio. A real accomplishment to build such a massive apartment complex inside a studio and work with this just one view for the entire movie.<br/><br/>The movie has Hitchcock regulars James Stewart and Grace Kelly as the main leads. It's especially a big and important role for Stewart, since he really has to carry this movie, as a temporarily wheelchair bounded photographer who has nothing else to do but to spy on his neighbors. Also Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr play some excellent roles.<br/><br/>One of the most unique and genuinely tense made thrillers from the master of suspense.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"avi0107","10","0","3","24 January 2010"," A masterpiece...in every aspect.
","Hitchcock has directed many classics, innovated various techniques and provided the people unique thrilled throughout his career but if there is a movie I would personally consider as his best, it would be Rear Window. Rear window is a masterpiece, it blew me away the first time and I'm still as impressed after several viewings. The premise of the movie is pretty simple, a man in cast sitting by his window and basically spying on his neighbors. The set is amazing and the atmosphere captivating. Hitchcock came up with the brilliant idea of having real sound recording. There is no external soundtrack, for example, we can here a song in the movie, only if one of the characters is playing it or listening to it and the whole soundtrack was recorded from the room where most of the movie takes place(Jeff's apartment), providing really raw sound which added a superb effect to the atmosphere. The cast is amazing. James Stewart is as good as ever in the role of Jeff and Grace Kelly is simply enchanting as Lisa. The romance is entertaining and interesting enough. The dialogues are very pleasant,Jeff-Lisa arguments are thoroughly entertaining and Stella's dark humor is a very welcomed touch. The directing is top notch as one would expect. Hitchcock does an amazing job here in creating an interaction between the audience and the film. The way this is filmed enables the audience be Jeff Jefferies and accompany the characters in this movie. This is a movie that has got it all, every ingredient for an entertainment feast; the thrill, the intensity, the Hitchock suspense, the superb atmosphere, entertaining romance, the comedic aspect, a great cast, a masterful director...this is a classic. This is a movie that imo will never age and will always be considered as the masterpiece that it is. A movie to discover and re-discover for any cinema lovers:the ultimate must-see."

","Alfred Hitchcock; what hasn't been said about this great man? I'm no Hitchcock fanatic, but I can comment on his significance as a great filmmaker. The man knew his way around the camera in ways that are highly instructive in how today's filmmakers should learn to make movies. One thing I have noticed about the few Hitchcock movies I've seen is that the man has an eye for simplicity - that is simply telling stories that by themselves seem insignificant, but something, I'm not sure what exactly, I guess just the way he tells his stories, composes his scenes, and directs his actors are nothing short of brilliant and instructive.<br/><br/>One of his more acclaimed and masterful films is 1954's ""Rear Window,"" an adaptation of the short story ""It Had to Be Murder"" by Cornell Woolrich. ""Rear Window"" concerns wheelchair-bound photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries's (James Stewart) routine observations of his neighbors from his apartment perch overlooking a Greenwich Village courtyard, a ""hobby"" he takes to in order to ease the pains of boredom. At home recovering from an on-the-job injury, he keeps tabs on his neighbors, but as they say that curiosity killed the cat, Jeff thinks he gets wind of his neighbor Lars Thorward (Raymond Burr) murdering his nagging, invalid wife. Pretty soon Jeff's attempts to prove murder become an obsession, an obsession in which he also draws his socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) into as well.<br/><br/>We really get to know the characters in ""Rear Window,"" the other apartment tenants, I mean. Incredibly enough, we actually know very little of the main characters played by James Stewart and Grace Kelly. Both Stewart and Kelly are good in excellent, well-known performances. They are interesting characters by themselves and we get to know their problematic romantic entanglement... um, relationship, but Jeff's observations of his neighbors occasionally make them far more interesting characters. Through Jeff's observations and musings, we come to learn a lot about his neighbors, even though they themselves have little dialogue or screen time.<br/><br/>The film's message couldn't really be any more clear, and that's the moral and ethical questions of watching people when they think no one's looking, and the desire people have for privacy in their own homes away from stranger's eyes. I also think it goes a little bit deeper: people are strange, and they're even stranger behind close doors when they think no one's watching. But it's within those people's rights to be strange in their own homes, behind close doors. Sometimes, however, those strange activities can hide dangerous behaviors that can have great implications for those around them, as Jeff, Lisa, and others soon find out in ""Rear Window's"" inescapable, all-too suspenseful climax.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is yet another brilliant and well-composed feature-film from Alfred Hitchcock. I'm giving the film a ""10,"" like I have his other films, the best of which, in my opinion, is the landmark suspense-thriller ""Psycho"" (1960).<br/><br/>10/10"

","..We like to think that if a film is from a certain era, it is going to be slow and boring. I am writing to you as someone who previously owned this mindset. I really had to put my ADD aside when watching this film. It seems that I, like many of us, have grown accustomed to unpredictable plot twists with large explosions and clean special effects. If that is what you need to enjoy a film, then please look elsewhere; but if you enjoy great acting, suspense, and women who actual have curves; then this is the movie for you. I must say that Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly were magnificent. It is rare now days to find actors with such unique characteristics that made them an icon. The love between these two was very evident and I was glad to see Grace stick by her man through it all. This movie was filmed entirely on a single set which can make for a feeling of claustrophobia, but at the same time it allows you to relate to Jimmy Stewart's character as being confined inside his home with a broken leg. The beginning of this film was drawn out and took some real refocusing on my part to keep me moving along, but just as I was drifting off there would be a shot of a hot neighbor girl dancing in her 50s bikini to draw me back in. Once you get past the first 30 minutes or so, you really begin to feel for Stewart's character. You see the paranoia take hold as he begins to see the events of a possible murder unfold. You can feel his frustration when the people who are supposed trust him refuse to believe what he is saying. One scene that particularly stands out is when Grace Kelly's character enters the home of the killer to gather more evidence when she is caught and confronted by the killer. I was on the edge of my seat and felt almost as if I were the one watching helplessly as my future wife was manhandled by this brute. This movie is a roller-coaster of emotion and that is why it is a classic. Horror should give you the chills and good horror should freak you out, this does both. This is captured perfectly in the scene when the neighbor's dog is killed. The killer' room is dark and Stewart's character can see nothing, but he knows the killer is there. The suspense builds culminating in the strike of a match and the glimpse of the killer sitting alone is his room watching and waiting. There is so much this movie has to offer, it is fear on the simplest level and done very well. Hitchcock's use of shadow and cinematography is legendary and he holds nothing back in this wonderful film. Love him or hate him, this is a must see in the Hitchcock collection, granite you can get past the first 30 minutes or so."

","Rear Window (1954): James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr, Judith Evelyn, Ross Bagdasarian, Georgine Darcy, Sarah Berner, Frank Cady, Jesslyn Fax, Rand Harper, Irene Winston, Havis Davenport, Alan Lee, Anthony Warde, Benny Bartlett, Harry Landers, Iphigenie Castiglioni....Director Alfred Hitchcock, Writer/Screenplay John Michael Hayes, based on the short story ""It Had To Be Murder"" by Cornell Woolrich.<br/><br/>With ""Rear Window"" director Alfred Hitchcock began his greatest hits decade, the 1950's. A master of suspense and what was at the time considered thrillers, Hitchock created a successful franchise of movies that endured into the mid 1960's. He also had his own TV series with half-hour episodes full of suspense and intrigue. ""Rear Window"" released in '54, starred James Stewart, a veteran of Hollywood whose popularity had not yet diminished. Hitchcock would cast him again as a lead in the 1958 ""Vertigo"", which was also a hit. Opposite Stewart is the equally iconic Grace Kelly, who was for Hitchcock, the perfect Hitchcock film heroine - blonde, beautiful, cool and a damsel in distress. He would later cast his favorite leading lady in another classic winner Dial M for Murder released the same year. With two big names as Stewart and Kelly, Hitchcock took Hollywood by the horns.<br/><br/>Plot: Wheelchair bound Jeff Jefferies (Stewart) lives in a crowded tenement slum in New York City. His fiancée Lisa (Kelly) loves him despite her privileged background and distance. Having nothing else to do, Jeff becomes a voyeur at his window and observes the daily rituals and snippets of the lives of his neighbors, who just happen to leave their windows open all the time. It's a colorful cast: Miss Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn) a lonely, single middle-aged woman who longs for love and cannot seem to find it, the Songwriter (Ross Bagdasarian) who labors over the same tune and entertains party guests, ""Miss Torso"" the gorgeous ballerina who draws a lot of male attention, a newlywed couple, a couple that are NOT so newlywed and the main draw - Lars Thorwald (Burr) whose invalid, bed-ridden wife mysteriously disappears. Jeff is convinced Lars has murdered his wife but all he has are suspicions. There are nightly departures from his apartment, a missing wife whose whereabouts are not known, mysterious long distance phone calls and some other things that seem very odd such as the missing clothes and jewels of his wife. Before long, he gets his nurse involved (Thelma Ritter), his landlord and yes his girlfriend. Are Jeff's suspicious unfounded ? Has his voyeurism led him to some fantastic conclusions that are not real ? What really goes on behind closed doors ? What do people do when they think they are not being watched ? The voyeuristic slant of this film seems to be one of many of the ""neurosis"" or psychosis themed films with characters whose problems are on the inside but whose world we are sucked into with horrifying force. This film is not violent, nor is it even the least bit eerie. It's a mystery plain and simple with an A list cast and with Hitchcock doing his best early in his career as America's King of Suspense at a time when these types of films were quite new. It's interesting to note how there are besides Stewart and Kelly, 2 other big names - Raymond Burr and Ross Bagdasarian. Burr was a well known figure in Hollywood himself and became the iconic TV star ""Perry Mason"". Ross Bagdaarian went on to become a songwriter (much like his character in this film) who wrote successful hits in the early 60's via the animated cartoons The Chipmunks - ""Witch Doctor"", ""Hurry Christmas"" and other hit songs."

With a the master trademark ""bomb-under-the-breakfast-table"" suspense, matched with a perfect mix of romance and deft bits of humor, it's not hard to see why many of Hitch's fans regard this as the definitive Hitchcock movie.<br/><br/>Still one of the best of Hitchcock collaborators (and still one of my favorite actors), James Stewart plays J.B.

To pass the time, Jeff watches his neighbors in the adjoined apartment buildings, watching their everyday dramas and goings-on. Perhaps one of the best qualities about the movie is Hitch and screenwriter John Michael Hayes introducing us to a series of quirky everyday characters like Ms. Torso (Georgine Darcy), a sexy partying ballerina; Ms. Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn), a heartbroken single woman; a frustrated songwriter (Ross Bagdasarian) whose a little lost with words; and a newlywed couple who confines their private dramas in a closed window (I think there's as much mystery behind those blinds as there is in the whole movie). Then there's Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling salesman living with his nagging sick wife. That is until he starts leaving his apartment every night, and his wife is nowhere in sight.<br/><br/>Stewart doesn't take sole credit; the glamorous Grace Kelly gives an excellent supporting performance as Jeff's up-class girlfriend Lisa who shares his enthusiasm with Thorwald's strange activities. Burr is subtly effective as the mysterious Thorwald (who doesn't utter a single line up until the climax) and Thelma Ritter is witty as Jeff's no-nonsense nurse. Even the background characters are excellent! It's a little slow-going, especially during the first half where several main and background characters are introduced, and the plot has been ripped-off and imitated several times that it has since become a cliché. Not that it matters. So it proves in the test of time, Hitchcock's original is still a classic and he's still head and shoulders above the rest.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","The extent of my experience of Hitchcock previously went little further than some foggy recollection of watching Psycho an awfully long time ago. when my girlfriend rather spontaneously brought home a box-set, I was intrigued but my modest expectations were to be completely blown out of the water by this, the perfect introduction to the master of suspense.<br/><br/>Rear Window establishes everything, from the beautifully drawn characters, the location and premise so convincingly that the movie just entraps you for its entire duration. James Stewart plays a photographer prone to danger who is incapacitated after an injury and relegated to the confines of a chair; he fills his dwindling hours by observing his neighbours from his rear window. The more he see's, the more he becomes involved with the peculiarities of their live's. When he suspects foul play, we're taken on a trip of obsession; is it all some elaborate misunderstanding compounded by his boredom and solitude or has he uncovered a vile story simply through watching? <br/><br/>Unmissable cinema."
"TheHande","9","0","1","19 August 2009"," Simple but simply brilliant
","The concept of the Rear Window is so quaint its positively humbling. The idea of setting an entire film in just one location would seem like a major faux pas in a thriller film. However, the approach is justified, the viewer is subjected to the main character's point of view of the events which at the same time creates a small element of doubt as to what the viewer is seeing is really happening.<br/><br/>The acting performances are old school, but they serve the style of the film and help it stay interesting. Hitchcock's films tend to have very good dialogue and I like listening to it.<br/><br/>What surprises me about the film is how dark it is in spite of seeming so innocent. It has the elements of a great detective story but with a detective who can't leave the room. The one small special-effect moment at the end is probably the only part of the film that doesn't fully work but even it is a minor flaw in an otherwise marvelous movie which still holds up."

"duckmaster09","9","0","1","13 July 2009"," Professional Voyeurism
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a cinematic masterpiece. It starts out by showing that the main character, Jeff (James Stewart), has broken his leg and is confined to a wheelchair for seven weeks. Since Jeff can't go back to work, he decides to take out some old binoculars and see what his neighbors are up to. Jeff is surprisingly good at spying on his neighbors because he's a professional photographer. Within the first few days of his spying, he becomes suspicious of one of his neighbors, Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr), after his wife disappears. Jeff keeps a close eye on Thorwald with the help of his girlfriend and his therapist, and attempts to dig up some evidence to prove him guilty. This movie is a classic Hitchcock thriller and is full of suspense until the very end.<br/><br/>In many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, such as ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", and ""Vertigo"", voyeurism is a key element. Voyeurism would be best described as spying on others without being noticed (usually for sexual gratification). In ""Rear Window"", it is one of the main themes of the movie. Hitchcock isn't satisfied by just having the audience witness the voyeurism, so he realizes that most people have voyeuristic urges or tendencies and he intensifies the voyeurism in his movies using certain audio and visual effects to make the audience feel like they themselves are the voyeurs! Although this may seem a bit odd, it helps portray his message that voyeurism is wrong, and it may have had positive results in ""Rear Window"", but it leads to paranoia.<br/><br/>In ""Rear Window"", Hitchcock uses bizarre audio and visual effects to scare his audiences. During the many scenes in which Jeff is using binoculars or his camera to watch his neighbors, the view is limited to an oval to make the audience feel linked with Jeff. At the same time, the only audio we hear (besides dialogue) is sirens off in the distance and sounds normally associated with a dark, dangerous city street. These effects make the audience feel the same emotions that Jeff feels and they give these parts a very ominous feeling."

","This movie is what got me into Hitchcock films. Being a young buck at the age of 24, sometimes it takes a good kick-in-the-head to understand the value of good storytelling/film-making. If ANY movie these days can make me feel as gripped with anticipation, well you'll probably see a similar review from me on it's page.<br/><br/>The campy-ness of this film is what makes it so unique. The story virtually unfolds in front of a voyeur looking out his window. He's debilitated by a broken leg and has to stay home. Watching his neighbors becomes a consuming hobby... and he realizes that something dark and mysterious is happening at the apartment across the way.<br/><br/>As I said, most of the scenes play out from the perspective of looking through a window. He watches the lives of his neighbors, however whimsical... or tragic (note: the lonely woman downstairs). I haven't seen another movie like this. It's great when a film-maker can take a simple location, and a simple idea and turn it into so much more.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that James Stewart is one of my favorite actors of all time. If you love good cinema, and if you love suspense and mystery - I HIGHLY recommend Rear Window. I'm just disappointed that it took me so long to get around to watching it."

","This is a suspense; which, of course, is an interesting place to talk about Hitchcock's sense of humor. James Stewart's, Thelma Ritter's (the no-nonsense nurse, God bless her soul), and, lo behold, even Grace Kelly's! Which makes me wonder why Chinese movies can be funny, but are generally not very humorous. Humor is not a lipstick that is applied at the last moment, to lighten things up. As the New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane puts it, humor in movies should be ""something that is already there---a luminous, natural coloring under the thrills, a blush in the very notion of romance"". That's why the comic moments in Chinese movies always strike me as contrived, as carefully--but separately--planned, like in Sad, really."

","I for one know just how good of a filmmaker that Alfred Hitchcock is certainly the master of suspense. I for one enjoy his masterpiece ""Psycho"", and this 1954 classic ""Rear Window"" ranks as a good suspense classic for one it was done in a unique way by Hitchcock the way it was mostly shot in a one room apartment from the lead character who had an across the way view of his own world. The film was shot in such an insular manner. Still over the years many say this is a voyeur film, I disagree true temptation is present from his views of a sexy ballet dancer across the street. Still all in all it proves your sight can come in handy to reveal info after it sees the drama before hand.<br/><br/>The plot is good and really suspenseful for the 1950's as legendary James Stewart is L.B. Jeffries a sidelined professional photo journalist who's in his high rise apartment with a broken leg. His life has become all to common with boredom therefore he turns his attention across the view way to the apartments watching the everyday happenings of a ballet dancer, a salesman and his nagging wife along with a piano player. True this may be spying and being to eager yet his sight will turn to be a good friend and lead to an eagerness that will produce a discovery. As when the nagging wife disappears he suspects the salesman, then he enlists the investigation to get started with his opposites attract elegant and sophisticated girlfriend(played by the beautiful Grace Kelly). The film builds with tension and pretty good suspenseful feel for a 50's film leading to a surprise kind of twist ending. Overall pretty good suspense classic from Hitch especially for the unique way he shot most of the scenes form one room of the lead character. It proves too the moral that being immobile isn't important just remember your eyes and sense of sight is the most powerful tool. As when you look out and across you never know what you may find or discover as seeing will lead to suspicion and become a truth finder."

","Photojournalist Jeffries (Stewart) suspects his neighbour (Burr) of murdering his wife.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a film that will make you smile. Rear Window is that first breathe of fresh air in the morning. Rear Window is vintage mystery and uncontrollable excitement.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's mystery drama starts with an artistic and unbelievably long opening shot covering all the windows and apartments from the point of view of James Stewart's Jeffries. Almost as long as the opening to Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future opening montage this is superb sophistication in justifying the surroundings. Long and spontaneous this opening shows many people but little of the story, which makes for an engaging viewing.<br/><br/>The settings for this film are amazing. Having all the shots filmed from the point of view from Jeffries' apartment would apparently limit Hitchcock's approach to the story but in fact gives a widespread account of the world around the central character. Point of views, long and short shots Rear Window is able to justify the intensity of the mystery at hand. Not to mention wonderful tracking shots and an especial use of moving from place to place in a fluid and controlled sophistication.<br/><br/>The whole mystery aspect will keep you entwined right until the end. There is simply no let up and with so many possible plot holes you have yourself a tale that will keep you hooked until all the holes are reformed.<br/><br/>This wouldn't have been so sophisticated hadn't it been for Stewart's obsessed and paranoid character. Good performance by the It's a Wonderful Life star but the talented approach to the narrative is what gets the blood pumping. The script is handled in a delicate and simplistic way but making it consistently enthralling and engaging for viewers of any age. The question of whether the murder happened or not is open right until the racing finale with the viewer always questioning Jeffries' obsessive nature deluding himself from the truth.<br/><br/>There are continuous twists and turns in the tale of the supposed murder but the use of spying helps give an idea of obsession and lack of health. Not to mention the fact that important points happen away from the main focus, giving the film a hidden depth along with a wonderful central story, making a wonderful artistic mystery."

","Rear Window is considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement. I don't quite share that sentiment. I much prefer Psycho, Rebecca, Vertigo, and maybe even Marnie to this film. However, this is still Hitchcock, and that means another thriller classic. Frantic James Stewart, gorgeous Grace Kelly, and wise Thelma Ritter are simply awesome and just like almost all Hitchock films, there is a very intense scene or two that has you gripping the arm of the chair until your knuckles hurt. The main premise of the story has been highly publicized and spoofed over the years (anyone see the Simpsons's episode where Bart plays the Stewart character?), so the fact that Stewart is laid up in his apartment due to injury and spies on his neighbors offers little surprise. It has to be noted that this is still far superior to attempted remakes (most notably, Disturbia from 2007), even though the movie is made some 53 years earlier. I had to take away some points for sets and props simply because the movie never really leaves the apartment complex, but keep in mind that this is done on purpose to create a certain claustrophobia so these points are evened out by the great direction and editing. Although it seems to be a bit more highly regarded and popular than it should be, this gem should be on everyone's ""To Watch"" list."
"mccolvil","8","0","1","8 December 2008"," Unreasonably Happy
","How many stories end with a man falling in love without even leaving his apartment? Not many, the tale is heartwarming and Grace Kelley is well, warming in general. To see the thesis of the dog-lady so rapidly denied the only set back for the optimist is that it took a murder to accomplish it. A small price to pay for an audience. For a critic it's a great one.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is always about how the movie is shot anyway, who should worry about the witty James Stewart dialogue or even Grace Kelley's warmth when it's completely overshadowed by genius camera work and a stunning set, described so beautifully that one audience member may even feel as though they are familiar with an area similar to it if they chanced upon it in real life.<br/><br/>Is that the point, that this goes on everywhere? That, like as in Network we are too tightly wrapped up in our own redundant affairs to even give our neighbors a glance? Well the character who would most like to escape from monotony or commitment to marriage or just everyday life cannot. In fact it drives him crazy and watching Stewart suffer and slowly succumb to the everyday miserable lives of his neighbors is something to behold.<br/><br/>Didn't Hitchcock say that the best thing you can do is ""make the audience suffer as much as possible""? He sure as hell hits the spot here. Stewart's seemingly inevitable demise is only trumped by the male audience's (and female's) desire for him to shape up and finally give in to Kelley and fall in love.<br/><br/>But in the end it's a love story, like all stories, and Stewart is content to be with a newly found old love, and she loves him like a good woman. Sometimes you wish brilliant men had been born in different centuries, sometimes different decades. The movie thrills and chills all the way up to the end..."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","1","23 July 2008"," Suspense is only the foundation for Hitchcock's psychological masterpiece
","If you describe yourself as the type of person who loves people-watching, then ""Rear Window"" should or already does rank as one of your favorite films. Not that dissecting people's voyeuristic tendencies is the film's only strength, but it is certainly what sets this film apart from all other films as well as other Alfred Hitchcock classics. It operates at a much slower pace, and it isolates the viewer by almost never taking the camera out of the room. This experimental technique is the mark of the artist working on his masterpiece, which is certainly the case (although just the first of many) with Hitchcock and ""Rear Window."" <br/><br/>I don't think any director who didn't have his own checkbook could have successfully pitched this film's concept. It's about a photographer named L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who breaks his leg and has nothing to do all day but watch the people outside this window. Then one day he sees something suspicion and is taken in by it completely. It sounds like classic Hitchcock paranoia thriller, but it's too static and uneventful for that to summarize it accurately. The suspense that Hitchcock is masterful at is merely used as a crutch to keep this film going. Its ultimate goal is to make you just as itchy and paranoid as Jeffries is.<br/><br/>The way that Hitchcock brings you right into the lens (pun intended) of his main character is about as good it can be done in film-making. Stewart is a good actor, but it's more about the perspective and the isolating feel of this one-set film that gets you to conspire along with Jeffries, trying to figure out what's going on because you desperately want some sort of drama. But Hitchcock never gives you drama--he gives you suspense, suspicion and suggestions about all the people outside the window in the surrounding apartments--but never drama. It's sinister and cruel, but it's absolutely genius. It takes a true master to earn appreciation for that kind of a technique.<br/><br/>Just as good as the exploration of human nature at an impersonal distance is that at a personal distance. The relationship between Jeffries and girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) is about the close as the film gets to drama. Jeffries is convinced that her posh, urban mindset is not the right fit for his adventurous, rugged photojournalist lifestyle. Their troubles and the fact that he's more focused on the people outside his window than her adds to the complicated contrast between reality and perceived reality. Kelly is absolutely stunning and it adds to the strength of her role.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, Hitchcock rides a fine line between truth and perception in this film and has you on the fence the entire time, bringing things to a trademark climax that gets your heart pumping. In general, however, this film is for those with a love of suspense and an appreciation of films that keep you inside your head the entire time. It is not a traditional thriller though it plays off some of those characteristics. It's really hard to get comfortable in this film, which is it's only weakness but perhaps its greatest strength."
"stealth4933","9","0","3","23 July 2008"," Good movie, but not a masterpiece
","I had a relatively blah rating of Rear Window on here a couple years back, and now I am compelled to re-write my review. You might say that that is the sign of a good movie, something that continues to get better over time. The brilliance of Rear Window is in two things.<br/><br/>The first is the fact that it is incredibly hard to be bored by it, as there are several plot lines going on at once. Obviously the two ones we are most drawn towards are the one of two main characters and the one of the murderer, but there are also 4 more linear plots going on at all the other windows. They are all realistic as well. Even though realistic plots is a staple of Hitchcock films, Rear Window almost seems more realistic than most Hitchcock films.<br/><br/>The second reason it is a masterpiece is the viewpoint. Roger Ebert addresses this in his review, but we are given the viewpoint of Jeffries while he looks at his neighbors. This highlights another Hitchcock staple, his ability to make the audience relate to people that we should not be relating to. If we were looking at the story from the third person then we might look down on Jeffries, but since it is in the first person we naturally downplay the creepiness of Jeffries' actions because we inherently think that we are doing it as well."

From the catchy opening tune, right through to the end, the movie is captivating and fun to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is about a cutting edge photographer who is stuck in his apartment for several weeks with a broken leg. The only view is of other tenant windows ... so that's what ends up looking at day after day. Of course, if you watch other people all day long, you're bound to start seeing something out of the ordinary eventually ... but murder ... or are you reading into something too much? <br/><br/>That's the basic setup of the movie. It's kind of voyeuristic intrigue since the viewer only sees what James Stewart (the main character) sees. Everything from the color to the sounds to the dialog are fascinating to experience. There's never a dull moment.<br/><br/>I'm seeing it some 50+ years after it was made and all I can say is that it has clearly stood the test of time. Recommended viewing for everyone."
"paul_66","10","0","1","22 June 2008"," One of the best of all time, and people may not realize it.
","On my way of discovering Hitchcock films, I found Rear Window to be one of THE best, and one of my favorites of all time. Well... my most favorite and most memorable experiences out of all Hitchcock films. This may not be HITCH'S best. I mean, it's not like there's more suspense in this film than any other Hitch film, but I say this one is one of the best of the suspense/gripping genre THAT SAID, I must note that the suspense is very fragile in this movie. It's only superior if you are willing to participate in the film. And the problem with that is, it may not be very easy for some people of this day and age. Especially young people who are not familiar with older and simpler films. They end up wondering ""what was this all about? Why did so many people HIGHLY recommended this film?!"".<br/><br/>But, first, let me say here why I think Rear Window is one of the best... it's because of it's structure, and how superior IT is (I'm not talking about the suspense and gripping moments, that just comes from how the structure is stacked up, but it's not the structure itself).<br/><br/>Now people may not refer to story structure very much, or at all. Or, in fact, they may despise it. Or maybe they've never even considered or hear or read of it. But you cannot deny the fact that structure is inside every movie that you see. Even if you can't accept that fact.<br/><br/>Though, structure can be hard to explain, but it's not hard to analyze when you watch a movie. Really what it is, is the layout of events that forms together a story. And depending on whether or not that story has a serious purpose or not and what is done with that purpose, you can then know whether or not you have a great film, a superb movie, or even just a good or decent film, or not... maybe even a bad film.<br/><br/>Though people can argue about the difference between bad structure and just simply bad deliverance. Which can be totally different subjects and probably isn't worth arguing. Though I don't believe it's worth arguing. Everyone has their own opinions, and they can look at films however they want to look at films. There should be no argue.<br/><br/>So, I say, if you haven't seen this film, you should. But you SHOULD NOT expect TOO MUCH. If you're not hooked (by your own will) into the film about a quarter way through it or maybe more. Or else you might have to say goodbye to that suspenseful climax near the end. Although it took me about two to three viewings before I lost the suspense. But who knows, maybe it'll come back. I don't know. But my first, I can say, was the best and the most superior because I watched it from the very beginning with hardly no expectations, rather then anticipations. I mean, I was literally dying to jump into my TV screen. But once it ended, I was tossed out of the window. That's how good it was for me, and it will NEVER be that good again. Mark my words. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend it if you are willing to participate in this film as much as I was for the first time. If you're not going to participate, DON'T! 'Cause this film, to me, is hardly anything more than a suspenseful and gripping treat. But you've got to participate! But if you've already seen it and you didn't get a good experience (rather than an impression), just simply take Hitch's advise and ""watch it from the very beginning"" and have no BIG expectations and just let the movie take you (which those are kind of my advise, though he might've gave them too). Let's just hope you're second viewing is better than your previous.<br/><br/>9.0/10"

","I decided to go with one of the more interesting looking, highly rated classics so as to pique my interest and hopefully set me off on a Hitchcockean journey.<br/><br/>I wasn't left deflated either. Hottest glamour property at the time this was sort of the bringing together of the Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman of the day and their chemistry far exceeds those two. You can see why Hitchcock used them frequently and I'm only surprised he didn't use them together more.<br/><br/>Their relationship in Rear Window is an interesting one, and for me is more central to the film than the actual murder or ""rear window"" aspects. The murder story simply serves to bring them together. Both are eminently likable and I was particularly fond of Jeffies. A mans man who, even at his age, is uncertain of what he really wants from life, even when the stunningly perfect Lisa Fremont comes into his life. However, the murder and the situations that Lisa puts herself in to prove her mans theory ultimately makes him realise his love for her and that is my favourite part of the story, over and above the murder theme.<br/><br/>However, this is Hitchcock, so one can't ignore the fact that this is a murder story. The final sequence of the film was a tad 'tied-on', speaking from the point of view of someone who likes a good twist, but that doesn't matter, the whole voyeuristic experience of being in Jeffries room looking on over those people who don't know you're looking was genius and keeps you riveted. The moment where Thorwald realises he's being watched from the opposite window is one of those ""HE'S ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ME"" moments and was done superbly."

","Movies don't get much better than this. Hitchcock is a master at using camera angles to set-up a variety of scenes although the entire movie is filmed in an apartment building commons. James Stewart and Grace Kelly have an incredible tension between them that feeds each others ego making the story that much better. A lot of classic films seem to only be applauded for their age rather than their content, but 'Rear Window' is not one of those movies. Technicolor is the only negative aspect of the film I watched, but can be overlooked if only to enjoy a masterpiece.

","I just got back from seeing 'Rear Window' in a cinema. It's probably the tenth time or so I have seen it 'full size'. Every time I am captivated by, above all else, the 'editing'. I put the word in quotes because it is not the 'classical' aspects of editing - rhythm etc., that I see, but the way in which Hitchcock cuts each scene up into detailing shots which, in turn, dovetail together to create a logical picture.<br/><br/>This is yet another example of the Master giving us a lesson in film theory. LB is playing Sherlock Holmes. He is adding small facts together to make bigger understandings. So Hitch uses the characteristic of montage discovered by Kuleshov in the early days of post-revolutionary Russia to take us through the process. It is magical.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't be so magical were it not for Hitch's wonderful characters - Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, the composer and so on. And they also contribute to this master-class in stylistics as each is given just enough screen-time to define their place in the drama.<br/><br/>And finally, and finally, and finally... there is Grace Kelly - the most beautiful, graceful, feminine star ever to light up our lives. And how are we introduced to her? She kisses us! Heart stops.<br/><br/>Maybe Hitchcock really was the greatest director ever. And there is nobody, nobody currently making films at this level of sheer genius.<br/><br/>Star Wars? Godfather? They are not in the same galaxy as this cinematic wonder."

","One of the points i caught in this movie is often not realized. In the beginning of the film the director displays the weird relationship between Jefferies and Lisa. Its obvious right away that Lisa adores Jefferies and he, well thinks she's nice, but not dating material. In most films in these times there is an attractive popular woman, which the main guy wants to be with. In this film Jefferies is looking for someone more interesting, not just a pretty face. During the final moments of the film Lisa risks her life to help solve a mystery that Jeffries is desperately concerned about. This sparks up feelings for Jefferies, and he see's Lisa as brave and courageous women, and not just a pretty face. Needless to say, Jefferies became interested in Lisa and saw her as better dating material."

","Alfred Hitchcock certainly lives up to his 'master of suspense' billing with 'Rear Window,' as it is one of the most suspenseful movies ever made. It's also probably the ultimate 'talk back to the screen' film. About a third of the way through till the end, you'll find yourself thinking and maybe even saying out loud, ""Oh no!"" and ""don't go in there!"" and ""hurry before he gets back!"" etc. So it's great fun to watch, a real nail-biter. The entire film takes place on one elaborately built set, the back of a four-sided, four-story apartment complex with a small courtyard in the middle. Watching 'Rear Window' is like watching a stage play albeit on a stage like no other. Everyone, apparently, can see into everyone else's apartment when the windows are left open, which they obligingly are, most of the time. This would seem to stretch credulity to the breaking point, since everyone is apparently just as oblivious to being watched, but one accepts it as crucial to the plot and after a certain point it hardly seems to matter. James Stewart stars as a man confined to his apartment in a wheelchair for several weeks due to a broken leg, and takes to, well, spying on his neighbors. What begins as a way to fend off boredom soon becomes an obsession. There is the newlywed couple (the only ones who typically have their shades drawn); a songwriter who plays his piano a lot; a single woman Stewart dubs 'Miss Lonely Hearts' because she imagines having suitors over for dinner; a gorgeous blonde who is forever doing exercises and dancing; another couple that sleep out on their stoop every night; and most importantly, a man (Raymond Burr) and his nagging wife. Stewart becomes convinced, after the wife disappears, that Burr has killed her and disposed of her body. Grace Kelly plays Stewart's girlfriend and Thelma Ritter, an insurance company nurse who checks in on him regularly. They are both skeptical at first of his theory but soon are drawn into it and become as obsessed as he is. I don't normally issue 'spoiler alerts' even though I'm always giving the end away, but since the build-up in 'Rear Window' is so crucial, I will this time. The only time I was disappointed in this film was at the very end. I was expecting some sort of twist or surprise ending, and the denouement when it came was no surprise at all, except perhaps in that it wasn't a surprise. Maybe that was the point. Frankly, I tended to agree with the police officer who occasionally dropped by Stewart's apartment to discuss the matter and ended up pooh-poohing most of Stewart's notions. All through the movie, Stewart's character reminded me of a conspiracy buff... one of those people who is convinced men didn't really land on the moon or someone other than Oswald killed JFK. Or in this case, is convinced through a lot of circumstantial evidence, some of it very questionable, that his neighbor killed his wife. But as I said, maybe that's the point, because the evidence Stewart sees is what keeps us in suspense for two hours. Is he right or is this just a bored man's wild imagination working overtime and a half? It's fun to conjecture the latter is true, even if the former was the correct assumption all along."

","While I recognize that star-power and box office are serious considerations in the casting of any film, I've always had a sense of discomfort with Jimmy Stewart in this film (and Vertigo). Perhaps my real problem is not really the casting of Stewart, but the mis-match of the beautiful and youthful Grace Kelly (and Kim Novak in Vertigo). Stewart was over twenty years older than Kelly & fifteen years older than Novak when the two films were shot. I think an actress with a little more maturity and depth might have worked more believably against Stewart. While both films are among my favorites (particularly Vertigo) I continue to suffer from a sense of discomfort at the implausibility of the love interest and the lack of a sense of any real chemistry in the performances. Nevertheless, they're both eminently entertaining and delightful films."

","Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.<br/><br/>Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous. Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.) Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activities of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.) Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house. Is it murder? The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears. In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses. At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.<br/><br/>The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa. But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the sculptor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, ""Miss Torso,"" a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls ""a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!"" This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyeurism to the nth degree. The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection. Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you. Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release. Recommended.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

Soon he begins to suspect one of his neighbours of foul play when the man's wife suddenly disappears and unexplainable things begin to happen.

","The great thing about ""Rear Window"" is how Hitchcock puts the viewer in the point of view of Jimmy Stewart's lead character L.B. Jeffries. It's a bit weird actually how you find yourself anticipating Jeffries' reactions because you're thinking the way he does as he scans his neighbors' apartments in an almost lurid act of voyeurism. What's problematic though, and what comes across as unrealistic today is how so many apartment dwellers can live without ever worrying that their activities ought to be concealed. Forget about the murderer for a minute and consider every other tenant featured in their mini-vignettes - Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, the Songwriter, the newlyweds, the doggy elevator couple. It seems to be a precarious way to live, like being in a glass enclosure or a cage in a zoo.<br/><br/>That's why Jeffries' solution of Mrs. Thorwald's murder is just a little too pat. He's got all the twists and turns worked out in the face of conflicting evidence to the contrary, mostly supplied by his detective friend Doyle (Wendell Corey). Yet it's important to be in on the identity of the murderer to keep the tension building to a dramatic conclusion. Jeffries has ample support in building the case with the help of fiancée Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his temporary caregiver Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella is the perfect character to inject needed comic relief as Hitchcock layers the film with increasing levels of mystery and suspense. In fact, she's got the best line in the movie - ""... just where do you suppose he cut her up?"" <br/><br/>One of the neat things I learned about the film is how Hitchcock got around Paramount's limited set to replicate a city apartment complex. The building used in the film was only two stories high, so to get the illusion of a much larger unit, Hitchcock got the studio to cut into the basement. Jimmy Stewart's apartment was really at ground level on the actual set, thereby creating the impression that he was spying on apartments above, below and across from his own.<br/><br/>One of the other cool tricks used in the story revolved around the Songwriter, and how the music emanating from his apartment served as a sound track for those scenes. It's where the director appeared in one of his trademark cameo appearances. If you were paying attention, you also learned that the writer got the inspiration for his songs from the landlady once a month!<br/><br/>For anyone new to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, this might be the best example of his American pictures, as it combines all the elements that he came to be noted for - mystery, intrigue, murder, an everyman character one can identify with, and the clever insertion of wit and humor to pace the film to an exciting finale. It's also one of the best examples of Hitchcock's pure cinema technique, replete with sophisticated use of camera angles, composition, lighting and perspective."

","Rear Window (1954)<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchckock's 'Rear Window' is an example of how script, camera-work and characters can be utilised to a maximum. This is a film that has its character stuck in 1 room for 110 minutes. That is a tough job to pull.<br/><br/>Hitchcock keeps an injured James Stewart in his apartment and he slowly senses murder across the block, and thus the spying begins...<br/><br/>No strong language, violence or gore. Nothing. Hitchcock was a master of cinema and Rear Window is one of the many examples of how he can entertain and delight so wonderfully with such basic tools.<br/><br/>The apartment blocks and the courtyard, which are fundamentally the only sets in this film are clearly studio made, but it really doesn't matter. Hitchcock manages to create an atmosphere with his camera closely examining each apartment; different people... different story.<br/><br/>This is old Hollywood at its finest; Rear Window is wickedly entertaining, wildly interesting and at times tense. It is very much the type of film that we do not make any more; Today we are more interesting in brutal violence, sex and drugs.<br/><br/>Rear Window is a classic in every sense of the word and it shall stay as that.

","The movie examines ethics from a unique perspective: if you are incapacitated in a wheel chair at the rear window of your apartment idly following your neighbors minding their own business, are you committing an invasion of privacy? Jimmy Stewart's wheelchair-bound character sits at his window with a magnificent view sharing in the happiness and the disappointments of his neighbours: there is a woman past her prime looking for love, a middle-aged couple camping out on the balcony, a salesman and his ailing wife with the latter suddenly disappearing, a scantily clad beautiful dancer practicing her moves, a newly-married couple scarcely able to keep their hands off each other, a musician struggling, all in the privacy of their own homes and unaware that they are being watched by someone and that is the delight of the movie. Jeff gets carried away with the little things that make up everyone's lives until he gets wake-up calls as to the ethics of the situation by his nurse and his beautiful girlfriend. The nurse's brutal cracks are a major change of pace. Grace Kelly's character provides great chemistry with Jimmy Stewart's as the two argue about their world's-apart professional lives ever allowing them to get married. The movie takes on an elegant look and feel as Grace Kelly enters. She makes her first appearance in the movie bending down to kiss Jeff against a stunning sunset and then she subsequently progressively illuminates the room by switching on the lights as she refreshes Jeff's memory. It is no surprise that Grace Kelly's glamour on its own gives the movie a gleaming finish. Her verbal waltzes with Jeff are intense. The three team up to solve a murder mystery. However it is Jeff's naughty pastime and his romantic exchanges with Grace Kelly's character and his philosophical exchanges with the nurse that make the movie stand up to viewing again and again."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Ever since I became an Alfred Hitchcock fan, the movie that he made that I wanted to see was Rear Window, but I never got the chance to. Well, I finally saw it and it was amazing. Definitely one of the best movies I have seen, and I do believe that this is Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, and his greatest film ever. It really is hard to top this movie. It is incredibly suspenseful, Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, and Raymond Burr's acting is all terrific, and the story is simple yet so terrifying and frightening. Without the story, this film would be no where near as famous as it is today. I mean, the story has been parodied so many times, like in the Simpsons. There are a lot of subtle and little touches in this movie, like the similarities between some of the characters, like the comparison to L.B and Lisa to the neighbors, that you do not quite notice until you watch this film again for the second time. Alfred Hitchcock really did a fantastic job in directing this. By the way, Hitchcock is seen winding a clock as his cameo.<br/><br/>Here is the plot of this film. L.B Jeffries is a photographer who broke his leg and has to stay in his apartment with his girlfriend Lisa and his nurse Stella. When he grows bored Jeffries starts spying on his neighbors. Then, he believes he sees his neighbor Lars Thornwald murder his nagging wife. Nobody believes Jeffries, though. However, Jeffries notices strange behaviors that Thornwald has. He owns several knives, his dog sniffs around his garden, and his dog mysteriously dies. Stella and Lisa realize that something is wrong when they see that Thornwald's wife does not have her wedding ring on and, when Thornwald is gone, they investigate my digging up the garden. They do not find anything. Lisa then searches his apartment, but Thornwald comes home and catches her. The police come and Lisa is arrested for burglary. Then, Thornwald realizes that Jeffries is spying on him and starts attacking him. Jeffries is knocked out of the window. Thornwald is then arrested for the murder of his wife. Lisa is also set free. The film ends with Jeffries having two casts on his legs.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a gripping, suspenseful, masterpiece of a film. It is probably Hitchcock's best and one of the best films out there. Not only is there the obvious suspense, but the writing has light-hearted comedy in it, too, that I tend to like. I personally believe that this film has every right to be number fourteen on the Top 250. This is an unbelievable picture that you just can not miss. Anyway, I can just keep on saying that this is a great movie, but all I will say now is just watch this movie, you will have no regrets.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Psycho, Vertigo, and North By Northwest."

"slymusic","Null","0","1","14 June 2007"," ""Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jefferies.""
","""Rear Window"" is one of the masterpieces of director Alfred Hitchcock, no question about it! My favorite actor James Stewart, who portrays the wheelchair-bound magazine photographer L.B. Jefferies, claimed this murder mystery to be his personal favorite of his four films with Hitchcock. One might have thought that after Stewart's negative experience in working with Hitchcock on ""Rope"" (1948), it was not likely that the two would ever work together again; in fact, ""Rear Window"" is a single-set drama just like ""Rope"" is, the difference being that ""Rear Window"" was an instant success and one of Stewart's biggest moneymakers in the 1950s. (If you have not yet seen ""Rear Window,"" please DO NOT read any further.)<br/><br/>Hitchcock was a genius not only in casting the picture but also in the way he shot it. James Stewart's characterization of L.B. Jefferies (Jeff for short) is superlative, as Jeff is simply an ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation. After breaking his leg on a photographic expedition, Jeff is forced to sit quietly in his Greenwich Village apartment during an excruciatingly hot summer and spend his time observing & spying on all of his neighbors across the courtyard. In particular, he focuses quite a bit on the windows of jewelry salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), whom Jeff suspects of murdering his ailing wife after he spies on Thorwald making mysterious trips at odd hours in the night with his sample case and wrapping a butcher knife & a small saw in a newspaper. The way Jeff tacitly uses facial expressions to convey his many reactions to his neighbors' various unfolding dramas is a true sign of James Stewart's skill as an actor. Whenever the camera focuses on the windows of the neighboring apartments, it is almost always from Jeff's perspective, thus we constantly hear indistinct snatches of conversation from the various apartments, and almost all the music we hear in this film comes from within the realm of the set (as when the songwriter, played by Ross Bagdasarian, turns on his radio or plays his piano); as we can conclude, Hitchcock was quite clever in setting these various limitations in order to keep the story captivating. And, of course, what would a Hitchcock picture be without generous sprinklings of HUMOR to break up the tension of the murder story? A majority of the humor stems from, once again, the antics of Jeff's neighbors! <br/><br/>In addition to the great James Stewart, the beautiful, enchanting Grace Kelly is splendid as Jeff's fashion-model socialite girlfriend Lisa Fremont, who in short order believes that Jeff's suspicion of murder has credibility. So does Jeff's sharp-tongued nurse therapist Stella, played by the wonderful Thelma Ritter. One person who does NOT take Jeff seriously, however, is Jeff's detective friend Lt. Thomas J. Doyle, smartly played by Wendell Corey. Doyle is so skeptical of Jeff's belief of Thorwald's act of murder that he uses pure logic to try to settle Jeff's suspicions. And finally, there is the murderer himself, Lars Thorwald, brilliantly played by Raymond Burr. From a distance, Thorwald doesn't look so dangerous . . . until he finds out that Jeff has been spying on him! <br/><br/>Here are a few of my favorite moments from ""Rear Window."" Once Jeff spots Thorwald wrapping the cutting utensils in newspaper, the close shot of Jeff's eyes is all that the audience needs to confirm that Jeff suspects murder. Jeff creates some humorous friction between himself and Lisa in a rather lively discussion of how different their lives are. Probably the scene that provides the most tension in the picture is that of Jeff helplessly WATCHING Lisa being physically assaulted by Thorwald after she sneaks into his apartment. The close-up of the mean look on Thorwald's face as he quietly enters Jeff's dark apartment is very frightening indeed. And finally, I cannot help but comment on the brilliant Franz Waxman, whose music score at times DRIVES the movie; my favorite musical moments in ""Rear Window"" are the bright jazz score with intricate harmonies during the introductory credits, the very GLOOMY score during Thorwald's mysterious sales trips at night in the rain, and the jazz combo in the songwriter's apartment accompanying Lisa rushing over to Thorwald's apartment to slide a letter under his door.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is quite a gem of a movie, a true masterpiece showcasing the genius of that Master of Suspense: Alfred Hitchcock. Need I write more?"

I loved Lisa's character arc, as she tries to draw Jeff's attention away from spying on Thorwald. She was in denial, trying to prove Jeff wrong all the time. But a moment before that scene fades out, she's very well hooked into what might have happened across as well.<br/><br/>And hey, we even see her and Stella - Jeff's aid audaciously dig in the apartment's garden across. And Lisa - the cynical girlfriend who couldn't care less even ascends through the fire escape. And watch this very thrilling scene as Jeffrey's could only scream his girlfriend's name and watch in horror. Hitchcock said to always make the audience suffer as much as possible - we do suffer as a helpless and disabled audience as well in these scenes I am talking about.<br/><br/>If PSYCHO was creepy enough - you'll get some of those eery moments in here too, but more psychologically than visually or graphically portrayed as they talk about the clues to Mrs. Thorwald. You don't see any of these of course - but what your mind imagines or visualizes is far more terrifying than anything you'll see in this film.<br/><br/>Plus a breathtaking climax. Watch the very last frame - the closing shot of the movie. Grade A+"
"ragosaal","9","0","1","1 November 2006"," How Did Hitchcock Do It ?
","I've been always amazed by Alfred Hithcock's incredible ability to create real good thrillers without hiding the villain or murderer's identity through the picture; he usually reveals it right from the start. In ""North by Nortwest"" we know all along that James Mason is the villain, and the same happens with Joseph Cotten in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", John Dall in ""The Rope"", Ray Milland in ""Dial M for Murder"", Robert Walker in ""Strangers on a Treain"" and even Charles Laughton in the old ""Jamaica Inn"". The point is that the director creates tension, intrigue and high impact with perfectly handled situations which is not an easy task and requires a lot of talent.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" is another example. Bounded to a wheel-chair photograph L.B. Jeffries passes his time by spying his neighbors apartments through his window helped by the big eye of his camera. He gets interested in one of them (Raymond Burr) who is clearly planning something and not before long we realize the man's intention is murdering his wife which he does. From then on the picture enters in its most tense and interesting parts as Jeffries, helped by his girlfriend Lisa (Grece Kelly) and his housekeeper Stella (Thelma Ritter), searches for evidence to catch the killer.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" stands as a perfect thriller where you almost feel in Stewarts skin (all you see outside his apartment is what he sees through his camera). And when the murderer -aware that he's been spotted- comes over you are worried too.<br/><br/>All in all, a real impressive film by Hitchock with lots of tension, thrills and perfect performances. Forget remakes and go for this one; you won't regret it."
"itsbaylis","10","0","1","24 October 2006"," Quite simply one of the best films ever made.
","This movie is one of my favourite films, and deserves to be right up there with other classics of cinema, new and old, because, aside from a few references and special effects, it hasn't really aged.<br/><br/>Or rather it has aged, because too often these days there is little thought put into the characters of a movie, with more reliance on sex, violence and thundering through the plot at light-speed to reach a dramatic end. This film devotes time to the characters, even the ones with tiny parts being fleshed out to an extent where no one is ever left as just a plot device or totally pointless.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's superb from all the cast, with the entire ensemble on top form. James Stewart, possibly my favourite actor, is a shining example of how acting should be, with a well thought out measured performance you don't doubt for a second. Grace Kelly also plays her part superbly, standing alongside Stewart in this film as an example to today's actors of how suspense SHOULD be played.<br/><br/>I'll take this movie over the special effects laden, thinly plotted drivel that is turned out in much modern cinema."

","Technically, this is the reverse of 1948's ROPE. ROPE's murder happens behind a closed curtain. This films observes everything through open windows & curtains. There was so little wasted footage in this because Hitch knew what he wanted to shoot before he shot it, that there was less than 10 minutes edited from the film as shot. The efficiency is almost as good as ROPE but the sequences are shorter. <br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a broken leg in an apartment complex (so large a set that the crew came to think of the set as home during the shooting of this film) with nothing better to do than gawk out at all the neighbors while he is recovering. Grace Kelly in one of her last & best complex roles before becoming Princess Grace is Stewarts girlfriend (also presented as a bit of a tomboy as well as being a sensuous beauty) who winds up along with Stewart's maid getting involved in the mystery that a neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) presents because of how he is observed by Stewart.<br/><br/>This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, presenting situations in which the viewer gets emotionally involved & wants to help the folks on screen with their dilemma. From the short story is added other folks in the story from Miss Lonely Hearts, to others as Stewart, much more comfortable in this film than he was in ROPE, is on the mend from a broken leg peering in on the multiple apartments & people in this little world. <br/><br/>It is a fine film because even though the action is all limited to one huge set (apartment & window to a multi-apartment complex) for the most part, it explores & surprises the viewer with what can happen in such a static situation. I am thankful the studio came out with a restored version as this is a film that is well worth restoring to it's original form. Thelma Ritter is exceptional in her role as Stewarts maid.<br/><br/>The tension when the salesman (Burr) confronts Stewart in his apartment is brilliant & the technical use of now outdated flashbulb photography still plays well as setting the tension in this sequence."

"baptiste-fontaine","10","0","1","20 August 2006"," True Hitchcockian suspense
","I rated the movie 10 because I consider this as the best one he ever shot, although Psycho reaches the same grade according to me. There isn't much to say after all about this movie, which suspense is only based on the viewer's expectations of what will come next. The tension starts on the relationship between the two main characters and builds up on what they think they understand of their neighbor's strange attitude. All their theories about murder and death first seem absurd until they eventually turn out to be profoundly true. This movie is different from most other Hitchcock movies in the sense that the viewer is usually told what will happen at the very beginning of the movie, and only has to see and discover how and why. Here, you can't really expect what is going on in the neighboring apartment aside from the fact that there is ""something"" going on. The plot makes the main character sound paranoid, and the viewer therefore cannot first believe what this character seems to be sure of. Only the very last scene of the movie makes the story come true, because of the fact that only a couple of characters had spent time in the main character's apartment during the whole movie. As a consequence, the villain entering the apartment feels like the aforementioned apartment was being violated -even raped- by some man you have never really seen, and who you strongly hoped you'd never see. For those who never saw this movie, I shall really ask you to see it before many other of Hitchcock's movies. I would even recommend seeing it first, and save Psycho for later. This is a must you just cannot miss."

"highkite","9","0","4","15 June 2006"," Shocking, suspenseful, and flat out original.
","In most people's minds, ""Rear Window"" is another one of those Hitchcock thrillers that present a big shock or two. However, what Hitchcock presented in this film is much more than just one of the biggest suspense movies of all time, it's a true representation of our own desire to look into the private lives of others. It's a story about a realistic approach to voyeurism and the outcomes that follow. At first, leading man Jimmy Stewart denies his own boredom by sitting by his apartment window observing his neighbors, but soon realizes it may have been for the best.<br/><br/>L.B Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who broke his leg and is strapped to his chair with minimal capability to enjoy any activities. With nothing to do, he spies on his neighbors who he knows nothing about. He becomes more skeptical of his neighborhood as one of them becomes delusional and depressed, attempting to take her own life. Also, higher up in the building, a businessman suspiciously gets rid of his invalid wife, leaving Jefferies to believe he had killed her. Gene Kelley plays Stewart's eccentric girlfriend who at first thinks Jefferies has gone too far by spying on his neighbors, but soon plays a big part in his game when she too suspects a murder in the building across.<br/><br/>Hitchcock cleverly orchestrates a vision so realistic and powerful that we dare not ever look in the wrong direction again. The entire film is set in one location: Jefferie's apartment. Every shot of the neighbors, buildings, and strangers is shown from Jefferie's point of view, making it all the more claustrophobic and realistic. We know almost nothing about the neighbors, and very little about Jefferies (for example, how he broke his leg), which only adds to the urge to know more about others and the irony that we know it's wrong yet we can't help but to look away.<br/><br/>The directing is superb and we can almost instantly see Hitchcock's influence on huge directors such as PT Anderson and Quentin Tarantino with his endless tracking shots and flawless choreography of one seemingly endless scene. Hitchcock also chooses a perfect set-design, helping to create a very open yet confined space. The score may not be as good as other Hitchcock films but it fits the mood quite well. We hear both internal and external music, which Hitchcock intelligently connected in order for us to feel the mood he is conveying and to understand the realism of the movie.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" has to be one of Hitchcock's best movies. More than just a clever suspense story, we are exposed to an entire social conflict that resembles our own lives. Our own flawed behavior gets hidden behind closed doors but as we see this film we start to understand the complexity of the characters and how they relate to us.<br/><br/>I'll give this movie a 9/10 because of my very minor problem with the score and that I just can't help but compare it to the flawless work of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo."""
"Vampenguin","8","0","1","1 June 2006"," More of Hitch's genius
","I've been trying to brush up on my Hitchcock lately, and this here is another classic from the master.<br/><br/>First off, Hitchcock really shows his genius as director in how the film is presented. Almost solely from the view of a wheelchair bound Jimmy Stewart, we watch the lives of the various characters unfold before his eyes.<br/><br/>Hitch plays with morality here, which I think was another high point of the film. Stewart's speech about ethics really emphasizes this point.<br/><br/>The acting is great, but with star power like this, that goes without saying. Grace Kelly is simply stunning, Stewart plays the everyman to perfection, Thelma Ritter is great comic relief, and the various residents of the apartments were great as well.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight-forward, but very well-written nonetheless.

","I LOVE this movie. This is one of my top three all-time favorite movies. (And my very favorite Alfred Hitchcock film.) Alfred Hitchcock does an incredible job of creating an environment that you quickly feel right at home in.<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart's character has a broken leg, which requires him to be homebound for several weeks. To pass the time, he begins to observe the comings and goings of his neighbors. Looking through his eyes, you soon start to feel as if you, personally, know all of his neighbors. The neighbors are all quite interesting -- but one neighbor, in particular, soon draws the attention of the viewing audience. This is when the movie REALLY becomes interesting.<br/><br/>This movie zips along, the music is catchy, the characters are likable, (when they are supposed to be), and the suspense is perfectly pitched.

Not to mention the presence of excellent actors for the main characters, James Stewart and Grace Kelly, two performers who always did so well with Alfred Hitchcock. There is almost not a flaw in this movie, the perfectionism of Hitchcock applies here all the time, and the fact that it tells the story of a man who spend the entire movie looking through a window tells how much Rear Window is kind of a metaphor of the cinema in general ..."
"imdb-5807","10","0","1","23 May 2006"," Love story!
","One of the four movies that are my favourite from Hitchcock along with Psycho, Lifeboat and Birds. This latter shares with Rear Window what I express in the subject, and I believe is quite overlooked.<br/><br/>Yes, though it is about a criminal investigation on its face value with plenty of suspense, mystery and with some humor added, there is a second story in this movie: how the two heroes learn and find out that they can be partners despite some 'differences' in their backgrounds, life styles.<br/><br/>When we meet the couple first we observe obvious attraction between them, however Jeff explicitly points out that he is a danger seeking journalist, occasionally traveling abroad in conditions that would not please Lisa who is a member of the high society, never wears a dress twice etc.<br/><br/>Due to Jeff's accident though he is prisoned in his home and stumbles upon a murder while peeping at neighbours. And here the transformation begins. Lisa becomes a private detective, she takes serious risks in order to confirm Jeff's suspicions and acquires evidence. This results in a bonding, that is rarely recognized and which is IMO is a major pillar of this movie.<br/><br/>This compares to Birds, where very similarly a married couple has some marital problems when the movie starts, but through the ordeal of the Bird 'problem' they become more bonded than before."
"jldmp1","8","0","1","6 May 2006"," Funneled World
","My sense is that Hitchcock was an expert at bringing us into a film world, and keeping us there. Strangely, he seemed largely unable to release us from that world - unable, that is, to end in a smart way. ""The Birds"" is perhaps the best exception to that.<br/><br/>Here, we are brought into the world of the voyeur - the most interesting bits are visual and (wink, nudge) the main character's a photographer. <br/><br/>After the introduction to who the protagonist is and what his handicap is, the camera's leg is taken away and forced into a particular stance. This is best described as a camera that is curious about what is caught in its funnel of perception. It's uniquely cinematic to narrow the scope this way, an approach that doesn't work as a play. Nor would it work as a novel, except with a burdensome adherence to a first person perspective -- so as a movie, the eye is trapped, yet free to take in narrative in an economic way.<br/><br/>The beginning and middle hold together visually, but the ending relies too much on Hitchcock's trademark visual gags. The story narrative fails to engage us in any real sort of game -- we know the suspect cannot be innocent, no matter how much we suspend our disbelief of Jeff's story. It spends far too much time locked in a pointless struggle with itself over plausibility.<br/><br/>This does earn its high ratings, but for my money, only because it's all about a unique crafting of a visual narrative."
"AnakinVader1138","9","0","1","1 May 2006"," Over 50 years old and still one of the most tense thrillers ever made.
","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is, to this day, one of cinema's finest examples of a thriller. Considered by most film goers to be Hitchcock's greatest film, Rear Window is the most responsible for revolutionizing the way thrillers are told. Hitchcock's later films, such as Psycho, North By Northwest, and The Man Who Knew Too Much (all masterpieces in their own right) owe much to Rear Window, as it set the standard to which all thrillers are to be compared.<br/><br/>The film is told almost absolutely from our hero's, Mr. L.B. Jeffries' (another of Jimmy Stewart's expert performances), point of view, thus making us feel all of the emotions that he is subject to. We the audience are drawn into the lives of his fellow tenants with as much fascination as Jeffries and feel the tension of not being able to know what is going on behind the closed curtains of those who act suspiciously. When Mr. Thorwald's wife first goes missing, we, like Jeffries, are immediately worried and frightened. And when Stella (Thelma Ritter) and Lisa (the lovely Miss Grace Kelly) are snooping around his apartment looking for clues, it is the very definition of a nail-biter.<br/><br/>Besides the murder mystery, the film tells the story of two people in love. On one hand we have the restless shutterbug Jeff and on the other we have the New York socialite Lisa Fremont. Both have their own lives and value their independence (a nice surprise to see an independent woman in a 50's movie), yet both are drawn to each other out of mutual adoration. With their love story, Hitchcock is able to inject a bit of his trademark romantic passion into what would normally be a straight thriller. The introducing shot of Grace Kelly's Lisa is one of the most dreamlike and romantic shots of any that modern cinema can produce today. My only complaint of the film would have to be the frustration that arises from Jeff's unwillingness to settle down and commit (good God man, its Grace Kelly!).<br/><br/>While John Michael Hayes' script itself is brilliant, most of the credit for the film's perfection should be given to Alfred Hitchcock. The idea to construct the entire set on the soundstage and to make the apartments as livable as possible did much to add to the aura of realism in the film. Telling the story from one room was a very risky move and could have turned out to be mind-numbingly boring (and indeed lesser filmmakers have proved this), but Hitchcock was able to create one of the best films in history doing it. Having all the music come from the film-world sources was also a brilliant move, making it seem like we were truly experiencing the sights and sounds of a New York street.<br/><br/>This leads to the question of whether or not this is purely entertainment or if it is actually a form of voyeurism. When Rear Window first premiered (and even in present day, actually), this was what many viewers were wondering after watching the movie. In truth, all forms of stories are a type of voyeurism. We, the viewer (or listener), are completely wrapped up in the affairs of the characters involved in the story, whether it be a child's fairy tale, a classic stage drama, or an epic space opera. Their lives become our lives for those two hours we devote to watching a movie, reading a book, or simply listening to a tale around the campfire."

","I'm not much on Rear Window ratings, thus I did not watch this film just because of its acclaim. And, I'm not one for Rear Window ethics so i daren't discuss it. But I do know one thing: I enjoyed the voyeur in me surfacing to play the role Hitch wanted me (us the audience) to fulfill in being curious and as intrigued (sometimes knowing more where he allowed it - they call it suspense) as L.B Jeffries (played with immobile precision by Jimmy Stewart) while he spent his wheelchair bound hiatus staring at the antics of his Greenwich Ville neighborhood.<br/><br/>For me, the film does not 'have it all' as some have claimed, even though it might be very well the quintessentially complete Hitch flick with black comedy/suspense and mystery. Backed by artificial lighting and a stage set underground, I thought the film was meticulously brilliant in terms of cinematography with each 50mm cut and edit and mise en scene set up and in place with purpose. The cocoon world of the set (which we are never allowed to leave- i.e. Jeffries' apartment area) gives us the confined limits and we focus on the actualities of the small world we now have. Never done in film till that point (or at least to be the central subject), our cursory voyeuristic tendencies are tapped from the beginning with the scrutinizing of the various NewYork stereotypes and the alienation of apartment living- ballet blonde who 'juggles wolves' while her man is off in the 48th Parallel; bored mid-aged couple with dog who sleep on the stairs in the NY heatwave; Bagdaranian the songwriting pianist; Miss Lonelyhearts who soliloquizes dating by herself; and Perry Mason & wife. Each window opens a unique little snippet, while alas, Hitch & Herbie deliver a masterful addition of a romantic story with chemistry that has enough vive of its own (in Grace Kelly's character) to drive the whole film (watching Stewart discuss Fish Heads Rice & jungles only to see Kelly climb into adventure later to impress him is genius). In addition, the romance's placement is well supplemented by sublimely timed comedic out-turns from Thelma Ritter to play up the fantastic dialogue and help add humor bound rationality like spreading 'common sense on the bread'.<br/><br/>As a result, there is great pacing in the film, with plenty of visual cues (otherwise they might as well have left it a written work isn't it!) and the usual Hitch thrills and suspense, especially right at the end, where the climatic showdown is one real confrontational flare. I liked the way Hitch did not need to leave the set (or use flashbacks) to tell such a complete story for each character. From the start, and before he contacts his editor, where we see Jeffries' cameras/bulbs/picture frames on the wall, we know his poison. Through his nurse (Ritter), we understand his relationship and learn about Kelly's character. Through mere visual representations of each of the members of the cast (all guided by earpieces including a hilarious mattress scene that resulted because Hitch deliberately gave conflicting instructions), we see through each character's gripes and personas. From arbitrary dance steps to improvisational jazz or 'That's Amore' pieces to a troubled husband (Raymond Burr) eventually clearing his apartment with knives and suitcases at 3am, we are hooked on Hitch's mystery. Only through Kelly's and Stewart's interaction and Club21 meals do we get the rationalization, the discussions and the point of view of it all. The verisimilitude is amazing, and as such may well have been the first concept for 'reality show' that we now see as the most popular form of television half a century later- further reason why some say 'Rear Window' has never been more acclaimed as a film as compared to this current decade.<br/><br/>That's what does it for this film- an honesty, everyman situation that not only audiences identify with, but are also lured into the suspense of. Little wonder then that it is a top film, but then again, I'm really not much on Rear Window ratings.<br/><br/>By Stephen Thanabalan"
"marissas75","10","0","1","21 January 2006"," A tight, suspenseful movie with universal implications
","Due to its tightly defined setting and the short time frame that it covers, ""Rear Window"" at first seems like a film that will dazzle you with its economical construction, but run the risk of feeling limited or claustrophobic. The story takes place over 4 or 5 days, entirely within a Greenwich Village courtyard and the surrounding apartments. Furthermore, the camera never travels inside any of the apartments except for that of L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart), a photojournalist recovering from a broken leg. Instead, the inhabitants of the other apartments are filmed as Jeff sees them: from a distance, across the courtyard, through windows. By the end of the film, you are quite familiar with everyone and everything Jeff can see.<br/><br/>But the genius of ""Rear Window"" is that it rarely feels confining. The plot takes its time getting started, introducing all the characters at a leisurely pace. Even when the machinery of the suspenseful plot starts to click into motion (Jeff suspects his neighbor Thorwald of murdering his invalid wife), the movie continues to follow the interesting lives of the other apartment-dwellers: a seductive dancer whom Jeff nicknames ""Miss Torso,"" the depressed ""Miss Lonelyhearts,"" a struggling young songwriter, a newlywed couple, a middle-aged couple with a little dog... The voyeuristic Jeff finds these people endlessly fascinating, and so do we; the apartment courtyard is a microcosm containing enough stories to make many more movies. And something magical happens when Jeff looks beyond the courtyard, at the bustling patch of street and sidewalk that he can see down an alley. Suddenly you realize how many other people there are in the world, thickly crowding the New York streets, and how each of them would reveal a different, intriguing story, if you were able to watch him or her from a distance.<br/><br/>""Rear Window"" might still be a decent thriller if it were pared down to eliminate all the subplots about the neighbors, but Hitchcock does the more difficult, braver thing: he maintains the suspense of the main mystery story while intercutting it with the neighbors' vignettes. Thus, for a movie that was filmed on a sound stage at the height of the studio system, ""Rear Window"" feels surprisingly realistic and lifelike. The story might sound confined, even airless, in summary, but Hitchcock reveals its unlimited possibilities.<br/><br/>James Stewart plays Jeff as a man who has always relied on his wit, his observational powers, and his analytical skills. In order to take his mind off his broken leg, and stop himself from over-analyzing his relationship with fashion-model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), he starts obsessively watching the neighbors, and witnesses Thorwald's strange behavior. Stewart has some great moments when he tells his friends about his suspicions, and they doubt him, and he doesn't know what to do, because his eyes and brain have never failed him before.<br/><br/>Kelly is better here than in her other famous Hitchcock film, ""To Catch a Thief""--she's more sympathetic, vulnerable, funny and relaxed. Thelma Ritter is very entertaining as Stella, Jeff's shrewd nurse.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the 1950s have a reputation as a time when Americans liked to think that everything was sunny and prosperous, and pretended that the darker side of life didn't exist. Recent films such as ""Far From Heaven"" have deconstructed the '50s, revealing the disturbing undercurrents beneath the cheerful faÃ§ade. What amazes me is that Hitchcock explored that exact theme here, in 1954--the despair, the passionate sexuality, the murderous impulses found in a group of seemingly ordinary New Yorkers. ""Rear Window"" may be one of the films that best encapsulates its era, in addition to being superbly crafted entertainment."
"patrick_dunne","10","0","1","28 December 2005"," One of the most gripping and breathless thrillers ever! Totally creepy and brilliant!
","Hitchcock has always been a genius. Just about every one of his films is thrilling and dramatic. I know that I am treating him the way some fans do to Tarintino or Burton, but I just plain love his films! I just finished Rear Window. It blew me away. Instead of just simply saying ""This film rocks,"" I will describe in detail the greatness and superiority of this film.<br/><br/>Like most Hitchcock films, Rear Window stars James Stewart. He plays L.B. Jefferies, a photographer for a magazine who recently broke his leg when trying to take a photo in the middle of a racetrack. (His boss said he wanted something new and exciting.) So, L.B. Jefferies has absolutely nothing better to do than just sit down in his wheelchair and watch the neighbors do their daily business. But, one night, he hears fighting, bickering, and then a scream from one of his neighbors apartments. Then, he observes as the man living in the apartment enters and exits his house three times during the rain. Now, isn't that odd? What could it be? Murder! Rear Window is a very complex and one hell of a movie. The drama, thrills and comedy do not under whelm the viewer.<br/><br/>Rear Window is successful as a thriller. Wouldn't it be weird to wonder what your neighbor was doing from at least seven feet away? L.B. Jefferies sees him doing mysterious actions, but doesn't know exactly what he is doing or thinking. Plus, he has to make sure that the neighbor doesn't see him! Rear Window is surrounded by a creepy atmosphere and scares and bewilders the viewer, whenever the neighbor does something. What is he doing? Can he really be murdering his neighbor? Where is he? As the plot grows more and more complex, the viewer can only hold their breath until the action happens. The film is also effective, considering the distance between L.B. Jefferies and his neighbor. It gives the viewer an increased feeling of uncertainty, and makes the film even more seemingly complex and vague.<br/><br/>Drama occurs between the characters, as they each play to their own tricks. L.B. Jefferies and the audience aren't the only ones being creeped out. How unforgettable is the scene where Lisa slips a note under his door saying ""What have you done with her?"" Even with that, Rear Window can be a comedy. It doesn't make much of an effort for it's jokes, and cleverly hides them amongst dialogue.<br/><br/>Lisa: I wish I was creative like that.<br/><br/>L.B. Jefferies: You are. You're great at creating difficult situations.<br/><br/>Yep. Rear Window is just about perfect. But, Hitchcock fans expecting an unpredictable twister of a movie will be disappointed, because there are no major twists. Then again, a major Hitchcock fan wouldn't expect that, would they? Besides, I can't tell you how many thrillers ended up confusing due to plot twists.<br/><br/>10/10"

It is rare today to find a film that is wonderfully written, directed and acted.<br/><br/>It would be easy to say that this is a great film, but what might be difficult is to pinpoint what makes it stand out. One of the things you will surely notice is that it tells a story, makes you think about it and as always with Hitchcock, still finds a way to surprise you.<br/><br/>Sure, you can watch any film and leave all emotion on the screen. With 'Rear Window'you will think long after the viewing at the possible underlying social points addressed. You aren't going to be spoon fed the intent of the film or mentioning of any other aspect of life depicted brilliantly.<br/><br/>Once again, Jimmy Stewart shines as an absolutely outstanding actor. What makes him so wonderful in this film is how real his character is. There's never a point where you wonder who came up with these people. All did a fine job of pulling you into the world and making you believe that you too are looking at their world through the rear window."

","Very thrilling. Very riveting. Disturbing in a psychological manner. Truly, it is what you don't see that scares you - this adage is personified in this movie. I loved Lisa's character arc, as she tries to draw Jeff's attention away from spying on Thorwald. She was in denial, trying to prove Jeff wrong all the time. But a moment before that scene fades out, she's very well hooked into what might have happened across as well.<br/><br/>And hey, we even see her and Stella - Jeff's aid audaciously dig in the apartment's garden across. And Lisa - the cynical girlfriend who couldn't care less even ascends through the fire escape. And watch this very thrilling scene as Jeffrey's could only scream his girlfriend's name and watch in horror. Hitchcock said to always make the audience suffer as much as possible - we do suffer as a helpless and disabled audience as well in these scenes I am talking about.<br/><br/>If PSYCHO was creepy enough - you'll get some of those eery moments in here too, but more psychologically than visually or graphically portrayed as they talk about the clues to Mrs. Thorwald. You don't see any of these of course - but what your mind imagines or visualizes is far more terrifying than anything you'll see in this film.<br/><br/>Plus a breathtaking climax. Watch the very last frame - the closing shot of the movie. Grade A+"

","Along with North by Northwest and Vertigo probably the best Hitchcock there is. I really liked the introduction-shot of Grace Kelly. The way it is shot proves Hitchcock was well ahead of it's time. The atmosphere created is often copied yet seldom they succeed. The slow-paced scenes where sound fills in the courtyard, the sleepy looks of Steward while he's gazing through his camera, the humor and then the tension.. brilliant!<br/><br/>How to keep such a tension with such little resources if baffling.

","This is not a film for those who enjoyed most modern horror films.<br/><br/>It has no blood, and little on-screen violence. However, it is thrilling, emotional and complicated. Grace Kelly is in one of her few non ice-covered roles as a fashion editor who is not, in fact, a snob or priss. James Stewart is wonderful, as usual, as a temporarily bed-confined photographer. The basic plot line is another murder mystery, but a unique one. It is wall-papered with realistic characters, and the flavor of urban life. It is scary in the ways that bloody battles never are: thrilling and emotional.<br/><br/>Also See: Charade, Starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn"

","Rear Window is a definate classic. The plot, the actors just everything about this movie is great. James Stewart as the wheel chair bound photographer delivers a great performance along with Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter and Wendel Corey as the supporting cast. Raymond Burr as the mysterious neighbor also does great. This movie had a great blend of humor, suspense and drama which are the three things that make a movie great. Thelma Ritter is the comic relief in this movie as the insurance company nurse and always has something to say about everything.

","Alfred Hitchcocks movie ""Rear Window"" sets a standard for all suspenceful movies.His wonderful camera work and detail to human life makes this movie a classic. Jeff is stuck at home with a broken leg, and nothing to do all day but stare out his window and look into the lives of his neighbors. The apartment that he stares into shows the different emotionable levels of each person. For example Ms. Lonely Heart is on the bottom and the piano player is on top. Each person in between has their own story and there characters develop with the movie. However the most sinister character is Mr. Thorwald, who is suspected of killing his wife. With the help of Lisa his girl friend they uncover the mystery and almost loose their own lives in the process! The acting of Jimmy Stewart and Hitchcocks typical blonde (Grace Kelly) work wonderful together. There wonderful acting skills and Kelly's good looks give the film a wonderful chemistry.The camera angles are wonderful, and all are shot from with in Jeff's apartment. So the audience see's exactly what Jeff see's. This is not typical for many movies who allow the audience what is going to happen before the characters.Hitchcock allowed this so that the mystery could not be solved before the movie allowed it to be. This keeps the audience on the edge of their seats and keeps all in suspense! Overall out of 10 I would give this movie a 10!!!"

","Although I still haven't seen much of Hitchcock's work, I must say he's mighty talented. I don't think REAR WINDOW is deserving of the title as the #15 movie of all time, and I certainly don't think it's better than PSYCHO... but it sure is good.<br/><br/>REAR WINDOW is the story of a photographer named Jeff (James Stewart) who is constricted to his apartment by his wheelchair after breaking a leg. After being at home alone all day (with the exception of visits from his nurse Stella, played by Thelma Ritter, and his girlfriend Lisa, played by Grace Kelly), he begins to inspect one of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr), who is acting peculiarly. This man's wife has suddenly disappeared, and Jeff comes to the conclusion that his neighbor has killed his wife. He has evidence to support this theory, but nobody believes him.<br/><br/>I must say, this premise of REAR WINDOW is very clever. I really do like the story. The actors are all pretty good, and Raymond Burr is genuinely creepy as the alleged murderer. The script is decent. Of course, Hitchcock's directing is excellent. But... this movie seemed to be missing something for me. Most of the time I found it to be rather boring, and incredibly slow-paced. I thought many of the interactions between James Stewart and Grace Kelly were useless to the movie and much too drawn-out. If it weren't for the rather bland moments, this movie would have a much higher ranking with me.<br/><br/>However, due to a great and well-executed plot, and the chills that the murderer can provoke, I have to say that although I don't think this is Hitchcock's best movie, it's certainly good. At the time I didn't care for it too much, since it bored me to no end, but looking back on it, it really is a worthwhile movie to watch. Not essential, but well worth your time. 8/10."

","The first minute of this movie is genius in that the scene pans from the outside of the apartment building then inside throughout his apartment. We know everything we need to know about this man in the course of that scene. He's a photographer, he was injured shooting a car race, he's a world traveler and probably single. <br/><br/>Who can resist spying on the neighbors when that's all you are able to do? The scene where the little dog is killed and all the neighbors come to the window is one of the scariest of all time. When everyone leaves and the blackened apartment across the way reveals the glow of a lit cigarette. He had been watching. It still makes the hairs on my neck stand up. Great film making."

Raymond Burr portrayed the murdering salesman so well. He was the strong silent type. He looked evil and the white hair made him look more sinister.

","Suspense movies are in rare form these days.  Perhaps it's because Hitchcock, `The Master of Suspense' did such a good job with his movies that people weren't interested in seeing them directed by other people: so the art died out with the end of Hitchcock's career, or maybe suspense films just aren't as interesting to today's viewers as fast-action films with amazing special effects.  Whatever the case may be, `Rear Window' is a very good classic suspense movie.  Filmed in color, it's also easier to watch than most classics, to those with spoiled movie tastes.  Hitchcock utilizes symbolism in this movie to give an intellectual twist for those who get excited by such things.   	For example, some of his characters seem to be placed in certain apartment levels and styles to display their personalities.  On the floor level Miss Lonelyheart, as she is nicknamed, is living her sad life.  She seems depressed and even at one point suicidal, generally if someone has reach this position in their life, they would be considered to have hit `rock bottom'; hence, she is on the bottom level.  The piano man to the right of the main wall of apartments has a place with a lot of windows on the wall facing the central courtyard: his apartment seems very open, like it hides nothing.  In the same way, the piano man is not afraid to show his emotion; he is a very expressive man and doesn't hide what he's feeling.  When he gets frustrated or upset with his music writing he gets very dramatic and sweeps the papers off his piano and almost seems to throw a tantrum.  When he has his party, he is a very happy and ecstatic person, the life of the party even.  There are many more little connections to the people and their apartments but it's a part of the viewing experience to figure them out! 	Hitchcock also does an amazing job with his camera tricks; only once does the camera view change in reference to its position.  99.99% of the time the shots are done from inside the main character's apartment, it's a great concept because it helps the viewer to feel like they are just as involved in the investigation as the other characters in the story.  The viewer sees what they see exactly and can make their own silent inferences as to what's going on.  Yet it doesn't get old having the same view standpoint because there are interesting plot developments all the time. 	Overall Rear Window is a very interesting movie and a must see for those who like suspense without all the gore that is found in today's Hollywood thrillers.  Hitchcock does yet another amazing job with his film creating a true masterpiece."

","Who else in the history of cinema could create a more suspenseful environment than an overweight Englishman could? No one, that's who. And with ""Rear Window"", that rotund Brit, better known as Alfred Hitchcock, displays a real knack for creating tremendous tension. With a very minimalist approach, Hitchcock builds up an atmosphere that rivals any other film in the genre, even to this day. 	 	The very first thing that you notice when watching Rear Window is the camera movement. Or, better yet, the lack of movement. Why this film is so original is that the camera never moves out of the main characters room. All the shots in the film are from out the window, the perspective of the disabled Jimmy Stewart. A sense of uneasiness is very prevalent due to the fact that you cannot really see everything that's going on outside the window. This is a major part of the story and is the catalyst for the actions of the characters. 	 	What makes Hitchcock such a master is that there's a deep meaning to his films. This film may just seem like a fun murder mystery to the untrained eye, but to those in the know, it's so much more. In ""Rear Window"", Hitchcock studies and analyzes human nature and people's tendencies towards voyeurism in an interesting and engaging atmosphere. Questions about society are proposed in this film, like people's need to satisfy their curiosity and the ethics surrounding interfering with other's personal lives. Very interesting points are made, but are cleverly hidden within the dialogue and plot. 	 	This is a great movie, one that could only be done by a master like Hitchcock. One little piece of advice when watching this though; stick with it. It's a slow building, mainly dialogue driven story, but it has a great payoff. Now I like that sort of thing, others may not however. Trust me though; you won't be disappointed in the least bit. It's just the Hitchcock style of story telling that helps to build enormous tension and suspense.<br/><br/>	 	At the very least, you'll at least have some ideas to slow down a would be attacker with little to your dispense. Enjoy.<br/><br/>

","'Rear Window' tells the story of an interesting, though sarcastic and sometimes bitter L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart), who's leg was broken in an accident. The film starts off with the first day of his last week in the class, and eventually characters such as his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his Insurance Nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter). The film is shot mostly, if not all of it, through the view of Jeffries' rear window. He has a view of many apartments one of them belong to the Thorwalds. However, something mysterious has happened to Mrs. Thorwald and Jeffries soon suspects murder. From then on, this film takes the path of a mostly noir, with the audience in it's heels trying to figure out what is going on. Several interesting twists are thrown to the characters (and the audiences) way by Jeffries' friend LT. Boyle (Wendell Corey). 'Rear Window' is a suspense film, but at the same time a work of blazing originality. There is little violence, sex, or swearing used at all to get the audience's attention into the film. It relies purely on the effects of the plot, writing, directing, and performances And it all works too. James Stewart brings a balance of blunt honesty but humor to his role as a man who's got nothing better to do then observe his neighbors. As Jeffries' love interest, Kelly brings great charisma and beauty to the screen, and her performance is worthy of mentioning. Corey and Ritter offer interesting support, but their roles aren't too demanding. The screenplay crafts detail after detail with greatness. As mentioned before, the audience too is trying to figure out what is really going on, and the choices of what to believe are theirs to make. However, the main beauty of this film is Hitchcock's direction. He gives an original feel of great power to the film, and he shows a perfect example of not having excess. Overall, 'Rear Window' stands out to be one of the great films of our time, and should definitely pave it's way into cinema history. 10/10"

","(contain minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Two newlyweds have recently moved into their first apartment. A ballet dancer invites acquaintances home for a dinner party. Miss Lonelyheart pretends that she's having dinner with her boyfriend. A downhearted composer plays the piano in search of inspiration. A married couple enjoys sleeping on the fire escape. And lastly, a salesman, Lars Thorwald, appears to be peculiarly fond of quarreling with his invalid, sick wife.<br/><br/>Every scene depicts a unique story in each of private compartments into which no one should ever pry or meddle without permission. But what if one of the occupants in this apartment building appears to be a murderer?<br/><br/>In Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller, Rear Window, L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart), an injured photographer with a broken leg, tries to address the above question by taking on a role of a crime-scene investigator when he suspects his neighbor Thorwald of murder. Using a pair of binoculars and his photographer's long lenses, Jeffries spies on Thorwald's and his other neighbors' private lives without leaving his wheelchair.<br/><br/>Because of Jeffries' immobility, nearly all the scenes in the movie take place inside his apartment. Although the stationary setting of a film can create an uninterestingly monotonous atmosphere, the fixed setting in Rear Window effectively draws our attention away from the scenery by turning our focus onto the characters. Through the witty repartees between Jeffries, his nurse Stella (Wendell Corey), and his fiancée Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), the audience becomes fascinated by Jeffries' `risky business'. Being a high-end fashion model, Lisa considers Jeffries' spying unethical; yet, her curiosity quickly persuades her to take a deep interest in Thorwald's life.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the audience, intrigued by the possibility of deciphering a homicide case, also becomes persuaded. Like Jeffries and Lisa, we have gradually turned into voyeurs, having secretly approved their actions by attaching our emotions to the main characters. To successfully connect us to the characters, Hitchcock chooses to recount the movie from Jeffries' perspective, letting us witness what Jeffries sees through his binoculars. Jeffries, thus, becomes a member of the audience, and we a part of him. When Jeffries wonders whom Thorwald is calling, we wonder with him; when Jeffries suspects that Thorwald has created false evidence to deceive the police, we agree with him; when Jeffries senses the danger once Thorwald has discovered his surveillance, we worry with him. Amidst the unfolding suspense, we hope to help Jeffries solve the crime, reasoning what would happen next and what would be the logical next step.<br/><br/>Yet, regardless of how deeply and firmly we have convinced ourselves of the murder, without evidence, we (the audience and Jeffries) cannot prove anything. Indeed, many private doings are never elucidated, but the movie's attentiveness to detail makes the crucial evidence easy to find under careful inspection. Every shot in the movie has a purpose: the most forgettable and trifling details often reveal the most meaningful clues to the manifestation of the murder and the murderer. Shots of a dog digging the dirt in a flower garden, a photograph of the flowers, a lady's handbag hanging on the bedpost and the tangled jewelries inside the handbag are revealed as crucial details. Yet, a viewer does not comprehend the importance of these significant scenes until he undergoes an unexpected epiphany later in the film, when he suddenly realizes their implications to the solution of the crime.<br/><br/>Thus, Rear Window has remained a classic decades after its first screening. Though it does not possess the mind blowing CGI effects of a present day action thriller, the audience is never deprived of the excitement, enthusiasm and suspense of a great murder mystery."

"hodge_m","Null","0","2","29 April 2003"," Hitchcock Themes
","Rear Window (1954), directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a magnificent film that in many ways conceptualizes and scrutinizes obsessive human curiosity spawned by voyeurism. While completing this seemingly rugged task by illustrating this apparent unconscious human behavior, Hitchcock manages to examine and illustrate many other motifs and themes. The two themes that will remain my major focus will be voyeurism and marriage. However, before exploring Hitchcock's techniques to illustrate these themes, it is important to define the concepts of theme and motif. Theme and motif are two terms that run parallel by definition. Their definitions are so closely related that it is possible that both theme and motif are one in the same. As defined by The American Heritage Dictionary, theme, in reference to a subject of artistic representation, is a topic of discourse or discussion. Motif, closely related refers to a recurrent thematic element in artistic representation One of the most fascinating aspects of Rear Window is the construction of the set. All of the events that happen are presented from one fixed location. The location is the rear window of L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart). The rest of the set is a reconstruction of block apartments at 125 West 9th Street, Greenwich Village.  This aspect of the film is arguably the most important component of Hitchcock's portrayal of voyeurism when intertwined with idea of an immobile protagonist. With these elements intact, the film is seen from the perspective of a stationary L.B Jeffries, with everything happening from one location. Hitchcock captures his thematic interpretation of voyeurism through the construction of the set, in which he presents the apartments across the courtyard in a manner that provides full visual accessibility to the activities that are taking place inside each individual apartment in visual range. This effect, in turn, creates separate pseudo-films inside the major film. By combining the construction of the set with POV shots of an immobile L.B. Jeffries, who by trade is a photographer (profession voyeur), Hitchcock is able to conceptualize the positive and negative aspects of voyeurism. Marriage is another key theme presented throughout the film. Once more, the construction of the set juxtaposed with POV shots illustrate Jeffries' lack of enthusiasm concerning the idea of marriage. As he talks on the phone with the Editor with whom he works, he justifies he's rationale of anti-marriage (boredom, nagging and oppressiveness) by the voyeuristic observations he has made through the lives of Miss Torso, Miss Lonelyhearts, the Thorwalds, and the Newlyweds. Hitchcock acquires the audience's empathy for Jeffries on this matter by the POV shots of Jeffries as he gazes into each window. Marriage is a recurring theme throughout the film; he is confronted with the pressured to get married by Grace Kelly (his girlfriend), Stella (his masseuse), and the editor. It appears that his only nemesis to marriage is what he observes when he penetrates the private relationships of others. There are many elements and examples that further illustrate the themes of voyeurism and marriage, just as there are many other themes present in the film. Beyond his renowned title as the `Master of Suspense,' Hitchcock undoubtedly created a masterpiece that challenges both human behavior and the thinking process. He challenges the audience using many cinematic techniques but perhaps the most important technique used is the POV shot juxtaposed with pure cinema (no dialogue). When we look into the lives of others with L.B. Jeffries, we observe what he observes and we analyze each event simultaneously with him, therefore becoming the voyeur and detective also. The phenomenon of the POV shot interwoven into pure cinema also illustrates the power of suspense, for example, when the antagonist/murderer Thorwald looks into L.B. Jeffries window, he's also looking at us as we all invade his privacy while searching for the truth. What separates Hitchcock from the thousands of directors in the business is his mastering of film techniques such as angles, lighting, color and music (or the lack there of) used in a manner to formulate ideas and stimulate the perceptions of the audience. Rear Window unconsciously draws the audience in, to vicariously live through eyes of the different characters in the film as Hitchcock tactfully uses film techniques to reveal feelings and mood through gestures, rhythm, camera angles and shot composition. The beauty of Rear Window is the fact that every dialogue rendered, every camera angle presented, every color illustrated and every musical piece heard played some role in the film. This is what makes Hitchcock's films such a delight to dissect, everything visual and audible that he implements into his work has some significance to the overarching concept of the film."

","The most interesting part of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window  is the portrayal of marriage.  This theme is absolutely central to the film.  At one point or another each character is described in terms of marriage - the lynchpin of the plot is the failed marriage between Mr. and Mrs. Thornwald; Jeff is constantly pontificating about the institution of marriage; Lisa is conflicted because of Jeff's aversion to marrying her; the newlyweds show the trials and rewards of young marriage; and, Mrs. Lonleyhearts cannot find someone to marry her.  The theme of marriage that runs through the film and the relation of the various characters to this theme is similar to other Hitchcock films viewed throughout the semester.  The hero and heroine of The 39 Steps pretend to be married but the actual union is never realized. This is parallel to Jeff and Lisa in Rear Window - the audience is enticed into thinking that they will end up getting married because of Jeff's regard for Lisa's daredevil side, but we never actually see a marriage ceremony, an engagement ring, or otherwise.  Thus, even though the theme of marriage pervades the lives of Lisa and Jeff and most of the other characters, and though they are all brought together by the plot twist of a failed marriage/murder, the two main characters never take the plunge (so to speak).  The complexity of the marriage theme makes this a fantastic film for both the film student and passive audience member alike."

"apwhalen","Null","0","2","27 April 2003"," Voyuerism in the Cinema
","There are several themes that run through many of Alfred Hitchcock's films. Theme is described by the Oxford English Dictionary as, `the subject of discourse, discussion, conversation, meditation or composition; a topic.' With this definition the themes of Hitchcock's movie are the underlying message he is trying to impart to the viewer. In Rear Window one of the main themes Hitchcock is exploring is the idea of voyeurism, the pleasure people derive from watching others. The idea of voyeurism is the overarching point of the film; you cannot watch Rear Window and not be drawn into Jeff's (played by James Stewart) voyeuristic ways. Almost the entire film is shot from Jeff's point of view, so the audience sees exactly what Jeff is seeing. Another important aspect of this voyeurism that cannot be overlooked is the commentary Hitchcock is giving on cinema as a whole. When a patron buys a movie ticket they are paying for the privilege of watching other people's lives for around two hours. In real life they would be arrested as `Peeping Toms', as Jeff's nurse warns him about. This idea of the moviegoers participating in voyeurism can also be seen in Hitchcock's film Sabotage. In it the main characters own a movie theater.  The patrons are then paralleled with the New Scotland Yard detective who is watching the owners. While the entire film is a commentary on voyeurism we will examine two scenes closely to better understand how Hitchcock was able to make such a fascinating film about how much people enjoy watching other people. The first scene we will examine is the opening scene in which the viewer is introduce to the occupants of the building outside Jeff's `rear window'. The viewer is treated to unobstructed views into the personal lives of the inhabitants: whether they be sleeping, shaving, or dancing. Within each window Jeff, and therefore the viewer is treated to a different genre of film. The woman Jeff describes as `Miss Lonelyhearts' is a melodrama, the love story of the newlyweds, and the murder - mystery of the Thornwalds.<br/><br/>One technique Hitchcock uses to get his point across about the movie viewer being a voyeur is through the constant use of Point of View shots. Therefore, the viewer sees only what Jeff sees. They are not treated to shots from inside the other apartments. This leads to a desire within the viewer to know more about what is occurring in the other building, just as Jeff grows ever more curious. Similarly, when Mr. Thornwald looks up and catches Jeff peeping the angle stays with Jeff's point of view so that Thronwald is looking directly at the viewer; almost accusing them of being an accomplice. Another scene where the viewer is drawn farther into Jeff's world of spying is the scene where Mr. and Mrs. Thornwald get into an argument. The viewer watches, as Jeff does, the couple fighting. However, the viewer gets no more information from the couple than Jeff does. Hitchcock does not cut to a shot from within their apartment. Instead, the viewer is left wondering what is being argued about, just like Jeff. One of the techniques Hitchcock uses to reinforce this distance from the action and voyeuristic tendencies of the audience is the dialogue left out in this scene and the noise that is placed in the scene. Perhaps the voices of the Thronwalds would have traveled across the courtyard if everything were perfectly quiet. However, the movie takes place in New York City where there is a constant buzz of noise that obstructs the viewers' and Jeff's ability to hear. Again, Hitchcock is forcing the viewer to deal with only having the information Jeff has. Most moviegoers feel uncomfortable with this since they are used to being all-knowing. Similarly, this drone of city noise is overcome when the poodle owner finds her dead dog. It leads to an aggravating and unsettling feeling for the audience and Jeff. While some things can be heard in the courtyard, most things cannot be heard from the apartments. Therefore, when Thronwald is getting ready to attack Jeff we are left wondering if anyone will be able to hear his cries for help and come to his aid. It is a masterful device set up by Hitchcock. As a whole Rear Window is a fascinating examination with culture, both the cinema and the outside world. People will forever be mesmerized by the lives of others. Even if it brings danger to themselves or the ones they love. It is innate in the human psyche and Hitchcock does a wonderful job of showing through this film."
"shah_p","Null","0","2","25 April 2003"," Describes a theme from the movie.
","Shakespeare would have been proud! Never before have so many storylines been weaved into a smooth creative web of dark humor and suspense in such little words. Hitchcock has managed to tell the viewers of `Rear Window' the story of six different relationships (or the lack thereof) without actually verbalizing all of them. The primary plot does revolve around the adventurous yet insecure photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) and his beautiful girlfriend/fiancÃ©e Lisa Carol Freemont (Grace Kelly).  According to me, the theme of this film, defined as a topic or subject re-occurring throughout the film, is based around the different layers of voyeuristic nature inherent in all human beings. We see the male lead, Jeff, confined to a wheelchair and whiling away his time by gazing into the lives of his neighbors. Hitchcock, unlike most of his movies, has also confined the audience to point of view shots from Jeff's apartment. The audience is confined to their chairs and is a part of this `crime' of secretly viewing other people's lives. The human nature, inherently curious, becomes part of Jeff's solution of boredom and starts learning more and more about the separate lives of all of Jeff's neighbors through his window voyeuristic practices. Jeff himself is curious about his neighbors for reasons apparent after we learn about his own problems with Lisa Freemont. He feels that Lisa would confine him and hence does not want to marry her. Hitchcock presents us with different versions of the turns Jeff's life might take depending on his decisions as regards to marriage with Lisa. `Miss Torso' is a free bird, always surrounded by dying fans. `Miss Lonely Hearts,' diametrically opposite, imagines herself on a date. The newlyweds hardly ever open their window for a respite. The `composer' is too busy with his work in composing his song for a dedicated relationship. Thorwald and his wife are continuously bickering at each other. Hitchcock masterfully presents us with a situation in which people often compare their own lives with those of others to make sense out of it. Another layer to the theme is human curiosity itself. For the most part, deep down inside, we always want to know the innermost secrets of other people's lives. It gives us a sense of normalcy. Watching the lives of his neighbors, gives Jeff this virtual sense of normalcy. There are various scenes, which represent this theme of voyeurism. One particular scene and dialogue exchange is in the beginning between Stella and Jeff. Stella catches Jeff looking at the stories unfold in his neighborhood and she says, `We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes sir. How's that for a bit of homespun philosophy?"" Stella clearly believes as most of us do that we should analyze our own problems first before trying to get in the middle of other people's problems. Ironically, she too, becomes a part of the voyeuristic web once she finds out what actually is going on. She, herself, cannot resist meddling in other people's affairs. This symbolizes the human nature of hypocrisy. Another scene that symbolizes this theme is when Jeff is comparing the life of `Miss Torso' with that of Lisa's. In the midst of their own relationship crisis, they use the experience of viewing into `Miss Torso's' apartment to make cutting remarks to each other about their own relationship. Hitchcock has also used some great technical elements to enhance the theme. The set itself, was the largest ever built at the time in the Paramount Studios. Jeff's window of the apartment is like a lens itself and the audience gets to participate in the act of voyeurism by watching every action through the lens, or through Jeff's point of view. This technique is used throughout the film by Hitchcock to enhance the effect of voyeurism. Hitchcock also uses lights throughout the film to symbolize the presence and absence of characters that Jeff is observing. In one particular scene, Jeff feels that Thorwald would watch him and he retracts into the darkness in his apartment. Jeff also uses camera flashbulbs as `protection' against Thorwald in one of the scenes. He feels that the absence of light would be protective for him. Hence, Hitchcock uses an excellent combination of various different technical and non-technical film aspects to create a cornucopia of delight for the audience."

","(SPOILER) `Rear Window', starring James Stuart as L.B. `Jeff' Jefferies and Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont, is a film that wraps the audience around its central theme of fulfillment. In fact, through the use of both subjective camerawork and mise en scene, the audience actually becomes part of the movie, and thus part of the theme, as well. `Rear Window' is a masterpiece of a film, a movie that leaves the audience with a powerful drive for personal fulfillment and a reminiscent sense of both understanding and knowing each character. `Rear Window' stresses fulfillment as the main theme, as the need for fulfillment plagues each of the characters within their enclosed world of 32 apartments and a courtyard. Happily, in the end of the film, all characters seem to obtain the personal fulfillment that they have been seeking throughout the movie. L.B. `Jeff' Jefferies (James Stuart), for example, desperately craves the solution to a potential murder mystery. In the end, he reaches fulfillment as he discovers the murderer and solves the case. His girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) wishes that Jeff would settle down with her. In the end, it appears as if their relationship has strengthened and her dream might come true. Additionally, the characters outside of Jeff's rear window also strive for fulfillment. For example, the musical composer (Ross Bagdasarian) repeatedly attempts to write a successful score, and manages to finally do so in the end of the movie. Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy) hopes to find a suitor that she likes. In the end, she finds one. Additionally, Miss Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn) seeks true love, and is granted this happiness in the end of the film. Even murderer Lars Thornwald (Raymond Burr) is granted some sense of fulfillment as he finally disposes of his plaguing wife, (although we never do discover his motive). Seemingly, the desire for fulfillment on behalf of the characters not only motivates their actions, but also categorizes their emotional and physical statuses at the end of the film. Thus, fulfillment is the theme of `Rear Window'. The theme of fulfillment is reflected in several scenes in `Rear Window'. It is discovered, perhaps in the most poignant revelation, with Miss Lonelyhearts. In the final scenes of the movie, we discover that for once, Miss Lonelyhearts is not eating alone (or eating with an unsatisfactory guest). Indeed, she has found a mate, the musical composer from a nearby apartment. Through the window, the two happily interact with each other in the composer's studio apartment. Miss Lonelyhearts is definitely no longer lonely. Thus, she has become fulfilled. In another poignant scene, we discover that Miss Torso has found a suitable partner, and through the window we discover her happily (and romantically) involving herself with her newly discovered love. She also has met with personal success and her desires have been fulfilled. Fulfillment (as a theme) is present in several of Hitchcock's movies, in fact. It appears vividly in `North By Northwest' (1959) and in `Suspicion' (1941). Typically, the audience never becomes involved with the central theme of a movie. However, genius and auteur Alfred Hitchcock directed `Rear Window' in hopes that the audience would relate to the theme. Hitchcock masterfully succeeded uniting the audience with the film by employing the two crucial camera techniques of subjective camerawork and mise en scene.<br/><br/>Subjective camerawork is employed through most of the movie, for the film consists of a series of events that Jeff sees through a rear window in his apartment building. The use of subjective camerawork allows the audience to familiarize with the characters, become part of their lives, and thus sympathize with the desire (and theme) of fulfillment on the characters' behalf. Through the rear window, the audience can clearly see exactly what the voyeur (Jeff) sees. The members are made to believe that they are interacting in this small courtyard world, and thus are part of the world. In doing so, the audience makes associations with the characters and it is cognizant about the characters' desires for fulfillment. One scene in which subjective camerawork is quite obvious is when Jeff thinks he sees the Thornwald murder take place. This scene best demonstrates subjective camerawork, because the audience member understands that the murder is a mere possibility, perhaps a figment of Jeff's vivid imagination. The viewer recognizes that the murder has been seen merely through a pair of eyes, and is thus from a subjective viewpoint. The use of mise en scene allows the audience member to associate the courtyard with a sort of world. By using very elaborate shots that encompass the dimensions and proportions of the courtyard, the audience member reaches understanding about the operative world in which the characters live. As a result, they can better associate with the characters and their desires, and thus the theme of fulfillment becomes quite poignant for the viewer- they are working within the characters' environment, as well. One scene that best illustrates mise en scene is the opening scene in which the camera spins and spirals through the courtyard, examining each corner of the tiny enclosed world. From this shot, the audience derives a sense of the spatial integrities of the courtyard, and they can better operate within the characters' world. Truly, Hitchcock's great film, `Rear Window', deftly maneuvers the audience to relate to and understand each of the characters. It's a masterpiece that destroys the barrier that typically segregates the audience from the film, and creates a bond between the visual medium and the viewer that lasts poignantly in the viewer's heart."

His neighbours are for the most part an amicable bunch (one feels affection for them after a while) but there is a grey area inhabited by one man. Soon, it becomes apparent to Jeffries that his neighbour isn't of good heart, and it seems that Jeffries has become a witness to a masked murder.<br/><br/>The beautiful Grace Kelly, goddess of the silver screen, also stars in this classic thriller.

","Spoilers heirin!<br/><br/>Rear Window is one of my top five favorite films of all time. Everything about it is great, from the acting to the camera-angles to the setting itself.  I stumbled upon this film about ten years ago or so.  I was in Florida with my mom and she decided that we should rent it and watch it together.  We were both huge fans of Hitchcock's and since I'd never seen this one before, she promised me that I was in for a treat.  After that first viewing, I became hooked and like to try and watch it whatever chance I get.  Even if you've seen it more than once, there are still so many different things and pieces of the puzzle that you can pick up on. <br/><br/>
As you probably already know by now, Rear Window is the story of an aspiring news photographer (played by James Stewart) who is sidelined in his Greenwich Village apartment one hot, steamy summer by a broken leg.  The rear window of his apartment looks out upon the backyard of his building and the buildings surrounding it. Stewart's character starts watching his neighbors going about their everyday business and it is only a matter of time until he is convinced that one of them is a cold-blooded murderer.  He enlists the help of his glamourous socialite girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly), the insurance company nurse hired to watch over him (played by Thelma Ritter), and his best friend the detective (played by Wendall Corey), who is a bit skeptical as to Stewart's reasoning at the beginning but then gets sucked into it like everyone else by the ending of the film.  I don't want to give anything away because half the fun of seeing this film for the first time is never knowing just what's going to happen next.  Rear Window is a film that you really must watch carefully, and study it frame by frame if you ever get the chance.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>My rating: 4 stars"

   The film has lost none of its fascination with the passing of time. Like many of Hitchcock's films it is multi-layered. It works as a straightforward thriller, but also as a study of voyeurism, and the moral dilemmas that it can throw up. Hitchcock directs with a sure hand, showing us only the view from Jeffries' apartment. Nothing much happens for the first half hour, we simply get to know the neighbours from Jeffries (James Stewart) point of view. We become as fascinated as he is, as Robert Burks' camera masterfully roves around the courtyard. At no time does the film seem to drag, because we have become engrossed in the surroundings - the voyeur in us all.<br/><br/>   The cast are uniformally good. James Stewart had the ability to convey an emotion with the slightest glance or facial expression, which works well here, as he spends the entire film in a wheelchair. Grace Kelly is good as Jeffries' high society girlfriend who comes to believe his theory, and Thelma Ritter is excellent as the visiting nurse full of worldly wisdom. There is some snappy and witty dialogue between her and Stewart.<br/><br/>   Rear Window showcases Alfred Hitchcock's genius to the maximum.

","Let me start off by saying that I am a young man, so by the time I was born Hitchcock was already dead and most movies were already learning how to capture audiences with explosions and special effects. Therefore, watching any movie made after 1980 was pretty hard for me, I simply didn't grow up in that time. But hearing all the rave about Hitchcock's films, I decided to give it a shot. I went to the video store and saw Rear Window on DVD. I almost balked when I looked at the year it was made and almost put the thing back on the shelf but something made me check it out. I was not disappointed. At first, it seemed slow and boring, not enough thrills for my taste. I was about to turn it off by the time that nurse came back again, but I just made myself watch. Things started to pick up and the rest is history. By the end of the film I was gripping my chair and with my pulse pounding. Talk about suspense! I never knew I could get so worked up over a movie made in the 1950s, it scared me more than most thrillers I have seen since 2000! I also have never seen a film that only used one set, like this one. To top it off, this movie gave me so many thrills and there were no shootings, no gore, and (I don't think) any special effects! I was really shocked. So many exciting moments, like when Grace Kelly and the nurse go to check out what's buried in the garden, when Kelly is caught in the murderer's apartment, and the climax when the murderer learns who is spying on him and goes to pay him a visit. Terrific stuff, all done using mood other things besides endless visual effects and blood! Needless to say, I can now see that some old movies are not as bad as I have thought, in fact they are better, focusing more on characters and stories than their rock soundtracks and computer images. I don't know if I would recommend this to many people my age, but I do suggest they try it. I did, and I loved it. Thanks to this I will be watching many more classic films now. If it seems slow at first, bear with it and wait. You're in for a great movie."
"sadaface","10","0","2","15 July 2002"," Probably the best movie ever made about voyeurism
","It s one of my favorite movies of the genius called Alfred Hitchcock. And surely one of the best ever made about that certain identifiable human activity which is more than anything else close to the mere mechanism of the medium. Voyeurism is being implied or clearly revealed in every sequence. The reporter, his girlfriend,  his nurse... and finally the viewers of this movie, all react to the situation in hand with a voyeuristic obsession. The dialogues are sharply sarcastic, the acting as in almost every Hitch movie, flawless and the plot is characteristic of what always had dominated Hitch 's mind. But it s the direction that manage to organize all these fine elements to create a unique movie that remains always in our mind."
"Curtis-23","10","0","2","15 July 2002"," A Wish-Fulfillment Feast
","Not only does this marvelous film cater to one's desire for a peek at the neighbors, but it makes their daily round unrealistically interesting, attractive or affecting.  The courtyard of the Manhattan apartment I once inhabited had no lovely ballerina starting the day with graceful, sensual dance, or talented songwriter filling the night air with live, semi-classical piano.  Rather, my window opened on the blare and schlock of commercial television and radio.  <br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart's neighbors include not only a killer who considerately leaves his shades up for everything but the crime but also Miss Lonelyheart, who dates and grieves in full view, another woman who eloquently laments and protests (to all the world who failed to stop it) the murder of her pet dog, and policemen who arrive within seconds of being summoned to stop a fight. Who would need movies if ordinary life were this alive?<br/><br/>Although Stewart is prone, with left leg in full cast, his role is something like that of a male ballet dancer, functioning as a kind of center off and around whom others play.  These ""others"" include not only his neighbors (for the most part unaware of him), but also his visitors.  In dialogue, we first see this with Thelma Ritter, who plays his skillful, no-nonsense nurse. Stewart's unassuming, brief responses set off her fast, funny, caring, shrewd paragraphs.  For how many people do insurance companies provide nurses like this?<br/><br/>But of course the crowning wish-fulfillment is Grace Kelly as Stewart's would-be bride.  If there is another movie in which she is this beautiful, lead me to it.  The beauty is in her carriage, her looks, her clothes, her speech, her love, her intelligence, her pluck, her resourcefulness, her resilience, her good temper, her liveliness.  (That she stays superbly attractive is the more remarkable, since aggressive pursuit is not ordinarily a becoming posture.)  Here she is, mine to enjoy.  The more so, because Stewart's retreats leave her more available to me, who would be glad to fill in.  <br/><br/>The murderer is played by Raymond Barr, who spent much of his cinematic life as a central character, Perry Mason.  Here, he mostly elicits action from others, rather than providing it himself, which is perhaps the fate of most criminals in detective stories they precipitate.  There is of course the last, frightening struggle between him and Stewart, a climax more crucial for the plot than for my enjoyment of the movie, which had already been signed, sealed and delivered. <br/><br/>By the way, in a recent comment (5/2/02) tim777ca asks why, as Barr approaches his apartment, Stewart leaves his door unlocked.  He is physically able to move to the door and lock it.  He could unlock it again if needed by friends or police. Do we have an ending with no artistic necessity?  Is this, as tim777ca alleges, characteristic of Hitchcock's films?"

"AbeStreet","10","0","2","27 June 2002"," There is a little bit of L.B. Jefferies in all of us!
","It is easy to see why this film made AFI's top 100 list.  In this review I will explain why I feel that this film is one of the best ever and compare it to other well known Hitchcock films.  Spoilers are contained in the review.<br/><br/>I first saw REAR WINDOW (RW) in 1984 at the age of 15.  It was during this time that several of Hitchcock's films were being re-released in theaters. I had recently discovered reruns of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (AHP) on tv and had a budding interest in all things Hitchcock.  I had of course seen movies such as PSYCHO (P) and THE BIRDS (TB)but knew little of his other work.  I had the opportunity to see the 1956 remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (TMWKTM56)with Jimmy Stewart at the theater.  I enjoyed this film more than any other Hitchcock film I had seen to date.  A few months later I tried to rent a copy of the film but the video store did not have a copy. The video clerk suggested I may enjoy RW instead.  I looked at the box and saw that this film contained Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, whom I had recently saw on tv in DIAL ""M"" FOR MURDER (DMFM), and figured why not. This suggested rental was probably the best movie tip I have ever been given.<br/><br/>
I watched this film several times.  Initially I thought the film moved at a much slower pace, especially when compared to TMWKTM56, and the same set throughout the movie was a bit boring.  However, I rewatched the film and found that I began to identify with L.B. Jefferies (J. Stewart) as he looked in on his neighbors.  After all who hasn't stared at his/her neighbors as they argue or as furniture is moved in or guests pull up and enter their home.  We all do!  Unlike Hitchcock's other heros that spend the film darting around from place to place while they romance the girl they've abducted to help them as they clear their names L.B. Jefferies is a man we can all relate to.  He has been bed ridden due to an injury and is bored. As such he begins to spy on neighbors to pass the time.  I think any person would have done what he did.  L.B. also struggles with the fact that he is dating and loves a woman who has a career, makes more money than him.  For the most part this aspect of dating was not a real issue until post WWII when women began to move into the male dominated work area.  I think many men and women can appreciate how this aspect of the movie relates to the dating scene more and more, especially when viewed today.<br/><br/>
Another great thing about this film is how the viewers all grow to know L.B.'s neighbors.  Will Ms. Lonely Hearts ever find love?  Will we learn who Ms. Torso really likes?  Why is Harry, the newly wed, so distraught? Of course once the film is over the answers to these questions are all provided but until the end Hitchcock keeps us wondering!  Thelma Ritter as the visiting  nurse Stella adds her usually snappy personality and wit to the film.<br/><br/>Lastly,  this film is unlike just about any other Hitchcock film.  There are no chase scenes, no graphic death scene and no fancy location shoots. It is a unique masterpiece to be enjoyed by all."

","As a huge Hitchcock fan, I had been predisposed to the belief that Rear Window would be an incredibly entertaining, mysterious, and suspenseful piece of film work.  I found it to be rather the opposite.  I am truly amazed that it impresses others with its ""depth and meaning.""  Hitchcock's other films entertain, excite, and satisfy the viewer.  Rear Window is slow-moving, meaningless, and anti-climatic.  In my opinion, nothing about it was scary or suspenseful, so if you want a real thriller of Hitchcock's that's not ""Psycho,"" I suggest ""Rebecca,"" (1940).  It was his only movie to win Best Picture, and it's a much better way to spend 2+ hours of free time. I feel the only other person who might share my sentiment is the IMDB staff person who suggested ""Body Double"" for those who like Rear Window- if you've seen it, you know what I mean!"

","A wonderful film. The minute I first saw this film, I wanted to live in 50s New York. And Grace Kelly, well you can't find women like that nowadays. As for the rest of it, well its pure genius and remarkable use of such restricted mise-en-scene. What's really wonderful is the genuine suspense that is created and no matter how many times you watch it you're always going to feel the suspense building. This is without a doubt Hitch's best and also one of Jimmy Stewart's best. Another example of that collaboration that comes close to this genius is ""Vertigo"", but I prefer the one-view perspective of ""Rear Window"". If you call yourself a Hitchcock fan and haven't seen this then you should put yourself to shame as this is the ultimate thriller. The master of suspense really goes in for the thrill, setting camera lenses twitching with REAR WINDOW! 10 out of 10!"

","This movie along with Vertigo, Psycho, and North by Northwest is a timeless classic that is one of Hitch's 5 best.  The only question is, is it his best movie?  You can make a strong case.  This movie has everything--great cast which included Jimmy Stewart(in probably his best role), Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr.  It had great costumes--I didn't think it was possible to make the gorgeous Kelly look even better but somehow Edith Head did.  It had a great plot that kept you in suspense the entire movie.  It also had one of the best Hitch villains ever in Lars Thorwald, excellently played by Burr.  However, without question, Stewart's performance is tremendous.  Just to watch him act with his face and body language is incredible.  An interesting note is that the songwriter was the creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks aka David Seville (real name Ross Bagsdarian).  I could go on and on about this movie, but you, the viewer, need to watch it, especially if you have never seen it before.  A movie that will stand the test of time."

","More than any other Hitchcock film, I think, ""Rear Window"" is not only a great piece of entertainment, but a statement about our society and even about the human condition.  Most of Hitchcock's other films certainly ""work"" as ingenious narratives, but ""Rear Window"" distinguishes itself as a multi-layered examination of voyeurism in American society. And what I think I like best about the film is its refusal to preach any sort of Great Moral to the audience.  It simply allows its wonderful story to unfold bit by bit, as Nature intended.  Grace Kelly and James Stewart are excellent, but Thelma Ritter is priceless in a supporting role."

","One of my favorite Hitchcock films. The plot couldn't be better. The cast is amazing. Considered as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. James Stewart and Grace Kelly star on this one. Stewart as a reporter with a broken leg on a wheelchair who always is spying his neighbors and suspects that a man who lives in his same neighborhood has murdered his wife.  Grace Kelly appears as his girlfriend. Thelma Ritter does a great job as a sarcastic maid and Raymond Burr (from ""Perry Mason"") as the ""suspect"". Considering the role of Burr in PERRY MASON, it was a little hard for me to adjust to the idea that his the ""bad guy"" on this one. The atmosphere of a neighborhood where everyone's life is so detailed (miss ""lonely hearts"", the sculptor, the newlyweds, the ballet dancer, the couple who sleeps on the fire escape and Mrs. and Mrs. Thorwald) gives a really interesting climax to the film. Alfred Hitchcock was nominated to an Academy award for Best director, and screenwriter John Michael Hayes for Best Screenplay. The TV remake cannot be compared to this one (but I don't think that is extremely bad considering other remakes from Hitchcock films). James Stewart second appearance on a Hitchcock film (since ROPE) and Kelly's first. A must-see for Hitchcock fans."

A number of interesting characters keep the the film intriguing while the plot develops. During the film, Hitchcock keeps the audience guessing as to whether Stewart's character is witness to a murder, or whether he is just allowing his imagination to cloud his judgement in order to fight off boredom.

Highly entertaining, with great performances from Stewart, Kelly, (Actually likeable for once, and very sexy) and the hilarious Thelma ""Maybe he put her leg in the East"" Ritter, and a great script, the film also does have a great deal of tension and suspense in its last half, created as only Hitch can do it, esepcially in the scene (Possible Spoiler) where Raymond Burr enters Stewart's apartment and he keeps taking pictures of him to distract him. It's also highly engrossing from the beginning; like Stewart's character, we really become voyeurs and get caught up in the lives of the people he watches from his window, most of whom hardly even speak. <br/><br/>

","One of the most amazing films of all time.  Hitchcock turns this thriller into something much more--a fascinating study of voyeurism with obvious ironic connections to movie watching.  The way Hitchcock turns the rear windows in this courtyard into miniature ""movie screens"" is a technical and dramatic marvel.  On top of this, we have one of the great romantic pairings of all time in James Stewart and Grace Kelly (in her best screen performance).  Thelma Ritter gives one of her many great supporting performances. And though Raymond Burr has a small role, he still creates one of the screen's most unforgettable villains.  (His ""What do you want of me?"" still gives me chills.)  An often overlooked element in this film is the sound work.  The way we hear the voices and music from the windows filtered into Stewart's apartment adds to the mesmerizing effect.  If Hitchcock had made no other film but this, he would still be remembered as one of film's great geniuses."

","You could say that Psycho is more shocking, Vertigo more psychologically probing, and North by Northwest more sheer fun - but no other single Hitchcock film fires successfully on so many cylinders all at once. Every aspect of the director's considerable artistry is on view here - his humor, his tight plot construction, his brilliant set design, his visual ingenuity, the sexy and sophisticated interplay between his two leads - each honed and refined to perfection. Everything works in this film, and works brilliantly. The physical limitations of the plot - i.e. that it all takes place on one set - could have seriously undermined the film by allowing it to become too static, but instead Hitchcock actually makes the resulting claustrophobia work to great effect; it all builds to a climactic scene that is as pulse-poundingly suspenseful as anything ever committed to film. There are not many movies which could be described as ""perfect"" - even in the best of them, there's usually at least one or two minor flaws somewhere - but Rear Window definitely earns that distinction. If you have not yet seen it, I envy you the experience you are going to have once you finally do."

","I was lucky to see Rear Window after it had been restored by the wizards who have restored such films as Vertigo and Lawrence of Arabia.  The film looks great.  You can see Lars Thorwald's lit cigar in his dark apartment and the sunset has color that hasn't been seen since the original theatrical run.  The film will never age.  Hitchcock's masterful direction draws you into the life of L.B. Jeffries and his confinement to a wheelchair.  The only things we are allowed to see is what Jeffries can see.   One stormy night, Jeffries hears a scream that sets his suspicions running.  Did Lars Thorwald kill his wife?  If not, why is he acting so strangely? Hitchcock pulls us deeper into the mystery the same way that Jeffries hooks his nurse and girlfriend.  Eventually, they start doing all the footwork and all Jeffries can do is watch.   The fun of Rear Window is watching the tension mount as Hitchcock work his cinematic touches to bring the fear and anxiety from the screen, and have it do a number on your nerves.   A great film that will always be entertaining."

","Grace Kelly had all the chance in the world to prove herself as a great actress and she did prove herself.  In fact, she proved herself in 1954 by winning an Oscar in ""The country girl"" but especially by playing in ""Rear window"".  Teaming up with James Stewart, she is terrific and looks absolutely marvelous.  But that's not the only good part about ""Rear window"".  The script is incredibly original and Hitchcock showed the world how subtle and suggestive his movies could be without screwing up his directing.<br/><br/>  Jeff (James Stewart) is a professional photographer who broke his leg taking a picture on one of his days off.  So he is stuck in his apartment without anything to do but watch what goes on in the city through his rear window.  Well, he also has company from his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).  However, one day he notices that in one of the windows across, there is a woman who use to live there who has gone missing.  The man who lived there with his wife is Lars Thornwald (Raymond Burr) and Jeff starts to suspect him of having murdered his wife. <br/><br/>
  As soon as Stewart starts to suspect Burr of having murdered his wife, you can't take your eyes off the movie.  Everybody delivers a great performance in this movie, especially Thelma Ritter who also provides a couple of laughs as Stewart's nurse who is always talking.  John Michael Hayes's script has hardly any flaws and is one of the best Hitchcock ever had.  But Hitchcock adds the final touch with his masterful directing.  the only thing I don't really like about this movie is that is considered as being Hitchcock's best whereas I believe that ""Psycho"" is by far his best.

","Alfred Hitchcock proved himself to be a master of his genre, and this film is one of his greatest.  Rear Window is an amazing thrill ride of the mind - it requires you to actually THINK about what you're watching and follow along.<br/><br/>Hitchcock keeps your mind going throughout the film - after all, haven't we all been guilty of a small amount of voyeurism at least once?  Extremely well written, and shot mostly from the main character's perspective, Rear Window is very entertaining at the same time it is thrilling, unlike a lot of more modern movies which rely on effects.<br/><br/>Watching a good Hitchcock like Rear Window is like reading a *very* good book!

","What can I really say about Sir Alfred Hitchcock? Whatever I am going to say is little about this man. He is just perfect. As a matter of fact Hitchcock is the best director of all times. This is being verified in all the movies made by him. All the directors make sometime a bad or not so good movie but Hitchcock is an exemption. Psycho, The birds, Notorious, Frenzy and all the others. And of course Rear window. How masterfully he directed it. The entire movie was shot in a room. Although the suspense has dominated the movie. If one had not seen the movie and had heard the plot he would have thought that the movie would certainly be very boring. I would agree if I knew that the director was not Hitchcock.

","If you are looking for a starting point to act as an introduction to Hitchcock then its hard to argue the case for any one particular film. The case made for Rear Window is at least as good as any others though. Featuring the main themes that flowed through Hitchcock's work (voyeurism, death, betrayal, pessimism, grim fascination with the darker parts of the human psyche), Rear Window is also a prime example of Hitchcock's stylistic singularity as a mainstream director. For example, the opening track and pan tells us at once who we are with, why we are there and what has happened to bring us there. As James Stewart's character L.B.Jefferies gazes out of his window we only really see the other characters in their moments of weakness, at their most vulnerable. At once a comment on the intrusive nature of the camera and the human self, we feel as intriqued and simultaneously disgusted as we along with Stewart's narky, bored photographer as he gazes at the drama unfolding as a man supposedly kills his bed-ridden wife.<br/><br/>I believe this to be Hitchcock's most pessimistic film regarding marriage and human relationships. All the characters we watch are either precariously happy or plain unhappy specifically regarding their marital/non-marital status. They are at worst like the murderer, ready to kill to rid himself of his wife, or like 'poor Miss Lonelyheart', alone and full of self pity. The only seemingly positive example is the newlyweds but even they near the end of the film show some signs of weariness. The evidence stolen by Grace Kelly's character is a wedding ring, which she slips on her finger, an ironic and bitter twist as she has been trying to ensnare Stewart's hand in marriage throughout the whole film and this perhaps is the closest she'll get. The ending, where her character lets the cover of her book slip to reveal a travelling magazine encompasses Jimmy Stewart's reasons for not marrying earlier on as the differences between them are too severe. The ending resolves little except the murder.<br/><br/>One of my favourite films. Although what precisely that says about me...."

What I like about Rear Window the best is the attention it pays not only to Jeffries and the murder he is trying to solve, but of the attention it pays to L.B.'s neighbors, his relationship with Lisa his girlfriend, and his nurse Stella. It also pays attention to L.B.'s relationship with people he doesn't even know, the neighbors that he spies on. Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, etc. that even the average viewer cares for them. The details are genius too, the set, the costumes (especially Grace Kelly's clothing)even the music! And we cannot discount the wonderful cast. Charismatic James Stewart is so charming as L.B. Jeffries and displays so much emotion with his eyes and his tone of voice. Was his face not heartbreaking when he saw his neighbor attmepting to kill his girlfriend? Also Thelma Ritter is great as well as stella, Grace Kelly is just so beautiful in this film as Lisa and she as well displays so much emotion when she is onscreen. Grace Kelly is just a vision in Rear Window. Bottom line is that Alfred Hitchcock, the cast, and the crew of this film make Rear Window one the best movies of all time. I also recommend: Psycho"

I felt so tense watching it that it wasn't until I thought about it later that I realized there wasn't any violence in the movie, with the exception of the very end.  I can't think of another film--or another director--that I'm that willing to play along with for that long, with the possible exceptions of Hitchcock's earlier Lifeboat (an underrated classic) or Seance on a Wet Afternoon.

It was still great, with all the usual compliments to be paid here too. Great camera work, scenery, directing, and tension & phenomenal acting from all parties. The only slight criticism of the films is that the lead man, despite usually being awesome does tend to play a role of a man with a lifestyle (& a woman) several years younger than himself, but that never affects the plot of the film.<br/><br/>Rear Window was just let down slightly by occasional lulls of anything happening, 5 minutes here & there, particularly at the beginning where the story stood still. Nor was it the sort of film where you'd ask yourself why? or how? during it. The way it would pan out was pretty clear from early on. I just thought there may have been a little more significance with one or two of the other neighbours, & 2 or 3 seconds of poor editing right at the finale was the only other aspect that slightly dated the film.<br/><br/>But overall, still a good watch & as good as anything today.<br/><br/>A high 7/10"

","Rear Window is without a doubt one of the greatest and most powerful movies ever to be seen on the big screen.

That's not all, that's the plot but then we have all the extras who polish the movie to create on of the most respected pictures of all times.

"AdFin","10","0","2","21 February 2002"," Hitchcock challenges the audience to put themselves in the picture.
","The great thing about Rear Window, as others have probably pointed out much better than I can, is the fact that Hitchcock challenges the audience to look at themselves and make the decision of just how far are we, to some extent, the voyeur.  We spend our entire lives watching other people's lives unfold before us on some kind of screen or other, and with the recent explosion in reality based TV shows, the lines between entertainment and exploitation are becoming increasingly blurred.  And Rear Window is one of the few films of this cycle to actual make an interesting point.  Hitchcock uses the environment of the protagonist L.B. Jeffries (his cramped apartment) and never allows us to leave, so we see the entire film evolve from our hero's eyes, helping us identify more.  This is also an important devise, as it means that we the audience are only given privilege to the same information that Jeffries has.  Hitchcock creates an atmosphere and a tension that lasts for ever, right up to the very last minute, never giving the audience an opportunity to breath, we're in the same position that James Stuart's character is in and for a moment, because Hitchcock has so expertly put us in that position we can suspend disbelief and almost feel what he is going through.  If anyone ever has any doubts as to what a talented director Hitchcock was, then immediately point them in the direction of Rear Window. One of the greatest films ever made.  10/10"

Thelma Ritter provides most of the comic relief as an insurance nurse, while Wendell Corey is also excellent as Jeffries' slightly ignorant detective friend.<br/><br/>To say anything else would be giving too much away, but rest assured, that even by today's standards, this is a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema.

Jeffries a magazine photographer, with a broken leg, is confined to the apartment for six weeks and the movie tells us how he spends his long days.  Jeffries' late girlfriend Lisa, played by Grace Kelly, is his most frequent visitor.  Lisa dreams of one day marrying L.B., yet he hopes to fall in love before he marries.  L.B. is often alone with no company, with the exception of his neighbors who reveal their personal affairs to anyone who might be watching.  Jeffries has nothing to do but watch, he becomes obsessed with his neighbors lives and takes every chance to spy on them.  L.B. will even wait up in the night to find out what someone might be doing out in the rain at three a.m.  L.B. becomes so interested that he begins to compare his self to their lives.  Lisa finds his constant spying revolting at first, yet she too becomes wrapped up in his compulsive need to know what they are doing.  L.B. is particularly interested in the lives of the Thorwald's across the courtyard from his rear window.  The Thorwalds are an older married couple, Mr. Thorwald is a touchy drinker, while his wife is in bed with what appears to be an illness.  The Thorwald's constant fighting with each other is extremely interesting to L.B. and Lisa as well.  L.B. even convinces his nurse Stella that there is something peculiar going on in the Thorwald's apartment, and he is determined to find out what.  The movie presents a classic mystery case that is even difficult for L.B.'s detective friend to penetrate.

I truly was scared for the safety of the main characters, and even some of the not-so-main characters, (Like the lonely woman who appeared to be ready to commit suicide by the end. She had maybe one line in the whole movie, and I still cared about her.) which doesn't happen to me often in movies.

"jansma_c","Null","0","2","22 April 2003"," Themes of Rear Window
","Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window deals with the complex human characteristics of voyeurism and obsession.  These underlying observant premises regarding the human psyche constitute the movies main thematic drive.  They are both what sustains and advances the films plot as well as introspective subject matter's themselves.  The film blatantly acknowledges these traits within humans as well as dissects them through the lens of Hitchcock's style, editing, and plot as well as his actors.  Rear Window is therefore a masterpiece not only in terms of its subjective treatment towards character observation, but the audience's observation as well. The movie's plot begins with L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) looking out the window curiously at his neighbors.  The entire movie is based on the idea of voyeurism from this moment on, with Jeffries, his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) constantly staring at their neighbors.  Jeffries becomes, not a participant in society, but rather an observer.  Where he veers from the path of pure voyeurism and into a more gray area is when he creates assumptions around his observations.  And this leads to a second major theme in this film- obsession. Jeffries becomes convinced that his neighbor has killed his wife through numerous coincidences and strange happenings. He assumes conclusions to his observations and, due to logic and stubbornness develops and obsession over them.  He compromises friends and ignores counter evidence in an attempt at confirming his inkling.  He, though almost being convinced otherwise in several instances, never gives up on his theory concerning the supposed delinquent neighbor and consequently creates suspense that had not yet been seen before the creation of this thriller."

","Synopsis: A newspaper photographer with a genius for catching the perfect shot, finds himself shackled to a wheelchair after his latest photographic shot has landed him there. Bored, he develops an instinct to naturally look over at the apartment complex that is within his view. His insurance nurse belittles him with questions about why he refuses to commit to marriage, with a beautiful woman faithfully at his side. But within his reach, he notices something peculiar about one of the tenants in his observation, and it's only a matter of time before he's convinced that tenant has committed murder.<br/><br/>The Review: Probably one of the best films Hitchcock will be remembered for. ""Rear Window"" is stylish in the sense that all the action takes place in one locale, an apartment. The performances are right on the money with frequent co-star Jimmy Stewart playing the unfortunate protagonist, and Grace Kelly as his doting girlfriend and Thelma Ritter as his nurse. Hitchcock develops the film a good hour and a half, setting it up with little subtle hints and surprises, but it's only in the last ten or fifteen minutes, that everything really kicks in. Hitchcock takes the audience out of text, and they are no longer made out to be the observant, but a participant in this film. Voted one of the American Film Institute's 100 Greatest Thrills, ""Rear Window"" is an unnerving classic. Definitely a classic film."

","Rear Window, is one of Hitchcock's best thrillers, giving Hitchcock total carte blanche to make the characters three dimensional, so the big finale will pay off. The story starts off with Jimmy Stewart's news photographer, sidetracked by an on the job injury with a leg cast and a wheelchair to prove it. His girlfriend (Grace Kelly) can't quite understand his refusal to commit to their relationship. He ends up developing a light taste for voyeurism, due to the inevitable view of the back of apartment building in full view of he. The story, however, kicks off when Stewart thinks he may very well have witnessed a murder in one of the apartments. He's dead intent on catching the murdering spouse (Raymond Burr in dyed white hair) as he catches glimpses of what he believes leads up to the incident itself. A majority of the film, is based on Stewart's paranoia, as he continues to watch continually at this particular apartment, and then the tension builds up in the forty five minutes. WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! In the seat jumping climax, Kelly in a fit of obsession with whom she thinks may be the killer, enters the apartment after he has left, only to come back, catch her, and the police arrive. The girlfriend goes in search of the ring the victim may have had, and as she waves it toward our protagonist, the suspect has a glimpse of her waving the finger in her hand, and then looks up in the direction of the ring, to catch a dead on view of who is spying on him.

","The film is just brilliant. The story masterfully unfolds, and the dialogue is witty, wickedly witty, even by today's standards.  The sound design is complicated and had to have been a big leap fifty years ago, when there are moments of no dialogue, only sounds coming from the many buildings of the apartment complex, as heard from his room - even the music score sounds like it's coming from a record player next door. Perhaps the greatest achievement is the fact that the camera never leaves the apartment - every angle is shot at his room or from the view of his room. Hitchcock loved to create little challenges like that."

","Hitchcock one word to describe my feelings for this film ""Masterpiece"" absolutely excellent movie. I saw this when i was like 8 years old im not the biggest fan of old films, but for Alfred I make and exception.<br/><br/>The perspective of seeing what LB does i like unlike a film in todays era where if they made Rear Window it would be all moving around. The setting is spectacular and due to the small character list it makes it easier to adapt to each and everyones life in their apartments. And the characters names stick in forever. <br/><br/>In closing I believe if a remake is done the following steps must be taken. - Gus Van Sant must not direct. - The theme stays the same - the era stays the same - Gweneth Palthrow plays Lisa - Harrison Ford plays LB<br/><br/>those are the ingredients for a top remake."
"JawsOfJosh","Null","0","1","3 April 2001"," Hitchin' a ride through the camera lens of L.B. Jeffries
","Like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Citizen Kane"", ""Read Window"" is and will always be a film that draws endless debate & discussion.  Is the film an examination of voyeurism or feminism?  Both themes appear strongly throughout.  As L.B. Jeffries, a wheelchair-bound photo-journalist with a broken leg, James Stewart delivers a carefully nuanced performance of a man whose morbid fantasy comes to life only to haunt him.  Whereas we all usually enter peoples homes through the front door to coat racks, arranged book cases and coffee tables, Jeffries looks out the rear window of his living room to witness the ""private"" worlds, full of negative energy, at the apartment complex across the courtyard.  Here we see Miss Torso, a young, curvaceous ballerina thwarting off the advances of young men.  Miss Lonelyhearts, a spinster in search of that special guy.  A frisky newlywed couple and a middle-aged musician are among the other neighbors.  Raymond Burr, as Lars Thornwald, draws Jeffries' attention the most.  Jeffries suspects that his neighbor Thornwald may have killed his nagging but invalid wife.<br/><br/>Playing audience to Jeffries' impressions is his girlfriend Lisa - played by Grace Kelly in her usually elegant Ice Queen mode.  Lisa at first is put off by Jeffries' homicidal theory, hoping rather to focus on a potential marriage between the two.  Lisa, an urbane socialite, doesn't consider any possible lifestyle clash that Jeffries, the nomadic adventurer, fears will happen.  Lisa is soon convinced by Jeffries ideas and becomes just as obsessed as he does with the neighbors across the courtyard.  Lisa & Jeffries conspire, mostly at night under dim lamp light, to solve the mystery, despite the warnings of Jeffries' stern detective friend as well as his nurse.<br/><br/>While considered to be more commercially inclined than the much more revered ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"" is still equally adept at sizing up the private passions of its protagonist.  Another facet of the film that escapes many minds is Hitchcock's subtle but perverse use of claustrophobia. ""Rope"", the much overlooked 1948 experimental film that serves as the the first Hitchcock-Stewart collaboration, also makes use of the inherent tension of dangerous situations occuring in close quarters.  The entire film takes place in one room with only 5 major characters!  Yet, you're never bored for a minute.  How many filmmakers can accomplish this?  The claustrophobia serves as a quiet catalyst to justify Jeffries' efforts - in his ""plaster cocoon"" - to spy on his neighbors, becoming a sleuth and a snoop through sheer voyeurism.  Hitchcock never judges Jeffries' for spying on his neighbors (by association he would be judging the audience too). Hitchcock knows it's much more fun & interesting to abandon any taboo of Jeffries' actions and just let us all spy in on a man whose spying on everyone else.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's great gift in this film are the buried themes of feminism; virtually all of the female characters in this film are oppressed by men in some fashion (Miss Torso's randy guests, Miss Lonelyhearts' one futile date, Lisa's unheard pleas for marriage & stability, a helicopter hovering over nude sunbathers in the opening credits).  All of the women prevail in the end, but by interesting means.  In an odd move towards role reversals, the men are the creatures who spend the duration of the film analyzing & questioning everything, unsure of how to play the game; while the women are unusually aggressive.  Another fact that supports the feminism slant is, given the obvious phallic symbolism of Jeffries' telephoto lens, it could be interpreted that Jeffries spends the entire film seeing & thinking with his penis.  The feminism of the film exists slyly because it's never conscientiously examined by any of its characters.  The film is also testament that blood & guts or cats jumping into frame from nowhere are not the best ways to scare people.  I still get chills toward the end when Jeffries' stares at the sliver of light from the bottom of his front door and he can hear those footsteps coming towards him - that soon stop, to unscrew the light bulb in the hallway, and then proceed slowly towards his front door.  Whoo!  By 1954, Hitchcock still had plenty of steam & fire left in him, but by then he had already created his greatest masterpiece.  A spooky, scary movie."

The rear window through which he's gazing into the others have great resemblance to a computer screen!And don't you think that all the other windows they're just a prophetic allegory of microsoft stuff!

","Rear Window may have to battle Psycho, North By Northwest and Vertigo for the title of Hitchcock's best, but if suspense is the category, then Rear Window beats them all.  Truly one of the most perfectly staged movies of all time, Rear Window makes voyeurs of us all.  We spend the entire film looking through the eyes of Jimmy Stewart, and the result is one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements.  We are put so squarely in the action that Stewart's fears become our fears, and that classic scene with Grace Kelly across the courtyard numbs us with suspense. A recent re-mastering for DVD makes Rear Window more enjoyable now than it has been in forty five years.  An essential for all Hitchcock fans... For all movie fans."

"majove","Null","0","1","31 January 2001"," Great, but over-rated
","Im a huge Hitchcock fan, the guy's a visual genius; I mean for a director who can make films that still keep you biting your nails fifty years later cant be put down. But this film didn't REALLY do it for me, especially after Psycho (hope its spelt rite)and The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rope. Don't get me wrong, its still a four star film, but there was something missing, maybe I was expecting too much; but then I was expecting heaps from Psycho, and I was disappointed the first time, but the second time I was blown away completely - not so with Rear Window. I felt that Grace Kelly's role was just there for pathos when she got caught by Burr (and love interest)- I mean really, Thelma Ritter could have provided for the same situation but without sex appeal - ah theres the catch! But so it was for Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest you say? Not so, yes love interest and sex appeal had a part in her role, but she was also part of a vital plot swing. I think (personally) that that was a woefully unnecessary bit of casting and quite out of character with the master. My apologies to all Grace Kelly fans out there. That couldn't just be the reason why it didn't do it for me, in fact I don't know why it didn't do it for me. I think I WAS expecting too much. To me it seemed a bit stop-start, it seemed to go somewhere and get exciting, then drop off suddenly (especially when Kelly pranched onto the set with customary lack of personality), even the ending - just where it got you on the edge of your seat, it ended and I ejected the video feeling let down and disappointed, unlike other Hitchcock summersault endings where I'm simply begging for more. Maybe I'm just hard to please. But all said, it was a good film, a great film, just compared to his other work, not as fulfilling. I loved the set - it was the biggest ever made until the Ten Commandments, Alfie didn't like the lighting he got on location. It was well directed, scripted and acted and I liked the part where the film's music soundtrack was all from the muso's piano in his flat. He actually (as I learned from this site)became the voice for the Chipmunks!<br/><br/>Yeah, a good film, but besides in theory and creativity, not Hitchcock's best - although one of the directors personal favourites. Sorry Alfie."

To Hitchcock this was the purest way to tell a story in cinema.  The greatest film of all time for suspense, cinema, acting and the greatest Hitchcock."

","This is one of Hitchcock's best movies.  It is very original, and extremely well-acted by three of the best actors in history.<br/><br/>Jimmy Stewart plays a magazine photographer who's stuck in his apartment while his broken leg heals.  He spends his days peering out the rear window of his apartment into the open windows of the apartments across the courtyard.  He sees lots of life stories, parties, arguments, sex, just about everything that happens in real life.<br/><br/>One thing in particular catches his eye though.  He sees what he thinks may be a man (Raymond Burr) trying to clean up and hide evidence after murdering his own wife.  He doesn't witness the murder itself, so he spends the next few days, with the assistance of his Park Avenue girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his hard-nosed nurse (Thelma Ritter), trying to find enough evidence to prove it.<br/><br/>This move is a must-see for all Hitchcock and mystery fans.  Clearly one of the best ever!<br/><br/>I gave it 9 of 10."

Lisa, on the other hand, was a glamorous and gentle uptown lady who was in love with Jefferies.  She always tried to make him see that they were meant for each other, until she got caught up in all the chaos that was happening across the courtyard.  Since Jefferies was stuck in a wheelchair, Lisa became his legs.  She went to the apartment building and got the name off of the mailbox.  She also went into Mr. Thorwald's apartment and took his wife's wedding ring.  When he caught her in the bedroom, backed her into the living room. With her back against the window, she pointed out to Jefferies that she had the ring.  She wasn't only pointing out that she had the ring, but that she was ready to get married and she wanted him to know it.  I think the end was my favourite.

","*SPOILER*(You should really have seen the movie by now anyway)<br/><br/>My anwser that question is: Yes! I expected to see a movie with long tedious dialogue, but instead Rear Window is a movie filled with suspense and psychological threat. I thought that because the movie is more than 45 years old, there would be a real timebarier, but unlike ""The Birds"" in which I sometimes found the dialogues very tedious, this movie's dialogue is pretty fast-paced even by nowadays standards. The really interesting thing about the movie is the psychological aspect. At first the main character sees certain suspicious things and he(and with him the viewing audience) is convinced that the salesman has killed his wife. Then the detective negates almost all the evidence and the viewer is (almost) convinced that it's just the main character who WANTS to see a murder and therefore sees one. But in the end guess who's right... What also appealed to me is that the main character's girlfriend and his housekeeper area at first disgusted by him spying on the neighbours. But later on it is them who want to go look what's burried in the garden. It probably shows that we all have voyeuristic sides. Conclusion: A very good movie, which will always be up to date, because of the suspense that only Alfred Hitchcock could create."

He noticed a man (Mr. Thorwald) had been taking care of his sick wife in one of the apartments across from him.  Then one night Jack noticed a strange event occurring in the couple's apartment.  After hearing a woman scream, Jack hurried to the window to see who he had heard.   When Jack suspected Mr. Thorwald has murdered his wife, he tries to convince his girlfriend, Lisa, and the police that a murder really did occur.  Nights of peeping into the apartment lead Jack and Lisa to clues, which help to solve the exciting murder mystery.<br/><br/>This movie was very exciting and entertaining.  Just when I thought it was almost over, I realized that I was just reaching the climax of the movie.

After the police left, Mr. Thorwald went to Jack's apartment and tried to throw Jack out the window when the police barged in and took Mr. Thorwald away.
