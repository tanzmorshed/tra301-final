","Today when I was at my house alone, looking through my DVDs, trying to figure out which movie I should see for entertainment. I saw E.T and I hadn't seen it for nearly 3-4 years ago. I seen the film ever since I was 4 years old, so I wondering if I would still enjoy it when I'm an adult. As I was watching the film, I had this rush of nostalgia running through me, I was remembering the times when I was a kid with my family. The film didn't at all feel to childish to me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago. This film is a truly timeless film, and will always be remembered. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg films. (And that is no easy task) A Timeless Classic 10/10"

","The classic of family classics, 'E.T.' is a wonderful and heartfelt portrait of childhood exploring the friendship between Elliot, a young boy living in California, and an extra-terrestrial who gets accidentally left behind by his spaceship. From the multiple viewings during my childhood to the nostalgic sense of warmth I get from watching it nowadays, there is no way I can fault this science fiction masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films, 'E.T.' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history. A remarkable adventure that acts as both a touching family drama and an exciting sci-fi flick, and one that needs to be seen by all."
"squeezebox","Null","155","207","7 May 2004"," Still Blows Me Away to this Day
","E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.<br/><br/>The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.<br/><br/>What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.<br/><br/>E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL."
"Catherine_Grace_Zeh","10","86","115","21 December 2005"," Very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart and make you cry
","E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, in my opinion, is a very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart and make you cry. I really loved the magic that E.T. performed. If I could have, I would have helped him get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get him to safety, since I can't drive. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it."

","The first time I saw E.T was at the age of 12 and I cried.  Really cried. Six years later, I still cry at it.  The ability of this film to pull emotions out of you is unlike most films we see today.<br/><br/>As many of the users have said, this is a film made for children and it achieves this brilliantly.<br/><br/>I do feel as well that it targets adults, returnign them to their innocence. The time of our lives when mothing was impossible and everything had goodness in it.  In modern times it is all too often seen that children are desperate to become adults and lose their innocence far too quickly. This story in which S.S developed helps adults to return to that time.<br/><br/>I would give this film 11/10.  Anyone who feels that it is not heart warming and emotional, I think have been watching a totally different film!!!!!"
"baumer","10","132","190","14 May 2002"," One of the best films ever made and experienced
","Everyone gets lost in nostalgia from time to time.  Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.<br/><br/>
Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.<br/><br/>There was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.<br/><br/>When the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.<br/><br/>When you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the ""The Tripping Game"", therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.<br/><br/>E.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.<br/><br/>As the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br/><br/>Seeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.<br/><br/>I think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>If you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.<br/><br/>10 out of 10----What more can be said?"
"rattydukes","9","66","93","16 June 1999"," Powerful and unique
","Spielberg's powerful and remarkable film about a boy and his unusual befriendment of an extra terrestrial. Possibly his finest film, E.T. captures a piece of childhood, and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past. It excites a story adults often forget, and a powerful remembrance of a childhood friendship during difficult periods of development. Adult criticism of the movie loses its youthful bond, and fails to appreciate growing up in the 80's. This is the pinnacle of Spielberg's childhood movies. Few other films capture as powerful a message of childhood emotion. Other films which attempt to do so dive so deep into childhood memories they lose their connection with adults, and degrade to brief interludes of ""dumb"" comic relief to keep grown ups from falling asleep. The closest runner up is likely Goonies (a film written by Spielberg). A very personal film for Spielberg; as he explores atypical friendships after the separation of his father; he should be commended for achieving such a remarkable success and for sharing it with the rest of us. I was five when I first saw the movie, and although it frightened me at the time, it still makes me cry. An unparalleled film in its class, it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film (adjusted for inflation, third otherwise) seventeen years after its release. Cheers to Spielberg for not ruining the movie by attempting a sequel."
"TylerVanP","9","70","100","12 December 2005"," I love this film and believe that it is as timeless as it gets.
","This is Spielberg at his best. That is all I can say about E.T. IT's gripping, intelligent story mixed with its incredible symbolism makes it one of the best films ever made. E.T. is a story about friendship, loyalty, and family. But most of all it is about love, and how powerful love is. The brilliantly innovative shots mixed with John William's epic score makes for a masterpiece, which E.T. certainly is. The underlying theme of science vs. religion is also what makes the film great. All of these things mesh together to form the film that ""touched millions of people around the world."" Everything about this film is great. Steven Spielberg pulls off some legendary shots, and the acting from the children is excellent. It makes the film truly real. Henry Thomas as Elliot is great. Drew Barrymoore is so cute throughout he whole film and she captures the audience every time she appears on screen. Peter Coyote does great with the minimal screen time they chose to give him. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history, and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile, but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time. Its timelessness is one of a kind. Forget what you hear about it being overrated. See it for yourself and understand why this film is apart of a small collection of films that will stay in our hearts forever and ever."
"Hitchcoc","10","70","103","2 March 2006"," It's a Masterpiece
","There are those times when all the forces at work come together and you have a masterpiece. This, of course, is a kids' movie. Obviously, it is so much more. It is a story of love and heart and character. To begin with, as a middle school teacher, I can attest to the wonderful casting and writing. It doesn't insult us. It shows us how a person who knows the heart of humanity (and that extends to the alien nation) can transcend cliché and put forth a beautiful story--but not a lightweight one by any means. The adults make up the periphery. The childlike quality of the lovable alien could only be appreciated and cared for by those who have not become as jaded as they. As soon as those adult figures show up, everyone is in trouble. Yet, for the most part, they have good intentions. The government agents are another issue. They bring force and death.<br/><br/>Who hasn't seen this. There are series of episodes that have become part of our cultural landscape. Words have been brought into our language. We speak along with Elliot and ET. Halloween, phoning home, frogs all over the lab, hiding in the closet among the stuffed animals, the bike ride where the bikes suddenly leave the ground, the touching of the finger and the heart. It's just magical. Sometimes when one sees a movie, one begins to say, ""If only they had done this or that."" I can't think of anything in this film. Why write this review. Just to include my two cents' worth."

","Back in 1982 when ET first came out a patron of the library I work at told me that I HAD TO SEE THIS MOVIE,and to take a box of tissues with me. Bear in mind that this gentleman was a very urbane,if somewhat cynical college professor. Not the type I would have expected to recommend a film so highly.  I took his advise. THANK YOU HOWARD. Next to ""The day the earth stood still"" ET ranks as my favorite sci-fi film of all time. The newly inhanced version is excellent too.  Henry Thomas is delightful and the middle child ,Elliott who find and befriends ET. He is not ""too cute"",but gives a terrific performance,especially when ET telepathically makes him drunk.The end of the movie still makes me cry,maybe not a whole box of tissues worth by now,but there is just something about ET and Elliott's good bye that tears me up.The two principle adults, Dee Wallace(Stone) and Peter Coyote are good too.  Coyote, who is only known as ""Keys"" is in some respects almost as innocent as Elliott, and you wish that he had been able to have more contact with ET.  Although the scenes where the house is being sealed off is frightening, it still works. The scene where Elliot and his brother steal the van is priceless when older brother comes out with the memorable line ""I've never driven forward before!"" I am planning to buy this on DVD as soon as possible.  ET,you can phone my home or visit any time"

","Review:
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.
E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.
The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job.
With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.
Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.

"Leofwine_draca","8","9","11","29 December 2015"," Mawkish it may be, but it's a classic for a reason
","E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL was one of those films that everybody took for granted as a child in the 1980s. Everybody had seen it, everybody loved it, everybody could reference it with the other kids knowing what they were talking about. Finding myself less than impressed than Steven Spielberg's overt sentimentalism, I wondered how I'd find it as an adult...<br/><br/>Well, I needn't have worried, because E.T. still hits the mark. Yes, it's mawkish and rather dated, but I think that's all part of the fun. This is the classic kid's film of the 1980s, in which the adults are portrayed as either out of touch or the enemy; it's the kids who have to band together to fight for justice, and the template works very well here.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the character of E.T. himself is what makes this film. The Carlo Rambaldi special effects still stand the test of time and the voice mannerisms are just right. Henry Thomas has a tough role, acting against an non-human for the most part, but he excels in the part and the frog scene is still excellent. Drew Barrymore is very effective too. E.T. is certainly a film that still manages to tug at the heartstrings with all of the increasing drama and that poignant ending, and I love it just as much as I always did."
"Agent10","10","51","83","21 May 2002"," E.T. = exceptionally tremendous
","If it wasn't for all of the babies crying in the theater, the reissue of this great movie would have been a better experience. While some will call ET nothing more than a sappy kid's movie, I feel this film brings much more to the table. The compassion, the acceptance, and the eventual paranoia surrounding ET made this film something to enjoy. With the remastered soundtrack, the experience proved to be even more breathtaking, adding more power and magistry to a film I thoroughly enjoyed as a kid. However, some of the remastered special effects were unnecessary,  especially the guns- turned-walkie talkies effect Spielberg employed. I mean, what stubborn, rebellious kid is going to be afraid of walkie talkies? They should have just kept the guns. When this one comes out on DVD, I'll just pretend the special edition never happened."

","I was just unaware of anything with which the Film's past is related i.e. copied from the Alien, when I watched the movie.
I just heard the movie's name for the First time and when it was from Steven, ears preaked somewhat up, and when saw it is LIKE the movie ""Koi mil gaya"", a Bollywood movie which I loved, ears finally preaked up.<br/><br/>And I just saw today.
First, the thing that I most loved before watching the movie, is the Poster.
This movie's poster in which Human and the Alien's fingers are getting touched is shown and in the second one in which the Kid riding on the bike and the silhouette of them are being shown by the moon behind, was great ( I am feeling that I have seen such thing somewhere )<br/><br/>But about the Movie, I was tied with it.
Has Steven got something called 'Emotions' in his every movies ?
I felt the same when I watched his A.I. movie. ( Again the Abbreviation ! )<br/><br/>But in this movie, I literally cried.
I literally cried.
Yes, I'm not a kid who enjoys the movie and cries when something sad happens in the movie but being an adult, I just cried.
The team has beautifully shot those scenes when the researchers are trying to discover from the alien's body.
The whole sequence maybe lasts long for about 20 mins and I cried 20 mins.<br/><br/>Very beautifully shot those scenes - But when they stopped my from crying was when the boy opens up the cabin, and the alien laughs and says - ""Please Phone Home "" , yes that was very expected that the makers will not leave the movie in this way and the alien was supposed to get up, but in the way the alien (Sorry E.T.) shouted and told was very hitting moment.<br/><br/>Some other factors :
<ul><li>Hey, wait, was E.T. a 3-D model ? ( Obviously, But how realistic in that time !! )</li><li>Flying VFX shots ( Ok, can't say !! )</li></ul><br/><br/>But whatever you say, this movie has something to say.
This movie can be 'Experienced' all time."

And no matter whether the commenters liked it or not, the consensus was that it's a ""kids"" thing and that it's sentimental, both which happened to sound very appealing to me, so that I even overlooked the cynics' comments. I mean, I like kid's movies like Home Alone, and I'm a sentimental schmuck - I loved Heart and Souls. SO I decided to watch this thinking I wouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I was disappointed. I'm still not sure why. The movie sort of dragged, making me feel bored. And I found myself way too detached from the movie than I was supposed to be. A very bad experience which proves this: I was watching this scene with the flying bike, the music was beautiful and soaring, and I was saying to myself, ""Now this is supposed to be a great moment,"" and I repeated some comment like that too at the last few scenes of the movie. The problem was, the moment I thought that, I knew whatever great moment it was supposed to be, I didn't feel that way. And that was how the whole movie was for me."
"charlieliddle","9","9","12","11 April 2016"," More magical than Harry Potter
","E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is a magical film and one of the best movies Steven Spielberg has made. The acting is tremendous all- around. The kid acting is especially great. Drew Barrymore and Henry Thomas's performances are probably some of the best kid acting ever in a movie. Really the only other great kid actor I can think of is Haley Joel Osment for roles in The Sixth Sense, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and many others. Everything you could want in a good family Spielberg movie is in E.T. There's great acting, smart writing, beautiful use of cinematography, good lighting with Spielberg's famous shadow work, an amazing musical score by John Williams, and, of course, there is plenty of memorable moments and what is often referred to today as the ""Spielberg magic"". The whole movie is a masterpiece, but I did find a few flaws that I tried to overlook but couldn't because they just brought down my enjoyment of the film too much. The first few minutes of the movie are really slow. There isn't dialogue for at least about five minutes in the film. Many people would say that that's a certain style that benefits the film. I wanted the movie to get to the point a little bit quicker, and I think the slightly longer exposition didn't help. There were a few other knit-picks here and there, but I won't get too deep into that."
"SpaceMonkey-Mafioso","9","9","12","26 January 2004"," The greatest live action family movie EVER.
","But, It's more than just that. Spielberg perfectly combined the magic of childhood with the magic of 70's/80's science fiction. The result: pure 80's pop poetry. Perhaps like no other film, this film completely captures what it was like to be a child in 1980's American Suburbia; I should know- being the same age as Drew Barrymore. For many, it's too sentimental (as if that was a deadly sin.) Maybe that's why ET gets no respect in the 21st century. Spielberg's other magic sci-fi masterpiece from the period(Close Encounters) receives the same lack of respect. It's also a hopeful film that is meant to awe, not scare or depress. Have we become so cynical in the last twenty years that we seriously consider movies(as good as they may be) like Trainspotting and Heat to be superior to two of Spielberg's best? I hope it hasn't come to that."

Everytime I watch this MOVIE it makes me feel like a little kid again. It's very entertaining sweet and cool. Still there is one thing I have to mention. Steven Spielberg brought out a special DVD version of this movie. Which is called ET the special edition. It's still the same fabulous movie we all know. They just improved on 12% of the special effects and also included a never-before-seen fun and interesting scene where you learn ET can breathe underwater.

","E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Steven Spielberg's timeless ode to all the loners of the world, finds him at his most pure. The storyline of E.T. is a relatively simple one: Ten-year-old Elliott (Henry Thomas, who never resorts to that ""oh-look-at-how-precious-I-am"" shtick but makes you root for him through his incredible performance), who lives with his mom and two siblings, meets a wizened little geezer who turns out to be a visitor from another planet. E.T., owing to his overtly curious streak, is abandoned by his pot-bellied otherworldly pals as he misses his ride back home. He now has to cope on Earth until they can come back and rescue him. Being a friendly extraterrestrial ambassador, Elliott and E.T. soon form a special bond and Elliott, with help from his siblings, helps E.T. find a way home. And soon the magic unfolds! Along the way there are moments of humor as E.T. makes discoveries about this world and the children learn things about him; moments of sadness when E.T. becomes deathly ill and is captured by the scientists; and a thrilling chase sequence that will have you cheering along. When Elliott and his friends soar on their bicycles against a gigantic moon, it's as touching and note-perfect a moment as any in the movies. <br/><br/>Spielberg's 'lovable-space-creature-slums-it-in-suburbia' movie is one of the greatest achievements in imagination ever put on film. The simplicity of the narrative and the ingeniousness of the E.T. character create a powerful combination. The genius and wonder of E.T. is that Spielberg creates a character that is obviously not real. However, he draws the audience in so well that you care for him as much as you do for the children. What the movie does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away. This is a wondrous evocation of that time in our lives when brothers and sisters were necessary co-conspirators, bikes were our ticket to freedom and we were willing to believe that a friendly little alien could really appear from the backyard shed. While doing so, Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us, never failing to strum the heartstrings. <br/><br/>Many have hailed E.T. as a bona-fide sci-fi classic. For me, it is a heart and soul movie that just happens to have a sci-fi angle. And you know what? You're sure going to need a box of tissues!"

","Firstly, I cant believe that poor old E.T. isn't getting a better showing in the rankings than the high sevens - its a beautiful gem of a film and deserves to be at least a high eight.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is one of those films made by Spielberg that helps to cement his status as the premiere fairy tale teller of all (film) time.<br/><br/>The simple premise that not all aliens want to rip out our spines of lay chest bursters inside us a kill all our friends is a concept that has not been returned to since (apart from the dismal Cocoon).<br/><br/>This is probably because nobody will ever be able to recreate the intense emotional journey that Spielberg has portrayed.  THe heart wrenching scenes between Elliot and E.T. at the end of the film will go to prove the exqisitely realised genuinity of the love and friendship that develops and actually exists (I mean that Henry Thomas - ELiiot - came to love the puppet as if he were real) is what makes everything in life worth it.<br/><br/>Full of warm moments, clever touches and humour, E.T. is an absolutely essential watch for all fim fans.<br/><br/>Timeless. 9/10"

","""This movie made my heart glad."" - Roger Ebert, film critic and gourmet.<br/><br/>They say that the path to a fat man's heart goes through his over-sized belly, but sometimes the digested waste product of one called Spielberg can achieve the same result.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I wanted to take a whiff of Spielberg's brown monster as much as the next kid. And I wasn't disappointed. I was only a clueless little brat at the time, what the hell did I know about cheesy Hollywood manipulation that makes you close your eyes (and nose) to the nonsense that surrounds the story of Spielberg's brown monster? However, many years later, and I discover that it's not all that it's CRACKed up to be. Plenty of stained holes in the script, and near every hole there's SBM sitting like the badly choreographed creature that it always was. A dumb kid called Elliott discovers SBM and goes all gooey and sentimental in no time. I didn't get it this time around: why would anyone in their right mind want to go anywhere near this film? It has a stench not unlike that of an over-crowded pig-sty.<br/><br/>The main culprit for the bad taste left in my mouth after taking a sample of Spielberg's brown monster was not the midgety dinosaur himself. It was the annoying kids and the retarded clichés. First we have Drew Barrymore whose facial asymmetry was apparent as early as 1982. Think about it. And then think about what it means to be nepotistic offspring in Hollywood: it opens doors even for the least talented and least good-looking among us. Spielberg, who fathered the brown monster in one of his less-than-inspired bathroom moments, is also Drew's godfather. Not to mention all those relatives of hers, all infamous for their shoddy B-movie starring roles. All in the family... But I'm sure that Drew will always look back at this movie with fondness, knowing that it was E.T. that launched her nose into the seductive world of cocaine.<br/><br/>So Elliott discovers SBM, invites it to his home, hides it from his parents (instead of flushing it, like any normal boy would), and then the evil adults and the government's wicked, knife-happy scientists kidnap SBM from right under his nose, hoping to anal-probe SBM as soon as possible. What exactly they'd hoped to find in SBM is beyond me. Clues to the director's digestive system? Judging from ET, the maker of ""Jaws"" ate some rather strange foods in the early 80s...<br/><br/>I will never understand the age-old movie cliché of the snip-happy scientists raring to have a stab at the noble alien creature, as if killing a one-of-a-kind specimen made any sense to even the most deranged sociopath, let alone an intelligent scientist.<br/><br/>The other pathetic cliché is all of the kids being wise and good, the adults stupid and evil. Well, if that's the case, then why don't we put the little ones in charge of Wall Street and the economy? I think we should start by appointing Spielberg's own brood to run the White House... I do not doubt for a second that this would lead to a Utopic future society of almost Spielbergian proportions.<br/><br/>""The creature, which looks a little like Snoopy..."" - Roger Ebert, film critic and dog expert.<br/><br/>I've read my share of Peanuts comics, but struggle to find any character there that even vaguely resembles the monster. But then again, Ebert also called this movie ""scary"", so why wonder...<br/><br/>Yes, and why wonder that Spielberg, of all people, should create such a brown monster. After all, he once told Barbra Streisand that ""Yentl"" was the best movie he'd seen since ""Citizen Kane""."

","I hate you Steven Speilberg.<br/><br/>You're one of the few directors who can make a movie that after all of these years, still makes me cry.<br/><br/>E.T. is a true classic that stands the test of time. It's a movie about a boy who's parents are divorced, and befriends a loveable alien who is lost after his family leave without him. Both go through a change in each other's personality and life, as the boy (Named Elliot.) must learn to share his new friend with others, while making sure his Mother (Played EXCELLENTLY by Dee Wallace Stone, as usual when she acts in films.) doesen't know that he is keeping that special alien with him. Sure, there are some disturbing scenes, but the good outweighs the bad here. When this came out, I was only 4 years old, and it has truly affected me. I was amazed by this film when I was young, and still am now. To me, this is the greatest film of all time.Yes, I like this more than Star Wars, The Godfather, Titanic, and other films that have achieved greatness. Why? Because it affected me in such a way back then, and still does now-a-days.<br/><br/>I still cry when I watch this movie. I'll admit it. I still cry.

","""You know what I saw recently? Munich. I hate it, all this false complexity. But I'm not always dismissing Spielberg. A much better film cinematographically is his previous one, War of the Worlds. I like its dark, grainy atmosphere. His films are all variations on the story of paternity rediscovered, his big obsession. The tragedy of Spielberg is that he's much closer to what we call ""art"" when he's doing what he probably thinks are commercial projects."" – Slavoj Zizek<br/><br/>""Film is my drug and every few months I need a new fix."" - Steven Spielberg<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""ET: the Extraterrestrial"" stars Henry Thomas as Elliot, a kid living in suburban California. As his parents have separated, Elliot's a bit depressed. Thankfully Elliot befriends a small alien creature, whom he dubs 'ET'. Like Elliot, ET's name starts with an E and ends with a T. More importantly, ET's also been abandoned by his parents. This separation leads to ET's body becoming pale and sickly. ET eventually dies, but is magically resurrected when his parents return. ""ET phone home!"" ET triumphantly says. The message is clear. For Spielberg, himself the son of divorced parents, the family unit has the power to heal and nourish.<br/><br/>The motif running through all of Spielberg's key films is that of the recovery of the father figure. In ""ET"", both Elliot and the alien are abandoned by their fathers. ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Hook"", ""AI"", ""Minority Report"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""Indiana Jones"" and ""War of The Worlds"" likewise all focus on parental abandonment. ""Jurassic Park"" itself begins with child hating archaeologist, Dr Alan Grant, threatening kids with a raptor bone (a symbol of the paternal superego). Only later, in a very brief scene, does Grant throw away this bone. At this point he suddenly becomes a father and reconciles with the children. As he nestles in a tree, cradling the sleeping kids in his arms, the predatory dinosaurs of the night slowly morph into benevolent herbivores the following morning.<br/><br/>Philosopher Slavoj Zizek would himself call ""Schindler's List"" an ""ugly remake of Jurassic Park"", with the Nazis as the dinosaur monsters, Schindler as the cynical-profiteering and opportunistic parental figure and the infantilized ghetto Jews as threatened children. The story the film tells is not about the Holocaust, but about Schindler's gradual rediscovery of his paternal duty towards the Jews. His transformation into a caring and responsible father, echoes Sam Neil's character arc in ""Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>The same story is repeated in ""Duel"", in which a weak and effeminate father must battle demon trucks in order to assert his masculinity and reclaim his marriage, and again in ""The War of the Worlds"", in which Tom Cruise plays a divorced working class father who neglects his two children. The invasion of the aliens reawakens in him the ""proper paternal instincts"", resulting in him rediscovering himself as a caring father. In the final scene he finally gets recognition from his son who, throughout the film, despised him. <br/><br/>So at their core, Spielberg's films are all ""the story of a divorced or working class father who strives to regain the respect of his children"". Sometimes this tale is told from the perspective of the child, sometimes it is told from the perspective of the adult. In each case it's the same story.<br/><br/>Mostly, though, Spielberg's cinema is a cinema of ""trauma avoidance"". The reason's for Daddy (or state/nation/leader) being a jerk are suppressed and the crisis of masculinity is repaired or avoided via Daddy's battles with fantasy monsters (nazis, sharks, dinosaurs, trucks etc). In short, power and patriarchy are rehabilitated via fantasy.<br/><br/>One can see similar ""trauma avoidance"" in ""ET"", a film which posits fantasy as an imagined escape from pain. In the film, Elliott's broken family is not in any real sense repaired, or its brokenness even explored as a truly solvable emotional problem. Instead, the film uses aliens to provide a false emotional closure. <br/><br/>In ""ET"", the little alien becomes a mediator who provides a substitute father, only to disappear and ""go home"" once Elliot's mother embraces the good scientist (and new father?) in the final shot. As Spielberg's art is always about avoidance and not confrontation, daddy's absence is never resolved or investigated, and so his creepy rehabilitation must be repeated, over and over again, from one film to the next. Whether it be young Elliot in ""ET"" or Chris Bale in ""Empire of the Sun"", Spielberg's fantasies palliate traumatic human experiences (divorce, war, slavery, terrorism, Holocaust etc) by offering viewers the film's imaginative plenitude as a compensation for its characters' emotional losses. <br/><br/>But despite all this, almost everything in ""ET"" works. The film oozes raw, naked emotions and never pretends to offer anything other than a child's knee-high perspective, which Spielberg's shooting strategy reinforces. Autobiographical to the core, the film perfectly reflects its author, a man who has made a career of avoiding painful truths by indulging in fantasy. It's once these personality traits are married to external issues (Munich, Amistad, Ryan etc), that you get profoundly untruthful junk.<br/><br/>8/10 - Would spawn a whole genre of ""suburban kids' adventures""."

He doesn't know where he's at, he has nowhere to go....until Ellliot finds him, and gives a home, a secret kept from his divorced mother. The film is happy and sadness melded into one. The film is almost all magical, along with the music, the story, the cinematography, and the humor. The story mainly revolves around trying to keep ET safe from enemies ( and there's plenty of those) along with trying to find a way to get him back home. I can't see anyone not liking this movie."

","With Summer fast approaching, and nostalgia always in the media zeitgeist, I always find myself returning to the masterful works of directors in the 80s. Sure, it is usually out of a desperate want to return to the age of innocence, a time of playing tag with the neighborhood friends, or racing bikes down the street with cards taped to the wheels. But the days are far gone or slipping further and further away. So, I turn to Spielberg or Carpenter or Donner (the list goes on, of course). And nothing so eloquently plays with childhood discovery and the pressure of adulthood better than E.T. If you haven't seen it, or you remember it as a kids film, be sure to revisit it sometime soon. It is truly a director working at their own peak."
"andyman618","4","22","43","13 August 2003"," Overly sentimental and manipulative tripe
","I dislike E.T. because ever time I watch it, I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated by a series of cutesy images, plot mechanisms that defy logic, and a score that is WAY over the top.<br/><br/>E.T. is supposed to be an intelligent being, capable of interstellar travel, but in this movie, he is relegated to the role, basically, of a child, and acts as such. I guess that's part of the point of the movie: the parallels between E.T. and Elliot (yes, I know: Elliot's initials are ET). That they are each lost and lonely, one in his own world, the other in a place far from home. But even understanding that does not make this movie any more palatable to me.  I guess I wanted a more mature treatment of the little guy.<br/><br/>An example of the plot doing this movie in for me is arguably the most famous scene from this movie: the flying bicycles. The whole movie E.T. has presumably been in great danger of discovery, and is apparently unable to help himself. But when he and the kids are being chased on their bikes, not only is he able to levitate Elliot's bike, but all the rest of them, too! Sorry, but my reaction to that was `Where the HECK did that come from?' (For the record, and so you don't think I'm completely heartless, I do love the image of the bikes in front of the moon).<br/><br/>Lastly is John Williams' overpowering score. When I listen to his music as part of a movie, I feel like I'm being hit over the head with a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>All right, so I'm an ogre for not liking E.T., and my children will doubtless grow up to be delinquents, but it's the way I feel.  I do think he took the easy way out in creating something with broad appeal: he did it not through character development and growth, but through a series of cute images and gimmicks."

However, despite my age and my ZERO memories of the movie I had no false expectations. I didn't expect a dark sci-fi tale, I didn't expect logic, I didn't expect breathtaking action of any sort. What I DID expect was a cute, funny and somewhat sugary 80's kiddy fairy tale about a boy and his new alien friend. So what went wrong? The movie starts and we wait, and we wait, and we wait. Then a glimpse of the alien! Then we wait and wait and wait while the boy tries meeting him. Then we wait and wait and wait while the boy tries communicating with the alien. NOW we wait and wait and wait while the ALIEN tries to communicate with the boy. And in about an hour the EVIL ADULTS come forth and take the alien thus starts the quest to save it. Still awake? Still interested to watch this ""classic""? Well if the awful pacing of the movie isn't something bad for you the lack of any entertainment value and the overdose of cuteness will do the trick.<br/><br/>The movie simply isn't fun. The humor is okay for a movie of its kind but I can only remember 2 or 3 mildly fun scenes in the film and they aren't exactly ""classic"" material. The characters are boring and way too cute and politically correct for my tastes. It's your classic ""Awwwwww"" movie and I can handle a certain amount of cuteness alright, (I've seen ALL Disney animation films), but this movie went overboard. Each scene which involves the 3 kids and the alien, (especially when Drew is around), all you see is kids with their mouths wide open, (the Spielberg look like a reviewer cleverly commented), then the alien does something ""funny"" or full of sensitivity and Awwwwww or if you are like me ARRRGGGH!!! Well I'm 29 years old and I did shed a tear with Toy Story 3. I did laugh my ass with Back to The Future and I enjoyed the similarly dumb Gremlins. While watching E.T. I could see the strings that Spielberg tried to pull with my bare eyes. I'm sure he masterfully managed to manipulate a lot of 5-9 year olds into loving this crap but honestly how on earth did this film managed to become such a huge phenomenon??? The child in me died you say? Good riddance!!!<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Rent a Disney movie instead (1/10)<br/><br/>[+] Good special effects for its time [-] Very slow paced.

The nostalgia was like nothing I have experienced watching a movie before. I woke up the next morning wanting to immerse myself into this universe. There's just something so completely innocent about it. Makes me want to be a kid again. There's something about getting older that makes you appreciate being a kid, and this is really one of those movies that makes you feel that way.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really extraordinary on a technical level. Seeing it as an adult you pick up on some of the stuff that just doesn't really appeal to you anymore. That's another great thing about the movie though, it appeals to both kids and adults. It reminds me of the Lion King a bit in that sense. You are more prone to pick up on some of the logical flaws in the movie as an adult, whereas when you were a kid it may have been something you enjoyed. Usually I am pretty strict when it comes to how I review movies. If this one didn't reach to me on a personal level so much, I'd probably give it an 8/10 or so. But it's great this movie is able to bring what could have been a mediocre one into such an amazing classic.<br/><br/>There are a few reasons it really works. First, the acting by the young cast is excellent, especially from Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore, who seems to have always been a natural at acting. It's really great how the movie is from their vantage point throughout the entire movie. Secondly, the music is absolutely brilliant and chilling.

","1982's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is a movie for the ages and an instant classic. Watching this movie again gave me the feels of nostalgia. This film was an important part of my childhood and now as an adult, this movie is still nothing but exceptional filmmaking. This is a movie that is perfect for the entire family and it is a story that both adults and children can relate to. The central theme is about a lonely child finding a new friend. By the time the credits roll on your screen, there will not be a dry eye in the house. This is the kind of enchanting and magical film we have here.<br/><br/>E.T was directed by the great Steven Spielberg whom we know as the director of famed films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He ventured into more family-friendly territory with this movie. He made the movie a parallel to his own childhood. As a child in 1960, Spielberg's parents divorced thus leaving him quite lonely as well as a tormentor turned protector toward his younger siblings-things that we see clearly in the characters portrayed on screen. Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison were able to take these childhood elements and effectively show how painful/wonderful growing up can be.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a bunch of alien botanists on Earth, but they rush to leave when discovered by a human task force. Unfortunately, one little alien is left behind. The alien is now left alone to fend for himself on a very strange planet. He soon meets 10-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas), whose parents just separated. They soon become friends. E.T dearly misses his home and tries to send a message to his folks back home while becoming acquaintances with Elliot's mother, Mary (Dee Wallace), brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Soon, E.T becomes seriously ill.....and so does Elliot thanks to their special bond. When the task force finally intrudes, it may be hard for E.T to join his people again.<br/><br/>I remember when first seeing the movie, I was not impressed with Henry Thomas's performance. Now years later, I come to appreciate his performance. As far as child actors go, Thomas is one of the better ones. Speaking of child actors, Barrymore is very adorable here. She became a big movie star, but this is the role I know her by. If E.T was played by a human, I would say this performance was excellent. The alien was voiced by Pat Welsh, who apparently smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, thus creating the perfect voice for E.T.<br/><br/>I loved the look of E.T. The little alien looks perfectly grotesque but he also looks very cuddly. His eyes are a standout and I like the way he can raise his neck. The way the alien uses sound is also memorable. The catlike purring, those child-like squeals of surprise, etc. Speaking of the looks, the visuals of the film are fantastic! The one scene that stays with me in the bicycle chase/flying scene. Set to the sweeping, magical music of John Williams, you feel the magic as we watch E.T help the children avoid the cops chasing after them.<br/><br/>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial is the reason why we go to the movies. To escape from our realities and join a world that is filled with magic and emotion. Steven Spielberg created a narrative achievement unlike ever seen before. A family film designed to make you feel, think, and get lost in this world. Every time I finish the movie, there are tears running down my face. Sorry Gandhi, but this film should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Solid performances, great visuals, an alien you will never forget, one of John Williams's best scores are just few of the many great things this movie has to offer. Also fun fact! Reeses Pieces became my favorite candy thanks to this movie! Thank you, Elliot for leaving trail of this delicious candy to use as bait for our favorite alien!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

I was in my dad's arms as we joined the long line who had come that night to see the newest Steven Spielberg film. I suppose I have Speilberg to thank first for my undying love of films.<br/><br/>What Spielberg created from a script by Melissa Mathison was to me pure movie magic and a film with one of the biggest hearts in film history. A young boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas) has found an alien and almost right from the start they have an especially deep connection. Elliot finds that he must assist his new friend and try to send him back to his own planet.<br/><br/>Amazing direction and storytelling mixed with great visuals and interesting sounds. John Williams also has a fabulous score that really belongs among the conversation about the best movie scores of all time. ET won four Oscars including Sound, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Music. Carlo Rambaldi as well gets a big thumbs up from me as he grabbed an Oscar for his work on ET. He had previously a few years earlier had worked on Ridley Scott's ALIEN and did work on the head of that alien. Two very different aliens though. The effects of the alien in this film are great and kids should love it.<br/><br/>This film also was not just a little influential for the TV show STRANGER THINGS. ET was a monster of a flowing river of inspiration to that show. When it came out it was the highest-grossing film of all time until Spielberg outdid himself in 1993 with JURASSIC PARK.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great as well especially from the kids. Elliot has two siblings in Michael (Robert McNaughton) and Gertie (Drew Barrymore). It is to me through these three kids that the film must be carried when ET is off screen. They do a great job and bring quite believable performances. Also starring Dee Wallace as their mom, Peter Coyote and C. Thomas Howell in his film debut.<br/><br/>On a final note I also owned the Atari game ET when I was a kid. Sorry, but awesome film, terrible game. It was one of the most frustratingly bad games I had ever played. Whenever I played the game it was out of the console within five minutes so that I could play a much better game like SPACE INVADERS."
"slightlymad22","10","2","2","9 April 2018"," Takes Me Back To My Childhood, Every Single Time
","Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to E.T.<br/><br/>Alongside Field Of Dreams, this is a movie guaranteed to make me cry every single time I watch it. I don't know what it is, but I automatically become 5 years old every time I watch it. It is seriously flawed (My 12-year-old ripped it to shreds) but I can't hate anything about it. <br/><br/>Lots more product placement and Daddy issues<br/><br/>The end of the film was one of the most significant musical experiences for John Willims. After several attempts were made to match the score to the film, Spielberg took the film off the screen and told Williams to conduct the orchestra the way he would at a concert. He did, and Spielberg re-edited the film to match the music, which is unusual since the music is normally edited to match the film. The result was Williams deservedly winning the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Score.<br/><br/>E.T was the number 1 movie of 1982, as it grossed $359 million at the domestic box office (beating Tootise (2nd) an Officer & A Gentleman (3rd) and Rocky 3 (4th). Giving Spielberg back to back number 1's and his third no 1 movie of the year, making him the most successful (box office wise) of all the people I have done this for."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","2","24 February 2018"," E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is the epitome of 80s family adventure.
","Consistently referenced in modern day films, a pop cultural phenomenon and rated highly as one of Spielberg's best. Unsurprisingly, I can see why! It has stood the test of time. A young boy encounters a small alien who is accidentally left on Earth. He decides to keep the alien and assist it in contacting its home so that it can return safely with its race. Think of E.T. as an sci-fi symphony. Spielberg is the maestro, waving his camera around succinctly to create a visual narrative. Each section of the orchestra is an emotion. We've got happiness, laughter, bewilderment and even sadness. Spielberg unites these feelings to create a melodic film that encompasses each emotion perfectly. I still do believe he is one of the best directors for this very reason. He is a visionary master. If he wants to make a family adventure that all audiences can enjoy, well...he's going to. And he does so consistently well. He is able to embed themes of maturity, friendship and motherhood to enhance the meaning behind the glorious practical effects. The telepathic connection between E.T. and Elliott enables Spielberg to harness imagination and utilise it for creative control. Extremely effective towards the end where illness befalls, to which I'm sure will bring a tear to your eye. The acting was consistently good, especially from the child actors. Liked how the story was told through Elliott's perspective, to which the majority of adults are hidden from view. John Williams' score once again accompanies Spielberg's vision and complements the film euphorically to create some memorable pieces of music, such as the moment Elliott's bicycle soars through the night sky. Because I'm late to the E.T. party, I have seen very similar films so I was not as astounded as one may have been back in 1982. Nostalgia definitely plays a big part in the acclaim for E.T. however, it's a competently made family blockbuster that may seem small in scale but will deliver big emotions."
"nmholland","9","2","2","9 March 2016"," Another Spielberg Masterpiece; A Gift to Children and Adults
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is directed by Steven Spielberg and is the story of an alien accidentally abandoned on Earth by his parents. He soon meets a little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, and the two strike up a quick friendship. Elliott's older brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) also meet the little alien, and befriend him. However, they soon realize they aren't the only ones who know about E.T., which pits the three children against none other than the U.S. government.<br/><br/>This film is know as a masterpiece, and it's not quite hard to see why. Spielberg has made many cherished films throughout his lifetime, including Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). However, E.T. is his only film directed mostly towards children, and boy he nailed it. This movie isn't just about a little dumb alien that gets himself into small altercations, this movie's about childhood, and what it means to have a true friend, whether he be a person or an alien. E.T. is also about family hardships, including tough relationships with siblings, or even divorce. E.T. can be loved by kids, or by adults, and that's not a quality easily achievable.<br/><br/>This film has many things to offer, and quite possibly the best one is, as mentioned above, the underlying themes. All of the kids in this film are dealing with their parents splitting up, and their dad lying about where he currently is to all of them. This can be related to be lots of people, mostly because of the diversity of ages between the children. Michael is about 16, Elliott's around 10, and Gertie's roughly 4. This variety of ages allows almost anybody to relate to the parental divorce factor given throughout E.T.<br/><br/>Another theme this movie offers is the tough connection between siblings, most abundant between Michael and Elliott. Towards the beginning of the film, Michael and all of his friends poke fun at Elliott claiming he saw an alien in the back yard. Although they see it as a harmless joke, Elliott takes offense to it, even calling one of Michael's friends a slightly crude, yet hilarious, name. Later, after Michael has been confirmed the existence of the alien, his friends make fun of Elliott at a bus stop, asking which planet the ""goblin"" came from. Michael quickly jumps to his brother's defense, without even thinking of what his friends may think of him afterwards. This a great example of brotherhood, that can be related to by young children, teenagers, or adults.<br/><br/>Now, for the more technicality of the film. The direction is amazing. As always, Spielberg does a perfect job directing the movie, and getting every shot just right. The acting is great as well. Henry Thomas as Elliott is one of the best child performances of all time, thanks to the emotion he shows through caring for E.T. Drew Barrymore also does really well, especially considering she's four years old in this film. Not that she has the biggest part, or the most lines, but the scenes she is in are lightened up by her line delivery and all around adorableness. Robert Macnaughton as Michael and Dee Wallace as their mother, Mary, also deliver pretty good performances.<br/><br/>Now, if someone went back and watched 1977's Star Wars, or even it's sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), they wouldn't be able to spot a single shot that looks bad, as far as CGI goes. However, going back and watching this movie, a few of the shots, especially of the spaceship, look pretty fake. Keep in mind, this film came out in 1982, five years after Star Wars (1977) and two years after The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and some of the CGI just doesn't hold up. There are more than a few times that E.T. had some obvious green screen going on, either with the spaceship of the flying bikes (we all remember that part, right). However, this is the only negative this film has or will ever have.<br/><br/>Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a straight up masterpiece. Many films have tried to copy this movie, including Earth to Echo (2014), and even some elements of the film Super 8 (2011), but none have ever succeeded. Thanks to it's amazing acting, fantastic themes, and great direction, E.T. gets an A, or a 9 out of 10."
"Theo Robertson","4","35","79","15 January 2005"," It's Not That Good
","In terms of box office bucks this was the most successful film ever . It might have made even more if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of people including myself hadn't watched it on pirate video in 1983 . In truth I don't think it deserved to set the universe alight because of its premise ET starts with a spaceship landing in a desolate woodland one dark night . Now spaceships landing in desolate woodlands on a dark night mean only one thing , if you've seen an episode of THE OUTER LIMITS or DOCTOR WHO or UFO it means trouble for humanity with the human race losing some brave warriors at the very least . You see the problem ? The narrative has just started and already we know nothing horrible is going to happen . This is not what alien landings are about , there not about monsters with extendable necks being vulnarable - They're about carnage , gunfire , explosions and lines like "" We can't hold them sir "" <br/><br/>If anyone thinks I'm missing the point let me say this: Spielberg's first movie was a pseudo horror movie called DUEL a fairly effective thriller ( Casting aside ) about a man driving through desert wilderness . Spielberg then made SOMETHING EVIL a chilling horror film and then made JAWS another legendary quasi horror movie with a monster that exits in reality a great white shark . JURASSIC PARK is to all intents a horror movie , and I bet the upcoming WAR OF THE WORLDS will get a few pulses racing . In other words Spielberg despite his flaws can make an audiences heart leap out of their mouth but his main flaw is that he all too easily drowns an audience in gooey sentimentality . THE TERMINAL suffered from this and so did parts of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , and without doubt ET is the best example of Spielberg's sugary sentiment suffocating a story , not that there was much of a story to start with . And I haven't even mentioned the all American kids or the ridiculous flying bikes sequence or the terrible John Williams score . The only significance ET has in my life is that it introduced me to the words "" Geek "" "" Wimp "" and "" Douce-bag "" and that I had to watch nearly every sci-fi movie of the mid to late 1980s revolve around a plot of a cute alien being adopted by a child . Give me THE THING and LIFEFORCE anytime"

","OK, admit it now. You HATE this film, but you were afraid to say it.Insipid and idiotic, not to mention intelligence insulting, this is one of the worst movies I ever saw. The corny old children's film of a boy and his dog{or horse} has been updated to a boy and his alien.Typical 80s style family where boy finds shipwrecked alien and his attempts to get him home. No real emotion or drama {or science fiction}just a ""Hallmark"" greeting card turned into plasticised ""touchy feely"" film. The alien ET is just an animatronic figure like you see at Disneyland and was not too convincing. Once a fine director, Spielberg sold it out for money and all those ET products like pajamas, talking dolls, costumes, Reeses Pieces, bikes and other tie-ins just left a bitter taste in my mouth. Shamelessly manipulative to say the lease. As is, just OK for kids, but even todays children will be able to see through it. They say the movies have become ""dumbed downed"" these days. ET is the one that started the trend. I quess that Mencken was right when he said ""nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of America."" ET is proof positive. The film that started Speilbergs descent into mediocrity, a place he still occupies today.If this is the kind of film that brings tears to your eyes, get a life! I know that I am going to get a lot of heat for this review, but I give this saccharine film a Zero Star rating.Yeah, it really is that bad. E.T.go away!"

It's just that ""E.T."" is so phony, so synthetic, so made-up, so ENGINEERED to try to make me feel something, that I have to resent it. <br/><br/>I'll just never understand Spielberg. For so long, I had nothing but contempt for him. Till Schindler's List. (Does anyone (other than Nazis) not like Schindler's List?) <br/><br/>And then, too, he made Saturday-morning worth getting up for. (Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain).

"ccthemovieman-1","6","21","45","8 March 2007"," 25 Years Later, My Message Is "" E.T. - STAY home!""
","This is another blockbuster film of 25 years ago that is well-remembered but doesn't quite have the impact on multiple viewings and in years that have come-and-gone since 1982. Some movies still have a stunning impact, like Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyseey,"" or Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" or even Scott's ""Alien,"" but this sci-fi/alien movie seems to have lost its impact. Maybe it's just me, getting to be a cranky old man.<br/><br/>It's still a cute show and one kids would like, except with the part where E.T. is close to death. This is another Steven Spielberg film in which the kids are smarter than the adults...and the adults are always the bad guys. He had that in a number of his popular films and I hope he is finally through with that tiresome nonsense. Maybe he actually learned that adults are smarter than six-year-olds (generally-speaking!).<br/><br/>I got a kick out of this movie at the theater in 1982, but now it just looks too corny, manipulative and an insult to any adult's intelligence."
"maixiu","5","18","38","20 May 2013"," Not as good as you've heard
","No, it's not a poor movie, but a 7.9 is a very generous rating, likely helped by its massive box office and a fair amount of nostalgia. I watched this the other day, for the first time since the 80's, and was surprised at how trite it was. A 5 or 6 at best. A few things that stood out to me: <br/><br/>1) Child actors -- All I could think of was The Phantom Menace, and how it's always a big risk to cast a young, unproven kid as a main character. Henry Thomas as Elliott wasn't quite as painful as Jake Lloyd, but he still wasn't that good. Far too many of his lines were delivered with a grating screech. Drew Barrymore wasn't too cloying as the cutsie li'l girl but the combination of she or the two boys being in each and every scene meant we never got a break from child actors. There wasn't anyone in this movie who gave an outstanding -- or even above average -- performance. <br/><br/>2) The ""connection"" between Elliott and E.T -- What are the rules regarding this connection? How come sometimes Elliott is completely in synch with E.T. but other times they're feeling things separately? And why would E.T. do that to Elliott in the first place? What purpose did it serve to make a young boy, who's trying to help him, suffer? His brother later says that Elliott ""feels his (E.T.'s) feelings""? To what end? And why does this empathy come and go? Had Elliott been heretofore unable to feel emotions? Is that what E.T. was trying to teach him? We're never given any insight on Elliott prior to E.T.'s arrival so anything about Elliott's background is just conjecture. <br/><br/>3) E.T.'s intelligence -- Why does a member of a race that's conquered inter-stellar travel act like such a simp? He can build a MacGyver-like contraption to send signals into space but he still doesn't know better than to pop a metal toy in his mouth and start chewing it? He springs out of his body bag and starts babbling ""phone home, phone home"" to the point that he has to be shushed by a 10 year old kid. That's a horrible inconsistency that can only be explained away with a huge leap of logic. <br/><br/>4) The sets and scenery -- Fans of MST3K will remember episode 303 Pod People, which was an early 80's E.T. knockoff. When I watched the original again it was almost like the makers of Pod People were intentionally taking the mick out of E.T. All the jokes about the fog machines from that episode of MST3K could apply to E.T. Southern California is an arid climate, all of the day shots feature bright blue skies, yet each night the pavement is soaked as if it stopped raining just a minute ago, while the air is thick with moisture. There were frequent lapses in continuity when it came to cloud cover and daylight. The worst is when the boys are taking E.T. to the rendezvous with his space ship. As they break the police blockade it's broad daylight; suddenly the sun is red and setting; and what was likely a couple minutes later they're in the woods at night -- although when the ship takes off it's dusk again. The ship rises into a beautifully clear evening, with no breeze visible in the tree tops, but back in the woods everyone's again shrouded in mist and what appears to be a stiff wind is blowing everyone's hair. Seriously, Pod People wasn't half as ridiculous about these things. <br/><br/>Then there's all the indoor shots at Elliott's house. You never see a shade covering the windows, only Venetian blinds. Yet even in the middle of the sunniest day the inside of the house is dark as pitch, necessitating the use of lamps. The deleted scene of E.T. in the bath tub is illustrative of this. Since you get no context for the shot, I assumed it was supposed to be night time given how dark the house was, yet Elliott's mom calls from work to see how he's feeling! Never does anyone mention that hiding E.T. from prying eyes is a concern. On Halloween, Mary is coming down the hallway to take their picture and it's as dark as can be, with candles lit. But then they go outside and it's still daylight. All the indoor shots were so obviously shot on a stage that it comes off like a cut-rate soap opera. <br/><br/>5) A couple other random questions -- How did E.T. know a ship was coming for him? Telepathically? If they were able to communicate that way then why did he have to rig up the ""phone"" and call them? Why did that one kid have a balaclava on him during a typically gorgeous SoCal afternoon? How come when E.T. first enters Elliott's room he is reaching over his head to touch the objects on the table, yet the next morning he's tall enough to see what's on the table (and no, his neck wasn't extended.)? Why was Mary wearing a satin bathrobe in front of teenage boys in the beginning of the movie, like some sort of temptress? Then she's an anguished divorcée. Then she's an independent career woman. Then she's ditzy and perhaps tipsy on Halloween. It just seems like there was never an agreed upon direction for her character. E.T. can make objects -- including the bike he's riding on -- levitate, but the boys have to lift him into the bike's basket?? <br/><br/>I don't dislike the movie. I was 11 when it came out and probably liked it a lot then. As I said, there's still a nostalgia factor in its favor. I just can't buy into the idea that it's a well done film."
"crash21","3","11","21","9 October 2008"," E.T. big joke
","I cannot watch E.T. without constantly laughing and rolling my eyes at scenes in this movie. E.T. has to be the most over-hyped, over-dramatized, commercialized, movie that was ever made. This movie is simple proof of what paying the media to hype a movie can get you. E.T. is really nothing more than a dramatic commercial for things like Reese's Pieces and BMX bikes.<br/><br/>I think Steven Spielberg gets a lot more credit than he truly deserves, especially with E.T. Steven Spielberg doesn't make these stories believable (as so many people claim), he just makes everything extremely dramatic. The scene in E.T. where the scientists come into the house wearing space suits (by the way his mother is the first to see the suits), is beautiful proof of this. I think this also applies to the scene where they're trying to escape with E.T., and Eliot's brother says ""I've never driven forward before!"" Driving forward is the first thing you learn how to do in driving! Plus, he drives forward after backing out of the driveway earlier in the movie. I also love the Halloween eve where E.T. sees a kid dressed as Yoda from Star Wars and screams ""home!"", in the same part of the movie E.T. uses the umbrella with crumbled foil for a satellite dish, it's all absolutely comical. And E.T. can't beam up to the space ship because ""this is reality, Greg"", yet he can make all of the kids riding bikes float above the neighborhood from a clear blue sky through a dramatic sunset?<br/><br/>This movie is labeled as science-fiction. I see a lot of dramatized fiction, but where's the science? The amount of drama in this movie makes me cry, but it's crying laughing."

All created prior to the film's debut so that Steven Spielberg could buy another yacht. The entire movie was filled with gimmicks from AT&T's buy-in of ""Phone Home"" to the film's two hour commercial for Reeses Pieces.

","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
Screw E.T.  Why is this movie praised so much?  It's pure garbage.  ET is an a**hole.  Why?  Because he was out in the forest lolly-gaggin' when his superiors were calling him back to his ship.  He was careless and missed the boat!  Simple as that.  And instead of being a man and paying the price for his own mistakes, he lays this guilt trip on all us humans and begs us to help him get back home.  Now it's our problem.  What a jerk!  Sorry, ET but I got my own problems.  What were you doing out there in the woods anyway? Probably devising some elaborate alien conspiracy that will baffle the minds of millions of society's greatest analysts for the next thousand generations.  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.  Period.<br/><br/>And once he gets here, look what he does.  He makes Elliot (the only one who loved him) sick.  So sick, in fact, he is near death.  If ET can touch a flower and bring it back to life, why doesn't he touch the boy who is doing his best to help him???  Elliot is really bustin' his ass for this punk alien.  He's telling his mother boldface lies, he is missing days at school, he becomes a part time wino, he gets a police rap sheet, quarantined from his neighborhood, then chased and shot at by the FBI.  All for this ingrate named ET, who never even gives so much as a thank you.  This is the thanks I get?  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.<br/><br/>I purchased the ET Scholastic book when I was in 2nd grade.  There, it stated that ET is 300 light years away from his home.  I don't think people realize how far that is.  A light year is the distance the speed of light travels during the course of 1 year.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.  Now there are 86,400 seconds in just one day, which means the distance of the speed of light is 148,800,000,000 miles in a day.  This number multiplied by the number of days in a year (365) brings us to 54,312,000,000,000.  This is the distance light travels (in miles) in just one year.  I repeat ONE year.  Now then, ET is 300 light years away from his home planet?  Fine.  There are 109,500 days in 300 years.  Which means the total mileage of how far ET's home from Earth is 10,346,436,000,000,000,000. I know these are all just mind numbing figures to you, so to put it in greater perspective, ET had to begin his journey to Earth about 10 trillion years before the first dinosaur was created in order to get here by 1982, the year of the movie's release.  And Elliot made contact with his home with a friggin' Speak-N-Spell.<br/><br/>This movie is so stupid.  How ET even has the balls to ask his homies to COME BACK and get him a second time is beyond me.  The speed of sound is even slower than light, so Elliot should have been about 20 trillion years old before the aliens even GOT the signal.  Then another approximate 47 trillion years later (not counting rest stops and space tolls) before they actually arrive to get ET.  Elliot would be an old man by the time they got back.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it introduces some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen in a movie.  During Halloween, the kids throw a sheet over ET and Dee Wallace doesn't even notice her own child is a foot shorter and her head's 10 pounds heavier.  Then when they go trick or treating, ET mistakes a kid dressed as Yoda as one of his hometown natives.  How stupid is this alien?  He's smart enough to learn English in 2 hours but can't tell a kid in a costume.  Yoda's from Dagobah, for Christ's sake!  He looks nothing like ET.  Even I can tell the difference and I've never even been to Dagobah.  ET must be the Rain Man of his planet.  The more I watch the movie, the more I realize how autistic ET is.  He even enjoyed it when Drew Barrymore had her way with him and turned him into a cross dresser.<br/><br/>I really like the end sequence when all the kids put masks over their faces during the big FBI chase.  Is Spielberg that stingy with his money that he couldn't afford stunt look alikes?  So instead he'll save a buck by hiding their faces so we can't see them, but never mind the fact that each kid grows 2 feet taller and 20 pounds heavier.  And after they all fly, how corny was their landing?  Perfect formation, BMX style!  Hahaha!  It looked like a deleted scene from that movie Rad.<br/><br/>So, yes, ET is a bad movie.  Crap special effects, crap acting, crap story. It wasn't even half as good as Mac and Me.  ET is not fun for the entire family, as most believe it to be.  Fun for the whole family is a movie like Animal House.  Kids like d*ck and fart jokes, trust me.  Not some kid hugging a nightmare inducing creature with his heart pumpin' on the outside. How scary was that?  I tell, you, one day the sequel will come out and you will all see I was right.  ET is evil.  Just like every other alien in every other movie.  After Close Encounters, Independence Day, and V.....I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.<br/><br/>Zero stars out of 5."

"a_chinn","10","3","4","21 October 2017"," Hard to be objective, but this is a truly special film for me
","First off, I am so disappointed my children found this film boring when I took them to the theater for a 35th anniversary screening. They didn't hate it, but they did not get the sense of wonder and magic that I got when I watched this film as a child. Granted I was a few years older than them, but I'm still disappointed. Anyhow, ""E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial"" drips in 1980s nostalgia, with Mike and his friends playing Dungeons & Dragons while ordering pizza from a corded telephone, Space Invaders t-shirts, references to someone getting the high score on Asteroids, BMX bikes prominently featured, and so on an so forth. That alone made this film fun to rewatch, but beyond Gen-X nostalgia, Steven Spielberg does what he did best during this period of his career, he brought a sense of magic to the world. Spielberg at this time also populated his world with characters who seem very real and identifiable. I was the exact same age as Henry Thomas when this film first came out (I suppose I'm same age now as well), so that likely also added to me feeling a strong connection to the characters in the story when I originally saw the film. Thomas is great and very genuine in his performance, but this was Drew Barrymore's first film and she really does steal every scene she's in. It's hard to say a six-year-old has star quality, or if it's the script, or if it was Spielberg, but she has some of the film's best moments; dressing up E.T., calling him a deformed kid, telling her brothers, ""Give me a break!"" or her the film's heartfelt finale with E.T. telling Gertie to ""Beeeeeee... gooood."" The overall story is of a boy hiding a lost alien in his closet and helping him get home is charming, but I believe it's really all of these small moments that made this film great. It's as if ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is entirely filled with precious Spielbergian scenes like the one from Jaws where Chief Brody and his son mimic each other at the dinner table. I couldn't get over how charming and innocent moments of the film were, particularly when Elliott first coaxes E.T. out of his closet and tells him all of his toys. Those little touches all add up to making the audience more connected with these characters, even if they don't necessarily forward the plot. Those are the scenes that stick in your mind, although the flying bicycles are certainly going to stick in your mind and are a big plot moment. A few things I don't think I picked up on when I originally watched this film was some foreshadowing of E.T. and Elliott's connection. Early on in the film when Elliott is getting food from the fridge, E.T. is startled by something in Elliott's room and shrieks, causing Elliott to also shriek and spill a carton of milk. Upon first viewing, you'd think it was E.T.'s shriek that startled Elliott, but it's the start of their psychic and physical bond between the two. The other part of the film that escaped me as a child was Elliott's mom, Dee Wallace and a great performance that's very nearly very easy to miss, struggling with being a newly single mom and a still coming to terms with a recent divorce. Her struggles as a parent are something I now identify with as an adult and allowed for a new emotional connection to the film and characters. It was also fun when rewatching the film to see how many tips-of-the-hat that were done in ""Stranger Things"" to this film. It's no secret that ""Stranger Things"" cribbed heavily form Spielberg, but I was struck by how spot on ""Stranger Things"" was when I actually went back to watch a Spielberg film from that era. Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a film classic and if Elliot saying, ""You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T."" doesn't get to you, you have a heart of stone."
"Fluke_Skywalker","10","3","4","6 December 2015"," For the child in us all
","Nostalgia can be a popular emotion, blinding us to flaws that are otherwise quite obvious. With 'E.T.' there's certainly nostalgia there for me, but what makes it different is that it makes me feel like I'm 8 years old again.<br/><br/>Every element of this film is truly sensational. You're unlikely to ever find a cast of children who are the equal of the youngsters here. The direction by Steven Spielberg is--no pun intended--light years ahead of the many copycats who followed. Oh, and then there's the score by John Williams. If it doesn't give you goose bumps, there's a good chance you are dead.<br/><br/>With laughs, thrills and a huge heart, 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a classic for the ages."

","This movie draws well the strong bond of friendship between a young boy Eliot and E.T. from other planet.This movie teaches us that it is not a big problem what kind of animal they are.Eliot and E.T. are special friends for each other. Their hearts are in tune with each other. Of course this story is really good but the movie is also special.The famous scene that Eliot and E.T. fly to the sky by bicycle is very beautiful and the music is also romantic. The growth of Eliot is also the point of this story.The encounter with E.T. certainly gives him great influence to his life. Not only the friendship between Eliot and E.T., the assist of other friends is also moving."
"Lebowskidoo","10","4","6","4 November 2018"," Timeless Movie Magic
","Rewatched Spielberg's classic, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, again, and yes, it still maintains that magic it always had.<br/><br/>Having not seen it since the multiple times I watched it as a kid, you now notice all the things you missed originally. Spielberg basically set out to make the entire movie from the viewpoint of Elliott, a kid. Camera angles are from a kid's point of view, adults ignore him, older brothers are annoyed by him, it's all there, I just never noticed the first time because I was exactly Elliott's age then. I mean, we never even see his teacher's face, not once. It's like he's Charlie Brown's teacher too!<br/><br/>Another thing I realized watching this as an adult is that the government agents are not as evil as I found them to be the first time. Peter Coyote's character (who is never even given an on screen name) doesn't want to dissect E.T., he's basically Elliott as a grown-up, fascinated and wanting to learn from this alien tourist. He and his team in space suits all seemed so ominous back in the day, but watching it now, you realize they did try to save him and weren't out to chop him up and study him. Well, not until after he was already dead.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is almost another character in this movie. So ideal and beautiful, no wonder he's legendary.<br/><br/>Dee Wallace kind of breaks your heart a little, as an adult we now know she's heartbroken that her husband has run off to Mexico with some bimbo...and he hates Mexico! My parents were split up when I was Elliott's age, and I was a little isolated and in need of a friend then too. Hmmm, why is it I related so much to this movie?<br/><br/>Basically, this movie was an instant classic. All the pieces (not necessarily Reese's!) came together in perfect unison to make this movie. It still creates that sense of wonder and universal sense that although we may be different we can still find ways to love each other. Cornball, I know, but who doesn't love a bit of cornball once in awhile?"
"Neonsamurai","Null","4","6","7 October 2002"," Unrealistic
","I see that many people here have praised ET to the heavens, and maybe rightly so, but I'm particularly cynical when we have films that contain two of the most dangerous groups in society: children and aliens.<br/><br/>Now is it just me, or are kids really nasty little things? If so, then why is it that it's always kids that discover kindly aliens, monsters, robots or beings of pure energy, that adults always want to destroy or at least slice open? Just once I'd like to see an adult find a nice, kind caring monster and then have to protect it from a hoard of marauding children. Don't believe that would happen? Try dressing up as a Teletubbie and spend a day shopping at a mall, then you'll see.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure what kind of advanced alien species ET was from, but whoever was flying that ship was a bit of a moron and in serious trouble. Let's face it, in today's litigious society, where you can get sued for serving hot coffee, imagine the kind of lawsuit ET would have had against the tour firm he was travelling with! Plus, why did he have to call home, wouldn't his wife, girlfriend (or boyfriend) have raised the alarm when he didn't come back? But that kind of trouble pales in comparison to the amount of explaining he'd have to do:<br/><br/>`I'm sorry honey, you see I got lost and the guys left without me and I couldn't find a phone anywhere. So there I am, naked, hanging out with these kids when. Honey? Honey?'"

","When ET first came out, I was at a nihilistic punky point in my life and thought it was absolute dreck. The woman who brought me to the film was seeing for her third time, and she was having orgasms of pure bliss, and expecting me to feel the same way. I was diplomatic, after all, I wanted to get laid, but it was a real chore to feign the slightest emotion over a squashed head alien and his foul-mouthed child protector.<br/><br/>Years later, after the film had made many top ten greatest movies of all time lists, and at a point where I was more ""sensitive"", I went back and re-watched the movie, trying to see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>Lord, I really tried, but for the life of me, I just don't get how people have swallowed Spielberg's hook. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg is the world class manipulator of our feelings towards his movies, and I have taken his drug many times and liked it, but ET just sucks."
"jboothmillard","10","11","23","13 July 2005"," E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
","I remember seeing it as a kid, and the ending making me cry, and seeing it again (properly), it is a great film from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) that still does. He based it mainly on his childhood, the divorce his parents and wanting a friend. Anyway, basically an alien is left behind on Earth, and young Elliot (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Henry Thomas) befriends him, along with his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (seven-year-old BAFTA nominated Drew Barrymore). They teach him how to speak and keep him safe from harm of the adults (who you see from the point of view of E.T. or a kid, i.e. mainly just legs). E.T. unfortunately has some kind of accident and is discovered dying by the government who try to save him. In the end, after escaping the authorities, E.T. did manage to communicate to his kind, and in the tearful ending he says goodbye to everyone and does go home. The bicycle flying is wonderful, especially across the Moon (which became Amblin Entertainment's logo), the Oscar winning music by John Williams is magical, and E.T. is a very lovable character. The extra footage put in, and some reconstructed as part of the 20th anniversary re- release is also fun. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Score, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""E.T. phone home.""), it was number 14 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending, it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 31 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Films.

About a year ago i watched E.T. again. I thought, well, I'm older now and maybe I was just in the wrong mood when i saw it the first time. Nope. It still gave me the creeps. This time around the alien seemed too fake with his animatronic neck elongation and that overly sympathetic whine. The one time I almost laughed was when it he she whatever got drunk wearing those high heals and the wig, but even then i thought it was kind of pathetic to beg for laughs with such a tired method as drunkenness.

I think kids like it obviously more than that adults would. The story has holes and is pretty simple but for kids it's real good. I did not like any of the restored and changed things in all the updates of the movie, especially changing the guns into the flashlights. What is the point of that? I was a kid when I saw it but the flashlights did no scare me at all. Kids aren't as fragile as I think these directors are thinking nowadays. Anyway I give E.T. a six out of ten rating because it is a good movie that is worth seeing with some unforgettable scene but only if you have kids watching and there are many better films out there that are not so well liked. E.T. is an above average movie, for kids."

For children this piece of entertainment is harmful (it makes kids believe in a kind E.T. and other scum), while for grown-ups this film is simply flat.<br/><br/>Reason No.2 This movie did not make me laugh or smile, did not make me fear or think, did not entertain me - it just dragged on for an hour and a half. Could not believe my eyes and ears later on when famous men were expressing their adoration before this flick and considered it to be the best of the best.<br/><br/>Reason No.3 The idea of friendship between a child and an alien can be quite well executed but in this movie it just does not work. The extraterrestrial looks stupid and goofy while the child is a run-of-the-mill boy. There is no chemistry to amaze. A helpless wretched alien, who ""lost"" his parents? Fie! Come on, give me ""Predator"" to enjoy.<br/><br/>Reason No.4 Lack of interesting fresh ideas. Oh, yes, there is a bicycle flying against the dark sky with moon as a background. It's still being remade and remixed here and there on TV. Big ...deal.<br/><br/>There is a very low-end and cheap British movie ""Xtro"", which is superior in each and every point mentioned above. The child who played Tony there was to be nominated for an Oscar, the aliens were real bad, and the chemistry between the child and his ""altered"" father was grotesque.<br/><br/>Agree or not, but ""E.T."" is too soft and too boring, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>While there still should be something good about this movie, which slips my mind, here go a few points to be more objective.<br/><br/>Verdict: a very soft pathetic American sc-fi of ""3 out of 10"" kind.

","The first thing you need to know is that my impression of this film is forever colored by my first exposure to it.  When ET was released, I was 4 years old.  It is the first movie I can remember seeing in the theater, and it scarred me for life.  Really, this is a widespread phenomenon.  If you were not born between the years 1977 and 1980, you may not understand what I'm talking about, but I'm telling you it's true.  Ask anyone in that age bracket--if they saw ET in the theater, I guarantee they had the same experience.<br/><br/>Imagine yourself as a four-year-old, in a dark room, filled with people you don't know, watching the story of ET.  You are a bit apprehensive about this strange-looking creature, but as Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore grow to love him, so do you.  You want one of your own...he's like a pet or maybe a stuffed animal come to life.  What fun!  Until, that is, the horrible people in the white jumpsuits take over the movie.   All of a sudden, all these grown-ups are out to get ET.  The screen is taken over by mean-looking people and, even worse, all those scary tubes and quarantine equipment.  At this point, you--the four-year-old--are terrified.  You don't understand why all those mean people want to hurt ET.  Your parents take you out of the theater, into the shock of daylight, and more than likely vow not to take you to a movie for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Now, I can understand that ET is a highly regarded film, and I can appreciate why many people love it.

My dad would never take us to see films in the theatre so of course I had to wait for home video of E.T., but in all that time considering the way he was merchandised I wondered at even a young age: is this actually a good movie or a ploy to sell Reeces pieces? Well, I can honestly say that the first time I finally saw the film I was more than a bit confused... just what was so special about it? Consider, E.T. is probably the single most ignorant looking creature ever seen in a film. The film went overboard in the way it portrayed The relationship with the alien, almost in a homoerotic way... it seemed that they were just TOO close, but hey I guess I'm being a cynic. Now this masterpiece of fluff has been released, and what's different? Not much, unfortunately... Spielberg showed just what kind of a director he is by butchering his own original work, but after some of the pathetic films he has helmed I suppose he could care less just as long as the money comes rolling in. And roll in it will, this film really is nothing more than a vehicle to sell endorsements and toys, it has little redeeming value other than the fact that it might keep your 2 year old at bay for at least the duration, and that it makes ol' Steven more cash to throw around. I really hope he leaves the Indiana Jones films alone once they hit DVD, but digress... he will probably squeeze them dry of life as well. In closing I would just like to say that this film is terrible, it lacks in story, goes overboard in its melodrama to the point of nausea, and most importantly it actually CHEATS the viewer by just bringing the alien back to life out NOWHERE thus defeating the only really good thing in film: his death. If you want to see masterful directing go find some Akira Kurosawa, Hiyao Miyazaki or George Romero because unlike Spielberg they know how to tell a beautiful story without killing the human element or ruining the premise via over commercialization.

I recall going over to a neighbour's house and watching it on pirate video (I think that E.T. was the most pirated video ever). I was pretty excited to see it. In the event my neighbours all were in floods of tears, as I sat there strangely, yet deeply unimpressed with what I had just seen. I don't know what it is but I have revisited this film again a further couple of times in the last three years or so and I still come away somewhat ambivalent and unmoved. Maybe I am dead behind the eyes? I must be going by the reaction most people seem to have to this movie. But I can't change my reaction no matter how I try and find this to be overly sentimental and slightly tiresome. It's not that I don't like Steven Spielberg – I think on his day he can be great – but he sometimes makes films so twee in nature as to be very off-putting.<br/><br/>It also sort of baffles me how E.T. himself can be such a super-intelligent being when he allows himself to be led up a staircase by a child via a line of sweeties. That surely is the behaviour of a creature with an IQ no greater than a domestic dog and not a galaxy-hopping alien, surely? And why hasn't his alien race invented clothing?

I foud it incredibly boring, the special effects were laughable and ET itself was about the worst glove puppet I had ever seen, a hand in a sock would have been more realistic. I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and enjoy most of his films but this one just lost me. However I can respect the fact that many other people have really enjoyed this film and I am not really criticizing them at all, I am simply saying that it was lost on me. I just don't see it as a great or even a good film. 'Batteries not included' was to my mind a much better ET film but didn't seem to appeal to as many people as ET."

Yes, I am fully aware that Steven Spielberg is playing with my emotions.<br/><br/>But if anyone is going to toy with my feelings, he's probably about the best one to do it.<br/><br/>In so many respects, this 26-year-old film holds up incredibly well. Doubtless, if it were to be released today, the character of E.T. would have been computer animated; indeed, much of the film would have been made using that medium. I'm not sure, though, even with today's advanced technology, that any computer image would have been able to emote so convincingly as the puppet used here. The actors, the puppeteers, the director - everyone worked together to such great effect to make the audience believe in that character. And despite the obvious emotional ploys on the way to the film's conclusion (the near-death, tearful goodbyes, etc.), it just feels natural to want to see E.T. happily home with his family again.<br/><br/>Between Spielberg's mastery of the language of film and John Williams' rousing, yet sumptuous score (the man might be one of the greatest composers of our time!), this film is masterfully made and a wonder to watch.

"roghache","9","3","5","24 March 2006"," Sci fi fairy tale with everyone's favorite alien
","This is a wonderful fun, heartwarming fairy tale of a story for both kids and adults. In terms of a cute science fiction story, no one has ever been able to touch Stephen Spielberg's classic.<br/><br/>The fairy tale begins when some alien botanists visiting earth for samples inadvertently leave behind one of their own on this strange, bewildering new planet. The adorable little alien critter is discovered by a 10 year old boy named Elliot, who finds him foraging for food in their garden shed. The friendly alien (ET, as he comes to be called, for Extra Terrestrial) comes to stay in the boy's home. Elliot, his older brother, Michael, and younger sister, Gertie, sort of take him under their wing. But as they learn to communicate, they discover that ET is lonesome. He wants to go home, and to that end, concocts some type of device he thinks might help get him there. However, if he succeeds, Elliot (whose own parents are going through a divorce) will lose his new friend.<br/><br/>It's all too cute, especially the little alien guffer himself. Basically, he kind of represents every homesick kid (or adult) who ever lived. Despite his newfound human friends, he just misses his own home world and fellow critters. Memorable scenes for me are of course the legendary ones...ET hiding among the stuffed animals and assorted junk in a closet so Elliot's mom won't spot him, Halloween trick or treating, and the famed flying bicycle scene. And of course the ongoing ""ET go home"".<br/><br/>Great acting by everyone, especially the three kids. ET is simply a fabulous movie with some fancy modern effects and a space age theme, but mainly a story about the bonds of friendship revolving around a touching little guy that needs love and help from his new earthling buddy. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry...just like any truly good movie should. This is one that perennially appeals to the kid in all of us."

And in specific, I've to mention the inspiring Music Score of the 5 times Academy Award Winner (including E.T.) John Williams. I never forget his Theme Music to this movie and I'm still hearing the sounds.<br/><br/>The movie overall is Great!

"kergillian","7","3","5","26 May 2002"," Better than I remembered, but still overrated.
","I haven't seen this film since the late eighties at least, perhaps not since around the time it came out. And I must admit it was better than I expected. I didn't watch the new remastered director's cut that just came out recently, but instead borrowed the original, to see it as it was (I'm not really interested in cut scenes, etc.)<br/><br/>The effects were vintage ILM, very nice for the time. E.T. looks pretty impressive, even by today's standards it isn't at all bad. Drew Barrymore is adorable, and I liked the older brother. In fact, Elliott is the only character that annoys me, with his shrieking and whining constantly...I admit, I'm fairly prejudiced against anyone younger than 14 in a film (as I rarely see any character at that age that isn't nauseatingly precious or irritating as heck) and this kid was no exception.<br/><br/>Scenes that stood out in my mind include the wonderful frog rescue scene, and the classic bike rides (especially the chase one). But unfortunately, I feel the film drags on much too long, and the entire illness stretch just seems to go on forever. The government agents also seem rather unbelievable as well as overly inept and less covert thatn I think they should be. Though this is a children's film, so some silliness and suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, as a whole I think the film is overrated. Great for kids (though not too young - I can see young children easily frightened by certain scenes), and heartwarming, some cool effects and a message for all about friendship and loyalty is strongly apparent. But still, a bit too silly at times, and the length gets tedious a bit towards the end. Great to watch, but I don't think it's the masterpiece many claim it to be. 7/10."

Jaws was boring, Jurassic Park was simply crap, Saving Private Ryan was far too pathetic, and A.I. was boring, crap and pathetic. So I personally don't know why Spielberg is so successful.

How much better can a movie be ?<br/><br/>Okay, it was again pathetic. But it had a lot more story than Saving Private Ryan, and it wasn't pathetic about the US.<br/><br/>I don't know the original, so I can't comment on the differences between the original and the directors cut.<br/><br/>Recommended unless you consider good entertainment with a positive message a sin."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","11 January 2004"," A wonderful family movie
","When Elliot hears strange noises from his garden shed he finds an alien there - left behind when it's craft had to leave early.  He brings `ET' into the house and shows his siblings, who help ET feel at home and settled. However ET begins to plan a way to signal back home to get picked up, meanwhile Elliot and ET start to have their feelings join up.<br/><br/>Be honest - there must be very few people do at very least don't have a lump in there throats at some point during this film.  The plot is a simple tale of an alien who befriends a young boy however it is told with such pathos and wit that it is very hard not to love it.  Here is an example that shows that Spielberg can actually make a sweet film without totally killing it with syrupy sentiment - although that's not to say that he doesn't cut it very fine at times here.  ET is an ugly little beast but he easily wins over an audience.  His link to Elliot is never totally explained but it is well used, whether it's in the classroom scene or the touching scene near the end.<br/><br/>The film has a real wit to it that is never hilarious but sits very well with the gentle emotion of the film.  Most of the reason lies with the cast. This is seen in the fact that in the 20th anniversary version of the film, several scenes were added with a cgi ET - they mostly added humour but didn't totally work because it is the very talented child cast that makes it work.<br/><br/>Thomas' Elliot is cute but not to the sickly point, he is sassy and smart (but again not to the point of being annoying).  Barrymore does all the stuff she does now - little smirk and smart mouth!  But she is really good and I wish more child actors could be as fun and natural as she was here. Ironically it is the eldest of the three children that is the weakest - he is a teenager and falls to the surely side, he is quite wooden for too much of the film.  However it is ET who is the star of the film and, watching it as an adult now, it is amazing how expressive he is for a puppet - he may not look like much when viewed alongside modern cgi characters (ie Gollum) but he is very expressive and very much a character rather than an effect; Barrymore was not the only one to be taken in by him as a real character! In fact the cgi ET looks weaker if anything because he does look like an effect first and a character second; it's hard to describe but the puppet works better because he is in the scenes whereas the effect has clearly been added later.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a wonderful film that I saw as a child in a bingo hall cinema and loved and watch as an adult now and love.  There is really very little that is wrong with it and Spielberg holds back the syrup for only a few scenes that are emotional enough to justify it.  The cast of children show, where later Spielberg films don't, that child actors don't need to be horribly cutest kids that bare no resemblance to real life, and they create a real sense of audience involvement and identification as well as emotion and wit."

","I would be very surprised if there was someone out there who hasn't seen this movie already...at least someone old enough to be reading a review. Few movies are compelling enough to appeal to young and old alike and  E.T. is one of those rare gems that was able to bring an enjoyable story that spans the generation gaps.   <br/><br/>E.T. is an incredibly touching tale of a lonely young boy and his friendship with an extra terrestrial.  Henry Thomas does an excellent job portraying young Elliot and his talent shines through in this performance.  Drew Barrymore is absolutely adorable as little Gertie and quite accurately portrays Elliot's often annoying little sister.  Robert MacNaughton plays Michael...the older brother of Elliot and Gertie and does equally a fantastic job.  The talent these three exude is incredible...leaving the viewer wholeheartedly believing they are siblings out on a quest to save E.T.<br/><br/>Although filmed in the early 80's, E.T. has undoubtedly been able to withstand the test of time.  The effects were beautifully done given the technology at the time; and although technological capabilities have vastly improved since then, E.T. still is as beautiful now as back in 1982.<br/><br/>This movie has all the makings of a great story:  fabulous casting, believable characters, humor, action, and the occasional tugging of the heartstrings.

The first half has most of the movie's famous moments, while the second half takes a turn for the emotional and occasionally heartbreaking, all leading to one of the most effective and memorable climaxes in modern cinema history.

"classicalsteve","10","2","3","9 June 2016"," An Alien Seen Through Children: Most-Moving SF Film Ever Created in the Wake of the SF Craze
","With the release of George Lucas' original ""Star Wars"" film in 1977 (later re-titled ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"") and Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"", the genre of Science Fiction film was reborn into the mainstream. Previously it had been primarily marketed to adolescent boys as either b-films or cliff-hanger series in matinees from circa 1935 to 1970. For about 5 to 6 years from circa 1977 to 1983, the entertainment industry cranked out tons of Science Fiction based films and television shows, most of which were of marginal quality, such as ""Buck Rogers"", ""Battlestar Gallactica"" and ""The Black Hole"" which were simply trying to mirror the success of Star Wars. A few were superb standout's, such as ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"". At the end of this short period when the studios were saturating movie theaters with just about anything with space ships, Steven Spielberg and company produced and released ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"".<br/><br/>Unlike most of Hollywood's Science Fiction offerings from the release of Star Wars in 1977 to its third installment ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, ""E.T."" didn't rely on space ships and galactic battles. Yes, there's a space ship in a couple of scenes, and even a few technological miracles, but that's not the main point. ""E.T."" is primarily about how children see the world as opposed to adults. In a strange way, ""E.T."" probably has more in common with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" than ""Star Wars"", the former being injustice as seen by children in a similar way. The themes of ""E.T."" are so moving because we see the alien through children who don't quite fear things the way adults do. Not to say that children don't have fears, but sometimes wonder can overcome fear, which is I think at the heart of ""E.T."" The alien is also very childlike, often exploring and getting into things he shouldn't be. ""E.T."" is thematically opposite from ""Alien"" released just two years earlier in which an horrific alien creatures infiltrates and attacks a galactic space ship. So although ""Alien"", ""Close and Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the original ""Star Wars"" films are in more or less the same Science Fiction genre, the similarities end there for the most part.<br/><br/>The story-line is deceptively simple but allows for the development of not only the characters but their relationships. A spaceship has landed on Earth and some beings from another solar system have been exploring our planet in a wooded area not far from a suburban community. For them, our planet is an alien world. One of the explorers was so curious about our planet he wandered far away from the space ship. Government men became aware that something was going on, and when they made their presence known, the ship was forced to leave, causing their companion to be stranded on Earth. Throughout the film are the government men who are investigating what's going on, and they become somewhat adversarial to the alien being and the children. Intensely curious about us and our planet, he wanders into the suburban community and hides in a shed of a house where a single mom and her three children reside. He is discovered by the younger son Elliott (Henry Thomas), the middle child of the three.<br/><br/>One of the most effective sequences is how Elliott and the alien meet and find common ground. Elliott leaves trails of Reese's Pieces which are picked up by the alien. But instead of eating them, the alien places a handful of them on Elliott's lap as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. Some kind of message has passed between them, not of spoken language but based on friendship gestures. Interestingly, the alien is not afraid; the alien has to persuade Elliott that he has nothing to fear. As events unfold, Elliott is vaguely aware that the adults in his life won't understand the alien, and he keeps him a secret. Eventually he introduces him to his siblings, who he has nicknamed ""E.T."". In one of the most interesting scenes, E.T. communicates that he needs to contact his race and let them know they can come for him. ""E.T. phone home"" becomes the line of the film. And he helps them build a kind of intergalactic telephone made of electronic toys. However, the adults finally catch up with Elliott and intervene between him and the alien. In one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, the government men infiltrate Elliott's house, and they are dressed in space suits, as if they are the invaders.<br/><br/>One of the most striking aspects of ""E.T."" is that nearly every scene is shot from the height of a child, just above the waste of an adult. E.T. is short and he relates to the children but seems much less interested in the adults, as if he has a sense the adults will be too quick to judge who and what he is before he can give them a chance. When the mother finally is shown E.T. she freaks out. This is the essence of E.T. about the wonder of childhood and how children, even if they may be inexperienced, are sometimes more open to new possibilities than adults. The children exhibit love towards E.T. whereas we get the sense the adults are operating more out of fear."

","Steven Spielberg is one of the most famous directors in the world and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is one of his most beloved films, which is remarkable considering he has made films like Jaws, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones series.<br/><br/>In a Californian town, Elliot (Henry Thomas) is a lonely 10-year-old who lives with his single mother (Dee Wallace), teenage brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Elliot is picked on by his brother but one night he finds a strangled alien in his back garden. Quickly Elliot befriends the alien who he calls E.T. and the trio of children both teach and aid E.T. who has telekinetic and healing powers. Soon Elliot and E.T. share a psychic link, but the longer E.T. stays on Earth the more ill he becomes, effecting Elliot. Added to the mix is a mystery government agency is hunting for E.T.<br/><br/>Spielberg knows how to manipulate emotions and he certainly does it with E.T. . You feel for both the alien and the children. The characters are well defined, Elliot is the character most children can relate as he is a normal middle child who has intelligence, missing his father and is picked on by his brother. He is decently played by a young Henry Thomas and none of the acting was terrible. I personally like how Michael was portrayed: he is a bully, gets his younger brother to act as a slave and makes fun of him, but he is also protective and when it manners will come good for his younger siblings.<br/><br/>The animatronic used for E.T. were top of the range at the time for time and looked really effective, giving E.T. emotion and physicality. I saw the 20th Anniversary DVD version which clearly added some CGI touch ups to E.T. and has the notorious scene where two guns are swapped for walkie-talkies: but it is hardly game breaker because the film is so great. John Williams also gives us another excellent film score, including a very famous signature we all know and love.<br/><br/>E.T. is a touching film for good reason and it is a great film for whole family."
"Mr-Fusion","9","2","3","16 August 2012"," More than a hit film, it's an experience
","""E.T."" was the movie that introduced us to Steven Spielberg as the supreme sentimentalist. Facing the big-guns roster of Summer 1982, it seemed like a little movie, in every aspect. And this movie swept the competition and went on to redefine that movie season as ""The Summer of ""E.T."" <br/><br/>Spielberg's ultimate fairy tale (from a script by Melissa Mathison) has a left-behind alien seeking refuge in the backyard of a suburban home. It's a broken home, inhabited by a single mother (Dee Wallace) and her three children as they try to maintain some semblance of family after Dad ran off to Mexico (with another woman). Elliott (Hentry Thomas) is the first of the household to discover the life form (whom he names ""E.T."") and the two lost souls find themselves inexplicably linked. And that link (as well as the rest of the family) will be tested when the scientists come looking for their creature from outer space.<br/><br/>Spielberg wanted his audience eating out of his hand, and he accomplishes just that. The film is shot from waist-high (the eye-line of a child) so that we experience the events of the film through the eyes of childhood innocence. And when the government guys show up in their space suits, they're legitimately scary. Spielberg also shot ""E.T."" in chronological scene order, wringing the maximum emotional reactions from his child actors. Spielberg's a master manipulator; he knows exactly what he's doing, (he's done this prior with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""). But it extends beyond just his cast and into the setting for the film. Spielberg's subdivision is clearly located in California (Elliott even point to California on the map), but the movie's setting becomes an almost-otherworldly place. There's a corn field in Elliott's backyard, complete with nighttime fog, and he's a BMX-ride away from a very Redwoods-esque forest.<br/><br/>The relationship between Elliott and E.T. is completely authentic, thanks in no small part to Thomas' ability to make us forget that he's reacting to an inanimate puppet. He sells it, no question. And speaking of which, E.T. is not an attractive alien. That the cast (and director) can make us laugh at, and cry over a character so hideous is nothing short of astounding. None of these actors are lightweights. Dee Wallace is terrific at playing the put-upon mom who's doing her best to keep the family together, and Drew Barrymore is the essence of childhood innocence as the youngest of the family. <br/><br/>This is a movie that isn't lacking in emotional punch, in any sense of the definition. Spielberg (with the help of John Williams' magnificent score) expertly tugs at the heartstrings of his audience, and makes it look easy. ""E.T."" is the ultimate in family feel-good movies, and it's truly a portrait of a man at the top of his game in Hollywood entertainment. The heroes are so good, and the message so pure, that it's scientifically impossible for a human being to walk out of this movie with dry eyes (or at least it should be).<br/><br/>It lacks the replay value of most of my all-time favorite movies (which I think is good, as I revisit ""E.T."" every few years and it never loses its emotional punch), but it always delivers. <br/><br/>Always.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

In retrospect, way too smug in the aliens-are-OK insider stance with Peter Coyote and... and, well just quite a few alien lovers in the film. I rate it 2 rather than 1 for the breakfast scene with a still young Drew Barrymore and her ""alligators in the sewers"" line; but this film, like the filmmaker Spielberg, has no real character or backbone. Family Classics, true classics, have one thing in common: They remain classics year-after-year. Like Wizard of Oz, still new after 66 years. Poor E.T. has no resilient value either at the box office or on television. Poor old Sears bought the TV rights for several years of annual runs. Trouble was, nobody much watched. Now Sears doesn't bother exercising their right-to-play anymore. This film did, however, make big dollars in its initial run. As always, the All Time Hit list failed to reflect constant dollar figures, thus squeezing out the true all-time hit SNOW WHITE, which cost 20c to see --- made at a time when $800 was a really good annual income."

This is something Hollywood has completely forgotten. It's almost like they think the only thing that makes for a good story is if your heroes suffer and end on a bleak note. Look at the movies that critics praise and tell me I'm wrong. There's no room for happiness anymore and that's sad.

As an 8-year old in 1982, I was suddenly becoming aware how much growing up without a father was making me different from my friends. I was alienated and alone at times, seeking my own identity that little boys often find in their dads. E.T. made me realize that I wasn't alone and that love, compassion, friendship, and family could still exist even if my father didn't want me. The movie is beautiful, inside and out. EVERYBODY delivers a meaningful performance with heart and dedication. If you haven't seen this film, watch it, and be prepared for an emotional roller coaster that ALL great films should have."

","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) is a Family Sci-Fi film starring Henry Thomas and directed by Steven Spielberg. It's about an alien being who was left behind on Earth when his spaceship took off after almost being discovered by human beings. He hides out until they leave until he is finally seen by a young boy named, Elliot. After learning how to speak, E.T. tells the 3 children that he wants to phone home and they try and find a way to help him. This film was entertaining, well-written, well-performed and it is an overall amazing production. The best components of E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial are the music, the characters, and the actors.<br/><br/>The music is dramatic and majestic. It adds the perfect amount it magic to the scene that it is added to and enhances the overall message of the film. As Elliot is trying his best to walk around quietly and not be seen by the others, there is very soft and light piano music playing and as he is healed by E.T, the music increases slightly in volume and tempo as the two new friends watch his mom and sister read a bedtime story.<br/><br/>The 3 main characters in the film: Elliot, Michael, and Gertie are all imperfect and likable. Elliot is seen bragging about discovering E.T. and making Michael say that he has absolute power in order to reveal his discovery. He is also very smart and compassionate. Michael seems to be a big bully at first as he is seen making fun of Elliot. Upon meeting E.T., Michael slowly begins to reveal his soft side. The youngest sibling, Gertie, is naive, yet persistent. All 3 siblings are helpful and stubborn.<br/><br/>The actors who were cast to play the 3 main characters were an amazing choice. Even though they are all so young, they are able to convey the wants and needs of their characters. While Elliot is in class about to begin dissecting frogs, E.T. is sitting at home on the couch drinking beers. Even though Elliot is not even in the same building as E.T., you can immediately see that he is beginning to see the effects of the alcohol that E.T. is drinking even though it had not been said yet. Henry Thomas, the actor who plays Elliot, portrays this with his posture and facial expression.<br/><br/>I am awfully glad that I gave this film a re-watch as it is even better than I remember it. I had heard that this film is overrated but I would have to disagree. As the film continues, E.T., the character that will make you fall in love, gets increasing more Ill. The 3 siblings are unsure what to do and how to help him. Will E.T. ever get home? Why is E.T. sick? Is it too late to save him? Will he find a new home on Earth?"

","This is a truly touching film and proof that sci fi can have as much, if not more, heart than any drama in the film world.<br/><br/>E.T. wants to phone home. He is lost and afraid in his new world, our world. He is short, wrinkly, bug-eyed, yet somehow adorable, and easily befriends his human friend Elliot who cares about him and wants him to survive on Earth.<br/><br/>This beautiful story has a lot of depth to it. Elliot and E.T.'s friendship is a model for many successful relationships we desire and strive for. We all want a companion, and E.T. being an alien somehow makes us want to strive for better relationships on Earth.<br/><br/>The terrifying sequence involving the scientists at the end doesn't paint the most positive picture of scientific progress, and ironically makes science itself seem somewhat ""evil"" in a science fiction film. Poor little E.T. must run for his life from the scientists who want to do who knows what with him.<br/><br/>This classic sci fi story is one of Spielberg's best, and a must see for all ages, even those not initially attracted to the sci fi genre."

","With this film for all audiences, Steven Spielberg managed to reach the heart of each and every one of the spectators who were lucky enough to enjoy it, because above all, E.T.

We are before a beautiful song to the friendship and to a friendship beyond the borders, because it has like protagonists to a boy and a friendly and endearing extraterrestrial. This adorable fable is full of magic, of unforgettable moments, of unrepeatable dialogues and it is a story wisely told, that no doubt chills inside the public. In it also comedy and drama, action and pause, fiction and reality coexist and, if that were not enough, the soundtrack is authentically masterful. So look at it wherever you look, we are before one of the great jewels that has given the history of the cinema, so there is no reason not to see it and not to be touched by the adventures of an alien, who went beyond The stars to excite us and to tear us a smile. In my case at least, he got it."

","I remember when this film came out I was 10, and saw it with my parents. E.T. is about a genital little alien who was accidentally left behind, when the craft came to earth. Lost in the Redwood forest of California, E.T. comes to a neighborhood. One night Elliot( Henry Thomas) finds him, and hides him for awhile. Elliot and E.T. start a bonding process, that is touching to the heart. One day the secret comes out where his older brother is introduced to him, and finally Gertie( Drew Barrymore). E.T. mainly communicates though Elliot.Elliot feels what he feels, an emotional connection that happens just with the two. To me E.T. is cute, and a little too curious, which Elliot finds out one day at school. When Gertie teaches him to talk, a whole new adventure begins. The government is curious about what has happened that night, and know the alien has to be somewhere close. They start surveillance of the neighborhood. It's Keys( Peter Coyote) who finds out were E.T. is hiding. When he overhears a conversation with Elliot and Micheal. Micheal tells Elliot that he is concerned that E.T. isn't looking so good. One day E.T. builds a homemade radar so he can contact his people. On Halloween night it's planned to set up the radar in the forest. They tell Gertie to met them on the top of the hill. To get out of the house tell put a sheet on E.T. so mom will think it's Gerty under the sheet. Once the three are trick or treating. The the met with Gerty so Elliot will be covered when he takes E.T. to the forest. They sit up the radar, but Elliot falls asleep, and E.T. goes missing. In the meantime Mary(Dee Wallace Stone) is frantic, she calls the police. When Elliot suddenly appears it's a relief, but E.T. hasn't returned. Elliot tells Mike he has to find him, in the forest. Once found, E.T. looks pale and in really bad shape. Mike brings him home, and all the kid's are in the bathroom. Mike has to tell mom, when she finds out, she's in shock. Since Elliot and E.T. are connected they are both dying/sick. She grabs the kid's and runs downstairs, she is met with government agents. The agents search the house and find E.T. upstairs. Now the house is quarantined and under government control. E.T. and Elliot are both taken to a MASH type triage unit. It is surrounded by doctors/government agents. There Elliot meets Keys, who is concerned with both Elliot and E.T.. Keys also dreamed of this day, and tells Elliot he doesn't want E.T. to die either. When E. T. vitals start to drop, Elliot has to be removed. Elliot doesn't understand the doctor's are trying to save E.T.'s life. The doctor's work on E.T. for over 8 hours try to resuscitate him. It is devastating, to everyone, especially Elliot. Keys tries to comfort him, but it doesn't seem to help. While alone Elliot is alone with E.T.. Elliot is sad and start to talk to E.T., Keys comes and says they have to take him away now. The lid shuts, but something magical happens That Elliot discovers. E.T. Comes back to life. When Elliot tells his bother, they take off in a government vehicle with E.T.. The rest do not understand what is going on until Gertie brings a note to her mom, Mary. She reads it and realizes what has happened. There Gertie with her mom race to the forest, then Keys finds out whats has happened. In the end, E.T. is reunited with his people, and the farewell's are touching. I still love this movie, and just recently watched it. A great movie to add to your collection that the whole family will enjoy. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, that will leave you with a great feeling in your heart."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","1","7 April 2017"," There's just no denying the magic of this film's appeal to the emotions
","It's hard to quantify what's so magical about a Steven Spielberg film. No one has directed and produced so many broad-appeal, family- centered movies as consistently well as he has. ""E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial"" combines the best of his family-friendly sensibilities with his interest in aliens and adventure stories.<br/><br/>One might argue Spielberg's openness to engage new filmmaking technologies and big, daring projects has been a leading cause of his success, but that doesn't explain the enduring appeal of films like ""E.T.,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" films, ""Jurassic Park"" and more. These films have aged impressively well despite the huge leaps in visual and special effects Hollywood has experienced in the last 30- some years.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is a reminder that Spielberg's secret lies in his stories and their ability to tap into ideas and feelings that are so fundamentally human. This little alien is a stand-in for your childhood pet, favorite stuffed animal and best (real or imaginary) friend. That had a lot to do with why it ages so well. As a child, you relate to and connect to it; as an adult, you fondly remember those feelings.<br/><br/>You can tell this is a Spielberg story despite the writing credit going exclusively to Melissa Mathison, but Mathison deserves credit for constructing the narrative in such a way that the plot matters so little to enjoying the film. Why something happens in this movie matters less than what. E.T.'s desire to go home is profound and resonant – we don't care about how he's able to pull together a ""phone"" from scratch. ""E.T."" comes alive in the moments when the characters discover and connect with this creature.<br/><br/>Those moments are Spielberg's to own, but the script creates a simple conceit to move things forward, and that's a very basic notion that the adults are going to screw things up. That's the lone force of antagonism – the adults are going to find out about E.T. and they won't understand him and they'll ruin everything. The small touches of not showing most adults from the waist up or the kids' mom (Dee Wallace) being so caught up in her own head that she doesn't notice an alien walking around her house (and posing as her daughter at one point), drive these feelings home. The movie doesn't need a traditional antagonist to keep our attention for this reason.<br/><br/>The child actors, namely Henry Thomas as Elliott and Drew Barrymore as the adorable Gertie, also have a lot to do with the success of ""E.T."" Spielberg has a knack for working with kids, but these kids had to really react like this animatronic puppet/sometimes short person in a suit was real, and had to form a genuine connection to it, and they do. Watching Elliott ball over E.T. is so relatable. Friendship and loss, having someone who understands you – these are fundamental pieces and challenges of growing up. <br/><br/>The brilliance of the film comes in Spielberg's wrapping it into a science-fiction story. So many alien films before it (including Spielberg's own ""Close Encounters"" imagine what aliens might want if they came to earth. They were scary or at least suspenseful films. ""E.T."" twists all that upside-down. The ""Star Wars"" references in the film alone place the story in a world in which we have that concept of aliens and a love for this genre, which plenty of films have done since, but not so much in 1982. Add the touch of animatronics with the subtle facial and neck movements that make ""E.T."" stand out technically from ""Star Wars"" and other films, and you end up with what was a wholly unique yet completely familiar movie.<br/><br/>The other factor to consider with a Spielberg movie is its John Williams score. The music here is highly reminiscent of Williams' work in ""Star Wars,"" but it plays such an integral role in the emotional moments. He and Spielberg are totally in sync. And frankly, scenes of kids flying on bikes would've been cheesy without the ""E.T."" theme to make them really soar. Spielberg's films have in many ways become synonymous with this majestic theme music in such a way that no one can compose like this for the movies anymore. You can't get away with it without being labeled an imitator.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is a raw appeal to the emotions and surprisingly timeless despite the ways it has been associated with the '80s (Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" owes so much to it). There's an enduring magic in it that transcends time and generational gaps. To extend it much scrutiny as a film is to miss the power of its deeply human story.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews"

"Realrockerhalloween","Null","1","1","7 September 2016"," Phone Home
","E.T. is an instant classic that defined childhood innocence and what it means to be a friend. Elliot could easily take his new found alien to the authorities for a big reward, but instead keeps him safe inside his home, feeds him, lives him and even shares an empathetic connection with the little guy. E.T. provides much of the comedy as he tries out food, gets drink on one beer and walks around during Halloween in see of the costumes as if they are real. The drama equally bounces it out as he writhers away only to resurrection on the third day and when the two share goodbyes knowing it may be the last time they are one another. I literally bawled like a baby and wished for his swift recovery.<br/><br/>What's interesting to note is E.T. noticed a Yoda costume as if he recognizes him. Later in clone wars you see E.T. like creatures in a stadium as if they share a common universe. <br/><br/>The music, special effects and amazing camera shots like the bike crossing over the moon has wowed audiences around the world. Steven Spielberg was able to transform a pretty simple film into a heart warming family film enjoyed for many years to come. Its perfectly made with no sequels to condense the original."

","What would happen if aliens exist and one of them was found by a child alive and well, but lost on our planet and eager to return to his home? This is precisely the subject of this film, which is part of the collective memory of most people and that is undoubtedly one of the most notable films of Steven Spielberg's career. Directed by him and with a script by Melissa Mathison, this film has the participation of Henry Thomas (as Elliott) and Drew Barrymore (as Gertie). The alien's voice belongs to Pat Welsh, an old woman who smoked two packs of cigarettes daily just to achieve the hoarseness required for the role (at a time when technology wasn't what we have today, that's what was done, and I just hope she didn't suffer from the lungs later).<br/><br/>Personally, I consider this the most remarkable film of Spielberg's career so far, despite the success he achieved before with ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and even of many other blockbuster films he made after. Spielberg has always shown a particular talent for sci-fi themes, very present in his work and presented here at an audience younger than what is normally the target of alien movies. Despite the theme and suspense throughout the film, we can consider it a family film. The suspense alternates with very funny moments, where children (and their interaction with their new friend) reign at all. Drew Barrymore deserves particular attention: this lovely girl, screaming like a grown, won with this film a well deserved stardom, unfortunately tapped the hard way over the next decade in an absolutely downward path, which the actress has only recently recovered. Henry Thomas was also good in his role, grabbing it with vigor and commitment. The special effects, as usual in films of this director, are excellent and the soundtrack is one of the best of John Williams. Some of the scenes on this film became so famous that come naturally to our memory and are known even to those who have never seen the movie. This is the case of the flying bike passing in front of the full moon, one of the most beautiful and striking scenes in sci-fi, along with that famous scene where E.T. finger lights touching on Elliott's forehead.<br/><br/>This film is recommended to all families of all ages. Its a truly timeless film, which was done without the massive computerization we are used to, which ends up being an advantage to make it more genuine. Moving and emotional, he entertains any audience so well that it's not surprising the huge success it had at the box office. Winner of Oscars for Best Soundtrack, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects and Best Sound (1983), it also won the Golden Globes for Best Dramatic Film and Best Soundtrack. This is that sci-fi film that will decidedly please even those who don't appreciate this kind of movies."
"Amadeus_Smith","8","1","1","23 April 2013"," Critically Acclaimed '80s Blockbuster
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is timeless, visually impressive and directorially phenomenal, that being said, while I appreciate all the uniqueness of the film, I don't really understand the universal acclaim as one of the all-time greats in cinema, nor do I agree with those who claim it to be one of the best movies of the 1980s.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, E.T. is a very enjoyable movie, a simple yet poetic story about loneliness. With a charming family-friendly basis coinciding with a not-so family friendly script, that is where the obscenities wear off and are replaced with a heartfelt story that anybody can enjoy. Even if you don't completely enjoy the film, you can still absorb the genius of Steven Spielberg and the incredibly impressive science fiction design of the focal alien 'E.T.'<br/><br/>There isn't much else worth mentioning though, a stellar soundtrack is composed by the always-ambient John Williams, and the writing is worthwhile with a few quotable and memorable lines. Whether it captured your heart or merely just your attention, I'm sure you have one or two nice things to say about this massive, critically acclaimed '80s blockbuster."

"marlow04","Null","1","1","16 September 2011"," A true classic for the entire family!
","E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)<br/><br/>A story of an extraterrestrial left behind on Earth who encounters a human boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas). He and siblings Gertie and Michael (Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton) attempt to care for and return the alien home while hiding it from their mother Mary (Dee Wallace) and the rest of the town. The extraterrestrial (dubbed E.T.) was spotted and is now being searched for by the authorities, all while the children plan his escape. This movie is widely accepted as a classic, and even though it is an alien movie produced in 1982 without modern CGI, the E.T. character is still believable today.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has once again brought to life a child-hood fantasy of an alien life-form on Earth. Elliott, the coy young boy who makes first encounter with the extraterrestrial is filled with curiosity and fear after seeing something rustling in the backyard. One theme woven throughout the film is Elliott's close connection to E.T. as Elliott clearly struggles with feelings of alienation by his brother, neighborhood bullies, and the loss of his father in divorce. This film certainly incorporates internal truths of human nature, in that Elliot and E.T.'s friendship is real and good; contrary to how these events would likely play out in reality. <br/><br/>Elliott was determined to prove to his family that he wasn't just a kid make believing, so he camped out in the backyard waiting for E.T. to show up again. After coaxing him into his home by leaving a trail of Reece's Pieces, he began building a friendship with him. His bullying older brother Michael was so surprised when he saw the alien for the first time in Elliott's bedroom; he immediately joined Elliott and younger sister Gertie in the mission to help him find a way home. This film takes full advantage of children and adult's imaginations, as nearly anyone can inject themselves into the role of one of these characters. <br/><br/>Elliott began feeling a physiological connection to E.T. when he noticed feeling drunk after E.T. was home drinking beer out of their fridge. E.T. slowly began feeling weaker and weaker here on Earth as Elliott's health also began deteriorating. Eventual capture by authorities, E.T.'s ""glowing heart"" brought him (and Elliott) back to life as they approached near death. Elliott's clear mission of getting E.T. back home kept him going and gave him purpose. The experience of this young boy and his extraordinary friend as his main confidant against all odds, reminds me of another childhood favorite, Cloak & Dagger. Also starring Henry Thomas as Davey Osborne and filmed in 1984. Davey and his imaginary friend were on the run evading bad guys to save the day. This was another situation where a young boy, against all odds, leveraged his friends and his own resourcefulness to save himself and save the day.<br/><br/>This film was often shot with a low camera angle to depict the viewpoint of Elliot, E.T., and the other children in the story. From the beginning of the film where the authorities are first after E.T. in the woods, the audience was pulled into this 4 foot tall world. Much of the films lighting mirrored the theme of connection between Elliot and E.T., and the health of these characters. The beginning of the movie was dark and foggy, which gave the audience a bit of apprehension toward this alien visit. But as Elliot and E.T. become friends, the lighting brightens and the apprehension is gone. When they become sick, the director places them in the cold, dark, and damp woods; the lighting continues to be subdued until they are both 'healed' toward the end of the film. The final run toward the landing site to enable E.T.'s escape is exciting, bright, and sunny. The use of lighting and climate helped pull the audience into the overall feeling of the characters at various points in time throughout the film. <br/><br/>Together, Elliot and E.T. won over his brother Michael, the neighborhood bullies and Elliott's mother, who finally stopped doubting Elliott. This same group supported and assisted in the escape of Elliot and E.T. from the authorities to eventually help E.T. transport home. Through the relationship built with E.T., Elliott came out of his shell and transformed from that coy young boy to a brazen young man.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

He can touch-heal a cut finger, bring dead plants to life, fly several bikes through the air and craft an interstellar communicator out of a saw blade and a Speak-n-Spell. I just can't see how a weak, slow-waddling creature with less manual dexterity than a raccoon could ever achieve interstellar flight. He certainly seemed much less intelligent when he was snarfing Earth food and drink left and right. Smart enough to build an ansible from toys, too dumb to fear food from another planet. Go figure.<br/><br/>
*************** HERE'S THE SPOILER *******************<br/><br/>If you're going to fool movie viewers into thinking something has happened, you shouldn't make it blatantly clear that it HAS happened if you're going to contradict it later. You should leave some room for doubt. When E.T. comes ""back to life"",  your manipulated emotions feel ripped off. We saw him die in extreme detail. The movie doctors describe degeneration of the body. We are led to believe that E.T. is dead in every way possible. Then, voila, he's back. Yippee.<br/><br/>Sure, you can argue that he's alien and that we don't understand aliens, but to me, that's a cop-out. Spielberg went too far to show death. Bringing E.T. back after going to so much trouble is cheap and soap-opera-like."

","I have seen this movie twice.The first time was when I was a kid and it was a lot of fun. The second time as an adult it merely irritates me with its clichés and cheesy sentimentalism. Movies like this seem to rely on the stereotypes we have about aliens. A flying disc,a creature with big head,2 eyes ,long neck . The score of J.Williams is awful. If not for the camera work and some effects this movie would have been a B-movie. Its ridiculous how this movie is so highly regarded by so many people! I doubt if todays kids will find this movie entertaining or funny. Its dated and brainless.even for kids. I find this the worst movie that S.Spielberg have ever made."

","This is a movie that I watched so that I know what happens in it. It was quite a demanding task. There are really no ideas in the movie. It is the most basic kind of story; a creature arrives, becomes a friend with a child, then there are some difficulties to overcome and finally the creature has to leave and everyone is sad.<br/><br/>The only thing that brings joy in the boring task of watching this is the performance of the then 6 years old Drew Barrymore. She was a very talented actress already as a child. But knowing how fame at early age ruined her life, it is not all joy either.<br/><br/>So, now I know what happens in E.T. and I will not watch it again. For someone who likes childish stories and doesn't mind their predictable nature, this may be an entertaining film."
"antagonist117","4","5","12","9 September 2014"," It didn't work for me as a kid, and as an adult I think I know why
","As a young kid in the early 1990s, I could not get enough ""Indiana Jones."" I'm fortunate that my parents let me watch ""Jaws,"" and I loved it. Seeing ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" at a friend's house left lasting images and ideas in my mind. But ""E.T."" did nothing for me, despite the fact that it was in theory Spielberg's most child-oriented blockbuster. When I saw it for the first and (until now) only time, I was the same demographic as the child star, but the experience was, frankly, boring. I remember feeling, if not putting into words, that the movie with the boy and the inarticulate, Yoda- like puppet was slow and cold. It was far less engaging to me than the other Spielberg titles to which I had been exposed. I don't remember if I knew that they were products of the same director, but the art of movies, which Ebert compared to ""a machine that generates empathy,"" a tool for looking at the world through different eyes, was working on me: I was already accustomed to relating to adults on screen instead of just kids. Whatever holes ""E.T."" might have filled for me as a nascent movie buff were already occupied by more ""grown-up,"" and therefore more exciting, material. If I was in the mood for pure fun with a sci-fi flavor, the ""Star Wars"" VHS tapes with their more attention-grabbing special effects and attention-keeping pace were right there. It was no contest.<br/><br/>Revisiting ""E.T."" now, I don't see much cause to regret my early rejection of it. In fact, it's probably worse now, because it's hard to find an original cut; I had to watch the ill-advised digital remaster, in which certain camera positions no longer make sense, and the actors are often looking just behind E.T. instead of at him as they presumably did when he was a puppet instead of pixels. Even ignoring the awkwardness of the digital content, which really does great damage to the feel and persona of the title character, there's little in ""E.T."" that feels real or fresh. The first part of the film takes place mainly in the home of the boy Elliott. The house always seems dim on the inside, lit by late afternoon sun even when it's midday outside. Elliott makes an emotional connection with the alien almost too easily, aided by an unexplained psychic connection between the two, and he causes some chaos with frogs in a heavy-handed scene that Spielberg seems determined to cram with ideas never to be unpacked.<br/><br/>Elliott and his older brother are bland, generic kids, and they gang up on their young sister, who is a breath of fresh air and a splash of color around the edges of the increasingly disturbing main story. It's not just that Drew Barrymore is cute in the role; she's also a natural actor, stealing scenes from all her older costars plus the alien. Having a real live Barrymore on their hands, you'd think the filmmakers would have rethought the whole thing and cast her as E.T.'s main companion. It's her, after all, who teaches E.T. his most important vocabulary words and figures out what he wants to do: ""phone home.""<br/><br/>The final act takes an unsatisfying route to this conclusion with a messily-edited, illogical home invasion by astronauts that segues into a dark riff on the massive government operation from ""Close Encounters."" It's a nightmarish cycle of silly and sad and shrill right up to the final scene, but there are two particular moments that do work. These are the iconic bicycle flights, one eclipsing the moon and the other the sun, and they are made magical and memorable with the help of John Williams's accompanying score. I might appreciate these moments more now than I did as a kid, having seen them depicted in Spielberg's production logo over the years and developed a fondness for the idea of them. But all things considered, I still think I made the right decision years ago to watch ""Star Wars"" a fifteenth time instead of ""E.T."" a second."

","Alright, alright, you got me, ET is a great movie - mostly for the little moments that Steven Spielberg captures in the first half (or first two-thirds) before it becomes the big emotional spectacle that the director deals with as something he has to do as a Capra fan. What I loved was seeing the early, 'hmm' part of Elliot/ET's friendship, where its a bit like a boy and his dog, only the ET is much more curious than a dog (and he can TALK!) I can't deny this is a director at the peak of his powers. That said, my one real 'but' is in that sense it's like his North by Northwest; Hitchcock, too, was at the peak of his powers with that, making as much a symphony as a movie. It's just not 'personal' favorite of mine (I still get more from Close Encounters).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, also like NBNW, this is a very entertaining film at its core, with a lot of shameless laughs (Gertie SCREAMS! ET SCREAMS BACK!), and it has BY FAR John Williams greatest score. It helps that he scored some of the film without even really watching the film cause it didn't all match up. I could listen to this just as classical music, not even as a 'this track goes here, that goes there' with the scenes. If it's not Spielberg's greatest film, he still gets the greatest assist from his closest collaborator."

Sure the alien had personality and looked neat, but I want MORE. Especially out of Drew Barry Moore, who really didn't give all that good a performance. I found her character to be juvenile and immature and she totally weighed down a perfectly solid flick from acclaimed director Steven Stealberg.

Although there is no denying that the relationship between the stumpy legged alien with the wide face and the human children is a nice touch, and that the little fella is a cutie, the film just doesn't have anything to say to me.<br/><br/>The kids - Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore - were fairly good, but not enough to keep the interest throughout.

"the-evil-cult","9","3","6","25 January 2004"," Good Movie, even though it's a Children's Movie
","My brother seems to hate ET. He claims that some of the scenes were ""childish."" When Harry Potter came out he refused to read it and assumed it was bad simply because it's a children's book. A lot of teenage boys nowadays seem to believe that watching children's movies is somehow shameful. They feel as if they have to pretend they hate children's movies to prove their manliness, not only to others but also to themselves.<br/><br/>While struggling to find a reason why ET wasn't good, my brother cited Spielberg's portrayal of adults and scientists as evil. He said it was ""simplistic."" But this is a legitimate theme. Many believe that children start off innocent and as they grow older society corrupts them. Others believe children start off silly and as they grow older they mature and become better people. This concept has been pondered over for centuries by ethicists and lawyers. Why do you think children under 10 cannot be charged for murder? The legal system claims they are not capable of forming a guilty mind. This concept is far from ""simplistic."" And anyway, to all young boys scientists and adults are scary, and this movie was told from the perspective of the little boys. So of course the adults are portrayed as evil!<br/><br/>There is virtually no flaw with this movie apart from the slight overacting by Elliot, but all in all he is one of the best child actors I've seen on screen, much better than the kid off Last Action Hero. ET has good plot, good characterization, good soundtrack, and good visual effects. It's a movie you cannot hate unless you try hard to hate it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for most people watching movies is about carving out an identity. People try to define their character by the sorts of movies they watch. So if you like to think of yourself as some tough guy, you'd force yourself to watch violent action movies and then go around telling everyone how much you loved these movies so others can acknowledge your identity. These are the sorts of people who scream out ""chick flick"" at any romance movie to conform to the stereotype that men can't tolerate romance.<br/><br/>It's sad that the objectivity of movie reviewing is now corrupted by vanity.<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I was 7, I loved E.T. and thought it was brilliant.  As time passed, I couldn't help but see all of Spielberg's little inclusions that make this not only typical, but outstandingly mediocre.  Spielberg loves making his ideal worlds the same as John Hughes, complete with similar endings.  This defines the 80s...<br/><br/>First off we have the white, middle-class, suburban family.  Briefly touched on in Jaws, this idea only grew with Close Encounters, 1941, and Poltergeist.  He even includes it as a subtle trait in Minority Report.  If Steven is trying to invoke fear or wonder that ""this could happen to you"", he profoundly fails.  Diversity is obviously not one of his strong suits. Cameron sticks to professionals (whether soldiers, workers, colonists, but never sees them as people) and Tarantino has gangsters, therein lies the common trait of directing.<br/><br/>The character of E.T. in itself is too innocent.  I would love to have seen what Cronenberg would have done with this story.  We get the typical Spielberg ""happy"" and ""sad"" moments (B-O-O-H-O-O, cry me a river) full of phony emotion that other directors have tried copying ever since.  While this is a delight for the intellectually devoid in film, I gag at it.<br/><br/>Worse yet, we now have the ""safer"" special edition loaded with a few extra seconds and altered footage (I thought Michael Moore was the only one who did that) that adds NOTHING to the story.  I am sick of it...<br/><br/>Overall, you don't need to see this movie to understand Spielberg.  To think that Das Boot defeated it for the technical awards is a complete abomination on the Academy of Fools' part.  1 out of 5 stars."
"norbc","10","3","6","17 August 2003"," One of Spielberg's best
","It may not be as obvious today as when the movie was made, but ET remains one of the very few alien movies in which the alien is not a threat to humanity. What a novel idea! And what a wonderful way to explore human themes, including the paranoia that if aliens do exist, then they must surely mean us some harm or otherwise be harmful. But it goes far deeper than that, commenting on lost innocence of adults and the need at times to perhaps rely more on the approach of the innocent, approaching the new with wide eyes but without fear or preconceptions. But, hey, never mind all the heavy stuff, ET is just plain a good, fun, funny story, a romp with a tremendous imagination and great acting and directing. And if you're looking to buy it, get the updated version. . . It's actually better than the original, Spielberg having included a couple more scenes left out of the original which improve the continuity, and subtle but effective updating of ET's facial expressions, thanks to more modern computer graphic capabilities. It's a rare instance in which the revised version after the fact is a big improvement rather than a detriment."

What at first looks like a ugly creature, becomes a good friend during the movie.<br/><br/>It's not the special effects that makes E.T. so great, but much more the depth of characters. The meaning of the word soulmates gets a whole new dimension. For me E.T. was an instant classic, the moment I saw it for the first time. Although some might consider that this film is a tearjerker, I believe that E.T. (and his well casted friends) are worth every tear you shed.

","E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982) **** Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert McNaughton, Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote, Tom Howell (C. Thomas Howell), KC Martel, Sean Frye, Erika Eleniak. Steven Spielberg's classic sci-fi masterpiece about a lonely boy (Thomas in a remarkably natural debut) who befriends a stranded, freightened alien and the bond that strengthens between the two. Fantastic special effects, John Williams' heart warming score, and Carlo Rambaldi's creation of E.T. earned Oscars as well as for sound, stand out as well as Melissa Mathison's (that's Mrs. Harrison Ford to you!) wonderful script conveys beautifully how the human spirit can truly be. Speaking of spiritual, it is somewhat surprising just how spiritual the film is (i.e.: E.T.'s healing powers and 'resurrection'). Memorable scenes: E.T.'s getting drunk and Thomas sharing his feelings (particularly the wonderful set up to his kiss with the towering Eleniak {who would be best known as the gravity-defying Elly May Clampett in the big screen version of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""}); Wallace not noticing E.T. on Halloween; E.T. fixing Thomas' ""ouch""; and one for the film vaults: the flight of the bicycles. In a word: perfect. ** incidentally I first saw this when I was 14 and the day I saw it my mom informed me and my sister she was divorcing my dad, so I totally relate to Thomas. ** Noteworthy trivia: yes that is Debra Winger's voice as one of the many elements that went into the voice of E.T."

","These two words spoken by E.T. and Elliott, respectively, is the heart of this beautiful fable of a young boy and his meeting and eventual love for an extra-terrestrial being.<br/><br/>Elliott's (Henry Thomas) love is returned in full by E.T., hence E.T.'s desire for Elliott to come home' with him.<br/><br/>This makes for a delightful story with all the suspense, laughter and devotion that any good film could ever have.<br/><br/>The interaction between Elliott and his family is so finely fashioned that it is completely believable.  (The torturing of the doll brought back a few memories.) There is a truth to their interactions that adds so much to the believability of the film.<br/><br/>Just because a movie relies on children to tell a story doesn't make it a children's film.  While this is a family film' there are some issues around language and the death of E.T. that the parents of some children may find objectionable.  Also, parents that cannot control their children should not bring them to a theater where people are actually trying to quietly enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>The new revamped Twentieth Anniversary edition of this film classic adds a few scenes, digitally expands on the facial and body movements of E.T. (which couldn't be done with the puppet in the original filming) and removes the guns in one scene.  I must admit that when I saw this film when it came out in 1982 the thought that the children were, on some level, threatened with guns bothered me.  I am glad to see that they are gone.<br/><br/>When this film came out it added the `E.T., phone home.' phrase to the American lexicon.<br/><br/>The stirring score was the product of the genius of film music: John Williams.

ET is to beloved childhood films (say, The Yearling, or Sammy Going South, or The Thief of Bagdad, or any of Disney's best works) what the Twinky is to homemade apple strudel.<br/><br/>I'll leave aside the obvious contrivances of the concept, and the utter lack of likability of the rubberized title character. Instead, I'll note the main element that made me detest this film: the manipulative illogic of the central premise. We are expected to see the parents as the villains, even though they're clearly not. We are expected to cheer the brave, resourceful kids who actually accomplish nothing other than a needless escape from people who are clearly trying to help them.<br/><br/>There's no other semblance of tension here, so if that collapses - and it does, in a great putrid, oozing ball of schmaltz - there's precious little left. Spielberg is a brilliant technician, and he's made a few truly outstanding films. But ET is Spielberg at his soppy, sentimental, nauseating worst.

But the nice part is that, unlike the original, embarrassing tale, this version makes absolutely no demands; one is not required to change one's cushy and acquisitive life, to sell one's worldly stuffed toys or love one's enemies or turn the other cheek; in Spielberg's soggy vision, all you need is sentimentality, and the suburbs go on as before."

I cannot remember most of the jokes and dialogue in the movie, but I remember the big picture still.  After all, the movie is still popular.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that Spielberg entered in this movie some of the best aspects of filmaking and also some of the worst.  The movie is magical, especially for a young child.  The relationship between E.T. and the boy is indeed heartwarming, and the special effects are good enough to compete with Cameron. However, the disappointing aspects of this film overweighed the good in my mind.  This movie was rated PG-13 in some European countries.  Why? Spielberg lures kids in to watch this movie, only to tell them that parents are close-minded and completely out of touch with kids, while also encouraging children to defy their parents when they ""know"" all the answers. Now granted, Spielberg doesn't come right out and say it, but for very young kids, this atmosphere could be harmful.<br/><br/>Moreover, much of the movie is directed to people who fall in love with lots of cute things.  I don't mind cute movies, but it is overdone in a movie which is meant to be a sci-fi movies for kids, and a serious drama for adults.  There are also many contrivances and plot holes that I believe are only accepted because the director was Speilberg and because it was a ""cool"" sci-fi flick.  However these do not affect my rating of the movie, as I also am willing to ignore some poor or formulaic writing when the rest of the movie is great.<br/><br/>It seems I am in the minority on this movie.  Even AFI has it 25th best all time on their list.

Some people mistakenly consider it warm and endearing, but to me it is nothing but shameless manipulation by a cynical director.<br/><br/>I can't believe so many people swallowed that sugar coated turd served by a money-grabbing team of filmmakers led by the master of crap himself: Mr. Schpielberg."

","E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A lonely young boy (Henry Thomas) finds a stranded alien who he calls E.T. and must help him get back home. It's rather strange how sentimental this movie is because the farthest back in life that I can remember is my mother taking me to see this on opening night. If the release date for this on IMDb is correct then I 25 months and 2 days old. It's strange but I still remember just about every feeling that I was feeling while watching the movie then and I still fondly remember the reaction that the other kids were having while watching the movie. All these years later I still have the same affection towards the film and it still makes me lose it like a little girl just like it did when I first watched it. I certainly don't think this is a movie for young kids due to various subject matters including death but I once read an interview with Spielberg who said it was a film for anyone who believes. This is certainly one of the most magical movies out there due to its sense of wonder and its meaning of friendship. In a lot of science-fiction movies we really don't get to know or feel for the characters but that's not the case here because the screenplay is so smart that we learn all sorts of facts about not only the humans but E.T. himself. Thomas gives the greatest performance here that I've ever seen from a child but I'd probably go even further by calling it one of the greatest ever put to film. The range of emotions he has to display is rather amazing considering his age. Dee Wallace, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Peter Coyote are all very good as well. The greatest performance in the film has to go to the special effects that created E.T. and made him one of the most memorable characters in the history of film. The 2002 ""CGI enhanced"" version is pure garbage but the original creature is one of the greatest to ever come to the screen and it's just amazing at how well he holds up and how human they were able to make him. With his funny talk, silly walk and human eyes, he really is one of the most loved characters in film history. I also find John Williams score to be the best work of his career and it certainly gives an extra charge to all of the scenes, especially at the end."

","In my book, Spielberg made one movie worth watching: ""Close Encounters."" Its in the French tradition, and really has some depth. Afterwards, he had a disastrous ""1941,"" and then his adventure with George Lucas, someone who actually understood how to center on entertainment first.<br/><br/>Afterwards, we've been served nothing but polished, empty entertainment, cinematic junk food. This is his first of that period since Lucas. Its amazing success worked against us all because it froze this possible talent in a worthless mode.<br/><br/>Seeing it today makes me notice its flaws. The impending doom of the ""scientists."" The goofy bike chase. The pretend mom. The backstory about the father who abandons his family. The character of the two boys. None of this works. Its almost Ed Wood category.<br/><br/>There are three things that do. The jokes of course. The endearing creature. And third was something of a surprise. Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>I actually think that if she had been replaced by someone else, this movie wouldn't have worked as well. She's the anchor. The whole story is anchored in innocence and though she has a minor role, she embodies that innocence. <br/><br/>She's gone on to have a rather influential and successful career. As I write this, she is actually someone in the industry who knows her craft, understands her limits, readily exploits her strengths and seems to do intelligent and hard things.<br/><br/>Its sad seeing this, watching a filmmaker die (represented by the ""scientist"" who can only watch and record while important things happen without him). But its rather wonderful seeing a youngster ready to replace him. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","I love many films.  The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca and scores of others are all masterpieces.  The French New Wave has got to be one of the greatest cinema movements ever made.  I love films that are thought-provoking and stimulate debate among those you see it with (i.e. Fight Club, Bowling for Columbine et al).<br/><br/>But when it comes down to the bottom line, the best movie ever made is a film from my childhood -- E.T. -- The Extra-Terrestrial.  Pretty much everything in this movie is flawless.  Henry Thomas brings in a performance of a 10-year-old boy mature beyond his years.  The John Williams score is among one of his best.  Steven Spielberg was at his peak with this film. To me it all ""clicks"" together.  And for me, by the time the film is over, I'm bawling like a baby when E.T. and Elliott must say goodbye at the end.<br/><br/>There are lots of great movies out there, but for me, NOTHING can touch E.T.!"

Even as a kid though I got quickly bored of this on and today I never want to see it again.  I will say I really enjoyed it the first and second time I saw it, but I have to say this movie is definitely for kids and they will get the most enjoyment of seeing Elliot help the little alien call his friends to pick him up.

Seriously, I can tolerate and even luxuriate in sentimentality if it serves a legitimate artistic purpose. At least ""Madama Butterfly"" (as just one example) manages to marry the flowing tears with wonderful music. Or, if you want to stick with movies, how about ""On Borrowed Time,"" the 1939 cinematic masterpiece that just happened to star the great uncle of ""E.T.""'s own cutesy version of a Barrymore."

","Picture the scene. It is 1982. Three 19 year old young men decide to go to the cinema to find out what all the fuss is about. This is not a demographic that is easily impressed, and certainly not by a ""kids"" film. We arrive to find a queue around the block. As we are waiting, the audience from the previous showing file out past us, nearly all in tears. We pay our money and take our seats. The house is packed. And, for the duration of the film, everyone is enthralled by the simple but beautiful story that plays out on the screen. The audience laughs, cries, whoops and gasps as one. At the final cut, as the lights come up, the three friends turn to each other and simultaneously admit,""That was good!"" That was an understatement of course. It was fantastic, and has never been bettered. To judge the effects by today's standards is silly, and to criticize it as ""manipulative"" is really to pay it a high compliment. That is what good films and stories do, manipulate the audience or the readers' emotions. E.T. does this so well, and with such brilliant use of the medium and techniques of cinema that it must surely be regarded as one of the best films ever made."
"caseynicholson","10","2","4","18 May 2015"," A Marvelous Classic that Holds Up Well Across the Years
","Yesterday I saw ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" at a theater screening for my hometown historic theater's classic film series. I was excited to see the film, because my memory of E.T. from my youth was that it was indeed a really great movie. By the same token, though, I was a bit apprehensive about watching it again as an adult. I've grown up to be a bit of a harsh critic from time to time, so I wondered whether or not I'd like the movie at all now that I'm in my thirties.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that I found ""E.T."" to be just as memorable and as momentous of a film now as I did when I saw it in the theater as a kid. This film is an all around classic. The story is familiar enough: a space ship crashes to earth, the lone survivor has to fend for himself in a foreign world (i.e. earth), and in doing so he meets a young boy who takes him in, shelters him, and tries to assimilate him into the family. As the film progresses E.T. learns a few words in English, at which point he is able to communicate that he wants to ""phone home"", meaning call other members of his extraterrestrial species to come get him so he can go back to the stars. The rest of the film revolves around the events that take place as E.T. goes about this task with the help of his adopted family.<br/><br/>That having been said, the thing that really stands out about this movie is that it is a triumph for movie making and storytelling. As I have said in so many of my reviews, my philosophy on good film--and this is something that my understanding of has emerged as a result of writing these reviews here on IMDb--is that good movie making is, at its core, good storytelling. A film that can clearly, cogently, and cohesively communicate its story in a way that is entertaining tends to be a good film, period. Modern special effects are nice, and action has its place in certain films. But so often these days we see films made on the ""Transformers"" model of film making which sacrifices the clear communication of a compelling narrative in exchange for large scale CGI effects, explosions, etc.<br/><br/>""E.T."" has none of that. It's most advanced special effects seem to have all been physically made (the space ship scene looks suspiciously like a hot air balloon at one point). E.T. himself appears to have been either a costume or a robot of some sort, not a computer generated animation (with the film having come out in 1982 this is surely the case). There is, of course, the iconic bicycling scenes that clearly were the work of some creative green screen camera work, and those scenes are neat in terms of how they are done in the film. But the point here is that despite this being a film that deals with an alien with magical powers, there are no gratuitous special effects in this movie that don't fit in well with the gist of the film or serve its plot well. The effects serve the story and contribute to the story rather than the reverse.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, what we're left with is a grand 80's movie that is both fun and light hearted yet also poignant and emotional. This movie truly tugs at your heart strings at certain moments, and its good, creative and well designed narrative makes you care about its characters in a way that not all movies are able to replicate. As I sat watching this movie in the theater yesterday, at a certain point in the film I heard a young child boohooing over what had happened to E.T. in the last thirty minutes of the film, only to then have his tears turn to joy when E.T.'s plight resolved to the positive. I couldn't help but think that somewhere in the back of my memory that was surely my own experience when I saw this movie as a four or five year old when it was first in theaters in the early 80's. The power of this film is cross generational--and that's both fascinating and endearing.<br/><br/>If I had anything negative to say at all about ""E.T."" it might be that in spite of its overall appeal, there is a bit of a cheesy feel to certain elements of the movie. But no sooner than I say that, I remind myself that this is a film that is made for adolescents and youth, and was a true family movie. Cheesiness is okay in this context. That said, I can see how ""E.T."" could be rightly compared to Steven Spielberg's other 80's youth classic, ""The Goonies"". Overall both films have a very similar vibe going on, even if the Goonies is a tad bit more straight forward with its comedic value.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to give ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" 10/10 stars. I toyed with the idea of a 9, but for me this film's strengths greatly surpass any relative weaknesses. It's a grand picture that provides a model of good movie making that Hollywood could learn from today.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, as a brief aside, I'd simply advise you to now go and do an online search for ""E.T. Star Wars theory"". Mind. Blown. You're welcome."
"GeorgeRoots","7","2","4","27 September 2014"," Spielbergs Charming Movie About A Lost Alien Still Holds Up ""Well Enough"".
","Has ""E.T."" stood the test of time? I do consider it a classic, and it does a service to the Family, Sci-Fi genre. It started with Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (Which I prefer), and ever since it has been replicated to death and only rarely does it appeal to all ages anymore (J.J. Abrams did a very good job in 2011 with ""Super 8"", which was also produced by Spielberg).<br/><br/>It tells the story of Elliott (Henry Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an extraterrestrial (Dubbed ""E.T.""), who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings try to help it return home, while attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government. A government that replaces its guns with walkie-talkies in the 2002 re-release (Thanks whoever's decision was that).<br/><br/>To be honest with you all, I feel the film is ""getting there"". I mean no one ever really talks about it extensively anymore, we just acknowledge it and sadly I admit to channel flicking to something else. So what I still enjoy about this film is that E.T. STILL looks totally convincing, proving that the effects of this movie is timeless and has that trademark fantasy that Spielberg incorporates into many of his movies. It would also be incredibly wrong not to say that some of its movies scenes are unforgettable, as well as that unbelievable music score by John Williams.<br/><br/>But what I am starting to dislike about the movie are a few things. For as good as Henry Thomas is as a child actor, his voice is a scratch on a chalkboard and sometimes it just comes off a little too dramatic and unreal a performance. And finally, just the overall length of this movie feels like they stretch it out for all its worth. I know you could say that they are trying to get you to connect more with all the characters, but after viewing the movie over 6 times it never really worked for me like Spielberg's other work and kind of leaves me bored and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Ultimately I think the film still holds up well in the effects, and the overall acting. But even though you know how classic this film is, it feels like a chore in order to watch it from beginning to end. Regardless it's in my Blu-ray collection, Walkie-talkies an' all. 7.5/10."
"aharmas","10","2","4","1 July 2014"," Spielberg's Best
","Originally titled ""A Boy's Story"", it eventually changed its title and made its way to the top of the box office, a critics' darling, and audiences fell in love with the story of a lonely boy who finds his soul mate, has the adventure of a lifetime, and eventually has to say goodbye to the friendly alien from another galaxy.<br/><br/>Done with much love and care by Spielberg, with a great score by John Williams that captures the heart, soul, and just about every emotion of the main characters, we get to experience, much like Elliot does, the emotional journey of the stranded alien, as he learns that there is much magic and wonder on this planet.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is full of wondrous scenes, some of them depending on flawless editing and Williams' score. The original meeting between Elliot and E.T. is a work of genius, as the young man is faced with deciding whether he's about to embark on an unknown and dangerous enterprise, but there is something magical ready to be discovered, and we join him for the ride.<br/><br/>What makes the film interesting is the point of view used to tell the story. For the first half of the story, we rarely see the faces of the adults. It's only the children who convey the transition of E.T., as he discovers the customs of humans, communication, and a love for food. The children realize they've encountered a very special human being, with a spirit of gold and much kindness. This doesn't mean the film drags in anyway. It's full of humor, physical comedy, and great improvisational lines, mostly by Barrymore, in a sensational and memorable debut. She commands the screen with her eyes, her voice, and very dry delivery that reveal, she's both innocent and quite sophisticated for her years.<br/><br/>Wallace does lovely work as the mother who must deal with the recent separation from her husband, three growing kids, and the arrival of a new family member. For the longest time, the presentation of her routine reminds us how difficult it is to be a good parent, even with all the best of loving intentions. She sees only so much, and it reminds us in the audience, that it is so easy to lose control, and that we should be more aware of our children's needs. It's not to fault her or anyone. It's just an observation in this fantastic script, one that manages to introduce an alien without sacrificing the humanity in everyone involved. Simple lines like, ""he's got D.N.A."" reminds us that we are not that different.<br/><br/>There are powerful moments, and it is impossible to leave the theater with a dry eye, as we get to feel the pain of the separation that Elliot experiences when E.T. gets sick. There is a heartbreaking moment expertly shown by Spielberg, as the kids realize they might have lost E.T. forever, and interestingly, much like ""The Exorcist"" shows the worst scenes by giving us a look into some invasive medical procedures, it's devastating to see Gertie's composure shatter when E.T. is being revived by the doctors.<br/><br/>There are mirror scenes in the movie, involving a certain group of bicycles, and you had better be prepared to let your spirits soar, as Elliot literally takes flight. It's no surprise that image became a classic reminder of what powerful magical medium movies can be."
"Hey_Sweden","10","2","4","24 May 2014"," Still very effective 32 years later.
","Steven Spielbergs' beloved alien encounter classic truly touches a nerve. How many of us who experienced this film as a child came away completely unaffected? It's ultimately a touching story of childhood innocence, devotion, and friendship; the friend in question just happens to be an alien being. Beautifully acted by its principals - and, yes, that should include E.T. himself, who's brought to life by a talented effects crew - this sometimes funny, sometimes a little spooky, and always heartfelt story, scripted by Melissa Mathison, still has the ability to move this viewer who's now seeing it from the perspective of a 41 year old adult.<br/><br/>John Williams contributes another of his majestic, iconic music scores, the cinematography by Allen Daviau is excellent, and Spielbergs' storytelling savvy is at its peak. This film moves forward extremely well, and the one hour & 55 minute run time pretty much flies by.<br/><br/>An alien botanist gets stranded on Earth when his spaceship leaves without him; soon, he's discovered by troubled youngster Elliott (Henry Thomas), who does everything in his power to hold on to his new friend and provide for him in any way that he can. He knows that if word got out, that adults would just want to exploit and examine the poor creature. Fortunately, E.T. is sufficiently intelligent to be able to figure out a means of contacting his home planet, so it becomes a matter of spiriting him away so the rendezvous can take place.<br/><br/>This viewer will admit that as a child he just felt like bawling at the finale, but even at this age, his eyes didn't exactly remain dry. There is a fundamental sweetness and charm to all of this that helps it to hold up after all this time. Tellingly, adult characters are very minimal in the mounting drama, save for the always appealing Dee Wallace as Elliotts' mother Mary and Peter Coyote as the basically well intentioned government agent known only as ""Keys"". Drew Barrymore is adorable and natural as the sister and Robert MacNaughton is fine as older brother Michael. That's C. Thomas Howell as Tyler and Erika Eleniak as the girl in the science class.<br/><br/>This remains among the best of Spielbergs' filmography and is worth introducing to each successive generation.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

With a fun adventure and story, Spielberg pulls the audience into a believable world with characters that feel real and a mission to get a stranded alien back home.<br/><br/>After discovering an alien hiding in his backyard, a young boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas) and his siblings keep the alien hidden while he sets up a communications array to contact his planet. <br/><br/>One of the best parts of this film is with the casting and acting. With the main cast consisting primarily of younger actors, they do not weigh the film down like most child actors do. <br/><br/>Another things this film can do well is pull emotions out of the audience. This lacks in a lot of famous films, but the sympathy and connections you feel with the characters makes you care about what is happening as if you were the one involved.<br/><br/>Like other films by Spielberg, primarily ""Jurassic Park"", ""E.T."" has a target audience of everyone and will appeal to people of all ages. My only complaint is that I could not hear the dialog at some points but I write that off to my poor sound system. Either way, ""E.T."" is a fun sci-fi adventure film that will appeal to any age group."

","There is no denying that E.T is one of the greatest movies ever made and that E.T is one of the most memorable movie characters ever. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, considering the story evolves around 3 kids and an alien friend. They are all energetic, excited and simply have passion for their roles.<br/><br/>The story itself is simply brilliant. When I first watched E.T, I expected it to be one boy, who must by himself venture to return his alien friend home, simply due to the fact that no-one believes him nor will they assist him. Every time I would guess this will be next, the plot completely takes an unexpected turn, making the film all the better. The story itself is very touching and simply a joy to watch! Nothing went wrong with this film. It was funny, it was sad, it was exciting and simply a treat to the watch! All the characters are extremely brilliant in this film. We got the little sisters, Gerly. She's awesome. She has some touching moments with E.T, such as when she teaches him to speak. She is funny and simply a great addition to the story. Then we have Mike, Elliot's older brother who seems like a bully but ends up growing a heart due to this little alien friend. His character was the most unexpected to me as I expected him to go spreading rumors about everything and bail out on Elliot.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's directing for the film is brilliant. Though the film takes a while to get going, in fact over an hour, this film is packed with excitement, humor, emotion that its purely great, unlike other classics such as 2001 A Space Odyssey where nothing happens.<br/><br/>Even though this isn't even worth mentioning, John Williams soundtrack for the movie is absolutely amazing! It kills on every scene, especially when played more intensely! The film is made all the more better as this soundtrack not only makes you love the movie more, it also makes you imagine soundtracks such as Williams' classic Star Wars and Indiana Jones soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, E.T: The Extra Terrestrial is directed by one of the greatest, if not the greatest movie director of all time who brought to us one of his finest movies, making this one of the greatest movies.

It tells the story of Elliott, a lonely boy who befriends an extraterrestrial, dubbed ""E.T."", who is stranded on Earth.It is co- produced and directed by Steven Spielberg; and it was written by Melissa Mathison.<br/><br/>Elliott, a young boy living with his single mother, his older brother Michael, and his younger sister Gertie. He often seems lonely and out of sorts, lost in his own world. One day, while looking for something in the back yard, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. And he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the ""little squashy guy,"" perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's hit about a stranded alien and his loving relationship with a fatherless boy struck a chord with audiences everywhere, and it furthered his reputation as a director of equally strong commercial sensibilities and classical leanings. Henry Thomas gives a strong, emotional performance as E.T.'s young friend, Robert MacNaughton and Drew Barrymore make a solid impression as his siblings, and Dee Wallace is lively as the kids' mother.It is an appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the children's' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T.And playing as both an exciting sci-fi adventure and a remarkable portrait of childhood, this touching tale of a homesick alien remains a piece of movie magic for young and old.It remains a classic to this day after many decades of release."

","There's no doubt in my mind this is a 10 movie. I saw it when it came out, and it floored me. After 30 years I find it still hits my emotional nerve each time. The special bond that develops between Elliot and ET is just priceless. Stephen Spielberg wrote the book on entertainment with this movie. Some may see the story as corny or overly emotional, but I feel it covers all the major elements for a truly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>I just know kids today will fault ET, wondering where all the CGI is, but if they look past the lack of modern moviology they can find an exciting two hours, and maybe learn something about themselves in the process."

","ET was one movie I grew up watching and enjoying. I loved the characters, music and famous scenes that brought it back to cinema about ten years after. But, giving it a re-watch I realized the movie was on a very slow pace for a majority of the movie and there were only smalls scenes or such that brought high entertainment. The effects of the extra-terrestrial were just average, the character ET looked quite fake at times, but what can I expect it was created in 1982, there was no CGI or high powered effects. The movie exceeded it's limit and should of finished thirty minutes after, too much slow paced dialog and impatient waiting to see what's going to happen next. Apart from that, it's still just a good movie, the acting is okay, characters (apart from ET) are again okay, overall a nice family movie but with it's exceeding parts that slows the movie down is a high negative."

","I first saw E.T when I was about 8. To me it was just like any other film, I didn't cry or laugh and to be honest it scared me a bit. Then when I was 16, I sat down to watch it and I have not been the same since. It was INCREDIBLE. I started out laughing, then the music gave me a lump in my throat and before I knew it I was sobbing uncontrollably and I did for most of the day. E.T can move even the most intense and cynical of people and make them remember how truly beautiful life can be. The Cast is fabulous, with admirable performances by Mcnaughton and Barrymore, but Henry Thomas gives a performance like no other in this, film acting way beyond his years. The films central relationship is the kind of friendship that is envied by us all. John Williams's music is beautifully adapted to story telling and it moves you to such an extent you can't think about anything else all day. So if you haven't seen this film, you haven't lived. I don't care if you're a tiny child, a moody teenager or an old age pensioner. This is without a doubt the most magical film ever, it completely changed my perspective on life and if you haven't seen it then see it now.<br/><br/>10/10."

"FilmFanatic09","10","2","4","10 December 2006"," E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
","If it is possible for a single shot to sum up an entire film, the shot of the bicycle racing across the moon does that for ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial."" For those who were introduced to ""E.T."" during their childhood, the film will always offer an unparalleled nostalgia. Spielberg wisely sets the film in American suburbia, a place where many of us feel instantly at home. It is here we are introduced to the family E.T. will soon call his, loving headed by single mother Dee Wallace. Of course, besides E.T. himself, the true stars here are the children (Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton, and Henry Thomas). Precocious Barrymore offers innocence and humor to every scene she's in and Thomas, as our hero Elliott, brings maturity far beyond his years to the screen. Who would have imagined that one of the most affecting relationships ever captured on film would be that between a little boy and a visitor from outer space? <br/><br/>Special effects are certainly essential to this movie, and Spielberg is unquestionably a master of them, but for the movie to work, we can't simply look at E.T. and ask, ""How'd they do that?"" We have to feel the same connection with him Elliot feels. And we do. We sense the homesickness in E.T.'s over-sized eyes. We marvel as he gives life to a flower and puts on a magic show with a model of the solar system. We delight in his fondness for Reese's Pieces. We instinctually know that his glowing red heart is so very good. And when he asks to phone home, we are touched more than seems natural for three little words. I don't cry easily at films. Very few, including those about the most disheartening tragedies, actually bring me to tears. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that ""E.T."" is one which did. <br/><br/>While displaying more profundity in numerous ways, ""E.T."" never forgets its roots as a science-fiction film. Though sci-fi doesn't necessarily require this, many films in the genre deal with the sky and what exists beyond it. Back at the turn of the century when film was still in its infancy, one of the first sci-fi features, Méliès' ""A Trip to the Moon,"" featured space exploration as its theme. ""The Thing from Another World,"" cult classic of the 1950s, offered its classic warning ""Watch the skies!"" However, ""E.T."" is different from these and other like films. As opposed to driving the plot with conflict between creatures from different worlds, ""E.T."" allows them to exist as friends. Science-fiction films are successful when they capture an audience's imagine. ""E.T."" certainly does. But in many scenes it goes beyond that, such as when that bike soars across the moon. It makes our hearts soar too."
"GOWBTW","10","2","4","9 November 2006"," Endearing!
","Knowing to me this is like the G-rated version of the X-Files. But this has a lot of heart. You got a young boy named Elliot(Henry Thomas) who goes out on a quest with the others. Then one night, he throws a ball out into the shed, and he's freaked. Later out in the field, he's sees a strange creature shrieking at him. That creature was an alien botanist who is simply known as E.T. That same night E.T. retrieves the Reese's Pieces Candy that was left on the ground earlier. The government where on the trail of E.T., one of them finds the candy and samples it. Keeping E.T. from the government is one thing, keeping it from the mom is another. The older brother and sister Gertie(Drew Barrymore) both meet the creature and reacted the same way Elliot did. Now all three have met it, they take equal actions for its well being. With all the fun they have, one will learn after the other. E.T.: ELLIOT, E.T. PHONE HOME, and OUCH. I bet each one have their own talent as well. There was plenty of everything, drama, comedy, love, and intrigue. The ending was a tear-jerker, but who says it had to end on a sad note? Not me. This movie here is really fun for the whole family, and for all ages. 5 Stars!"

Yet people will not give credit to films like this, or the Green Mile. These films should be in the top 50 films for all time.

","I think this is Spielberg's best movie. I have been watching this film for almost 24 years. I never tire of it, when E.T's family come down to earth and forget to wait for E.T who wondered off a little too far. He walks around and Eliot Aka Henry Thomas finds him in the shed while he's playing baseball. He tries to see him so people don't think he's crazy, he finds the creature loves sweets, he led the alien to his room. He gets to know the creature and shows him all his things and feeds him, they become the best of friends. He tells his big brother Aka Robert MacNaughton and little sister Aka Drew Barrymore they kept him in secret. E.T misses his family, and they find he wants to phone home, E.T couldn't use a normal phone. He had to make a connection toy to call home, he collected everything he will need and they went to the forest and set everything up. They waited and waited. E.T became very sick and so did Eliot, they were both dying and rushed to hospital. Luckily Eliot and E.T survived. The boys decide to take E.T back to his spaceship where he called his family. Everyone says goodbye as E.T goes home. There are some great scenes which Henry Thomas and E.T are saying goodbye and it expresses how much E.T means to the boy aka Henry Thomas and how much E.T loves Eliot. IT was a unique story of friendship a special unique one between two people and of course of loneliness and never to take anything fo granted because you never know when you may lose them."

","Okay, everyone knows what happens in ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", so I'll look at some certain things in it. There's Steven Spielberg's common theme of the father abandoning the family (although I have to admit, I didn't realize that until I read an interview with Spielberg). When I was young, my favorite scene was always the bicycle chase, especially the scene where they knock the siren off of the police car (or even when the truck is dragging the plastic tube with the scientists). I guess that overall, this movie is also a look at the suburban shift that was sweeping the country at the time. All in all, Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace-Stone, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore and Peter Coyote all phoned home some good performances."

"Mr-JAFO","9","2","4","1 March 2004"," Part funny, part moving, entirely original.
","I saw this movie on its first release in 1.982 (when I was 6) and a lot of times since then (the last one, last weekend on TV), and my feelings didn't change at all: it's a pleasure for me to watch this movie. It can be childish, as some users may say, but it was essentially made for children (when I first saw it I was a kid), and, like some user said, for good-hearted people (that's a thing that can't grow old).<br/><br/>First, I found it funny for some special moments (the first meetings between the alien and all -one by one- of the family members, when ET got drunk and caused an identical effect on Elliot, and the following scene in his classroom -kiss included-) that are simply great. Especially good was the boy who lay down to make Elliot arrive to the girl's lips, and the ride on the streets in the Halloween day, how he confused a fake ""Yoda"" with his ""home"".<br/><br/>Moving, because of ET's ""humanity"" (when he saw Elliot's finger wounded he immediately cured it and he made a sacrifice trying to save Elliot's life), <br/><br/>his powers (especially when he made Elliot's bicycle and later all the boys' lift and fly), his feelings (his desperation for finding himself lost in a distant planet and not finding an answer to his calls, that made him sad almost till death), and the final farewell, the final top to the movie.<br/><br/>Original, because it shows an alien in a different point of view. Most of the ""aliens"" films before (e. g., ""Alien"") and even after (e. g. ""Independence Day"" and/or ""Mars Attacks"") show evil aliens that try to invade the Earth and/or exterminate Manhood. This alien is good, has his feelings, and a great heart inside.<br/><br/>Like ET (the character), ET (the movie) has got a great heart. Watch it."

Sure, the scientists come off as a bit frightening, but they aren't malevolent. There are only two adults who really play roles (the detective guy and the mother), and both are ""in touch with their feelings"" and, while not always acting towards the same goals as the kids, they never act remotely evil.<br/><br/>This is a great Film.

He made this film for children, the film is about children and children only. if you notice in the film the children play a more dominant role than adults.

"sdillon-1","10","2","4","30 July 2003"," Spielberg's finest film.
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>It is criminal Steven Spielberg didn't win Oscars for best picture and director for E.T.  This is, in my opinion, not only Spielberg's finest film. It's the best children's film ever made.<br/><br/>Of course everyone is now familiar with the story of the abandoned alien befriending the boy Elliot (played brilliantly by Henry Thomas), but what is often overlooked are the darker elements of the story.  For a start, the opening chase in the woods is downright terrifying, as well as deeply traumatic.  The humour and (genuine) sentiment of the story is superbly undercut with the menace of the NASA scientists and the sound of their jangling keys as they approach.  To add to this effect, Spielberg never shows you a man's face until very late in the picture.  Almost every shot is from a child's point of view.  Also, I find the `death' of E.T. one of the most downright upsetting scenes in film history.  Of course this is sheer emotional manipulation, but brilliantly executed.  In the subsequent resurrection scene the audience literally goes from tears to laughter in a matter of seconds.  There are one or two great chase scenes in E.T., most notably near the end when the bikes fly off into the sunset.  That is, in my book, the single most exhilarating scene in cinema history.<br/><br/>Performances are all fantastic from an (at the time) largely unknown cast. As well as direction, the screenplay, cinematography, sound, editing and music are all first rate.  In fact John Williams score is the best I've ever heard composed for a film (topping even Star Wars for sheer operatic overtones).  Everyone remembers the soaring main theme but there are many other more subtle pieces which add immeasurable quality.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with details of the much-documented Christ allegories in the film, but what is more interesting is its moral message.  Although understated, E.T. is clearly a film about tolerance and not judging by appearance.  That makes it the ideal modern fairy tale.<br/><br/>As for the recently re-released version, the new scenes neither add nor subtract from what is already a classic film.  That said, I'd watch the original because of the much-maligned digital removal of guns in the final chase.  For the most part you don't notice, but if you are familiar with the film, the absence of a particular cutaway (and subsequent edit in the music) is jarring."
"nifabs","10","2","4","19 April 2003"," Extra Terrestrial Territory
","E.T. is a beautifully crafted piece of work.  In an age before the total eclipse of special effects, Spielberg brings a magical story to life via the camera.  The lightning, the score, the cast are all pure magic.<br/><br/>
Many themes are visited in this poignant and riveting masterpiece.  Family ties, friendship, adventure, honesty, the list is endless.  The children are remarkable in their attempts to outwit the law and help E.T. return""home"". That bicycle ride across the moon and the takeoff right in front of the barricade is a flash of pure genius.  My heart never ceases to leap each time I watch that scene.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore who went on to become an accomplished comedienne is sweet in one of her first starring roles.<br/><br/>E.T. takes you back to every magical yesterday, for every lover of lore, fantasy and good endings.  E.T. is the forerunner of all sci-fi epics but it's quality is in it's simplicity of storytelling, character portrayal and cinematic depiction.<br/><br/>AN ALL TIME CLASSIC."
"clydestuff","10","2","4","13 April 2003"," ""Spielberg's Heart and Soul""
","In an age when many movie goers sit in a theater judging how real the computer generated special effects are or how detailed the computer animation is, I wonder if a movie with the heart and soul of E.T. could even find an audience.  It's disheartening when people write that movies like Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc.,  are way better than this classic Stephen Spielberg film.  I enjoyed Toy Story and Shrek both, but they don't come close to the emotional impact of E.T.<br/><br/>E.T. is not just a story about an alien who gets lost on earth.  It's a story about family, friendship, love and loneliness, and it is these elements that we always remember. Spielberg, drawing on his own childhood experiences, captivates us with an unforgettable and timeless story.  E. T. could be every lonely child's invisible friend.  We never think of E.T. as an alien special effect, but as Elliot's own invisible friend come to life. We see the pain of a family going through divorce without being hammered over the head with it in every scene, a masterful achievement in itself.  Of all of Spielberg's great films, I can't think any can match what he achieved in E.T, scene for scene.  Melissa Mathison's script is perfect, the casting was as if Spielberg rubbed a magic lamp, asked for the perfect cast, and got it.  John Williams score is so beautifully done, it is worth listening to just by itself.<br/><br/>There is not a wasted moment in this film, every scene is exceptional and memorable.  I saw this movie on it's original release in 1982.  At the end of the movie, the audience stood and applauded, something I have not seen again in twenty years."

More movement in his face and instead of the FBI having guns they have walkie talkies. The Night Sky looks wonderful and the spaceship looks better.

Wow!<br/><br/>I watched the entire restored version, waiting for the ""new effects."" i never saw them. It looked like the ""E.T."" movie I had remembered. It was bright, deep, warm, engaging, and utterly cool. It was only upon watching the marvelous commentary portions on Disk Two that I got my answers, as to where the new stuff was. Speilberg does a shot-by-shot explanation of the enhancements. Nothing ""new"" in the sense of added stuff--- by what looked great as sci-fi FX back in 1982 really DID look a bit stupid today. Not quite on the Flash Gordon level from the 1940s and 1950s, but pretty lame and stale. the enhancements added the sparkel and zong we now have come to expect from the techno advances of the California film industry.

And wearing combat pants! I have no problem with fixing up special effects (the running through the forest scene is much better than the original) but the other stuff! The extreme silliness about the guns to walkee-talkees has been mentioned before. The removal of the guns destroys any threat that we felt during the original pursuit. Instead of looking terrified when the federal agent cocks a shotgun, Elliot is scared of two guys waving radios? Watch the original and toss the ""updated"" version.

","I saw ET at the premiere in 1982 and have not seen it since then until I picked up the DVD set a few days ago.  Without too much embellishment I have the same feeling for it now that I did then: this is one of the best motion pictures ever made. How could I have remembered every scene from 2 decades past, nearly every significant word of dialog, every note of the score, if it had made no impression on me from the first viewing? Because it went straight to the parts of me that define me as HUMAN. It would be pointless to over-critique ET; small and trivial aspects of it have lost their luster. So there is an ATARI console, so Drew Barrymore has taken on less sweet roles as an adult. The cheesy effects in The Wizard Of Oz do nothing to detract from the essence of the film. In this case the essence is the same: Home. It is a word that is as intangible to define as freedom or truth or....faith. ""Phone home"" he says, ""There's no place like home."" says Dorothy. THIS is the essence of the movie...it does not take a Roger Ebert or Leonard Matlin to uncover this fundamental (and yes, sentimental) truth. Spielberg captured all that was possible to capture on film about the nebulous nature of needing to be home. For each of us, for every human being, there is a place we call home. It may not be the place we live now, or it may not even exist anymore except in our memory, perhaps we shall never find such a place. But we all know what it shall be like when we are there. Spielberg's film says that the concept of home is not only a human desire, but perhaps even a universal one as well. <br/><br/>    I think he is right.<br/><br/>I believe if you don't understand or feel these feelings after viewing then somewhere along the road of your life you have lost some part of your humanity. True,it is just a movie. And Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is just another song. And The Last Supper is just another fresco..."

It took me ages to even give in to curiosity and watch it one Christmas, because I thought it was going to be tedious and boring and possibly even mushy.

This doesn't happen to me very often - and no it was not cold in the cinema. I really was surprised that the film was as genuine and funny and complete as it was. I was surprised that the cast was actually able to act. I was very surprised that Drew Barrymore was able to be convincing. The music score was perfect. And I say that as someone who has not received much in the way of music teaching but has watched a lot of movies with some really diabolical soundtracks. E.T.'s soundtrack fits so well with every facet of what you see and it gives a real flourish that was definately absent in Tron. I don't want to talk about Mr Speilberg, but I think he did a properly good job of this one. I think what I am trying to say is, that having finally seen this film and having had a low view of it before hand, it was great to be proved wrong. This is now one of my very favourite films, and is the second best cinema experience I have ever had. If you have never bothered to watch E.T. then go and see it NOW!<br/><br/>I should note here at the end that my brother has still never seen it, and he probably never will - I think this is something to do with honour, or was it ego."

","As a young boy, I was raised around marines. They were tough as nails, typical man's man guys. But I vividly remember going to the base screening of this movie at four and entering the lobby after the movie was over and saw that every one of these marines were reduced to tears. It was in one of these moments that I saw the true power of what a truly fantastic movie can do.<br/><br/>E.T.-The Extra Terrestrial is an emotional roller-coaster. One minute we're laughing, the next, we're afraid, the next, we're charmed, then saddened, then joyous. And all within the period of two hours. Since the film's release, the format has been copied to death, but to watch the film again, the undeniable power of the original still remains.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, during his idealistic period, created this movie as a way of dealing with many emotions that family movies avoided to be more Pollyanna-ish. But this was one of the first real movies for kids that never glossed over death, coming-of-age, and divorce without being either too smiley faced or too adult. This was a movie that cared about the audience (how many movies today can say that?). Another first was this actually had kids saying lines like ""Penis breath"" and swearing. This was unheard of in 1982, now it's as common as saying Cheesy Poofs.<br/><br/>E.T. is a good mature film for families to watch if they're ever bored of the same old PC Disney garbage that's been churned out post-Lion King. E.T. doesn't talk down to it's audience, it never insults their intelligence, it's a movie that is there to entertain and show kids what it means to be a true friend."

","Call him the Great Manipulator, I really couldn't care less. Sitting in that cinema, aged six, and seeing how everybody, young and old, was so deeply affected by this tale of universal friendship, well, I never saw anything like it again.<br/><br/>It always amazes me that so many diss this movie, saying they got 'sucked in it' as a kid or that it's dated, pointing at the Atari/BMX/Star Wars figures etc. Why, that would make a fifties film dated because there's no cell phones and TV-remotes. Or hating the message of the film so much that they start attacking its technical merits. That's just beyond me. The direction of children is a most difficult thing and Spielberg pulls it off superbly. Cinematography is top notch, giving us the best signature shot of all time. The score, the effects and Rambaldi's creation deserve the highest marks.<br/><br/>
In this day and age it's more cool to rate cynical, dark movies as personal favorites, claiming that they are more real and poignant. Great, raise your kids with showings of 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Scarface' for all I care."

","I must stand out as the only person who detested this movie.  I found the 'in your face' sentimentality intollerable in the extreme - it was emotional manipulation of the most blatant kind.  I was irritated also by the assumption that aliens will be benign and harmless - the reality may be quite different as Independence Day shows.  I felt the  authorities were quite correct to take the precautions they did. While our record on pollution is far from brilliant, who knows what the aliens may be carrying? When I saw this movie in 1982 (in a packed house - rare in Britain at the time) I felt so different to those around me that I wondered if I were an alien!"

I just sit myself down and enjoy the heroic deeds of a few children, the funny (drunk) E.T. with his beautiful big blue eyes and the magic atmosphere altogether.

"Spleen","9","2","4","6 November 1999"," If I sound bitter, it's because I loved this film when it first came out..
","I would have been nine or so.  It just goes to show that you should be deeply sceptical of the aesthetic judgements of a nine-year-old - even if that nine-year-old is yourself.  What a let-down it was to watch the film later and realise I'd been had!<br/><br/>Not completely had: John Williams's score, one of his very best, is still stunning (the only part of the film that doesn't show its age, in fact); Spielberg moves from scene to scene with great assurance, hiding from a trusting audience the fact that he's telling a story that makes little sense; and I must admit that the two key children, Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore, have both charm and talent.<br/><br/>
There's also a great bicycle chase scene.  We need more bicycle chases - this one is easily the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>But couldn't Spielberg have spent his resources on a story that didn't fall apart when exposed to bright light?  For a start this shouldn't have been a science fiction story.  Pure fantasy would have worked better.  (Impure fantasy, which is what this is, always feels awkward.)  We have a supposedly intelligent alien race, capable of mounting a sophisticated interstellar expedition - or, in other words, sneaking into the outskirts of Los Angeles at night for an hour or so only to scuttle off in fear when, surprise, surprise, humans appear.  What did they expect?  Oh - and they fail to notice that one of their number isn't aboard when they take off.  How smart are these aliens, exactly?  Judging from ET himself (there's some reason to think of it as a he), brighter than dogs, not so clever as chimps.  And then there's the way the stranded ET alerts the other ETs that he's missing - with a ploy that comes straight out of `Gilligan's Island'.  Nope: the trappings of science fiction don't suit this story at all.<br/><br/>Not that removing them would remove any non sequiturs from the script.  Why does ET suddenly recover?  Why must he be hidden from NASA?  Why must he be hidden from Elliot's mother?  And is there ANY explanation for the behaviour of the aliens as a whole?  I'm not unearthing irrelevancies here: all these things drive the plot.<br/><br/>But who cares, you can hear the director thinking, the kids won't notice any of this until they're older.  He's probably right.  Children can be manipulated into consuming any old rubbish - but sometimes, when they're older, they resent having been so manipulated.  At any rate, they ought to."

","No film will ever effect me as much as E.T done. I was nine years old when I seen this in the cinema in 1982, it moved me so much its probably responsible for my love of cinema. I couldn't get enough of E.T after I watched it, E.T toys, E.T soap, E.T sweets etc etc, yes I know it was just a huge cash in, but I was just a kid not the sceptical 29 year old I am now! One reason this film grew to mythical status with me as well, was the fact that it took YEARS to come out on video, and when I did see it again, I was slightly disappointed because in my head I had built it up so much, and I never did get to see it on those legendary pirate copies that passed from kid to kid and workmate to workmate. Everyone must know the story by now, Alien gets deserted on earth and is befriended by young boy. The film is wonderfully made, the effects are amazing, the performers are brilliant, the music is fantastic, Spielbergs direction is genius...you may have noticed by now I liked this film! The scene where Elliot is cyling his bike through the woods with E.T, and they take off and fly over the tees is my all-time favourite scene in a movie bar none, and the music too.....awesome. Thanks Steven for that day in the cinema in 1982 that I will never forget, and I want to repeat with the 20th anniversary showing, and make me forget and forgive you for the awful British Telecom adverts you forced poor E.T to make in the UK ( why does Steven Spielberg risk spoiling a classic movie by allowing people to cash in and make crappy adverts using E.T????) does he really need the money. That would be like George Luca letting a cough sweet company use Darth Vader in their adverts ( oh i forgot he did ). Basically what Iwnted to say I still love this film. *** 10/10 ***"

I'm sure this is the case for many fans of this superb film. You all know the story, but to me the story is just the backbone to the movie. The real brilliance comes from Spielberg who's heart truly shines throughout. The photography and mood he creates are mesmerizing, the performances and direction of the actors could not be topped. And the ending could not be better. But i can't just praise Spielberg, because with him comes the most brilliant composer. Take a bow John Williams. The music that accompanies this movie is unforgettable, throwing in the atmosphere by the bucketload, and plus,this is the man to blame for the tears that we always find filling up our eyes at the finale, it's his music that creates the sadness and the longing for E.T and Elliot. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and i can't wait to see it on the big screen again in march. Forget the fact that this was supposed to be a kids film, and just let yourself be amazed at Spielberg's best movie ever."

It never did.<br/><br/>I just don't get it. Where is the magic? What is the appeal? The characters look like they just jumped out of a Tide commercial, and the dialogue from the Mickey Mouse Show. The special effects were anything but special.

","A sweet and often magical adventure, E.T. brings more to the table than just the standard family film schluck, and becomes something truly original and wonderfully iconic. The film is well acted for the most part, and the kids play their roles to the best of their ability. Henry Thomas is by far the most notable performer of the film, truly capturing the spirit of his character to a very impressive degree, especially for a kid. The film is also finely shot, and its soundtrack is fantastic, with John Williams providing a wonderful score as he always does. The film can often be quite funny, sweet, and surprisingly emotional for the subject matter- and is truly a moving piece of work, despite its duller moments. The film can struggle with pacing from time to time, especially towards the very beginning of the film, but even as it is consistent with this fact, it is able to find its footing just enough to provide for a very interesting and very enjoyable job well done. In the end, E.T. is not without its flaws, but is ultimately a very sweet and very magical film that is equally enjoyable as it is deeply iconic.

When everyone hear of this word, ET, what do they associate? I am suggested the image that ET and Eliot join their index finger. However the scene does not exist.

Indeed, we all picture the squashy head of an adorable monster with an extensible neck, huge expressive eyes and unforgettable raspy voice, a pointing finger with an ability to glow at the most cinematically emotional moment, a little boy and a legendary bike ride that flew him to a moon, that had the good idea to be full that very magical night.<br/><br/>If Cinema is a world of imagery and magic, well then a certain movie made by a certain Spielberg in a certain cinematic year (that happened to be the one I was born in), deserved its instant place as one of the most glorious exemplification of the reason to be of Cinema as an Art and an escapist medium. I'm being verbose, am I? Well, I'm sorry to maintain the suspense, but this is a trick I learned from Steven Spielberg himself, who, more than anyone, knows how to tickle your curiosity enough to make you want for more, so that the emotional effect is twice more satisfying.<br/><br/>And it works, really. The film opens in total darkness; mysterious creatures are wandering near a spaceship. We only see the plants and mushrooms that seem to be the reason of their presence. Suddenly, flashlights and screeching vehicles indicate a hostile presence, the aliens escape leaving one of them alone. Like in ""Jaws"", we never see the creature until Spielberg judges it's the right time. Indeed, we have to discover the kid first, so that his discovery of his alien friend will have the right effect. Spielberg loves imagery but he never takes them for granted, it's all about the effects.<br/><br/>The boy is Elliott (Henry Thomas), he lives in one of these suburban houses, impersonal but with a charm of their own. He's a middle child, so, a little bit teased by his 16-year old brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and a little less mollycoddled than his 5-year old sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore). He's an outcast in his own family and the separation of his parents didn't help. Spielberg wanted a movie that would evoke the feeling of loneliness in children of dysfunctional families and the late Melissa Mathison's script was the material he needed in order to express the emptiness felt by a boy without a father and without a clear position in the family. And who better than a misfit kid to feel an immediate sympathy toward a naturally misfit creature? That's to say, it had to be young Elliott, to shine a flashlight on E.T. so that both would be scared in a funny and touching symmetry.<br/><br/>This 'close encounter' is actually the first hint on what will cement the friendship between the two loners: reciprocity. And like Michael explains to the scientists, Elliott doesn't think E.T.'s thoughts but feels his feelings. This is not about telepathy but empathy, and empathy is a virtue molded by childhood times, because we have less perspective of the world, and are more capable to judge according to our heart than our mind. Beyond the friendship, this is also a film about childhood and it's very revealing that all the props needed to communicate with E.T. and even help him to communicate with his people, all belong to childhood world. Star Wars toys, electronic games, Reese's Pieces, you name them. Of course, out of all the childhood-defining props used in the film, the BMX bike is the most emblematic one and it's no wonder it inspired the most memorable moment of the film.<br/><br/>Maybe this is what the film owes its timeless and universal appeal to, being a world of kids, where everything is seen from their perspective, where adults are half-showed like in ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, where you feel like flying when riding your bike, when you think of freeing the frogs rather than dissecting them. Childhood as a time of innocence and purityit's a bit corny and I remember a comic-book I read when I was a kid, where the hero, after seeing the film, was glad E.T. was discovered by children, a friend of him was skeptical, but to prove him wrong, the hero dressed as an alien and approached a group of kids, they tied him up. On his road to the laboratory, the hero said, ""you were right, that's only Sci-fi"". I also remember when we first saw the film during a school trip, some boys were laughing at the sight of poor E.T. and I thought he was lucky not to have met them.<br/><br/>So maybe the film is less about childhood than Spielberg's own vision of childhood? And perhaps this is why the film is accused of being manipulative, like any Spielberg's film after all. Now, is Spielberg manipulative? No more than any author who wants to create the right emotional impact, yes he knows that an E.T dying to make his friend recover is the tear-jerking jackpot, but isn't the scene efficient for all that, and doesn't it make us jump of joy when E.T. suddenly resurrects and happily repeats ""E.T. Phone Home"", not to mention John Williams' triumphant score to complete the effect or the so emotional farewell. (Ouch!) Again, it's all about effects and it is easy to accuse Spielberg of manipulation, but the fact is that he took a staple of movies: friendship between different persons and made it an instant icon, something on the same level of imagery as ""The Wizard of Oz"".<br/><br/>So whatever was manipulative still made it it the most successful of all time, for 11 years before another Spielberg film would dethrone it. He must have a way with audience, because he considers himself like this audience, if you think the film is overly sentimental from the way it portrays kids, well that's Spielberg's vision, and as<br/><br/>naive as it is, it contributed to a creature without which we simply can't imagine Cinema."

","E.T: The Extraterrestrial, directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Henry Thomas as Elliot. The film tells the story of an alien, named ""E.T"" who befriends an earthling, a young boy called Elliot. The Film is the Most Beautiful friendship movie ever made, and shows what friends should do for each other.<br/><br/>Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Michael MacNaughton and Dee Wallace are extra terrestrial(get it?!) in their roles. The acting really portrays what kids are like, and what an alien looks like to a kid. Elliot sees E.T as a friend, because he took the time know him in the inside, and didn't simply make a judgment on the way he looks. Elliot teaches a lesson everyone needs to know, but often forgets. Don't judge a book by its cover. Or in this case, don't judge Aliens by their Image. E.T wasn't a threat, but the adults mistreated him, because of their own selfish reasons. Elliot cared and befriended E.T, and is really a magical story of friendship.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, let's just say Extraordinary is an understatement. Nothing gets anyone more nostalgic than the bicycle across the moon scene. You help but love E.T, as he is a very likable character. Elliot is also very likable, and it's easy to relate to the difficulties he Experinces.<br/><br/>E.T: The Extra Terrestrial: is one of Steven Spielbergs Finest Films, and is one of the Greatest Films of the 80s, if not all time."
"avik-basu1889","9","0","0","23 October 2015"," A charming. heart-wrenching fairy tale set in the late 20th century !!!
","'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' directed by Steven Spielberg is one of the most renowned and well known films in the said director's oeuvre. It stars young Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Dee Wallace as the mother of the three kids played by the aforementioned child actors. The film's plot follows Henry Thomas' character Elliot in particular. One fine evening, he discovers an alien being. The film is about Elliot and his siblings falling in love and befriending this alien and hiding it from their mother and all other adults including the government who are clearly aware that an alien being has landed in the area.<br/><br/>I have a love-hate relationship with Steven Spielberg. I am ready to acknowledge the fact that he is arguably one of the most important filmmakers of all time in terms of making films that become box office behemoths. He has always been the box office's darling. I have always loved some of his grittier and personal films like 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan'. But there are other films in his filmography that make me cringe due to the saccharine nature of the direction and the style of storytelling. Some of his other big blockbusters like 'Indiana Jones' or 'Jurassic World' are examples of films that I can appreciate for the technical achievements, but I haven't been able to love them. 'E.T.' is an example of an aberration when it comes to my impression of a Spielberg film. It has all the schmaltz and John Williams' sweeping music that has made me cringe in some of his other films, but those are exactly the aspects I believe that work in this film because 'E.T.' at its basic level is a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Like many other fairy tales, the storyline to this film is strictly from the point of view of the kids. This is a story that can't be told without the presence of the kids. In other fairy tales like 'The Wizard of Oz' or 'Alice in Wonderland', etc., the protagonist goes to a new, magical and wondrous world where the story is set. But in 'E.T.' it is the magical element of an extra-terrestrial being which is brought to Elliot's home. <br/><br/>Without a shadow of a doubt, 'E.T.' is a children's film. But the best children's films are those that impress adults too. I watched this for the first time as an adult in my twenties and it blew me away. Not just because of the fact that it's adorable, but also because of the rich subtext. It is revealed very early that Elliot's parents have recently separated and clearly Elliot feels the absence of his father. This film is about Elliot, Gertie and Michael trying to avoid premature adulthood and maturity which can be inevitable when your parents separate or divorce when you're very young. The alien being itself represents Elliot's innocence. Elliot's attempt to hide E.T. from the adults epitomises his attempt to restore his innocence and his childish spirit in the face of great mental trauma brought on by his parent's separation. The E.T. is also going through emotional problems because of being separated from the other aliens. There is no real villain in the film except adulthood. Spielberg made an artistic and thematic decision to not show any adult's face for a major part of the film except for the mother played by Dee Wallace. For the most part of the film we don't see adult faces, we only can listen to their incomprehensible science talks.<br/><br/>The script written by Melissa Mathison in collaboration with Spielberg is beautiful. It tugs at your heart strings and embodies the magic and the wonder that comes along with a child's view of the world. This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's most intimate films. There is some special effects work in the film, but they never drown the human element of the subject. The alien in the film becomes a real character instead of remaining a gimmick. John Williams pumps out his characteristic sweeping scores that works beautifully to complement the magical scenes in the film. The acting in the film is also great. Special mention has to go to Henry Thomas. He is adorable and makes it impossible for viewers to not fall completely in love with him. A good aspect about the writing is that the kids actually behave like kids for the majority of the film which is not the case in some Hollywood films. Having said that there is one particular monologue by Elliot that felt a bit mature for his age, but that is a minor nitpick.<br/><br/>'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is an intimate and magical fairy tale set in the 20th century. Spielberg consciously attempts to create a film that oozes childish innocence. Children will love the friendship between the alien and Elliot and also the fun chemistry between Elliot, Gertie and Michael. Adults and other perceptive viewers will appreciate the rich subtext of children trying to not get forced into growing up prematurely by sacrificing their childhood due to their parents' separation. 'E.T.' also makes you nostalgic about your childhood and taps the inner child in you. Along with 'Stand by Me', 'E.T.' is one of a select few films that will surely make viewers rue the loss of their childish innocence. Highly Recommended."

","""Children are great – if their moms don't get too involved!"" actress Dee Wallace wrote in a Cult Film Freak interview. ""They trust, connect, and are always in the moment. I love working with kids And dogs!""<br/><br/>Dee's single mom, Mary, has three terrific kids and one friendly dog (unlike her CUJO antagonist a year later) in the Steven Spielberg mega-successful E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, and having the chance to watch this again in theaters, it still holds up.<br/><br/>The more deservingly heartfelt moments are subtler in re-watching: While the melodramatic ending drags on way too long... when E.T. dies slowly after government agents infiltrate the house of Henry Thomas's young Elliott... some of the less contrived tear jerking and/or endearingly memorable moments are when E.T. responds quietly to little sister Gertie's initial fear – or the freeing of doomed frogs inside class after E.T. gets plastered on Coors beer and Elliott, experiencing the same feelings while the drunken alien watches a John Wayne flick in the family room, smooches the hottest girl in school. <br/><br/>We all know the main story: a flying saucer lands in a forest bordering the suburbs and, after the ship takes off, one alien is left behind. He's soon discovered and eventually befriended by a young lonely kid who, even surrounded by his older brother's smart allecky cohorts playing poker like world-weary grownups Elliot has no one to call a real friend.<br/><br/>Some of the best moments occur in the build-up: boy and alien initially connect thanks to Reese's Pieces (when product placement didn't seem as obnoxious) And then as Elliott lets his older brother, played by scene-stealing/Yoda-impersonating Robert MacNaughton, and an adorable Drew Barrymore into the big secret mom can't know... It's during this in-house ruse that director Steven Spielberg, fresh from the rip-roaring success of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and having established himself a space alien guru for his CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, never misses a suspenseful beat. But with so much fun going on, it's too bad E.T. and Elliott get ill so quickly... Right after a terrific Halloween sequence both set out with a Texas Instruments Speak & Spell, an attempt to ""Phone Home,"" and the decline begins...<br/><br/>The movie can get corny but the yanked heartstrings don't hinder the film's steady pace. Henry Thomas was one of the great child actors, expressing every emotion possible while not coming across as an overly trained Hollywood brat. And as mentioned earlier, the only drawback is the end, as Elliott and E.T. lay dying for what seems like an eternity... but that's more than made up for during the iconic escape sequence resulting in the kids riding, and then flying, their bikes away from gun-wielding FBI agents.<br/><br/>""This is reality, Greg,"" Elliott tells his brother's more dimwitted pals after the suggestion that E.T. simply beam himself aboard the ship. And that's what makes this magical film so timeless: It still seems very real and is more than just another heartwarming science-fiction fantasy.<br/><br/>""I knew it was special,"" Dee Wallace wrote And when asked if she had a feeling (during filming) of the success E.T. would garner, becoming the number one box office champ of all time until Spielberg's JURASSIC PARK made that record extinct, she finished with: ""No! The public makes a hit. You do your best and hope."""
"ShibanPD","Null","0","0","11 November 2012"," E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
","With E.T., the Spielberg/Williams collaboration reaches an overwhelming crescendo. Story points, emotion, and music are perfectly synchronized, and symphonic mastery blends seamlessly with crystalline directorial vision. Spielberg demonstrates a real aptitude for directing child actors, evincing genuine fright, sadness, and love. Realistic childlike senses of humor, wonder, and adventure empower the young main characters to guide us on a supremely entertaining ride. Writer Melissa Mathison makes bold, strong, beautiful choices in her characterizations and thematic development. She tells the story from the point of view of the children, but never completely vilifies the adults. In the scene leading up to E.T.'s ""death,"" the doctors working on the creature try their hardest to save him and are visibly distraught when it appears they are unable to keep him alive, despite Elliott's accusative remark, ""Look at what they've done to you."" The title character is a wondrous amalgamation of various forms of ""the other""—those companions, projections, and creations of the human mind—other beings that fill the void when ordinary adult human beings just don't cut it. E.T. is, at once, an alien, a god, a superhero, a pet, and a child. Even to Elliott and Gertie, who are themselves children, E.T. is like a child, and they are able to teach him things. Like a faithful dog, E.T. feels what Elliott feels. Yet, somehow E.T. also assumes a magisterial presence; he exhibits supernatural powers and serves as a ""savior"" of sorts, distracting Elliott and his siblings from the pain of divorce. When Elliott thinks that E.T. is dead, he makes him something resembling a religious promise: ""I'll believe in you all my life."" It is a rare movie that can make children and adults alike feel so strongly for an alien creature whose eyes are said to have been patterned on Einstein's and whose voice was partially supplied by a chain-smoking 70-year-old woman. It is an even rarer movie that can make the hearts of its viewers long achingly for that same alien title character to find his way ""home""—while, at the same time, ache wistfully when they realize that he can't ""stay."""

","The thing that struck me as I sat down to watch this film was, although I've seen it several times before, I never realised just how good the musical score, by John Williams, was. I'm not just talking about the well known themes, it goes without saying that these are epic, I'm on about the much quieter themes, particularly at the beginning of the film, they are very subtle, but fit the on-screen action perfectly.<br/><br/>It's not a film with any great performances, although everyone did a pretty good job; Henry Thomas as Elliott was pretty annoying at times, but it has to be said, he was also pretty good at the emotional stuff. Dee Wallace as Mary, the mother, did a pretty good job, as did Robert MacNaughton as Michael. Also worthy of note was Peter Coyote as the government agent, Keys; although he didn't have an awful lot to do he did it pretty well. For me, the star of the show was a very young Drew Barrymore, who was quite adorable as Gertie.<br/><br/>I said earlier there were a few flaws which, for me anyway, prevented this film getting a higher score. One of these was the design of E.T.; yes I know he's quite iconic now but I always felt it looked like a small man in a plastic suit. He's also far too cute. The other thing that lets it down a bit is the CGI, I know it's only really used in a couple of scenes and the technology was in its infancy back then, but I'm afraid modern equipment does show it's limitations. As far as the story, the production and the direction of the film goes, all top notch and well worthy of all the praise it's got over the years. And even with these 'flaws', as I've called them it's still well worth the couple of hours it takes to watch!...

","Date: 18 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- E. T. is one of those movies that you regret not watching earlier. It took me fifteen years to finally watch this movie and I have to admit, I am short of mad at myself for not doing it earlier. Everyone knows the story. Little E. T. is left on planet Earth and soon meets Elliott, a boy who desperately needs a friend. Along with his older brother and younger sister (Drew Barrymore was so adorable as a child!) they embark on a quest to get E. T. home. If there's one thing I want to make clear in my review it's that E. T. is one of the sweetest and cutest aliens ever!! My favorite scene was by far when he went downstairs, while everyone was gone, and drank tons of beer that also affected poor Elliott. Then, the selfish humans came. Can't people just leave little E. T. alone? He didn't do anything wrong. I was almost near tears after it appeared E. T. was dead but what kind of story would that be if our innocent little alien friend died? Not a good one. E. T. rose again and made it back home. A sweet, sweet ending. So, in conclusion, I would suggest this movie to people.

This was a time when Steven Spielberg hit his stride as a filmmaker. Melissa Mathison's script is simple and wonderful. The story of a boy's first friend (happens to be an alien) doesn't change the fact that if you had a childhood friend as a boy this movie strikes you in the heart and tugs at it and never lets go. That's a good thing. The acting is perfect. Its too bad Henry Thomas didn't transition into an adult actor. At least Drew Barrymore did bless her heart. There are so many scenes that are etched in my memory forever especially the end when Elliot and E.T. say goodbye.

This year, well over a decade later, I've watched it twice, unable to remember the entire film beforehand (I may not have actually seen it all during my childhood). I don't consider this 1982 smash hit the work of genius that many others have considered in to be over the past 25 years, but I certainly can't empathize with the haters.<br/><br/>When a group of extra-terrestrial beings come to Earth, one of them is accidentally left behind. This lost alien comes near a house where a young boy named Elliot lives. Elliot is obviously frightened when he first sees him, but eventually, the young boy invites the alien into the house and hides him in the closet. He reveals E.T. to his siblings, but they must agree to keep the creature a secret from their mother! Elliot and E.T. become great friends, and even begin to share the same feelings! However, E.T. is desperate to return to his home planet, and starts to build a contraption to ""phone home"" with. Meanwhile, a task force is aware of the presence of an extra-terrestrial being on Earth, and is on the lookout for E.T.! <br/><br/>This is a family flick, but not every single line in it is clean, which is what earned the film its PG rating. If you ask me, the occasional mildly raunchy lines were unnecessary, and if they weren't used, it wouldn't have reduced the quality of the movie at all. However, ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" is a good piece of entertainment despite that. It may not be that great around the beginning, but eventually gets better. There's a good amount of excitement, as well an occasional comical scene (such as E.T. in women's clothing), and some poignant scenes, most notably the very moving climax, one which my eyes nearly watered from (something that very rarely happens to me while watching movies), and probably the ending as well! <br/><br/>Some seem to consider this movie strictly for kids, but if it was, I really don't think the IMDb rating wouldn't be anywhere near 7.8, and the movie wouldn't be considered such a significant one. Yes, I would say ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" is a great film for kids (parents, just remember the PG rating, and why it's there), but it has clearly pleased many adults as well. So, for adults, liking this film may not be as much of a guarantee as it is for many kids, but if you're still into family adventures, you should probably at least give ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" a try, since it turned out to be such a big hit, and has continued to receive a lot of praise through the past 25 years!"

","Starring: Henry Thomas as Elliot Dee Wallace-Stone as Mary Robert MacNaughton as Michael Drew Barrymore as Gertie Peter Coyote as Keys<br/><br/>So it's safe to say this is one of my favorite movies ever. Any time I'm asked to list them, this ends up fairly high. Spielberg crafted what I feel is his ultimate masterpiece here, and that's coming from someone who was a dinosaur nerd growing up. At it's core, it's a basic story of friendship. A boy meets a strange alien and they soon form a bond. It's the kind of kids movie you don't see anymore, and yet this movie is great for all ages. If you're expecting me to say anything negative about this movie, back out now, because it just isn't going to happen.<br/><br/>First of all, what would a movie this good be without a lovable cast? Henry Thomas brings it, even at this young age, as Elliot. He's one of the few kid actors who isn't annoying. Spielberg somehow had the uncanny ability to find child actors who didn't annoy you when it came to the main roles of his movies. Even Drew Barrymore is tolerable in this movie. The cast feels like a family, and relate to each other like one. Dee Wallace-Stone is great too, and the government officials look shady enough that you know not to trust them with ET.<br/><br/>So you get to see what happens to this family once this alien visits Earth and decides to be friends with Elliot. The story also works on multiple levels. A story of friendship or a sci-fi tale. Some people even claim it's a religious allegory. I don't buy that but it proves to me that it works on multiple levels for different people. This movie also features iconic scenes, such as the famous flying bicycle ride in front of the moon. Another would be when the government finally shows up at Elliot's house, and they look very menacing in their biohazard suits. ET's goodbye, ET's memorable line, it's all here and it's all as wonderful as it was when it first came out. And with iconic scenes, I would be wrong not to bring up the terrific score by John Williams. Fits the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The man of the hour, ET, doesn't look too shabby himself. Back before they edited the thing with CGI, they used a puppet and animatronics to bring ET to life. And it worked. He moves, talks, displays emotion and acts like he were part of the cast. Why they needed to go back and fix him with CGI is just as puzzling as why Yoda became CG. It's not necessary, the effects they used in the eighties worked. As a kid, I totally bought that ET was real, and as an adult, I appreciate the work that went into making him so lifelike.<br/><br/>That's another thing I love about this movie, it still holds up. Instead of showing my kids whatever new penguin movie gets churned out, I'm pulling out ET. It's still a great movie and still brings a certain magic to the screen that few movies can top. ET gets the full monty from me, and that's all there is to it. See this film if you haven't already.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** of *****"

","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982, Dir. Steven Spielberg) <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>Elliot is your normal boy, until one day, when he meets a little lost alien. Elliot decides to keep the alien, in which he gives the name E.T. Elliot works with E.T. in trying to find him a way to get back home. Elliot must make the difficult sacrifice. Whether to help his new friend or to lose him? Whatever the decision is, Elliot must keep him hidden, as someone else is out to look for him.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>The actors are perfectly chosen for this film. Henry Thomas fits into Elliot and acts as if he is actually Elliot. The rest of the family played by Dee Wallace, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton, all are so emotionally played that they seem to actually be related. They all act and react around ET as if he is actually there.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>Like many of Steven Spielberg's film, the films composer is John Williams, and like always, John William creates an emotional soundtrack which adds to the viewing experience. There is simply nothing bad you can say about this soundtrack, there are so many beautiful themes and heard, and defiantly one of John Williams's best work.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>For a film released in the early 80s, the special effects seen are actually very decent. The spaceship looks amazing, especially when it is taking off into the school. The ET puppet is also amazing and looks so realistic. Even to today, the effects look amazing.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>E.T. the Extra-terrestrial is a classic Spielberg and should bring a smile to anyone's face. It's the perfect film to watch as a family, and not that frightening for the younger audience. To put it plain and simple, this is amazing.<br/><br/>""Maybe an elf or a leprechaun""  Michael (Robert MacNaughton) ""It was nothing like that, penis breath!""  Elliot (Henry Thomas)"

"sol-","Null","0","0","19 October 2005"," My brief review of the film
","With a surprisingly good dose of atmosphere, thanks to great lighting choices and moody sets, this film manages to capture typical childhood imagination and sense of adventure very well. The second half is weaker than the first, as it becomes a bit too sentimental as it progresses, but I personally still found it thoroughly engaging the whole time through. The music score is wonderful, as is the camera-work and special effects. The editing is a little less than great though, with awkward jump cuts here and there. The film is very simple, and it seems easy to flaw it for being so, however, since the film takes a child's point-of-view outlook on the events, the simple delivery is quite effective. The lack of complexity truly invokes a sense of being young and blissfully naïve again. The only aspect that could be labeled as too simple is the characters - they could have definitely done with more depth. Overall, this is a well-made escapism film: a well-crafted dive into a child's perspective. Its simplicity will annoy some, but others will find it charming. I guess it depends a lot on the individual viewer here."

","There's really not much to say that hasn't already been said about Steven Spielberg's tribute to lost childhood and unlikely friendships,disguised as a Science Fiction fantasy. It is a beautifully made movie that was very cleverly marketed(i.e. not showing the creature in any of the ads during the first run of the movie). Melissa Mathison's script is spare and,as such,allows for the actors and effects to paint a picture of the story through emotions and images. His cast was comprised of almost entirely character actors,with the children comprising the Lion's share of screen time and lines(along with the creature of course)which seems par for the course for Spielberg,who is almost shameless in his usage of kids and kids' themes to breathe life into his movies.<br/><br/>When the 2002 re release of the film came out,I was initially very excited and looked forward to seeing it in a theater again. While I cannot say I was wholly disappointed with the end result(it WAS for the most part,still the same movie),I have to say that I found the changes put into the film--of which I would probably would've been barely aware of,save the E.T. in a bathtub scene,had I not read about it in something like Entertainment Weekly--were unnecessary and created a rather unnecessary buzz that I(And I feel like others)could've done without.<br/><br/>I would recommend either the 1997 VHS 15th Anniversary release,complete with edited footage,backstage filming,current star interviews and footage of the 1982 premiere.(If you can find this in DVD form, get it) It's the original untouched film,replete with back-story which,if you get into things like that like I do,you will find interesting."

","This is one of a continuing string of blockbusters for director Steven Spielberg. ET is a well written, well executed, well acted, well directed, etc. film. The real stars of the film are all child actors and actresses, yet they all pull it off beautifully. The storyline is pretty basic: an ExtraTerrestrial (ET) is left behind on earth when it's space ship is nearly discovered by human scientists hot on their trail. The scientists discover that at least one being was abandoned and begin searching for it/them. Meanwhile, ET is looking for a place to hide and is discovered by a young boy, played by Henry Thomas. He takes ET in and hides him from his family. Meanwhile, the scientists are still trying to locate ET and are rapidly closing in. The result is a madcap chase that is part suspense, part magic. This is a truly great film and, although it's now over 20 years old, is still a favorite of a lot of people. Overall, an excellent FAMILY movie!"

","It took 3 models of E.T. and whole number of great special effects and money to make this film but what it really took was the human element to make this one of the most memorable films in the last 20 years of film-making. Nothing or no one can capture the magic of this film.<br/><br/>Released in 1982 under a great deal of hype and marketing power, E.T. became one of the highest grossing films of all time,giving Steven Spielberg the award of being one of the greatest directors not only in the American cinema but in the whole world, even probably to where E.T. came from.<br/><br/>The movie is similar to other sci-fi alien flicks like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL,but E.T. has more heart , humor and magic that any other previous sci-fi film.<br/><br/>This movie was shown on TNT this Saturday and probably will show again during the holidays, so you can catch E.T. if you want to relive the magic of being a kid and see this great film.<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of seeing E.T. when it came out (I was about 6 or 8 years old)and watching it again , it still has that same magic it had 18 or 20 years ago.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the E.T. spaceship landing on a remote forest for some much needed repairs, then suddenly a couple of greedy government agents notice something moving in the forest (E.T.) and go after it.<br/><br/>E.T.'s friends seeing the threat coming,leave behind E.T.,<br/><br/>and so E.T. is entirely helpless and very afraid until he meets a young boy,Elliot (Henry Thomas) who cares for E.T. until his friends come back for him.<br/><br/>This movie resembles the story of a boy and a dog, they share alot of things together and when one hurts , the other one hurts as well.<br/><br/>So while E.T. is secretly hidden in Elliot's room alot of weird things start happening to Elliot he becomes sick and doesn't know.<br/><br/>The reason Elliot is sick is because E.T. is sick as well and they share a bond between each other thats make them feel the same thing.<br/><br/>Elliot's mother , Mary (Dee Wallace Stone who appeared in the cult classics the Howling, and the Stepford Wives) finds out what is going on ,but by the time she figures that out, the government agents come in and steal E.T. along with Elliot.<br/><br/>In what is the most saddest moment in the movie, we assume E.T. has died and I bet everyone in the movie theater was crying too,but E.T. comes back to life with his universal saying ""E.T. phone home?"". :-)<br/><br/>In the end, E.T. does phone home and tells Elliot that he will be with him ""Ill be right here"" as he points to his heart.<br/><br/>That is classic movie making folks.<br/><br/>See this movie to relive the magic and if you can get it on DVD with extra footage and behind the scenes specials, get it!!

","Considering the movie came out back in 1982, when I was two, my mother told me that she went and saw it at the theatre with me. Now, 20 years later, I had gotten the chance to take my two year old daughter (nearly three) to go and see it, but I missed out on the chance. I loved the movie when I was a kid and having had my daughter see on it video, she loved it too. I thought the 20th anniversary edition was really cool. It was good seeing a movie with new scenes after seeing the same 1 hour and 45 minutes of regular footage for 15 years. I remember when E.T. first came out on video tape back in I believe, 1988. I was so excited to get this movie that I bugged my mom and dad until they caved and bought it for me. This was also back in the day when VHS tapes costed almost as much as DVD's! (about $24.95) So seeing the movie brought forth to a whole new generation of kids was a really cool experience. This is a movie I plan on..... or rather Santa Claus will bring my daughter for Christmas.

","SOME SPOILERS!<br/><br/>E.T. is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see.  Here's why: #1 - The narrative and themes are timeless.  The innocence of childhood and the desire to be a part of something magical is just a portion of the film. It also examines the infinite realm of the imagination and the desire for lasting friendship.  These universal themes will help the film retain its message forever crossing over age, gender, race, etc.  #2 - The direction of E.T. is exquisite.  Notably, the bicycle chase scene near the end of the film is as thrilling as any scene in cinematic history.  This is Steven Spielberg at his best.  The action and excitement continues to build with the boys flying over a police barricade and into the forest.  Even though the finale is slightly cheesy with the spaceship leaving a rainbow as it ascends, you have to admit the whole scene is very touching.  One of the main reasons is because: #3 - The musical score is fantastic.  John Williams has always had a gift for providing an extra sense of suspense and adventure.  E.T. is just another example of his genius.  The score is uplifting and often times gutwrenching.  Most importantly, it adds an extra layer to the visuals and increases the emotional impact of the film.  All in all, E.T. is a brilliant ode to the joys of childhood and the imagination. The nostalgic trip I experience when watching the film is worth it every time."

However, it wasn't until I saw it again, when I was fifteen, that I fully understood it.  <br/><br/>Along with movies such as Hitchcock's Psycho, Speilberg has created a masterpiece constructed around a simple story line.  The cinematography in this film is remarkable and the symbolism is clever.  Notice how the film has a biblical theme and it makes the statement that God and human should be at peace.  The rainbow at the end symbolises this.  Also the film bases itself on the fact that adults fear and are hostile (i.e. prejudice) to the unknown, but children are less.  Also, the camera is often shot at a low level to represent the height of children.<br/><br/>The performance of the actors is clearly an excellence.  At such a young age Drew Barrymore was so natural and innocent.  The audience laughs with her and at six years old this is remarkable.  <br/><br/>What is a strength about this film is that regardless of age everyone can love it.  Although little kids don't fully appreciate the themes they can be easily captivated by the fantasy.  Adults can learn from this film and see the light hearted side too.  <br/><br/>This film, which was went to be a small time project, has not only continued to entertain audiences 20 years on it was also the foundation for one of the best, most talented actresses of today (Drew Barrymore)."

","There's a certain age when film matters more than at any other time. A time when you lose sleep over Fenella the Witch from Chorlton and the Wheelies, or leave behind a worrying brown stain on the cinema seat after seeing the flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. E.T. was one such time. Never mind that nowadays it's full of sentimentality and overdone comic setpieces, E.T. is 1982, and you're back to being a ten-year-old, trying to not cry when E.T. dies just in case your big sister catches you.<br/><br/>I've always had a slight problem with Spielberg's direction. Somehow, his films always seem too glossy, too clean. Even Schindler's List and Amistad had a clinical air, while the director chose Tom Hanks and Ted Danson to wage war in Saving Private Ryan. A case of the bland leading the bland? And so it is with E.T., possessing some very nice shots, but all put together with the maturity of an eight-year-old. Maybe that's the point. Spielberg loves referencing all the old films, such as Some Like It Hot, and, most obviously, Star Wars. If his childlike construction bores in Jurassic Park, then it's perfectly at home here.<br/><br/>E.T. is, like Speilberg's other great success, Jaws, manipulative and ultimately hollow. With it's $704,800,000 takings, the film is still the seventh most successful of all time, and it's to the producers' eternal credit that they never called for sequels. Imagine a world where we got ""E.T. 3-D"" or a story where E.T. travels from world to world in a personal vendetta against Michael Caine.<br/><br/>E.T. himself is a wonderful creation, though he does look worrying like Jack Nance's mutant baby from Eraserhead when ill. With his blinking eyes and expressive voice, coupled with incidental noises that sound like a crying baby and a kitten, he's a credit to the special effects team. Ageing less well are the floating special effects, be it E.T. making lumps of plasticine hover in the air, or the flying bicycles. They look like they were done on 50p and a roll of sellotape, but they were excellent at the time of release, and that's when it really mattered.<br/><br/>As an adult, you appreciate other things about the film, such as the family dysfunction, the reasonable performances, or the mental symbiosis between E.T. and Elliot. When I first saw this film I must confess I couldn't understand why they acted so alike, and thought the scene where Elliot copies whatever the drunken E.T. watches on the TV was contrived. Hey, I was ten, what do you expect? I was going to sit in the cinema musing over whether it's a religious analogy? E.T. dies, I sniffled, end of story.<br/><br/>Since this film, the cast haven't been able to recreate such a high-profile appearance, with Michael (Robert MacNaughton) only appearing in one cinema film since. Drew Barrymore, of course, since being told by E.T. to ""be good"", has appeared in Playboy, attended lots of open-minded showbiz parties (allegedly, allegedly) and gone on to be the most famous exponent of the film, appearing in Scream, Never Been Kissed, and many more. Her appearance in ""Bad Girls"" is quite ironic as her character in E.T., Gertie, spends most of the time wanting to be a cowgirl.<br/><br/>E.T. himself had a brief comeback to the high-life (or, at least, three of his brothers did) in a four-second cameo in The Phantom Menace. Since then he's been resurrected in England to plug a phone company. As for his sole starring role, as an adult it's still a pretty decently made, if cynical, picture. For the ten-year-old back in 1982, it's perfection."

","I think this is one of the finest films ever made. Its artistic, emotionally strong and very humane. I strongly feel that this movie did not receive the Oscar for the best film was a big mistake on the Academy's part and I feel the Academy has been particularly harsh on child actors & actresses in recognizing their talent and efforts. E.T. has not just been a children movie. It has been able to unearth some of the true feelings in our subconsciousness that we solemnly possess but hardly realize until we experience something like E.T. E.T. to me was a wonderful experience and a joy forever."

","I watched ET when I was a kid, about 11 years old. I loved it. I think, this is a movie every child should have seen at least once. It's a wonderful story about friendship and about overcoming difficulties. A young boy befriends an alien and must then fight for the freedom, and eventually the life, of his friend against people who don't understand. The movie also features Drew Barrymore and Erika Eleniak. Drew was too young for me then, but I did have a childhood crush on Erika. In retrospect, ET is everything I hate about Steven Spielberg. It's blatantly emotionally manipulative. Every scene practically had a big neon sign on top saying ""SMILE"", ""LAUGH"" or ""CRY"". The movie tries to be multi layered and only succeeds in being pretentious. I'm too annoyed by this to really enjoy the movie, which, I can't deny, is still really good. But when I was a kid, I loved it and I think every kid will love it."

"ST4","Null","0","0","7 April 1999"," E.T. as a Christ Symbol
","I am not the most religious child, but the similarities between the biblical accounts of Jesus Christ and the story of E.T., a stranded alien, are uncanny. Think about it...E.T. comes to earth from another place, he has the ability to heal people (simply by touching them), he preaches for the children to ""Be good"" and informs them that he always will be with them in mind and spirit, he dies as a result of authority (the scientists) and is then resurrected. It is through E.T. that the children learn that there is more to life. This can clearly be seen when Elliot's brother is riding the bus. While others on the bus behave in childish, sinful ways..he goes uneffected by his surroundings.  There are also Elliot's brother's friends, who doubt E.T.'s existence, they are doubters. It isn't until they see E.T., elevated in the government van (wearing a robe), that they believe and attempt to save him.  Another similarity: the only adult shown to be nurturing and pure is Elliot's mother..her name? Mary. It is no wonder this film was the highest grossing film, for it is simply a retelling of the ""greatest story ever told."""

","Restored to a better digital quality, ET - the Extra Terrestrial, celebrated it's 20 year anniversary, with a second release. I must admit that I enjoyed the movie a whole lot more this time, considering it was able to viewed in the cinema and that it was much better to watch. ET is a brilliant film and if you can not enjoy it,  than you have not got a movie-loving bone in your body.<br/><br/>A group of alien botanists visit earth and one of them is lost and left behind stranded on this planet. A 10-year-old boy, Elliot, finds the alien. Soon the two begin to communicate, and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship. E.T. wants to go home, but if Elliot helps him, he'll lose a friend...<br/><br/>The Story of this film is probably the main reason why I like it so much. ET is a friendly character, though the audience are not shown this  that until we get to meet him much later in the film. However once we do, the story really does take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. In fact it is a sad teary movie. I love the way the audience is made to encourage ET and hope that whatever he wants to do, he gets the chance to do it. While in the long run he is able to make friends with some loving human beings. That is another side of the script I enjoyed, how the humans of the show interact with ET. It was well done and I can only commend the people behind the scenes, which include the script writer Melissa Mathison and the director, Steven Spielberg, who got it just right.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is famous, considering the stars that were in this film way back in 1982. Probably the most renowned  actor would have to be Drew Barrymore, who played Gertie. Boy, she was young in this movie, but she proved how talented she was going to be, and has gone on to do some wonderful work. Movies such as The Wedding Singer, Charlie's Angels, Poison Ivy and the film based on the Steven King novel, Firestarter. I like what Barrymore does onscreen, however I was sadden to see that her off-screen life has taken a turn for the worse, considering her house burnt down and her marriage to fellow actor Tom Green also failed in the last 12 months or so.   <br/><br/>Yet there were other cast members that had a much heavier effect in this film. The main star would have to be Henry Thomas, who played Elliot. His role I feel would have made audiences very emotional, as Elliot is a caring character, who is also brave and would do anything for his Alien counterpart. I rate his performance in this film alongside current young star Haley Joel Osment, as the two have the similar style to each other. Then you have the role of older brother Michael, played by Robert MacNaughton, he was great as the smart-alec older brother, however as the circumstances start to become more serious, he becomes a responsible person in the tricky situation. <br/><br/>For a 1982 film, ET had some extra-ordinary special effects, and to think that if it was done today, the movie would be all the better. I love all the scenes involving ET in some magical sense, with the bike flying scenes my favourite. There are also some very funny and touching scenes. Other scenes I loved were when Gertie takes ET and teaches him too talk and dresses him up in girlie clothes.  Throw in a bit of good acting from some young people and you have a very healthy film I say. <br/><br/>So all in all ET is a great film, with a top cast, good special effects and a story that can only be loved by audiences around the world. I agree with Roger Ebert that ET is the reason why we watch movies, to reflect and too make us feel good about ourselves. I believe this film would have had the same cinema hype that movies like Star Wars, Ghostbusters and the Gremlins would have had. If you are feeling a little down and need to be lifted up, then see ET, the movie that will pull your heart strings and make you feel glad for the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 or 5 Stars"

Spielburg has made a least three or four films that I would rate higher then E.T.,but in terms of a emotional investment,this one is peerless in his canon,invoking laughter,tears and everything else between as we follow little E.T.'s odyssey to return home(a popular kid flick motif also found in,among others,The Wizard of Oz,Lassie Come Home,The Homecoming of Benji,etc.) Years later,the film still has not lost none of its magical glory and in this new version there is very much to savor;the remarkable performance by Henry Thomas as the alien's soulmate Elliott;the equally impressive turns by Robert McNaughton and 6-year old Drew Barrymore as Elliott's siblings;also included in this new version is a very short cameo appearance by Harrison Ford as Elliott's school principal;the majestic sweeps of one of John Williams' best scores(for which he won the Oscar that year in 1982 for Best Musical Score);Dee Wallace's achingly real performance as the kids' vulnerable single mom(To the question of why Dee Wallace never became a bigger star after the huge success of E.T.<br/><br/>and other movies she did after that remains a mystery to this day);Peter<br/><br/>Coyote's chilling portrayal as the government agent out to capture the alien and to separate the bonding between E.T. and Elliott is one of the most scariest parts of the movie;and the isolated sequences that were deleted(the bathtub scene,the classroom frogs,Elliott kisses the girl in the science class,the flying bikes,etc.)that will continue to delight moviegoers to generations to come.

It is the best family movie I have ever seen. E.T. is such a sweet character. This is my second favorite Steven Spielberg movie, the first being Jaws. This special effects are very good, even by now days standards. What I really liked about this movie is that E.T. is a character with complexities, rather than the usual alien who remains mysterious right up to when that hero or heroin blows him up.<br/><br/>I also like the mix of comedy and drama. They were very well timed and paced. Besides E.T., I think my favorite character was Gertie. Drew Barrymore is adorable as the little sister. She has some very good one-liners, but she is also a believable character as well as a hysterical one. I think this was WAY better than ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". I really didn't like that movie. It was long and boring. This is obviously the better of the two alien films Spielberg did. <br/><br/>This is my favorite family movie because it has more spirit and creativity than most others. I think that the only family movies that compare to E.T. are the new computer animated movies like 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' (two more of my favorite family movies). Since I am probably the only person on Earth who hasn't seen E.T. before, I will skip my usual recommendations to certain groups because everyone has seen this movie, and it is for everyone except people who hate aliens.

The other way to look at it is that this is a classic that a whole new generation can and will enjoy. It's extremely hard to find on video and hasn't been on screen in many, many years, so it's about time that a whole new crop of kids (and adults alike) get to experience what we were lucky enough to have ""when we were younger"".<br/><br/>The film itself has held up pretty well and doesn't seem too outdated. Kids in the screening seemed to enjoy it thoroughly and didn't really seem ""lost"" at all. While there are five extra minutes, it's hard to tell where they are for most that haven't seen the movie in a while. E.T. does a little more running this time around, with some help from newer CG techniques. Other than that, the CIA agents are now armed with walkie talkies instead of guns and the ""terrorist costume"" line has been replaced with ""hippie costume"". Those are silly little things, though. Due to our country's newfound sensitivity, I suppose it makes sense, but also doesn't seem like it would be too offensive or scary! I mean, this is an older movie! Those things have been there for 20 years now! Most people have seen it numerous times already anyway. One amazing thing is to see Drew Barrymore again as a child. It's wild to think that at 27 we've been seeing her grow up in film now for over 20 years now. While the rest of the cast is pretty low-key these days, Drew continues to evolve and work steadily despite the ""child actor"" curse. The cast really does work well together and are just as loveable as ever, including that pudgy, ugly little alien, E.T. This is definitely one to catch in the theaters whether you've seen it or not. Sure, it will come out again on video (and DVD), but that's why it's on the big screen again. That's the way it was supposed to be experienced. One can only hope that the rest of Spielberg's classics (""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters"", etc.) will get the same treatment with the inevitable success of this re-release."

","This is Steven Spielberg at his best.  E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial was a defining experience for an entire generation of moviegoers.  In 1982, special effects and science fiction were taking off to distant worlds and ""the blockbuster"" was being born.  This was also a time when baby boomers were growning up, raising children in often broken one-parent homes. Spielberg describes this film as one about divorce, lonelyness and companionship.  What makes E.T. work as a movie, is the friendship that ensues between a stranded alien visitor and young boy who longs for companionship.  The story is very simple, and the special effects are somewhat dated, but the true magic of this movie lay in the heartfelt interaction between Elliott and E.T.  It is a deceivingly emotional film with tremendous highs and heartbreaking lows.  Scientists are on E.T.'s trail throughout the film and tension is built through scenes of investigion, secrecy, and persuit.  Music plays a big part in the impact of the picture.  John Williams powerfully dramatic score accents Spielberg's character driven direction.  The swelling music at ending of the movie is one of Hollywood's most tearful bittersweet finales.  This is one of the best movies of all time.  Final rating = 9.2/10."

","According to Walt Disney, ""Movies can and do have tremendous inﬂuence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood."" Parents and young adults need to come to know that Steven Spielberg's, The Extra Terrestrial classic, has some scenes of mild peril that may be too intense for younger children. For example, E.T. looks like he has perished in one scene. Which child needs or even wants to see a shriveled dying alien that is disgusting to look at? No one! In the the movie E.T.,there is strong language intertwined within the movie that is unnecessary and rude. In today's standards for a PG movie, E.T. is beyond the limits. A concerned Christian parent once stated that this certain movie was compared to the characteristics of Jesus which uphold the essence of love and goodness. Not just this particular parent, but many others found this portrayal shocking and couldn't even express enough how stupeﬁed they were. The movie has a strong inﬂuence on young children. If children continue to think that using foul language is OK, then the movie E.T. is to blame. Furthermore, the quality of this movie is poorly portrayed with the usage of unnecessary and foul language, scenes of intense mild peril which children should not see, and also comparing the supposedly nice and lovable alien to the worlds own perfect Lord and Savior. <br/><br/>Basically, the movie E.T. has an inﬂuence on children that is inadmissible. There are certainly more than just a couple of parents who agree that the language used in the ﬁlm would not be the kind of language that they would want their own kids to express. How can anyone hear children speak as they do in this ﬁlm, and think these are the values many people's kids will pick up? As the language continued throughout the movie, it probably had a huge inﬂuence on children to talk in such a manner at their own house, visiting friends, or at school, which is a big issue. Exposing this to children is unacceptable. Parents in all societies should come to terms if they would want for their children to hear that kind of inappropriate manner of speech from a PG children's movie. Many would agree that a children's movie should not contain that kind of impolite manner of speech towards anybody. Furthermore, parents shouldn't have to worry about insigniﬁcant language that is being exposed to their very own children at a young age. <br/><br/>More importantly, sources say that the alien that is the center of this ﬁlm has characteristics of Jesus. Why would anything or anyone even think to be or portray our Savior? Why would anybody think that they are worthy? Nobody on this whole planet has the ability to be anything like Jesus. Jesus spoke of honor, love, patience, truth, respect, etc. Comparing this movie in any way to all that Jesus did for us, in being born, dying for our sins, and being resurrected, is so far fetched. Recommending this movie to anyone would be pointless and sordid, especially to a Christian family. To end, the horrid words to describe this movie being compared to the Lord are endless. Nothing can be compared to the one who created life on this beautiful earth. <br/><br/>In addition, some may think that the movie E.T. by Steven Spielberg is an inspirational movie that tells a story of a unique friendship between a boy and an alien that is unforgettable and sweet, but the truth is the only thing that people have correct is that it is unforgettable. This movie is unforgettable because it consists of foul and impolite language, gruesome peril, and untrustworthy facts said about the only perfect thing in this world; Jesus. This movie speciﬁcally reﬂects on how children are not supposed to act around anyone with that kind of tone or disrespectful language. People need to understand that this movie consists of horrible inﬂuences on the next generation. Without the proper enhancements followed by children watching this ﬁlm, they won't know how to think properly about different aspects in life.<br/><br/>Moreover, this movie also consists of overly intense scenes that are too sickening for the average child. Having a child being exposed to those kinds of events are unhealthy. Experts say that people's brains store the memory of the adrenaline rush people experienced after just seeing something deplorable. It triggers numerous amounts of other alarming images that cross people's consciousness. Children should not have to go through being frightened for a long period of time. And that is exactly what the movie E.T., by Steven Spielberg is exposing. <br/><br/>In conclusion, in the eyes of many the ﬁlm E.T., by Steven Spielberg is inﬂuencing children in a negative way. It exposes blood-curdling images in their minds, infers that it's OK to use rude comments and language, and also giving not just children, but people of all ages the predicament to see Jesus less than he is. This movie is without doubt the worst movie that refers to unprofessional and dishonest habits."

","OK, ""E.T.: the Extraterrestrial"", is not horrible, but that which is ""off"" about it is especially irritating. Steven Spielberg chose to ground ET too firmly in the more banal aspects of the early 1980s zeitgeist, which might creep out a latter day viewer from the get go -- at least it did me. Of course much of this was well done, but it seems only mass hypnosis or some kind of ""groupthink"" can explain what makes this flick so incredibly popular when it is so very average. Everything Mr. Spielberg ever made is far, far better than this treacly, saccharin-coated kid movie. I have to give it a 3 star to make up for so many undeserved tens. There is no doubt that this movie achieves it's tens because it pulls so well on the heart strings of a fair number of viewers. That's all very well to a point. Coming away from a two hour investment in edification should leave one feeling better, in one way or another. I would admit that my review is infected with an unfair bias but for the fact that I am usually biased in favor of including entertainment along with mere art, especially in comedies, of which ET is one, in a very broad definition (look it up!). ""Forrest Gump"" comes to mind as a comparable treacly-saccharin movie that I absolutely loved. At the end of the day, I can't put my finger on it; maudlin can be tolerable in the right package, but not in E.T."

This film may have been good in the time it was released, I mean, there are a lot of '80s values' on it, and I understand, it talks about the 'magic' of the childhood...but, it talked strictly for the 80s generation, I mean, for an older and different audience, there is simply no way to connect with this film at all. It's dull, outdated, and totally uninteresting. The characters are shallow, so I couldn't care less for them. And again, very dull. The film is about kids doing dull things, so despite the story being technically perfect for the 80s standards, nowadays it's just a boring film with nothing to offer for the newer audiences.<br/><br/>I also disliked the soundtrack. So annoying and sketch. It was used in the film to.attenuate the scenes, and it don't worked anytime. And I almost walked out in the most bizarrely manipulative moment of the film, the ending, much because of the John Williams horrible music.<br/><br/>The E.T is very similar to the weird baby in Eraserhead(David Lynch, 1978), I found this detail pretty interesting.

Perhaps more than any other film up to this point, this is the one that really put Steven Spielberg into people's minds (and hearts).<br/><br/>Thirty years on (and counting), the film holds up really well.

He finds the little alien hiding in the woods behind his family home. Nobody believes him. Not his single mother (Dee Wallace), not his older brother (Robert MacNaughton), nor his cute little sister (Drew Barrymore).<br/><br/>Spielberg got the visual style with the beautifully shot backyard with the light streaming from the shed. He's got the emotional touch with the boy and alien relationship. And he's got the comedic touch with Drew screaming at the alien. This is a beautifully put together story. Henry Thomas' performance draws you into his character. The pacing is good. The camera work is thoroughly modern. The jokes are still funny. The emotional payoff is still powerful. It is a modern classic.<br/><br/>I watched the redux version again recently, and it's interesting to see the intention of Spielberg with a CGI alien. I do miss the animatronic ET sometimes.

","When it first appeared in 1982, Steven Spielberg's family-friendly ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" was immediately hailed by critics as the '80s equivalent of ""The Wizard of Oz"". But, when seen today, the film seems more a marvel of technical wizardry than either an emotional or deeply personal offering from either Spielberg or screenwriter Melissa Mathison. Young Henry Thomas (who has a lovely, sleepy gaze), living in suburbia with his divorced mom and two siblings, befriends an alien creature who was inexplicably left behind by his own people on a fast visit to Earth. Spielberg knows intuitively how to set up this story, and he wrings laughs and excitement from even the hoariest of circumstances, but Mathison's script is a weak link. Quite suddenly, the kid and his alien friend seem to become attached spiritually (what little Elliott acts out is in response to what E.T. is experiencing), and still the audience is carried away with it. I didn't particularly find the relationship between the boy and E.T. very profound, and the second-half involving the unfeeling, intrusive scientists is one big muck-up, but there are scenes that work: Elliott's initial flight with E.T. on his bicycle (which gets a reprise near the end and congeals, seeming straight from a Disney movie) is a magical minute of film-making, and the finale is a highly professional bit of tear-jerking. Spielberg is surely in touch with the kids' feelings and responses on camera, which leaves mom Dee Wallace pretty much out of the party, but still it's a briskly-paced, imaginative valentine to innocence. I just wish it had been a bit more sensitive, and without so many winks towards the slapstick market. **1/2 from ****"

","Stepping away from the fact that I adore this film as an icon of my childhood, I feel its enduring popularity owes a debt to the capabilities of a truly creative mind. Spielberg, one in the topmost echelon of directors of the modern age, does what he does best: crafting a tale that both entertains and enlightens us. We are captivated and amused by the effects, and by the actions of the characters, but those same things also serve to teach us about ourselves and our world. Granted, a child will miss the underlying layers, but the broadest sense of the film--that everyone is deserving of, and capable of, love--is essentially impossible to miss.<br/><br/>For those viewers that crave opportunity to see what films used to be about--entertainment AND meaning (without being overtly ""preachy"")--this is a film for you. It hails from an era when we were not drowning in big-budget extravaganzas, but instead finding a commonality in our enjoyment. This is one of the last in a legacy of films doing just that."

","I had higher expectations for this one than I thought. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was expecting(from all the popularity it has achieved and such) a good, quality fantasy sci-fi comedy adventure. What I got was basically every other kids movie, just with better effects. I mean, Spielberg is a good filmmaker, so why would he spend time and money making such a typical, formulaic kids movie? I mean, I realize that the film does establish a good connection between E.T. and Elliot, but does that process necessarily require to alienate every single adult character in the film too? Every single adult character is stupid, and they are mostly depicted as jerks. I liked the way Spielberg made it kiddy-like by not showing one single adult persons face before the final 45 minutes or so(apart from Elliot's mother), but did he have to make every single adult in the movie out to be so mindless and stupid? The kids aren't much better; Elliot is whiny, easily startled and plain annoying. Gertie is girly and annoying, and every teen character comes off as a jerk, just like the adults. Spielberg has, purposefully or not, created a movie that only kids will be able to identify with and like. Anyone over the age of 10 will be annoyed, if not offended, by the way anyone over that age is depicted. The films humor is exactly the same as in any other kids movie, only less disgusting that most other. The only worthwhile reason to see this movie if you're not a kid is the special effects. E.T. himself is even annoying for most of the time. Had this film had something worthwhile to tell us, apart from how, somehow, a kid can relate more to an alien creature from another planet than he can with any human, it might have been good. Hell, it would've been good if it just wasn't so awfully kiddy-like and centered on making it entertaining for kids. If you want to see a good children's movie that anyone past puberty can also enjoy, I recommend the first The Neverending Story. That is a lot better. The only thing that is worth watching in this film is special effects, and very few of the gags and jokes that are funny to anyone above the age of 7. I recommend this only to kids and huge fans of Spielberg. 6/10"

","I don't think this is the best sci-fi movie in general. Check out the Star Wars flicks, for instance. Get a little more picky with the genre ET is, and it becomes the best. I have lost count with how many times I have seen this movie, but I don't care. It never gets old for me. <br/><br/>In 1977, Spielberg created the sci-fi masterpiece ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" which perfectly balanced aliens and reality. Unfortunately, 1977 was also the year of what many believe to be the best sci-fi flick and the biggest movie at the time: ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" As majestic as Close Encounters was, Star Wars was easily the better film...by a long shot. Five years later, Spielberg tops Close Encounters with what was sure to be his best movie: ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial."" Guaranteed a Best Picture or Best Director win, Spielberg loses both to Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi."" Attenborough always felt that ET was the superior movie, and many people these days think so, as Gandhi has not been able to stand the test of time. As A David Lean-esque film, Attenborough directs a marvellous film, but as a ""narrative picture"" there's very few layers that make some scenes dry and boring and the overall product dragged out. ""Without the character of Gandhi, the movie is nothing."" ET is original, fun, shorter and touching. It follows the story of ten-year-old, Elliot (Thomas) who's parents are divorced, is non-comparable with his siblings (Barrymore, McNaughtan) and friendless. That is until a lost alien arrives and rebuilds him, and helps the alien. ET is not a kiddie or immature film. Everybody can see this and feel emotionally connected with is, as it is about feeling lonesome and how friendship can heel someone. Spielberg wrote the screenplay inspired by some of his own events, his parents got divorced and he felt alone in the world. Watching this can save and inspire people going through similar situations."

Amazing piece of music!! Plays in your head long after the movie is over. And I found Drew Barrymore really cute and just plain fantastic in the movie! For a kid her age she was well ahead of the curve.

Elliot, a young boy dealing with the issues of his parents divorce acts as the innocent representative of the human race and introduces this extra-terrestrial creature to the wonders and horrors of mankind. We as an audience grow to love E.T. just as Elliot does and cherish the relationship between E.T. and this American family on a deep emotional level. So many elements in this film are so iconic due to the work by Steven Spielberg and John Williams who achieve great emotional expression through their visual and audible combinations.

","Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender ""getting to know you"" type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others."

","E.T. is the most perfect film of all time! E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial Is the first thing to come to mind along with films such as The Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, and Citizen Kane when you think of the word Classic! The characters and acting are perfect, Spielburgs directing is perfect, the story is perfect, and the movie is perfect! Henry Thomas, a young Drew Barrymore, Dee Wallace, and Robert Macnaughton all put on the best performances of their careers! Lets not forget about the star of the film, E.T. Spielberg made the actors in the film believe that E.T. Was real despite them knowing he was fake, and in doing so, he made all of us believe that he was real as well. This film is also paced perfectly, while giving you the perfect amount of excitement, curiosity, suspense, and laughter. It is a disgrace that this film is not in the top 50, not to mention, top 250. In all honesty, I am not even being bias, the criticism I have heard for this film has been utter and complete garbage. Hearing people complaining because ""E.T. Is an ugly pedophile, and that this film is a little kids movie."" These people honestly know nothing about film. E.T. Might very well be one of the most under-appreciated films that many people love! E.T. Is the most perfect film I have ever seen, and is the film that is most deserving....of a 10/10!"

But there was a boy and his family who helped ET and even helped him to escape. I remember the scene were the guys in the tunnel attached to the escaping van were trying to recapture ET and the boy disconnected the tunnel in time to stop them.

"Tweekums","9","1","2","12 June 2012"," A classic sci-fi for young and old alike
","I first saw this film in the cinema when I was in my mid-teens and I must say I was disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype; so much so that I didn't watch it again for another thirty years. Watching it again though I think I was at just the wrong age to watch it the first time; too old to enjoy it as a child but not quite old enough to enjoy it as an adult.<br/><br/>The film opens in the woods with strange half glimpsed creatures scurrying around picking various plants; that is until a group of people turn up and run into the forest; then the creatures return to their glowing spaceship and depart... at least most of them do; one is left behind. The creature is first seen by Elliot, a young boy who nobody believes when he says what he saw. Knowing he didn't imagine it he waits outside till he sees it again. He coaxes it indoors and shortly afterwards shows it to his older brother Mike and his little sister Gertie. The creature, dubbed ET, forms a sort of empathic bond with Elliot which causes the boy to feel what ET feels... with amusing consequences when ET starts drinking beer at home and Elliot falls off his chair drunk at school! After a while ET announces that he must 'phone home' to contact his people; to do this he makes a device and take it to the woods where he landed; something goes wrong though as Elliot starts to feel ill and passes out; when he wakes ET is nowhere to be seen. He gets home and Mike goes out looking for ET; he finds him close to death and brings him home. They aren't back long when government scientists turn up; they do what they can to save ET but it looks as though he will die anyway.<br/><br/>I am really glad that I decided to give this a second go as it was a real delight; the opening scenes provide no real hint of what is to come; in fact the creatures moving around in the forest could have been something from a horror movie! It quickly becomes clear that is not the case though and we learn that the stranded creature is entirely benevolent. This is very much a film about childhood; the three main characters are all children and ET only ever interacts with them; indeed the film is shot from a child's point of view with a low camera angle giving a child's view of the world. Henry Thomas does a fine job as Elliot and young Drew Barrymore is a delight as Gertie; it is not a total surprise that she is the cast member who is best known now. If you haven't heard how it ends already it is likely that you will shed a few tears towards the end when things are looking rather tragic. Like most science fiction films there are a fair number of special effects; the most obvious being the brilliantly animated ET puppet; he is far more real than any CGI creature is likely to be; there are also the famous flying bicycle scenes which are a bit corny but should be fun for younger viewers. If you haven't seen this before I recommend watching it some time; and if you saw it when you were younger and didn't like it; why not give it another go? You might find you like it a lot more now."

","For me, just a poem. About friendship, childhood nuances, contact of worlds and solitude. About games as bones of existence. The magic of this film is axis for everyone. Chain of myths and tale for innocent public, it is one of Alice doors. To an universe where metaphors are usual words. Where limits are only fiction and rules are too small for see them. I don't believe in extra terrestrial forms of life but it is not easy to challenge the presence of ET. In the name of imaginary friends, for the taste of conspiracy theories, for basic amusing, it is real. And necessary behind Alien armies. Touching, amusing, collection of wonders and sage, pledge for differences and toleration, kind of flower power, with sweet Henry Thomas in one of most beautiful roles, ET is exercise to define world in not complicated images.

"jzappa","9","1","2","28 October 2011"," Show Me the Way to Go Home-Bohm-Bohm
","This movie pleases one's spirit. It's alive with ingenuousness, resilience and joy. It's also a hilarious comedy and an adventure. It's like other seminal Spielberg films like Close Encounters and the Indiana Jones trilogy, a movie you can mature and age with, and it'll never lose its luster. It's a story of companionship and devotion, and there's nothing manipulative or anti-intellectual about that. It's simply the personal sentiment of a master filmmaker's inner child. Critics and viewers of my generation, that is to say thirty years after the film's initial release, have been made so scornful by the saccharine lugubriousness of Spielberg's many Hollywood imitators in that time that they are repelled by what they see in this film as the romanticized America that Hollywood and politicians struggle to assure us actually exists. Well why don't we take a break from being presumptuous post-modern snarks and look at what's actually on the screen? Sure, the movie is set in and around a sprawling American suburb. The split-level houses stretch up and down the coiled drives, etched out of hills that become forest just beyond the backyard. But this suburban world, with its unsupervised kids, deeply lonely and depressed parents, busted toys and trademarked snack food, could've come out of The Ice Storm or American Beauty. Except one night in those woods, a spaceship lands, and eccentric little glowing silhouettes shamble through the night, seeking plant samples or whatever. Thenhumans turn up, powers that be with flashlights and trudging boots. They converge on the spacecraft, and it's coerced to desert one of its crew. This forsaken little being is discarded to a horrifying world of dogs, raccoons, car exhaustand nosy little boys.<br/><br/>The movie is in effect a psychic autobiography, a picture of Spielberg as a normal suburban kid distinguished by a singularly impassioned, spiritual imagination. The hero is a certain little boy named Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, who doesn't give the impression of a coddled, over-trained kid. He's spontaneous as hell, hypersensitive, plucky and naive. He just knows there's something living out in the garden, and he waits all night with his flashlight, attempting to entice the alien to appear with a universally appealing inducement: Reese's Pieces. They become friends. The E.T. secretly moves into the house, and the movie's midsection is a continual development upon the idea of an extra-terrestrial's induction into bedrooms, TV, phones, refrigerators and beer. The alien has the capabilities of thought transference, and it shares its feelings with Elliott. That's how Elliott understands that the E.T. longs to go home.<br/><br/>What's particularly magnificent about all of those moments is that Spielberg builds them out of Melissa Matheson's genuine plot developments. At each point from start to finish, this respected event picture is truly a narrative achievement. It unravels particulars about the E.T. It builds on the behavior of Elliott, his mother, brother and sister. It embroils federal space organizations. It deals with extra-terrestrial medicine, ecology and contact, and it rouses real laughter and sentiment.<br/><br/>Much of those triumphs hinge on the extremely weird E.T. itself. Through its strange little waddle, its shrill screeches of shock, its exploratory replications of human tongue and its bizarrely raspy drone, E.T. becomes one of the most endearing imagined creatures in the movies. It's a success of special effects, of course, but it's also one of imagination, because the filmmakers had to conceive of this things, and experience our world through its wholly alien perspective to fashion a being so totally compelling. It's a triumph of empathy. While E.T. is the more obvious and frantic orphan, Elliott is in his own way bereaved of a home."
"kellibeuzard","Null","1","2","23 June 2011"," A Heart Warming Classic for All Ages!
","The 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a science fiction film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg. Kathleen Kennedy serves as the other co-producer and written by Melissa Mathison. Starring in the film is Henry Thomas as Elliott, Robert MacNaughton as Michael the oldest brother, Drew Barrymore as Gertie the little sister, Dee Wallace as Mary the mother of the children, and Peter Coyote as Keys, a government agent. <br/><br/>The film begins with a shot of an alien spacecraft in a wooded area in Northern California. You see alien beings collecting plant samples and one of the beings wanders away from the group. At this time a group of government agents pull and the beings flee the area, leaving one of them behind. Elliott is a young boy living in Northern California with his newly divorced mother Mary, his older brother Michael, and younger sister Gertie. Elliott goes outside to get a delivered pizza; he then hears noises coming from outside the family's house. After finding E.T. and luring him to his bedroom with the use of Reese's Pieces he befriends the alien and begins to interact with him. He introduces E.T. to Gertie and Michael and the trio of siblings decides they will keep E.T. and hide him from their mother Mary. As the film continues, you see E.T. build a relationship with the children particularly with Elliott the middle child. E.T. learns to speak with help from Gertie and Sesame Street. The children learn of E.T.'s powers such as reviving a dead plants and levitating objects. Elliott develops a physical, mental, and emotional connection with E.T. and starts acting out the things E.T. is seeing and feeling. All the while, their home is under surveillance from the government agency that is aware of the spaceship landing. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and he mentions this to Elliott who insists ""we will be okay"". With help from Michael, Elliott manages to get E.T. to the forest where he phones home from a contraption he made out Speak and Spell, fork, and other random household objects. The next day Michael finds E.T. dying and takes him back to the house and shows him to Mary where Elliott has also fallen ill due to their physical connection. The government then comes to the house and quarantines Elliott and E.T. where the alien appears to die. In a predictable fashion of true love never dying, E.T. comes back to life and a chase ensues when Michael and his friends try to get E.T. to the forest where the spaceship comes to get him and E.T. goes home. <br/><br/>The theme of this film is acceptance. Elliott simply took to E.T. and naturally just bonded with him. You get the feeling that Elliott may have felt different amongst his siblings and could understand a different being. The acceptance of E.T. may have been a way for Elliott to accept the fact his father was no longer living with the family. Elliott also had to accept the fact that E.T. could not live on Earth. Once again Elliott is faced with having to accept losing someone he cares about but is left with the knowledge that E.T. is always in his heart. The film is shot at a low level and every time an adult is present the camera has to move up, like how a child looks at an adult. This makes you view the film from the point of view of a child. E.T. is a classic that warms the heart of the young and the old."

If I'm not mistaken if you want HD you're stuck with that crap edition. If you're showing it to your kids please just use the theatrical release which can be found on DVD. Not as good picture quality obviously but then you don't have to see a favorite of your childhood get maimed before your eyes.

","I think that this movie is very good for people of all ages. It is a very kind and old movie. We can see how deep and strong a friendship even between person and alien really is. I think that the old part is much better, than a new one. I really liked the part with Halloween. By the way E.T. is a very sweet creature. Also I was very scared when everybody thought that E.T. died. Steven Spielberg is great movie director. He is very talented. I love to watch his movies. What I can also tell, that in Russia it's not really common to make movies like that, but it's a very good idea. While reading reviews of people from different countries, I can admire that people all over the world love this movie. It was made about 27 years ago, but still is one of the greatest. The thing is, I am very disappointed that I couldn't catch this movie in the movie theater. I think I would like to have a friend like E.T. when I was 11."

","How can one describe the experience of watching E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial? It's almost impossible, there does not seem to be a word in the English dictionary that can fully describe the total experience of watching such a masterful film. It is moving, heart-wrenching, funny, optimistic, and exciting, all in one.<br/><br/>One would think when they hear of the simple premise of a young boy befriending an alien from outer space that not much drama or emotion could be evoked, but that person would be wrong. E.T.'s true heart lies in its simplicity, through a child-like view of the world. As this is rightfully how this film should be, since it is told from the perspective of a child. I think it is because of this simplicity that E.T. has gone on to become one of the greatest films of all-time.<br/><br/>When one debates about whether or not which film is director Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, talk quickly begins to circulate around Schindler's List, but in this filmgoers mind E.T. is just as beautiful and poignant as the story of Oskar Schindler. What Spielberg did with this film was simply magical; no other human on Earth could have made this film other than him. E.T. is a lovable character, even though he is so ugly. Spielberg made us care for a character who in the wrong hands would have just ended up being an ugly Muppet that'd terrify children, but thanks to the classic Spielberg touch E.T. was brought to life.<br/><br/>While many cynics may bash the film for its all-out sentimentality and gentile nature, I must always hold my tongue from saying something in which I will later on regret. E.T.'s greatest strength lies within its sentimentality and its optimistic nature. It is just another testament to Spielberg's wonderful talents.<br/><br/>Overall, I think E.T. is one of the most beautiful films of all-time. It is a film that'll make even the most hardened moviegoer cry, but never tears of sadness, but tears of joy and happiness. When you come to the end of E.T. you feel as if you just got off of one of the best emotional roller coaster rides of your life, and it never changes each time you ride it. This is one of cinema's finest achievements.<br/><br/>I give E.T. a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","In 1967, Satyajit Roy wrote a script for a film to be called The Alien, based on his short story Bankubabur Bandhu (""Banku Babu's Friend"") which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. The Alien had Columbia Pictures as producer for this planned U.S.-India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando as the leading actors. However, Ray was surprised to find that the script he had written had already been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray as an acquaintance of a mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. The script Wilson had copyrighted was credited as Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, despite the fact that he only contributed a single word in it. Ray later stated that he never received a penny for the script. Brando later dropped out of the project, and though an attempt was made to replace him with James Coburn, Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to the earlier Alien script  Ray discussed the collapse of the project in a 1980 Sight & Sound feature, with further details revealed by Ray's biographer Andrew Robinson (in The Inner Eye, 1989). Ray believed that Spielberg's film would not have been possible without his script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies (a charge Spielberg denies).-(on wikipedea)."

","Steven Spielberg is considered one of modern Hollywood's founding fathers. Possibly not by coincidence, some of his closest friends, Francis Ford Coppela, George Lucas and composer John Williams are also regarded as leading Hollywood from the brink of collapse, influencing modern filmmakers the world over.<br/><br/>E.T. is one of cinema's most iconic characters and still today, over 25 years later, enchants audiences of all ages.<br/><br/>E.T. is an alien from an undisclosed planet, visiting earth to gather agricultural matter for later study when his ship leaves for home without him. A stranger on a strange planet, E.T. seeks means to signal his family of his abandonment and in the process, befriends a young boy by the name of Elliot. Much humour and excitement ensues leading up to a tear jerking finale which is easily one of the most memorable of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is adapted from a personal tale from Spielberg's own childhood. His parents going through a divorce and young Steven finding a way to cope with this, he created an imaginary friend. Years later once he had established himself as a filmmaker, he decided this was an excellent subject for a family movie and so enlisted the help of screenwriter friend Melissa Mathison. Unwilling at first to write the screenplay, Melissa eventually succumbed and made a decision which would change her life forever.<br/><br/>One of the best decisions of Spielberg made was to enlist the help of another friend, John Williams, who had worked with him before on the equally memorable movies, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. Williams brought the story together with his epic soundtrack that when listened to independently of the movie, still is as captivating. The heart of the film is really held here and as any movie goer will tell you, is unmistakable.<br/><br/>The one scene which really resonated with the audience has to be the classic and often parodied bicycle ride in the sky, the young actors silhouetted in the sun to John William's sweeping theme is always met with a cheer from the audience and is often the first thing recalled when asked ""What is your favourite scene from E.T.?"".<br/><br/>The bond which develops between Elliot's family and the pug-faced little alien is one the audience truly is involved with and every emotion they feel is felt by the viewer. An experience which is crucial to any movie but sadly missed in most modern family tales. There is an X factor to it, but the genius of Steven Spielberg and John Williams is possibly why the movie was such a hit and judging by it's recent re-release in 2002, this hold true for a new generation of movie goers.<br/><br/>E.T. is a picture which could be shown in another 25 years and still hold a massive audience. It is a yardstick to which hundreds of movies since have been measured and we have yet to see any that come close. An absolute classic."

","Okay, maybe it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture instead of Ghandhi. It had a great storyline of a young boy Elliot, played by Henry Thomas, who bonds with an alien named E.T. for Extra Terrestial. Of course, people like Peter Coyote is soon out to capture the alien from Elliott's home. His mother, Dee Wallace, is perfectly cast as the divorced mother of three who is unsuspecting of the creature in her home. As a nine year old when this film came out, I was envious the actors who played Elliott and Gertie played none other by Drew Barrymore, a descendant of American acting royalty. The film is a classic family film which should brings families together. I don't think it's my favorite Spielberg film of all time. that would be Jaws. I could watch that film a hundred times and still go in the water but E.T. is a tear-jerker and you might want to keep your Kleenex in reaching distance when you watch this film.

"BA_Harrison","6","1","2","26 December 2006"," Super-schmaltzy Spielberg sci-fi.
","Nearly 25 years ago, Steven Spielberg gave us this hugely successful blockbuster about a boy who befriends an alien stranded on Earth. As a fourteen year old, I lapped it up and thought the film was brilliant. A quarter of a century later, how does the film stand up to the test of time?<br/><br/>Not as well as I had hoped, actually, it being one of Spelberg's most schmaltzy and saccharine movies ever, with several scenes feeling more than a little contrived. To this now older and wiser viewer, the film feels less magical than I originally thought it was.<br/><br/>Spielberg gets great performances from his cast (particularly from some of the younger, less experienced ones on whom the film heavily relies) and delivers plenty of iconic moments, but parts of the film tend to drag whilst, if you analyse the movie enough, other moments make little sense. Only Spielberg's ability to expertly manipulate his audience allows him to get away with some otherwise unforgivable 'plot devices'.<br/><br/>I don't wish to dwell on these 'niggles', suffice to say that it's hard to believe that a superior intelligence would allow itself to be stranded in the first place, and that a creature able to communicate telepathically and make objects fly would need to rely on a 10 year old boy for help.<br/><br/>Those that are less pedantic than I will undoubtedly have a great time, but the more I think about the film, the less I like it. If you saw it as a child and loved it, my advice is not to watch it againyou may come away disappointed."

","It was four years ago my family and I watched the 20th anniversary edition of the DVD. My father actually had fond memories of this movie when it came out (in his single adult years), mainly because of this famous line ' ET Phone Home'. After I saw it on DVD, I realised why my father said that.<br/><br/>It's really touching and moving. The alien (ET) is also quite cute, maybe given the overall appearance is not what one can consider cute actually. And I can never imagine that I will see a young Drew Barrymore (given I often heard this movie is one of her earliest participation) on the screen.<br/><br/>It's really amazing and heart-warming, especially when Elliot is very attached to ET though the latter has to be send back to where it belongs. It almost broke my heart as I watched. I almost cried. Yes.<br/><br/>It first came out five years before I was born (okay, indirectly saying how old I am now...LOL) but then in its 20th anniversary edition, I guessed I knew why director Steven Spielberg is considered among the best in the business.

","I have to agree that I am amazed this film doesn't rate an upper 8 on this site. It is one of the most perfect films I know. I am not sure how many people remember when this came out. It was in a time that aliens were only thought of as natural enemies of man or benevolent beings seeking to fatten us before we were eaten. This film, like Close Encounters became the first of their kind. Although with the backdrop of the last 25 years it may seem sweet or even quaint, it can be shown to anyone and they can come away feeling profoundly joyful for the experience. Shot in Spielberg's modern world of imperfect families working through difficult times, E.T. raises us up from the day-to-day to help us see the larger picture of who we are and what we can be. Not unlike his later masterpiece Schindler's List there is a greater us than we currently see ourselves as."

","This is probably one of the greatest movies ever made. Personally, just about anyone can relate to this. At one point or another, someone has felt lonely or felt like Elliot. This movie makes you feel good. I don't agree with the 7.8 average, it at least deserves to break 8.0. AFI voted it one of the best of all time, so this site should definitely have it in the top 250. Oh well, I still love it. I've seen it billions of times and i still get a smile out of it. Phone home! I do wish that Steven Spielberg hadn't added in the new digitized E.T. because it took out the darkness of the movie. he replaced the guns with walkie talkies, i mean come on!!! And they say hippie instead of terrorist. Someone should know when to leave a movie alone. It's like changing the last lines of Casablanca's for instance, you just don't do it! That is the cardinal sin of movie business. That's my opinion at least."

","What a thrilling joy E.T. was when I was a kid. And what a trilling joy it still is. What an intriguing concept, to make an alien from another planet befriend children from Earth. At first the encounter is extremely tentative then by the end becomes a great friendship.<br/><br/>What an exhilarating score from John Williams. Probably the best composer in film history, this ranks as one of his best. The music dances and flows with the images on the screen with sweeping majesty. It ranges from the foreboding to the thrilling.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion this is Spielberg's best. He said he would never make a sequel to E.T. because it is too close to his heart. I for one applaud such a choice for a gutless industry that pumps out hundreds of sequels, remakes, spin offs...etc. a year."

","This movie was so beautiful. It was innocent, it was charming, and it was like the only movie then or since that has had an Alien character that ACTED instead of just killed humans or was like an insect. There was a movie with Louis Gosset Jr. and Dennis Quaid that was also good.<br/><br/>But this movie brought us Drew Barrymore! She has been such an amazing actress over the years, getting more beautiful all the time. She was so cute in this movie and I totally had a crush on Harry when he played her brother.<br/><br/>I hear that Spielberg has changed this movie and taken out guns and the word ""terrorist"" which I guess is OK. But why did he then make dark and scary movies about terrorists? That doesn't make sense to me. It's so sad that War of the Worlds is how he feels about aliens now. I liked it better when it was E.T.<br/><br/>:c)"
"richardclarke13","10","1","2","29 January 2006"," An excellent family movie. Spielberg triumphs again!
","I remember as a little 8 year old boy sitting down at my sisters and watching a dodgy pirate video of a well advertised film called E.T. The picture was jumping all over the place and hard to watch like most most pirated videos but through all that even as a little boy I could see how magical this film was.<br/><br/>Its essentially a film that appeals to the child in all of us and is about someone who is reaching out to be loved and cared for though despite being classed as different in a world that from time to time treats people with disdain just for being different. The story concerns a young boy named Elliot and his family who's live's are transformed when an alien being enters their lives having crash landed on earth. The story is then essentially about the aliens attempts to return home and this results in one of the saddest endings in cinema history (if you haven't seen it yet you'll need Kleenex) but E.T preaches nothing to no-one except to say that people (or in this case aliens!) should never be treated with disgust just because they are different. It is one of the best films I will ever see in my lifetime and though Henry Thomas's career has curtailed since it not only introduced us to Drew Barrymore but it also helped the careers of many of its stars and on the 20th anniversary DVD there is a great documentary that backs this up. All in all excellent."

"standardmetal","10","1","2","6 October 2005"," E.T: the Limited Collector's Edition (2002) DVD
","My original review (2003):<br/><br/>Besides Elliott shilling for Reese's Pieces, Pez and Coke, it is still all it's supposed to be. The kids are all talented and attractive and E.T. himself should have won an Oscar for his ""performance"". The effects are still quite magical and I think this ranks with ""Wizard of Oz"" as among the best films of its type.<br/><br/>Though Mr. Spielberg tried a darker version of it with A.I., this one still can't be equaled. But the networks are beginning to wear it out!<br/><br/>Further comments on the Limited Collector's Edition 2 DVD set (2001): Though I see nothing wrong with the original 1982 version, Mr. Spielberg thought there were shots that could be improved and he tried to do so. The new version is included on disk 1 and, by and large, I think he should probably have left well enough alone. Though I wasn't too put off by the changes, the scene, in the beginning, where E.T. is running from the feds is, in my opinion, less effective than the original where you only see a light ""running"". <br/><br/>I also think the replacement of the agents' guns with walkie-talkies was awkwardly done even if it the director thought it was more ""politically correct"". The new computerized facial expressions of E.T. didn't bother me particularly.<br/><br/>The extra features were very helpful and I especially enjoyed the section where John Williams conducts his score live at the Shrine Auditorium. This ""live"" performance may also be heard complete and with audience reactions as well in another section following the excerpted visuals of Williams conducting. There are plenty of shots of the cast in 2002 and they all seem to have aged well or almost not at all and they are also introduced to the Shrine audience at the end of that section. <br/><br/>In the ""Reunion"" one can see also that Henry Thomas, the original Elliott, has retained his benevolent expression as has Robert MacNaughton despite his odd hairdo. Drew, (Give me a break!) of course, is ""terminally cute"" in this film. She steals it whenever she's on-screen."

","Few films have ever entertained me, exited me and brought me so close to tears as E.T. It has humor and thrills and a whole lot of heart. Actually, I don't know if I've ever seen a film with more heart than this one. Who ever thought that a rather ugly alien could be such a lovable character? I have loved this movie since childhood and will love it for the rest my life. Like all great movies for kids, E.T. appeals to people both young and old. The performances are so convincing and the emotions are so real that you can't help being caught up in the thrilling adventure of a boy and his friend from outer space. This movie is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Schindler's List was excellent, but most of it's power came from the scenes of innocent Jews being randomly shot. It's main emotinons are that of fear and sorrow, but E.T. focuses on love and that is the most powerful and most important feeling of them all. If you haven't seen it and you're thinking that this film is cheesy or sappy, it's not. It's very real and very entertaining. It's the perfect film for anyone who has ever felt lonely or rejected and wished that they had a friend."
"gottogorunning","10","1","2","13 August 2005"," Masterpiece
","Spielberg's masterpiece of friendship and connection is still as powerful today as it was 20 years ago. Although this is my favorite movie, I am trying to be fair in this review. ""Schindler's List"" is Spielberg's best film, and ""Raging Bull"" is the best film of the 80's, but this film ranks second in both those categories. Great acting, direction, and the character of ET is one of the best performances not done by an actor on-screen of all time. The film is a classic, and the measuring stick by which modern successful films are measured. That is as it should be. Excellent in every category. E.T. is the super successful box office fairy tale by the current wonder Spielberg, who brought you Jaws,Indiana Jones, Hook, JurrasicPark, Schindler's List, Saving Privet Ryan and Minority Report. Steven Spielberg has been quoted as saying ""E.T. is the closest film to my own sensibilities, my own fantasies, my own heart"" The musical score in E.T. is fantastic and really helps set the mood. Probably Jhon Willams Best. Which isn't easy taking in to account the fact that the man's been nominated 41 times. Henry Thomas is perfect in the lead, playing the childhood equivalent of Spielberg's everyman heroes of his previous films. I was surprised to find out Henry Thomas wasn't nominated for it. Never the less the movie was nominated for 9 Oscar's including best picture. Should have won! This movie gets a perfect 10!"

","About 23 years ago, Steven Spielberg made a film inspired by his lonely childhood life particularly his parents' divorce and came release day, without question became the ultimate king of the box office hit film of the year 1982. It was called ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" and it was a story that forever touched the world.<br/><br/>The Sci-Fi Drama which told the heartwarming story about friendship, loyalty, devotion and most of all love. When a spaceship lands, one of the visitors is left behind. Then he finds shelter in a young boy's tool shed of his home. They're first encounter is rather scary for the both of them. But once they meet again, they begin to get along with each other. The young boy named Elliott (potrayed by a young Henry Thomas)decides to take in the harmless loving creature into his home, but when he does he discovers that he and E.T. have far more in common than either one of them ever thought. Elliott later recruits his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) for help to find out where E.T. is from and what they can do get him back home safe and sound. But there's only one problem: the government is after him and the kids will do anything to protect the alien with their lives. At one point, E.T.'s life shatters and falls into complete illness along with Elliott's as well. E.T. dies which leaves the boy in complete sadness, but it's Gertie who's absolutely shocked to see this happen to a very special friend she loves so much, even she much like her brother would never let him die. Filled with tears the last thing we all could want is to wish for him to return. And it's fulfilled when he surprisingly resurrects to life! Now Elliott, along with Michael and co. must transport him to the forest of E.T.'s rendezvous point dodging government and local authorities. Mission Accomplished. Once the spaceship arrives, E.T.'s adventure on Earth is finally over. Although he must leave to live on, but it means saying farewell to those who nourished him and fought for him. Gertie gives the creature a pot full of flowers and a passionate kiss on his face(on of my favorite scenes in the film). He later thanks Michael for everything and gives a heartwarming hug to the one who loved him like a brother: Elliott. He later boarded the ship, it took off and left a signature of peace between man and alien: A RAINBOW!!<br/><br/>In the end this turned out to be a film almost everyone can learn about true friendship and love. I can relate to Elliott because I was living the exact same way he was, but I can also connect with E.T. himself. Because he was the kind of friend who is so special, there's no other friend you can think of otherwise. In my mind, this is one of the greatest achievements from Master Spielberg and the most popular American classic film of all time that is to forever be treasured and loved as well as appreciated at the same time. I don't care if it's kiddie or dull BECAUSE IT'S NOT!! (for all you dumb shits who didn't like the movie), it's the classic that forever changed the face of American cinematic history and broke box office records from all over the world. everyone else can say what they want, believe what they want. But it will not change anything, nor my viewing of the film because I can watch it so many times and never get tired of it, NEVER!! The truth is that this is an epic masterpiece and deserves better as it should have more than 20 years ago, so for Spielberg, you are the man!!"

","ET is such a wonderful film.  I think its a film about the way a child views the world, and the way an adult views the world.  A child's mind is not cyncial, unlike the adults in the picture.  There is a vast gap between the child's world and the adult world.<br/><br/>This is probably Spielberg's most personal film, he grew up in suburbia, he was part of a single parent family, he has a wildly imaginative mind.<br/><br/> There are so many classic moments, more so than any film released in the last 30 years.  The bicycles flying past the moon is one of the greatest moments in cinema history.  The John Williams score is timeless. Unforgetable quotes ""ET phone home""<br/><br/> One of the greatest of all time."

Watching ET again was like watching the sun come up again to enrich the Earth and its Earthlings with a kind of brightness that only the sun can do..  I believe that the E.T. that has enriched my life came back again to enrich it all over again. I will forever praise Steven Spielberg as well as the producers, writers, cast members, and technicians who gave so much to make this little-but-big movie inspire a whole world of Earthlings because of the simple fact that no matter how many edits that have occurred, you can't really fake the chemistry that made this movie touch the hearts of most people.  And the new 20th Anniversary doesn't.<br/><br/>Unlike some people who have panned this movie from the get-go, I beleive that the 20th Anniversary Edition - had no effect on the adventuristic and real-life theme that I fell in love with 20 years ago. The edits and enhancements that they did were practically unnoticeable - only a person who has no life other than studying every frame of this magnificent movie would notice.  The chemistry between cast members and E.T. remains the same - I mean who could ever forget how Drew Barrymore's Gertie dressed E.T. in an old lady's suit and taught E.T. how to talk or the sense of real friendship that developed between Henry Thomas and E.T.  That is something I feel that no computer graphic can replace.  Even the movie's message can not be reproduced for a sequel which would most likely ""kill"" the first movie had they ever tried it.<br/><br/>I must admit, for a while, I forgot about E.T. I mean I was only 3 and half when it came out and that was 20 years ago.  It wasn't until I saw the beginning credits of the 20th Anniversary Edition that all the reasons why I loved E.T. in 1982 came back to haunt me - it is a timeless classic that will always do just that.

Nevertheless I left the theater bored, and a bit of surprised that this film says nothing to our world today. The facts that Mr. Spielberg digitally removed ""stuff"" from the original didn´t help much. I felt cheated, somewhat blinded.

","Spielberg's masterpiece of friendship and connection is still as powerful today as it was 20 years ago. Although this is my favorite movie, I am trying to be fair in this review. ""Schindler's List"" is Spielberg's best film, and ""Raging Bull"" is the best film of the 80's, but this film ranks second in both those catergories. Great acting, direction, and the character of ET is one of the best performances not done by an actor on-screen of all time. The film is a classic, and the measuring stick by which modern successful films are measured. That is as it should be. Excellent in every catergory."
"ColeSear","10","1","2","14 August 2002"," Beautiful Beyond Comparison (Spoilers)
","When a movie is a hit it's sometimes called ""home run."" But Steven Spielberg doesn't hit home runs he hits Grand Slams! If there is any film that absolutely defines Spielberg in my mind it's this one. This film is a complete and total success both as entertainment and within the framework of the director's objectives. It's very odd to look at these films in retrospect after most of them have already gone on to become world-wide phenomena and see that many studios rejected not only this film but many other successful Spielberg ventures. Oddly enough Hollywood insiders have always viewed him as a risk taker. 	This film's success, however, shouldn't have surprised anyone at all. In E.T. we have a wonderfully structured story that seamlessly crosses over from fairy tale to comedy to drama without ever missing a beat. It always keeps you emotionally involved both through the story and with the assistance of the score. 	One of the most impressive things about this film is the dialogue. It is often humorous and insightful. The thing that makes it stand out is how succinct it is and how perfectly adept to the situation. A prime example of this is during the emotional good-bye between E.T. and Elliot. They meet each one points to their heart and says ""Ouch"" then they exchange pleas ""Come"" and ""Stay."" Four lines of dialogue, four words exchanged between the two of them yet that says it all; can it get any tighter than that? The best part is that it works so brilliantly. The comedic dialogue is just as effective Elliot is asked, ""Did you explain school to him?"" and in response Elliot says ""How do you explain school to higher intelligence?"" There have been entire films on the subject of how futile public education is and in that one line everything has been said. Another great detail in E.T. is the use of inside jokes. First, we see Elliot introducing E.T. to the characters from Star Wars and later in the Halloween sequence we see an homage to that film as well as to Night of the Living Dead and The Creature from the Black Lagoon. 	One thing that makes E.T. special is that it uses situations that all of us can relate to from our own childhood even if it's only there for a second. There's bickering amongst siblings, the use of comics, adults that just won't listen to what you have to say, Halloween, being caught daydreaming by a teacher and many others. Spielberg implemented enough shared experience that even if we didn't feel that Elliot was a snapshot of our past we could identify enough to get lost in the story. 	What also aids the story a great deal is the almost supernatural connection that E.T. and Elliot form. It's akin to what identical twins are supposed to have according to parapsychologists. The connection of their emotional and physical states leads first to some very comedic moments with Elliot sharing E.T.'s drunkenness and also the magical mimicry of the John Wayne film. Later on it leads to some of the most emotionally wrenching scenes where E.T. and Elliot are sharing an illness. 	Everything is so beautifully set up in this film that you might even stop and consider, ""Hey, didn't that come out of nowhere?"" but upon examining the film you'll find there really are no holes in the narrative. An example of this being the bike flying one of the most brilliant moments ever recorded on film. It still catches me off guard but it was set up when E.T. levitated the balls in the kid's room to demonstrate where he came from.<br/><br/>	To measure a film's impact it is probably best to look at landscape of the entertainment industry a few years later as opposed to just looking at initial box office returns. In both regards E.T.'s impact was enormous. There was a cheap copy-cat film a couple of years later called Mac and Me along with a very successful television series that took a different angle called ALF. Even scenes in E.T. had an impact, for example, the anti-dissection episode is now another staple in the sitcom book of ideas. 	The reason that this film epitomized Spielberg so well is not the emotional intensity although that has a lot to do with it and it's most definitely not the fact that there are aliens involved. What makes it such a trademark in my mind is that it is such a resounding success. This film is also timeless, it will never, ever, ever seem dated no matter how much magic computers can conjure up you'll never be able to put aside a story as involving and touching as this one, it's a classic and it's quite hard to imagine someone making a film this beautiful one of the best films ever made."

The only reason I can see it being this low is because Speilberg has kept such a tight reign on the availability of it.  It is the least exploited film of all time.  Most blockbusters are totally over exposed and he didn't let that happen to E.T. thus if your younger than 21 there is a good possibility that you never saw it."
"chrisbrown6453","9","1","2","14 June 2002"," After twenty years, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is still one of the greatest movies ever made.
","Great children's movies are few and far between, but finding a movie to be embraced as passionately by adults is even a rarer find. Steven Spielberg's artistic brilliance is more apparent than ever, finding the most wonderful nuances and marvelous visual imagery in every situation. The scene where E.T. stays home and Elliott is at school has greater poetic enchantment looking at it now than it did back then. Elliott starts to absorb E.T.'s feelings and imitates his physiological reactions. When E.T. gets drunk at home, Elliott gets drunk at school. Like something out of a beautiful romance film, E.T. watches a movie at home where he sees a big, romantic kiss in a 40's movie is on television. At school a tumbling wave of wind practically sweeps Elliott off his feet as he shares his first kiss with a pretty girl (Erika Eleniak). There are other eerie and oddly wonderful moments, like Elliott's first encounter with what he thinks is a goblin. When Elliott is able to lure E.T. into the house, they become friends. Elliott builds a rapport with E.T. by showing him his toys that he demonstrates is like his own tribunal council. At Halloween, E.T. thinks that a kid dressed up like Yoda is some kind of messenger from beyond the stars. When authorities finally locate E.T., they wrap the house up in contamination-protective plastic and bring in men in NASA suits in such freaky abrupt nonchalance that it feels like the worse fascist government invasion. Additional scenes for this twentieth anniversary include a scene where E.T. takes a bath and a scene at Halloween where the other kids (Robert McNaughton and Drew Barrymore) are trick-or-treating and the neighborhood is wild with teepee-making and other acts of anarchy. These scenes don't serve as a distraction like other inexplicable director's cuts, but are actually well-integrated additions. The visual effects are also enhanced and the film is also enjoying a re-mastered soundtrack. When E.T. was released 1982, the movie raked in more money than any film in history and was garnered with nine Academy Award nominations. The movie lost to Gandhi at the Academy Awards, which now looks like a crude footnote. Richard Attenborough's stuffy Oscar-winning biography of the Mahatma was a three-hour bore that never gave face to the human atrocities of the great British rule over India and chose long, long talk over putting visuals to action. Basically, it sanitized the story of Gandhi and the movie henceforth is a big, laborious textbook that couldn't even make simple timelines of its subject. E.T. was one of the greatest movies ever made, but how important was it? Looking at it today, the story of a young boy whose parents have recently separated, and is desperately lonely and looking for a friend  no matter where a friend may come from  is more poignant than ever. Additionally, thinking the film would flop, M & M's asked the producers of E.T. to remove their product from the movie.  Reese's Pieces were then used, culminating in one of the film's greatest sequences. The magic of E.T. soars off the screen and the heart rejoices in that last great chapter. Elliott orchestrates an escape with E.T. away from the authorities and when those bicycles take off the ground, there isn't a greater voyage one could ever imagine. John Williams' music is the most magnificent score he ever created for any film. Spielberg's ending is maybe the finest moment of"

The alien is the most unattractive thing I have seen, and if I was a kid I would not hug it as it looks slimy and wet. ET does have a creepy edge to him with his long thin fingers, and telescopic neck, the way it hides in cupboards, and walks around in the dark.Also the way it has complete control over the young kids. This film made me scared of the dark as a child, and I had many sleepless nights.

I love a lot of his movies: ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the whole trilogy for that matter), ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are amongst my (and pretty much the critics and everyone else's) favorites. These are great films. It may be even more challenging for a director to turn what would appear to be pretentious and maybe boring ideas into films as exciting as the ones he's made. ""E.T."", though not my absolute favorite (that one goes to ""Raiders""), is a magical film, magical because of it's use of music with images. Had one or the other been missing, the film would have failed.

","When a little lost alien meets a 10-year-old boy (Henry Thomas), the plot of E.T. takes off and soars to a rollicking conclusion with a tearful farewell scene that is given an almost operatic quality by John Williams' emotional music. Williams wrings every drop of emotion out of his skillful score--one of his very best.<br/><br/>Along the way we're treated to a series of misadventures involving the alien--one of the funniest is the Halloween sequence--another memorable one is the chase when the bicycles lift off the ground and soar into the sky against a full moon. Henry Thomas, as the little boy who feels a close kinship with the ugly alien, gives what is undoubtedly one of the finest performances ever by a child star. <br/><br/>Not long after the release of the film, I recall seeing him perform in front of a group of celebrities at some shindig where the spotlight was on him as he went through the paces of a dramatic scene. The cameras caught the people watching--one of them was actress Olivia de Havilland who was watching with rapt admiration, clearly seeing that his was a major talent.<br/><br/>There is manipulation, to be sure. The emotional ending is guaranteed to leave you wiping your eyes as Elliot (Henry Thomas) learns that friendship knows no earthly bounds.<br/><br/>Only drawback is the film's length--but nevertheless, a fine family film for the young, marred only by the use of some vulgar language."

This is one of those movies that can actually transport us to an out-of-this-world-kind-of-adventure, the scene with the kids on the bicycles made me fly too just to follow perhaps the most sad ending of the entire history of cinema. A kid who befriends an alien creating a bound so strong that only the two of them could break. John Williams makes his best soundtrack yet, sad, tender and thrilling. Williams is my favourite composer, this man doesn't know how to make a bad score. Spielberg and Williams together and all of the crew just had to result in a movie like this. Just, absolutelly, the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Friendship is the most transcendent feeling we can experience, specially beetween an Earth boy and a little alien. A true classic that should be seen by any family, any kid, any grownup, any.. anybody. Only a true cold-hearted wouldn't like this movie."

","This story is one that still touches me to this day.  I remember watching it in the theater as a young boy in 1985 when it was rereleased, it touched me then and still does to this day.  Elliot made a friend with E.T. and the two became so close that Elliot knew E.T.'s feelings.  If you can watch this movie and not cry when Elliot and E.T. are telling each other goodbye, then you must be one cynical person.  E.T. and Elliot became so close in the purest form of love ever known.  A heartwarming tale of love and friendship that deserves its place among the great movies of all time."

","I've read the reviews of this movie and I was shocked. I thought everyone loved this movie as much as I do. I was 9 when it was first released, and I saved Birthday money and conned every family member I could to take me to see it as many times as I could. This movie, although almost 20 years old, still holds water against all the COMPUTER generated special effects of today. There are parts of the movie so detailed you can see E.T.'s veins and temples pulse. Although Drew Barrymore's cheesy performance makes my stomach turn, I can over look that. This movie, torn apart for it's ""unbelievability"" (which is the most MINDLESS argument against a FICTIONAL movie I can imagine) is a heart warming story of a boy who's lost and alone looking for a friend. Here's an alien also left alone. Elliot's parents are separated--a point made more than once in the movie. This can have an effect on any 10 year old, then and now, and he's also the ""middle"" child. Here he finds E.T. and is able to love, and be loved, without question. I paid to see it 10 times when I was a kid. I went to see it in the theaters AGAIN on it's re-release in 1985-ish (?). I own the original copy released on video, and then bought it AGAIN when it was re-released on video with interviews from Stephen and cast. I own over 300 movies and none of them have received that kind of love and attention from me. Parents can watch this with their kids, or.... without them."

","I have to admit that this movie left me wanting more action. But maybe I was expecting to much. From a Sci-Fi summer movie, I'd expect more action. But maybe Spielberg was trying to make that type of movie. I guess he wanted to try something new. For the most part he succeded. What I saw was good. Differant, but good. It has pretty cool effects and really good acting and plot for the type of movie it is. Some parts are a lttle hard to follow but the kids wouldn't mind at all. It's made for them anyway. So don't expect blood and guts like Alien, or even another great winner from Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan. Check it out. It's worth buying and your kids won't get tired of it for a LONG time.

","I have to admit, when E.T. hit the theatres in 82 I was a big a sucker<br/><br/>as anyone, compleatly drawn into the wave Speilberg had going at that<br/><br/>time. Going to the re-release, I was expecting to see one of those rare<br/><br/>perfect, or near perfect, works of pop art only a Scrooge can resist.<br/><br/>     Well, I'm not a Scrooge, but alas, viewed with a light touch of<br/><br/>objectivity, this movie is barely good.

Speilberg would<br/><br/>later try to cute his way through stinkers like ""Always"" and ""Hook"", but<br/><br/>even well modulated Cute can only take you so far. We all know the<br/><br/>story, what really surprised me this time is, that's all there is.<br/><br/>       Major gripes: One of the things that no doubt made this a hit is<br/><br/>John Williams, endless sledgehammer score, bashing every moment over<br/><br/>your head. Terrible. And Drew Berrymore, for all he hype, wasn't a very<br/><br/>good child actor. On the other hand, Henry Thomas is good, and is<br/><br/>possibly the one honest thing about this bombastic adorablefest.<br/><br/>

"SteePBN","10","1","2","5 April 2002"," Beautiful!
","Earlier this evening, I ventured to the Cinema with the intentions of seeing the twentieth anniversary re-release of E.T.  Although I had seen the film several times throughout my childhood on video (though never in theaters due to the fact that I was born five months after its initial release), went on the ""E.T. Adventure"" ride in Universal Studios, and even watched it a few years ago on cable, I was not prepared for what I was about to experience.<br/><br/>E.T. is a masterpiece.  Few films even come close to being this beautiful without bordering on corniness.  However, I can hardly put into words what Steven Spielberg has accomplished.   I cannot think of a  more touching movie, or even one that can come close (I'm not saying that it's impossible, I'm just saying that no other films of this caliber come to mind).<br/><br/>
The characters are real, including E.T., and the dialogue is real. Unlike so many other films or sitcoms which feature children, the children of E.T. speak and react like all kids do when they are that age.  This gives it universal appeal.  Kids like it because it is about kids, and adult viewers like it because they can relate to it, unlike the bulls*** child characters of the brady bunch and full house who speak almost entirely in catchphrases and never have any real emotions or friends.<br/><br/>Like Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, and Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands this film is regarded as Spielberg's most personal project.  And also like these films, it is probably his best, which, in Spielberg's case (I know it's kind of a clichÃ©, but still), is really saying something.  His genius is prevalent throughout it, and would be crap in the hands of probably any other director.<br/><br/>I didn't much like the added special effects for the twentieth anniversary special edition, but I didn't feel that they cheapened the film, like in the special edition of Return Of The Jedi.  I think that the special edition is just as beautiful as the original version of the film, and that those who see it for the first time will love it just as much, but they were unnecessary, and the film did look better without them.  For example, the suspense is completely removed from, although it is probably the most famous scene in the movie and was not a surprise to people seeing it for the first time,  when E.T. saves Elliot and himself by making the bicycle fly above the ditch.  This scene in the original edition had much more suspense in it and made the audience believe, even if only for a split second, that something horrible was going to happen to E.T. and Elliot.  However, the suspense is completely removed from the special edition where they essentially just fly off the cliff, and noone in the audience is scared at all.  Maybe its just me, but I liked that scene better without the added effects.<br/><br/>But, the real beauty in E.T. stems from its view of love and friendship. The love shown in this film is that of friendship, and, to me at least, it is more believable, and more beautiful than any other kind of love shown in any other film, including those considered to be ""Love Stories"" and ""Romances"".  However, if I knew anything about romance at all, then I probably wouldn't be writing seven paragraph articles about movies for fun at one o'clock in the morning, so I might not be the best source of information in that department.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I personally know people, though not many, who have never seen any of the Star Wars movies before.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are still a few people left who have yet to see E.T.  To them, I say see it.  Regardless of who you are, how old you are, and where you're from, you will enjoy it.  It is quite possibly the most universally relevant, beautiful films that has ever been made, and should be seen by everyone."

Spielberg, one of the greatest directors of all time took a big risk in a making a family movie about a boy and an alien.

Going into tonight, I accused the director of committing a gross case of historical revision by attempting to make the film more politically correct, but I will admit that I am wrong.  The changes he has made went virtually undetected and the digital enhancement blends in flawlessly (with the exception of one occasion).<br/><br/>I have been reminded of what a treasure this film really is and seeing it with a theatre of children reminded me how I felt when the film came out in 1982.

","Nearly twenty years since it was first released on the world, Steven Spielberg's 1982 sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL remains one of the greatest movies ever made.  This is one of those films that makes us feel and think at the same time.<br/><br/>Its story of a very benign alien being accidentally left stranded on Earth and protected by a ten year-old boy (Henry Thomas) from government agents is so well known it doen't really have to be discussed.  E.T. is, alternately, magical, fantastic, suspenseful, and sometimes even a bit terrifying.  And sprinkled throughout the film are singular moments that really stand out as some of the most unforgettable scenes in cinematic history; by this time, I think we know what those are.  For me, perhaps the most priceless scene is the introduction between E.T. and Gertie (Drew Barrymore), where she screams her head off,  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream at the same time!<br/><br/>Spielberg's film, though scripted by Melissa Mathison, is almost painfully autobiographical, given what the director has said about his childhood. Like Spielberg, Thomas' character goes through life minus a father, even though his mother (Dee Wallace) does her best.  He feels isolated and picked upon in school, as Spielberg frequently did.  There is also plenty of religious symbolism that probably doesn't need any analysing and was probably unintentional.  In any case, looking past the fact that it won four Oscars--for sound, sound effects editing, special effects, and John Williams' legendary music score--and has grossed over $1 billion, E.T. is a masterpiece of the cinema, pure and simple, and it will always be that way."

Well last night I watched the original version, which I saw a couple of times when I was a kid. The movie still hasn't lost its magical touch. ""E.T."" is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, a movie with heart, humor, and excitement that will live with us forever. The story about an alien stranded on Earth and the boy who takes him in and becomes his friend went on to become the biggest blockbuster of all-time. It stayed on top of the foreign box office list until Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" surpassed it worldwide in 1993. It stayed on top of the domestic box office list until George Lucas rereleased ""Star Wars"" in 1997 (that was complete with the new stuff that ""E.T."" is getting for its rerelease). Will ""E.T."" get back on top of the box office after its rerelease next year? Stay tuned. Winner of four Academy Awards (including Visual Effects and John Williams rousing score), ""E.T."" is a movie like ""Star Wars"" that stays with you forever.

"Nene-2","9","1","2","5 January 1999"," The wonderful product of a long evolution
","By 1982, Spielberg had already mastered several genres: Terror (Jaws); Science Fiction (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and, remarkably, adventures with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first modern adventures film. He put all those together with his ability to understand and manipulate the public's feelings and created E.T. that is a lot of a drama and a bit of all the previously mentioned movies.<br/><br/>This long evolution, together with the excellent work of John Williams was enough to create one of the best films of the decade, and perhaps the Spielberg's master piece. It is sensitive, sweet and emotive, while thrilling and cheerful sometimes. It distills the true essence of Hollywood. Not surprisingly, it shocked the whole world at its release and its influence was tremendous. Like it or not, the picture of the flying bicycles has became an all-time classic and will be associated forever with he cinema in the eighties, and not just the kids will remember the words ""be good""."

Notice some cleverly disguised images: the ET spaceship is, at one point, a Halloween pumpkin and, at the end, a Christmans tree ornament. Lots of interesting Biblical symbolism, including the use of the rainbow at the end to indicate the peace between God and human."

The movie, in every way, was so wrenchingly and wretchedly cutesy, so us-against-the blue-meanie government, and so predictable, that if it weren't for the fact that I would have caused a big, stinky fight over my being rude, I would have gotten up half-way through the movie and walked.<br/><br/>This is just the type of movie that appeals to people like my hippie-dippy sister, big on cutesy and fighting the evil Reagan Administration!

"christophershobris","10","1","3","15 August 2018"," A Timeless Classic
","I just want to take a few minutes to talk about one of my personal favorite films of all time. And as far as Spielberg films are considered it is my favorite. But firstly I want to get out of the way the flaws of the film, every film has them, even films I hold to high regard. Honestly, it's hard to find any flaws since this is a nearly perfect film in every aspect. You can't criticize the visuals since it was made in the 1980s, but I think the performances by the kids other than Thomas, Barrymore, and MacNaughton could have used some work, of course featuring also a young C. Thomas Howell, but it's not terrible. Now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about what makes this film so special and timeless. Firstly, Steven Spielberg's direction as always is masterful, especially when it came to getting the best possible performances out of the main characters, and the main characters are children. Spielberg always knows how to capture that childlike innocence in a film without being sappy, and it's wonderfully displayed here. Secondly, the main kids themselves who are the heart, soul, and blood flow of this movie each with groundbreaking performances especially by Henry Thomas as Elliott, and a cute and young Drew Barrymore as Gertie. Robert MacNaughton sort of serves as the middle man, being conflicted with the ways of an adult but still preserves that childlike wonder when he too meets ET. Thirdly, the master himself John Williams proved yet again why is one of the greatest musicians of all time. After musical hits from Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, he comes in here and gives arguably his best score before or after. He himself made you believe a boy and alien on a bicycle can fly. And without Williams music that bicycle scene with Elliott and ET flying across the moon wouldn't be anywhere near as iconic. Or the chase scene with the police wouldn't feel as intense without his music. And lastly but certainly not least, ET himself. It is a outstanding job on the creators of this magnificent alien. A bunch of people collaborated to make him including sound designers, makeup artists, costume artists, Spielberg, and many many others and together they made him as believable as you could possibly make him during that time. His voice is provided by Pat Welsh, and Debra Winger also contributed heavily to the character. I also don't want to forget the adult actors involved including Dee Wallace, and Peter Coyote, they too do a great job serving as a lense from an adults point of view of the film and the situations within. Overall, this is a film that should never be touched, Spielberg struck gold with this film and he recognizes that. Many films afterwards that deal with a friendship between a boy and another otherworldly being or animal have to owe it to this film. As the friendship between Elliott and ET is a friendship that people will look back on as one of the greatest. And the film itself should be considered one of the greatest films of all time. As a result this film easily gets a 10/10."

The Direction captures the film from the children's point of view for the majority of the film it really captures the magic and happiness the children feel as they bond with ET it really matters that the film is captured from Elliot's point of view because he needs a friend and feels lonely scared frightened about his childhood because his parents are divorced and he does not have no friends to talk to no bonding connection so to speak until ET comes in and changes the family almost like Mary Poppins in a way the friendship grows and develops into something very magical and poignant, when the threat of ET possibly dying is discovered the emotion that Elliot goes through is so touching the scene where ET is in the box and Elliot explains his love and affection for ET is heartbreaking helped by John Williams's Oscar winning score just captures the mood of the film beautifully when the Bicycle flies over the moon is the greatest shot in film and the score helps Elliot and ET fly over the moon it really does John Williams made that film what it is today obviously The Master of Film did too but still the movie should have won Best Picture not Gandhi! The score's melodic material is so wonderful heartfelt and really magical almost like a lullaby at the end when the threat of ET dying looms it really is special and like the last 20 minutes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind John Williams's score ends the film as the Children get ET back to his spaceship and the whole sequence as ET says goodbye to the children is scored beautifully and the whole Elliot hugging ET and the spaceship flying away and the family looking on as it does so is all scored by John Williams's magical finale literally the piece is 15 minutes long and covers the whole last sequence of the movie every frame is scored to perfection and if you tried to take the score out of ET the power would not be there the emotional pull would not be there particularly in that last 15 sequence!

","At the time of this writing, ""E.T."" is thirty-three years old and, despite major advances in special effects and film technology, it is still a watchable classic.<br/><br/>Spielberg does a good job bringing the viewer on a journey as seen through children's eyes. And, as in ""Jaws"", he engages our imagination by not revealing the unknown stranger immediately.<br/><br/>The film can be seen as an alternative to the many other foreboding films of alien visitation. E.T. is not a conquering villain or an inscrutable destructive force. He is a childlike being with an appreciation of beauty.<br/><br/>""E.T."" shows what can be done with some puppetry, special effects, good acting, wonderful music and, of course, timeless storytelling. Like ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""E.T."" has charm and an emotionally-charged story that remains forever in style."

","This is seriously the best movie I have ever seen to this date. It has a great story line, characters and setting. In addition the movie sends out a great message. For one, that humans are truly just animals, barbaric, insensitive and ignorant creatures! e.t. melts my heart as he loves the plants and wildlife. I love that alien! Drew Barrymore is so cute and relatable if you have a bratty little sister. The main character was such a great actor with much talent. Interacting with a make believe alien must be difficult seeing as how he is not really moving or reacting himself. Anyhow, if you don't believe that its the best movie then you obviously haven't seen it."

I found myself, in a strange place, someone's back garden, there was this strange but monstrous creature (a golden dog) then I met a small boy, who wanted to keep me, he also had two other earthling people and one grown up lady, this was Elliot's mother, later on when I settled in, Elliolt and his family looked after me, and helped me to get home again I got emotionally attached to Elliot and the little girl dressed me up in old clothes and taught me to talk ""E.T, ET."" I said to Elliot when he came home from school and I built a communications device in the forest, but I caught exposure and nearly died but when I discovered I was going home, I got better and my heart glowed under my costume so I after a Long goodbye session, went home. I personally this is me now( Paul squires writing as myself) now, think that this film is a classic weepy, and it is now 30 years since it was made and I find it watchable with great music, I thought I would review this film first as though I was E.T. Then as myself I liked the space backdrop and did you know, they used real Doctors in the film! I first saw this film in the cinema in a village called Spilsby, then on video VHS and I am going to get it on DVD.

"johnnyboyz","7","1","3","3 August 2011"," Weighty and more than substantial piece flicking through a great deal of emotional substance, on top of what is a magical, creative science fiction drama.
","Aliens. Beings from outer space – touching down on planet Earth with the intent to do whatever they please. Such films with the above premise, indeed any premise revolving around human-beings coming into contact with extra terrestrials, we often find are always so much more interesting when they come to socially, rather than aggressively, intermingle with that of the Earth's inhabitants. We enjoy films such as Robert Wise's original The Day the Earth Stood Still and the recent Peter Jackson funded District 9 a whole lot more than we do, say, Transformers or Independence Day – films about creatures with the ability to journey as far as they can but with nary a lot else to do than reduce Earth to rubble. Somewhere in the midst of all of this lies Spielberg's 1982 film E.T., a film, like the best of the above examples, about an alien creature not coming to Earth with the necessity to destroy it, but to carry a message or explore or, in the titular character's case, desire to make contact.<br/><br/>When E.T. begins, it launches itself quietly; ominously and in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien from a few years previously, as this suspicious glance across the starry night sky to ghostly musical tones dominate proceedings. The set up for an uncanny, fearful representation as we uneasily look up beyond the stars at the unknown appears prominent; the camera tilting downwards revealing a dense Californian forest fore-bearing the literal physical movement that the space ship which eventually arrives will undertake. Out of the ship arrives a flurry of small creatures, shot anonymously as we struggle to focus on them for all the fern and low light. One little fella gets overly curious, gazing long fully over a nearby town from this position on a hill-top having wondered away from his ilk. He appears humble; his kind clearly have the technology to kick something undesirable off with our species but instead gather samples of plants and such, his pensive body language has him appear fearful of us rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>Chaos arrives with the coming of some humans; shot equally anonymously in their charging and rushing through the forest, they come via a bevvy of 4x4 trucks whose arrival counterbalances that of the ship's smooth descent. They explore, finding our little creature and give chase; their flashlights juxtaposing this being's increasingly glowing red chest. It stumbles and fumbles to get back to its friends, whom are readying to leave, and thus, we find ourselves going against our own kind and rooting on this little being to make it back. But it is too late: the ship departs without him and the cluster of men eventually go on to loose their target. Within that aforementioned town dwells young Elliot (Thomas), a boy living with his bigger brother Michael (MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Barrymore) alongside their divorced mother in a neat, suburban neighbourhood.<br/><br/>When we first observe Elliot, it is on a recreational summer evening with Michael and a few of his friends while they play a board game; Elliot attempts to join in, but is marginalised and kept at bay – a later meeting out in the garden with our space man, whose trundled down from the hills, the catalyst leading Elliot to explore what is, to him, the unknown, just as everything around him is to this space creature. The film branches out into a wondrous, deeply affecting drama about the lead being able to find a proverbial level with a organism after having been marginalised during the board game and by those at school. Tied into proceedings is the thriller aspect consisting of the government agents doing their utmost to find E.T., the strand doing well to maintain tension as these rather defenceless children slowly come to bond with what is the agent's prize whilst the net, unbeknownst to them, closes in.<br/><br/>The notion of E.T.'s rejection of the more aggressively inclined, less humble-a being that he is, is a sentiment beautifully, cheekily even, captured in Elliot's bedroom when the boy raises a Boba Fett plastic toy in front of that of E.T. The toy, of the Lucas-film variety, is identified by Elliot as a creature more preoccupied with blasting away at other beings; something epitomising a more shallow-a depiction of aliens that are additionally identified within the comment as being much more rife in popular culture. In having Elliot hold the toy up in the manner he does, E.T. standing in the background but still dominating the frame, Spielberg literally dwarfs this toy in comparison to his bigger; more predominant idea of what should constitute as a filmic alien: Spielberg's is a lot more interesting. The film is a cracking, rollicking adventure; a notion in spite of the fact it rarely gets outside of a quaint suburban home based in one of those bright, perky American estates. It is a film full of a great deal of emotional involvement and heady attachment to the characters, human or otherwise, therein; a film doing its utmost to cover that of a group of siblings cut apart by the divorce of their parents and their consequent realignment through this wondrous catalyst that is the falling to Earth of a space-creature. Consumatley made, imperiously acted by the child-performers and wonderfully tactile in its tonal shifts from coming of age to chase thriller to comedy, E.T. hits most, if not all, of the notes it goes for."

The Extra-Terrestrial was a stupefyingly successful box-office fairy tale by director Steven Spielberg, many of whose family films work so brilliantly because he taps into the child-like sense of wonder that lies at the heart of everyone's earliest film-going experiences. This one could hardly be simpler, but it is literally unimprovable, and works at all levels for all audiences.

","Sounds like bleating, doesn't it? Spot on! That is indeed intention to sound like the sheep in Orwell's ""Animal Farm"".<br/><br/>Frankly: All kids MUST love this. Simply because it's according to their thinking: emotional, straightforward, open-hearted, without monetary ambitions etc. The adults are, almost in a stereotypical way, the bad guys here: except for Elliot's mother, who must be regarded as a neutral person, i. e. neither 'good' nor 'bad'. Notable adult roles are the government people trying to wiretap the kids' dialogues; the doctors who don't listen to each other but each of them talking their sort of ""I was the better medicine student"" gobbledigook at the very same time. The scene with E. T. in the box and the doctors around him babbling hectically reminded me a little bit of the no less stereotypical ""Planet Of The Apes"" with a similar annotation of ""doing experiments with the innocent and defenseless"". That's exactly where Spielberg creates bias on kids so that they'll exclaim something like ""A typical doctor's behavior!"", since each one claims his diagnosis to be the best, and makes it happen: that is, his own thought of 'best possible medication' of the mysterious creature from outer space...<br/><br/>And furthermore, the (child?) viewer will summarize: merely kid's true love and friendship can even resurrect an alien from its 'death.'

The rest of the cast are good in their roles as well. The special effects are amazing too especially for that time. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this movie.

","I have now seen this film twice now, and I have to say that I really cannot see what makes this film consistently appear on top 100 film lists as well as being called a tear-jerker. Perhaps I am just not sympathetic enough, but I really never felt that I was going to or should have cried at any moment in the film. This is probably due to the fact that it was intended for children, and it succeeds at doing that. Nevertheless, I wish Spielberg would have made it more accessible to adults as well, especially those who don't care whether or not extra-terrestrial life exists. There are other flaws as well, such as the explanation of why the aliens are one earth, why ET comes back to life after dying, and why the adults consider him so dangerous. Despite all this, there are some great heartwarming moments in it. Most of the acting is good, except for Henry Thomas, who I thought just whined his way through the film. The direction of Spielberg is good as usual, and John Williams' score is timeless as usual. Still, I cannot perceive this film as one of Spielberg's greatest achievements.

","E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is the best family movie ever made. It's something everyone can enjoy no matter how old you are. Now, children who are too young to have seen it when it was first released (like myself), get to see it on the big screen with never before seen footage, a new soundtrack, and special effects enhancements. <br/><br/>A spaceship lands on Earth and little brown men venture out to study this strange planet. When a group of government officials show up, the aliens flee leaving one behind by accident. This alien is known as E.T. when is found by a young boy, Elliot (Henry Thomas). He shows his brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and his sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore), but they keep it a secret from their mother (Dee Wallace). They teach E.T. to talk and Elliot develops a strong bond with the little creature. A bond so strong, that E.T. can communicate with Elliot through his mind. Whatever E.T. is feeling, Eliot feels. This is demonstrated in a classic scene in which E.T., at the house, discovers beer and gulps down about three of them. Eliot, at school, gets drunk as well and lets out all of the frogs they are about to dissect in science class. E.T. begins to grow sick as the government officials start to find E.T.'s hiding place. <br/><br/>E.T. is an absolute classic. Seeing it on the big screen was like seeing it for the very first time. I have one thing to gripe about, though. The new enhancements to E.T.'s face are both distracting and unnecessary. They are obvious, like the great scene where E.T. says, `E.T. phone home.' It would have worked better if they just made the enhancements to eyes, rather that the entire face. The new scene is funny and doesn't slow up the pacing of the movie. At least it wasn't as bad as the whole `Greedo shoots first' scene in the rerelease of Star Wars. <br/><br/>The reason no other family film has come close to being as great as E.T. is because Steven Speilberg had faith in his kids. He wasn't afraid to add scary scenes or touchy language. He adds emotion and sympathy to his characters. But now, family films are all about slapstick and toilet humor, which E.T. is thankfully missing.<br/><br/>I love E.T. It's charming and smart. It's a film where one laughs, cries, and conjures up about every emotion known to man. Stephen Speilberg is the best storyteller of them all. The rerelease of E.T. is greatly appreciated, but the annoying enhancements are not. If it's not broken, don't fix it.---------10/10"

A good portion of foul language is used, including anatomical references. There is other crude visual content. There are some areas of the story that are vague and hard to understand, such as when a fully geared astronaut comes barging through a window. Also, inexplicably, the young main character is somehow connected to E.T. the little alien, as if together they are one entity. An adult briefly notes that the little alien appeared to him too as a boy, a very minor thing which is never explored further than the original comment. Multiple references to the Star Wars franchise (costumes, toys, and the like) are made in this movie. John Williams, the Star Wars musical composer, composed the scores for E.T. too.

"michel_broeders","9","1","4","14 September 2015"," A movie that gets better with age
","""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), one of the most famous science fiction films ever made, needs no introduction. Even if you're not the biggest filmfreak you'll know without a doubt that it was directed by the one and only Mr. Steven Spielberg. Upon its release date in 1982 the world fell in love with this oddly creature from outer-space. Not that it matters much, but even Lady Diana and Ronald Reagan were moved to tears after seeing this film. But what were those secret ingredients that made E.T. as unforgettable as it turned out to be?<br/><br/>Spielberg takes us on a trip in an American suburban development. Out in the wilderness a spaceship lands at night, with odd-looking creatures taking what seems to be samples of trees and plants. After being startled by humans the creatures depart again into outer-space. There is just one problem, they forgot one of their friends, E.T. Without spoiling too much of the script E.T. befriends a little boy named Elliott and an adventure for both little 'men' begins. <br/><br/>Our hero in this particular film, besides E.T., is in the human form of Elliott who's played by Henry Thomas, a now former child actor who gives an extraordinary performance. The strength of his performance lies in the fact that it comes across as very natural and childlike. What Thomas feeds his character is something rarely seen around child-actors in Hollywood films. <br/><br/>Upon watching ""E.T"" again, for probably the 20th time or so, it becomes clear that this film tells much more than just the story about a little boy befriending an ""Extra-Terrestrial"". In its essence ""E.T."" deals about friendship and love. The sequential story develops the back-story of our little creature, the personality of Elliott, the relationships between the humans and so on. All of this is told in a fluently manner that makes us, as viewers, involved in what is actually a creature created by special effects. We empathize in the friendship between Elliott and E.T, sometimes with tears and sometimes with laughs. <br/><br/>""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" is a film that drives on a stream of different emotions throughout its entire runtime and Spielberg serves us just the right amount of these emotional ingredients. The film has moments of childlike innocence and hope, funny and exciting moments and a sequence that's so tear-dropping even Conan the Barbarian with blow his nose during the end credits. In the end E.T. is one of the most remarkable characters ever created in Modern Cinema and a film that ,like fine wine, only gets better with age."

","E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace Stone, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote: Wonderful film about friendship that touches the heartstrings in the best of us. It has a sense of wonder about it as E.T. is discovered by a boy named Elliott who lures him to his bedroom using candy. Government agents are in search of alien activity but E.T. must get home before he dies. Steven Spielberg touches all of the bases in delivering a film that should appeal to everyone. This would seem like a family oriented counter part to his Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Visual effects are convincing allowing Spielberg to create a creature that children will adore. Henry Thomas is superb as Elliott who will grow responsible when friendship becomes top priority. Drew Barrymore as his younger sister will be highlighted in that key images of her kissing E.T's nose. Dee Wallace Stone plays their mother whom we learn is still in grief after her husband left. Robert MacNaughton plays Elliott's older brother who plays football but ultimately must take charge when Elliott and E.T are in danger. Peter Coyote plays a mysterious scientist who goes by the name Keys, and who has different intentions. Aliens are usually brought to the screen for invasion. E.T. exists for a kinder purpose.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","1 April 2015"," Good movie, but not as great as I remember it
","Like most people, I first saw this film as a little child. I think I had just learned to read so I could follow the subtitles. And it was great. Childhood hijinks, bizarre aliens, chases, toys, skipping school to hang with your new friend, getting drunk (yeah...), making excuses to your mom, distrusting adults, high adventures and grand plans. What's not to like? <br/><br/>But now, as I rewatched it for the first time as an adult, it just didn't grab me as well as it did. It's still an interesting movie and certainly iconic on every level, from visuals to the characters to the story. But somehow it seemed hollow to me, like the story wasn't as deep as it needed to be to really pull us in. And that's a problem. It's a simple kid's story trying to function as a young adults movie. Not that kid's stories cannot be deep, of course they can, but they're usually rather simple in structure. Like E.T., which goes basically like this: boy finds something strange in the forest, he brings it home or it follows him home, he tries to hide it from his parents, they become the bestest of best friends, but eventually the boy has to release his new pet back into the wild because the pet is not meant to live with humans. Simple, allegoric, message-teaching. The problems start when you try to introduce the big bad government as the antagonists or you try to include scenes with sexual or alcoholic references. Because they stand out and they seem superfluous.<br/><br/>It still works, don't get me wrong. E.T. is a cultural classic for a reason. Sure, there's a certain amount of love it or hate it to the alien's creepy muteness, sure the children are rather clichéd, sure the mom's willful ignorance requires a lot of willing suspension of disbelief. But when it works, when the bike suddenly lifts from the air, when the children are completely enthralled by their new friends, when the alien craft lands on Earth. Then it's magic.<br/><br/>I theorize that E.T. works really well for you if you're a child yourself or if you want to be a child again. It's a great movie about childhood. Unfortunately as a twenty-something I don't really fall into either of those categories, so it didn't quite work for me right now."
"The-Sarkologist","5","1","4","26 January 2012"," A memory from my childhood
","This is a really corny little movie. My friend's comment is that it is early 80's but I still think that it is corny. The date in which is was produced is irrelevant, but I think the whole reason behind the corniness is that it is a kids movie. Elliot, the main character, is a kid and he is designed for kids to relate to him. There is little Drew Barrymore for the little girlies and Elliot's older brother for the young teenagers. In essence though, this movie was aimed at the children and as such it was successful.<br/><br/>There were facets of this movie that I did not like. First was the marketing strategy. It was released in 82 in the cinemas and released about 92 on video. It disappeared in the intervening time so that when it was released everybody would rush out and buy it. Actually, it is a very clever marketing strategy the only reason that I was annoyed with it was that they did it purely for the money and I saw it as a way of suckering me in to purchasing, or hiring, it on video. In reality, it doesn't matter when the movie appears on video, if it is a good movie then I will hire it. The reason behind ET is that they pulled a money making ploy which put me off.<br/><br/>About the movie itself: ET is a fantasy movie. It is not trying to be realistic or conspiratorial: it is a fantasy and as a fantasy it succeeds. The scenes with ET flying through the air on a bicycle trying to escape the evil US government scientists are the most fantastic of this movie. Even so we see elements of social problems within this movie, such as the infringement of the government on human rights. There is a basic hatred of centralised government and this movie brings it up with the scientists studying ET. But moreso this seems to be also outlining the gap between the adults and the children. The children want to play with ET and want to look after him. They see him as a friend, where as the adults see him as a monster and a freak that needs to be studied.<br/><br/>Relationship is the important part of ET. It is the relationship between ET and Elliot. The relationship is a purely symbiotic one, something that simply does not exist in this world. It is not exploring human relationship but a fantasy relationship of symbiosis. What I mean by this relationship is that there is a psychic link between the participants of this relationship. This is natural for ET's race, and we see this with the resurrection scene. This scene is not intentionally mimicing that of Christ's death and resurrection, but rather ET dies because the symbiotic link between him and his fellow aliens has been broken, but when the link is restored, he comes back to life. We do not know if he really did die because ET is not a terrestrial being and thus we cannot say how they operate. In essence, this movie is about the relationship between a boy and an alien, but the relationship is not on a human level but on a fantasy, idealistic level.<br/><br/>I was a little annoyed with this movie because I am simply too old for it. True we all have a child like part of us inside, but I was simply irritated by the cuteness of the movie and the corniness of the child relationships, especially with the one girl who makes a short appearance as Elliot's love interest that doesn't hang around."

","ET:The Extra Terrestrial is one of Steven Spielberg's better movies, funny, touching and just wonderful. It not only entertains very young children and their parents but it reaches out to the child within us, that is something I want to feel when I watch a movie from my childhood. I love films like Beauty and the Beast, The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins and The NeverEnding Story for exactly that reason. The film is beautifully filmed, with breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The scene with ET and Elliot on the bicycle is just an amazing scene, I think John Williams's amazing score is to thank for that. The special effects are excellent, and the script is funny and touching. There is one sight gag with ET hiding among Elliot's stuffed animal toys that warms my heart every time. The acting is very good, with Henry Thomas appealing as Elliot and Dee Wallace sincere and sensitive as the mother. I also loved Drew Barrymore as the sassy and big-mouthed sister. What makes this film though is ET himself, even with his large eyes and long arms for an alien ET is adorable, sad and sweet. The part when Elliot cries when ET is dying is a real tearjerker, it kills me every time I see this film. Overall, I love this film, it is so special and delightful. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","The movie E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is about an alien life form that is left on Earth by a space craft. A boy named Elliott comes across E.T. and brings him into his room in order to protect the alien from being discovered and possibly killed by other human beings. The part of Elliott is played by an actor named Henry Thomas. Elliott has a brother named Michael played by Robert MacNaughton, and a sister named Gertie who is played by Drew Barrymore. Michael and Gertie discover that Elliott is keeping this alien in his room and are sworn to secrecy. Together, the three children learn about the powers that E.T. possesses, and teach it things about how human beings live on Earth.<br/><br/>During E.T.'s stay at the residence, Elliott and his siblings learn about its many different powers that are unlike those of a human being's. Elliott also gains an appreciation of how E.T. thinks and feels by experiencing its senses firsthand. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is that one should not judge something until adequate information is known about it. Another way to state this is ""don't judge a book by its cover"". At first thought of a creature from outer space the children are frightened. As they get to know this unfamiliar creature they learn that he actually has much in common with them, except for a few special features. Another movie with a similar theme is Harry and the Henderson's. In this movie the Sasquatch is feared in the beginning, but eventually it is learned that he is actually a friendly creature. <br/><br/>Much of this movie is shot in low key lighting which gives it a more dramatic effect. It also gives the alien a more daunting look in the beginning of the film, which formulates the impression that E.T. is a harmful creature by giving it shadows cast across its face. This feature adds to the theme of the movie as it gives E.T. an erroneous sense of being intimidating while he is simply harmless. One motif in this film was the repetitive saying ""E.T. phone home"". This adage brings to light the fact that deep down, E.T. is much like a human being. E.T. is able to learn some of the English language and connect with the children. This motif goes along with the theme of the movie that one should not judge something until they fully understand it.<br/><br/>Overall, Elliott, Gertie and Michael learn a great deal from the space creature named E.T. What was once a space invader to be feared by everyone, actually developed a close relationship with the children. E.T. and the children learned a great deal from each other, particularly Elliott who has a more intimate connection with the creature."

Without taking the special effects into consideration, the movie is essentially a naked alien baboon with magical powers handing out with a kid.  First, what was a highly advanced alien doing naked and alone on our surface?  The answer: picking flowers. Yes, that makes perfect sense.  Secondly, he has super magical powers of telepathy and telekinesis, coupled with the technical know-how to create complicated technology with kids toys, but he has absolutely no ability to survive on his own, must completely depend on a kid, and has absolutely no preconception of our planet what-so-ever.

","As a kid, I was an E.T.-emo kid. Owned the puppets, boardgame etc. The movie touched me many times.<br/><br/>As an adult, I'm done with it. Why? First of all, I never liked the character of Elliot. He's a depressing kid, not enjoyable to watch and a character that doesn't even try to make the best of the situation he and his family are at the moment.<br/><br/>As Robert Englund once said about the ANOES-remake: You never should start a movie with kids who are already depressed. I think this goes for E.T. as well. There's nothing to like or identify with in Elliot.<br/><br/>That being said, I have to talk about the 2002 digital 'upgrades' by Spielberg. The first one in the movie is a good one: E.T. running towards the space-ship, being chased by Keys and his gang, used to be just a stiff doll on a tracking rail. The digital upgrade is a very good improvement.<br/><br/>But the rest of the digital upgrades are trash. Everybody knows about the walkie-talkies being replacements for the guns. Even Spielberg himself regrets that today. But the worst are the scenes in which the beloved alien is replaced by a digital version of him. The animated E.T. acts and behaves way different than the puppet versions and moves as if the laws of nature towards physical life do not count for his part. The additional scenes add nothing to the movie. I was looking forward to them when I first heard about it, but they were a letdown.<br/><br/>Because of these reasons I have grown to dislike E.T. Except for the soundtrack by John Williams. Listeneing to that is a time-travel trip back to 1982 when as a kid I was enachented by the magic of this movie. Thank you, John Williams!"

","The Extra-Terrestrial is one of the biggest money makers in box-office history. It is quite possibly the best known of all Steven Spielberg's films. Even at the relatively young cinematic age of two decades, it is beloved by multiple generations of film-goers. Yet it is arguably the most overrated motion picture to arrive in theaters during the 1980s. Obviously, this isn't a popular thing to say, and it's not meant to denigrate E.T. as being badly or clumsily made. In fact, viewed as a fable or an allegory (it's actually based on The Day the Earth Stood Still, which is a thinly-veiled re-telling of the Christ story), E.T. is successful. But there are times, especially during the final third, when it is hugely overwrought. Spielberg has always shown a penchant for overt manipulation, but nowhere is this more obvious than in E.T., where he pulls out all the stops in an effort to bleed tears from the eyes of every audience member. It doesn't take a cynical nature to recognize what the director is doing. Regardless, this is a classic."

","""E.T."" is an all-time classic that deals with the extra-terrestrial E.T. who is left behind on planet earth by his species and meets Eliott, a young boy, who gives him shelter and helps him to make contact with his fellow friends.<br/><br/>The movie ages quite well. All the cute and funny sequences still deliver the humor and heart that was put into the production. Even the special effects, that are by all means outdated, are carried out with enough care to avoid them from looking ridiculous. It is a typical case of a film settled somewhere between a children's movie, for which it is at parts quite scary, and a plot that adults can enjoy as well. The one thing that really bothered me was that for my taste too much cheesiness is woven into the plot. When E.T. is reanimated by Eliott's love for example, I can't help but feel that that's maybe a bit much. But otherwise this is still a movie you can enjoy with the whole family and one that had quite an influence on many people's childhoods.<br/><br/>All in all you can't do much wrong by giving it a try, either as a reminiscence from your own childhood or as a classic that you shouldn't miss out on."

The seem to have it growing inside of the ship and they are picking up some from the forest floor to take with them. Humans show up and try to capture the aliens. The aliens close up their ship and ET gets left behind. The humans keep looking for him but he hides well. Soon Elliot discovers ET in his back shed but his family doesn't believe him. Everyone goes out to search, but find nothing. Everyone goes to bed except for Elliot. He wasn't convinced that it was nothing. He goes back outside to search. Elliot and ET run right into each other and they both start screaming in fear of one another.<br/><br/>The next morning Elliot leaves the house and decides to leave a trail of food in order to meet up with ET again. That night Elliot is really determined to find ET so he sleeps in his backyard. Soon, ET comes out of the shed and reappears to Elliot. Elliot is terrified at first but understands that ET won't hurt him. Elliot takes him into his house and up to his bedroom. Elliot falls asleep and the next morning fakes being sick so he won't have to go to school. He tries to communicate with ET but the language barrier is too difficult to make work. When Elliot's brother and sister get home from school, he shows them. Their reactions were horrible, but they all agree to keep him a secret.<br/><br/>Elliot eventually has to start attending school again. ET is left at home to get into everything. ET gets in the fridge and drink all the beer. Somehow Elliot ends up drunk at school. This is the first time we see that ET and Elliot have linked up and are now in a sense one with each other. By the end of the day, ET can talk and he starts building technology to contact his home. There now sits a truck across from their house that detects that ET is living with them. The next day the kids and ET go out trick or treating for Halloween. This will be their first attempt to connect ET with his home. While everyone is out of the house, the people parked outside decide to break into the house to look for evidence. ET's invention to call home works and Elliot is very excited. Then he realizes that he's going to lose ET and that makes him cry.<br/><br/>The next day, Elliot and ET get really really sick. They both feel like they are dying. Elliot's mom tries to run away with the children but men in space suits show up and take ET and Elliot. ET separates from Elliot and Elliot gets healthy. ET continues to keep getting sicker. Finally ET dies. Next thing we know, ET is alive and Elliot and his brother steal ET because his people are coming for him. Everyone is in an uproar! All the adults are chasing the kids who are trying to take ET back to his ship. The kids make it to the forest and the spaceship appears. <br/><br/>For me, the theme of this movie is sacrifice. ET needed help and the children protected him and took care of him. Once he was dying, they felt helpless and afraid. When he died, that was the lowest point of the movie. The despair felt by the children was unbearable. Once ET came back to life, the children knew it was do or die. They sacrificed everything to make sure ET was safe and with his people. All that sacrifice happened because of love!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","8 November 2015"," The ultimate non-horror alien movie
","""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is an American science-fiction fantasy film from almost 35 years ago that won 4 Academy Awards, 3 technical and 1 for John Williams' score that basically won every other award that year as well. The movie comes close to the 2-hour mark and is considered a classic today. I myself would not go so far and include it in my absolute favorite films, but nonetheless it was a pretty decent watch and E.T. certainly is a truly memorable character. Maybe you also need to watch this film around the age of 12 and not in your adulthood for the first time to truly appreciate the magic of it. That said, I think there were a couple really memorable scenes, mostly of course the shot with the bike ride in front of the moon, which is truly famous.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg truly played with audiences on this one. You never know where it is going. Early on, when E.T. and the boy meet for the first time, it could very well have been a horror movie. Lets be honest here, the character of E.T. with his looks would have worked as a scary character as well. Then later on, it could have been a thriller with the doctors and police force all coming to capture E.T. But they actually were really friendly towards him. Pay attention how there are also no guns in this film to make it accessible for young audiences. I felt it interesting how basically everybody who wasn't family had no face in this film until around the 80 minute mark. And when we saw Peter Coyote, he was introduced in a way where he could also have been the major antagonist. But nope, we see his face, he becomes a friend. Apart from that, Peter Coyote is really used to playing likable characters. He is amazing in my all-time favorite ""A Walk to Remember"" too and I'm very glad he won his first Emmy this year.<br/><br/>So yeah, all in all, this film is a great achievement technically and a good watch in terms of drama, emotion and all the supernatural aspects. you should not watch this if you are in the mood for a particularly realistic movie. This one isn't, but that is not a problem as it somehow even adds a certain charm to it in my opinion. And let's not forget, this is fantasy and does not need to be realistic. Final shoutout to Drew Barrymore in one of her fist acting roles. She became the biggest star from the cast in the following decades. ""E.T."" is a good watch and I recommend it. Finally, a rip to writer Melissa Mathison who just died a couple days ago."

WTF? Hollywood got away with telling kids to trust outsiders (aliens in this case) more than authority or your parents. While real effects of divorce on leftover families are real, this was the beginning of Hollywood catering to the non-standard family dollars.

However, at the end of this movie, I felt affection toward ET because of his kind and admirable character. His cute character is one of the reasons why this movie is loved many people. My favorite scene is that ET and Eliot fly by bicycle. This scene is so beautiful and moving, and music is also good. Eliot and ET are very pure and remind us of true friendship.

","This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece.<br/><br/>The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music.<br/><br/>The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days.

It is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies: an adventure about a young boy named Elliott and his new alien friend E.T. trying to get E.T. back to his planet. It is a heartwarming journey full of memorable scenes and incredible lighting and photography. This quirky family classic is a favorite of mine and is a part of my childhood. E.T. has some of the most amazing music I have ever heard in film. ""Turn on Your Heartlight"" by Neil Diamond is the main theme of this movie, and a good one at that. The storyline and character development are extremely well done. By the end of the film, you have an emotional attachment to the majority of the characters. The scene where Elliott and E.T. are riding bikes and then suddenly start to float into the air over a silhouette of the moon is fantastic photography at its finest. Overall, I give the movie five out of five stars. I find this movie suitable for all ages. Check this flick out on HDNet Movies later this month.

Follow along as Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, finds a lost alien that he names E.T. Can Elliott help E.T. find his way home? You'll just have to watch to find out. My favorite character is E.T. because E.T. is just the most adorable thing ever. He's just so cute and so funny. Also, my favorite scene is when Elliott. realizes that his plant is coming back to life and he's, like, ""Oh, my gosh, E.T. could be alive again."" And so he goes over to the coffin, opens it, and he's, like, ""Oh, E.T."" and E.T. goes, ""Home phone, phone home"" and he just starts yelling ""home"" and ""phone."" It's absolutely hilarious. Elliott has to go running and get a blanket and wrap it around his head so no one will know E.T. is alive. He's so happy after that. So, I love that scene. The cinematography and special effects in this film are absolutely amazing. I am so impressed with how they made E.T. look so cute and so real. Also, the music adds such great effect to this movie. I think it is great; they did a great job. I think that this film is for people of all ages because it's such a great film and it's a classic. I think everyone is going to enjoy this.

This movie is about a boy named Elliott who meets an alien named E.T. Elliot's little sister, named Gertie, is too young to understand why E.T. is on planet Earth. Elliott and Gertie have to go through a lot of twists and turns because they have to keep E.T. a secret. The best scene in this movie is when Elliott and E.T. are touching fingers. It's such a touching and magical moment. The message in this movie is Elliott and E.T. are so connected that they do not have any barriers. My favorite character in this movie is E.T. because he's so magical, loving and caring. I give this movie five out of five stars. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

","I avoided the movie when it was first released because I thought to myself it's going to be about all these smart-aleck, over-talkative, full-of-themselves kids and how they saved this cute little Alien from the hands of the FBI. And if there's one thing I dislike it's a bunch of undisciplined, trick-or-treat kids who feel the world loves them to run riot and snap their fingers in the faces of authority. But when my local DVD store offered the Single Disc Special Edition for a mere $6.50, how could I pass it up? Yes, the movie was almost as bad in its storyline and characterizations -- even worse in fact, as the mother is presented as an even worse bimbo than her kids with not even half a brain in her skull -- but the little creature himself is anything but your usual cutesy-cutesy, and that in itself makes a very agreeable change. The movie's other main asset is John Williams who makes a sterling effort to save the day when the movie finally runs out of puff, plot and credibility!"

","I first saw this movie when I was just a little kid, and it is one of my favourite movies. It was directed by one of the best filmmakers in modern cinematic history. Steven Spielberg. The story focuses on an alien who was mistakenly left behind on earth and trying to find a way back home and a boy who befriends him. Two weeks after this came out in theatres, another alien visitation film came out in the theatres. John Carpenter's The Thing. Which did not fare as well in the box as E.T. did. I think the reason E.T. got a better reception than the thing is because the alien in E.T. is sweet, cute and lovable. Whereas the alien in John Carpenter's The Thing is mean and evil. In other words, E.T. shows a very positive view on alien visitations while John Carpenter's The Thing portrays The Thing portrays the exact opposite. Personally, I like either kind. If you like movies where the aliens are portrayed as good, cute, and lovable, I would recommend E.T. If you like movies where the aliens are evil and mean, I would recommend Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, Independence Day and War Of The Worlds. E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial is a timeless classic."

","This is my third viewing of ""ET"" after its first broadcasting in French TV (canal +) and its release in theater on Christmas time in my grandparents' city. At this time, I haven't been able to appreciate it because everybody said it make cry and so while watching it, I was always telling me ""don't cry, don't cry"". I know how much we can be fool as kid. Now as an adult, i am mature and it's indeed a movie with great emotions. I still don't cry because instead I feel good. In fact, it's funny to see Spielberg tells a story from the point of view of a child and now as an adult, I can notice it. When I was a child, the movie wasn't so surprising. Actually, it's great to live again those days alone at home, the false colds, the garden from outer space, the first crush... It was also a good lesson of truth that an open heart as Elliot means total acceptance and sharing. He doesn't ask anything from ET but welcomes him as he is and offers him all his toys. If adults behave this way, the world would be a better place. Beyond, the movie is full of surprises: Star wars is everywhere, MacQuarrie designs the ship, there's a future Baywatch star and William's score is among his best ones. I'm agree with Splielberg when he says that Williams make him better. For those who desire to follow the adventure, they can read the book ""ET and the green planet"" which is a fine sequel.<br/><br/>Pairing: ""Close encounters"". Of course: what ET did before meeting Eliot."

Now, as you probably know, I'm a huge science fiction freak, and I extremely enjoy this movie. It's a loving tale of friendship and hope. Steven Spielberg once again does another brilliant directing job, and brings another instant classic. The special effects are like no other, since the E.T. alien is now an iconic figure. The performances by the young cast is surely the main subject of the movie.

","I said that it was hard to top Jaws and Close encounters, but Spielberg topped it with Raiders of the lost ark. Raiders of the lost ark is a hard film to top. But if you know Steven Spielberg, he can do it. And he did. With his follow up to Raiders of the lost ark. Raiders of the lost ark is somewhere on my top ten, but E.T. is somewhere in my top five.<br/><br/>E.T. is a beautiful film. Spielberg's previous films were all just fantastic, but E.T. was something else. E.T. is a deeply moving motion picture with a huge heart. It had a heart so huge that it did something to me that most films never do. It did to me what 2009's Up did to me. It got a tear out of me. Actually, a few. I know its pathetic but its such a touching film. Not only is it a touching movie, it taps into the child inside of you.<br/><br/>Elliot(Henry Thomas) is a lonely boy. And one night he discovers an alien.He names him E.T. He takes care of the alien for a while, along with his brother and sister(a very young Drew Barrymore). But E.T. becomes closest to Elliot. The two have a friendship so strong that after a bit of time they sort of become a part of each other. When E.T. gets sick, Elliot does too. So the only way for it to stop is to get E.T. back to his ship. But not without the authorities trying to hunt him down.<br/><br/>When I saw J.J. Abraham's Super 8 a few months ago, it brought me back to E.T. and how much I loved it, and that is the main reason why Super 8 was such an excellent film. But it doesn't live up to E.T. E.T.'s special effects, for its time, were marvelous. John William's music is part of what brought the tears to my eyes. The music in E.T. just tugs on your heart strings.<br/><br/>I may be wrong, and, please tell me that I am, but I believe that E.T. isn't on the Top 250. Now, why? How could this not make the list? E.T. is such a beautiful film. Elliot's love for E.T. is the main touching thing about it. Elliot, his brother and Sister's love for E.T. is moving. Just the whole film is marvelous. The viewers on IMDb must change the list once again, and put E.T. on it. It's the best film Spielberg has ever done. Maybe he can top it some day, but thats going to be hard.<br/><br/>A"

At one point, young Thomas is directed to bathe himself, but ""E.T."" appeared to be self-cleaning. And, there is only one truly threatening gun, which added tension to the chase.

","I'm reading the positive reviews of this film by those who were kids when it first came out, and I never realized what an impact it had on youngsters of the era. I guess that's because I was an adult at the time, and wasn't relating to it's appeal for nostalgic sentiment. Films like ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" do a better job of bringing back that sense of camaraderie I had with the guys in the neighborhood I grew up with, when every afternoon was a ball game, and yes, tooling around town on our bikes was the only way to go.<br/><br/>It's said that a person's golden age occurs roughly between the ages of eight and early teens, and as an adult, one will look back on those years with particular fondness and longing. I can understand how ""E.T."" would have that effect on people who were kids in the early Eighties. Spielberg takes a sad sack looking alien of a creature and magically transforms him into a boy's best friend by virtue of creating a symbiotic bond between E.T. and young Elliott (Henry Thomas). As the story progresses, the other members of his family meet E.T. under different circumstances, each fraught with a mixture of fear and humor in just the right proportion. The goblin in the closet scene is bound to elicit a chuckle or two, and the trick or treat scene where E.T. as a ghost takes after Yoda is a blast. For those of us who like to stay young at heart, there will always be a place for films like ""E.T"", ""Star Wars"", and ""The Wizard of Oz"", along with those magical bicycle rides across the face of the moon at midnight."

","One of the big secrets to the blockbuster format of the late 70s and early 80s was that while the movies were primarily aimed at an adult audience, for the most part they were also fine to take your kids along to. It was only a small twist then for that most savvy of blockbuster pioneers Steven Spielberg to create a picture that was made for kids but could also appeal to the grown-ups in the audience. But most of all, like the director's earlier hits, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial works because it is just so well thought out and perfectly pulled off.<br/><br/>The opening moments of E.T. are a masterful piece of filmmaking. Spielberg shows us what the aliens are doing without revealing quite what they look like. We see a few silhouettes through the trees, a couple close-ups of hands and feet, even some point-of-view shots, but no clear views. This builds up a feeling of wonder and anticipation. We only get to see exactly what E.T. is like when Elliot encounters him face-to-face, which helps us identify with Elliot's discovery of his new friend. Bizarrely, in the CGI-ed up 2002 re-release Spielberg violates his own earlier genius by including a very clear shot in the opening scene of E.T. running into a clearing as his spaceship departs. This, to my mind, is far worse than the oft-maligned change of cops' guns into walkie-talkies, because it would destroy that sense of curiosity for a first time viewer. Spielberg claimed the re-release is how he would have done it first time round had he had the technology, but I reckon he's mistaken. It seems in his drive to make the creature more realistic he forgot the careful touches that made the picture so vital in the first place.<br/><br/>Thankfully, even in the overdone re-release there is enough of the director's original inventiveness shining through. A move like cutting down the line on the ringing telephone seems a bit excessive, until you later see an identical bit of cutting on E.T.'s makeshift equivalent, encouraging us to draw a parallel between the two machines. Spielberg keeps the focus on the younger characters by having some of the less important adult figures (such as the teacher or some of the government scientists) appear only vaguely – hands, backs, but never faces. In contrast, the focus is constantly on the facial expressions of the three children and E.T. A really important moment is the reaction shot of E.T. as he watches Elliot and Michael making threats over Gertie's favourite toy. At that point, the little alien stops being an odd creature and becomes a feeling, empathising character.<br/><br/>And then there is so much else to this picture that make it so wonderful. There is its touching story, one of the most heart-warming aspects of which is the way E.T.'s presence brings the family together. There is John Williams' powerful and evocative score that seems so utterly in tune with every image. And the performances of the three young actors, natural and deeply poignant, and even out-acting their on screen mother Dee Wallace. A moment like the release of the frogs and the recreation of a scene from The Quiet Man, inter-cut with the original may be incredibly surreal for a kids picture, but it is a gorgeous tribute to all that is romantic in cinema. The ironic thing is that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is such an intelligent and beautiful production, it moves me more as an adult that it did as a child."

","Dude, this movie is an awesome example of great filmmaking. Not only is the story great, the storytelling is fabulous (which ARE two different things, mind you....you can have a great story, yet poorly execute the telling of it), and the kid actors are all incredible. However, I would recommend seeing the original version without all the added scenes and such. To me, there is something significant about seeing a movie the way it was first made. Adding CGI stuff later I think takes away from the cinematic history the movie holds. Plus, the CGI makes E.T. look too cartoony, and less real. It's like at first there's an actual ""thing"" there with the actor, being lit by lights and filmed by the camera, and then all of a sudden it switches to something intangible. A digitally created imposter trying to pose as the once ""real"" character. Yes the movements and expressions might be slow, or choppy, since it is a puppet, but I'd rather see a movie and say ""Whoah, check out what cool effects they did back then with the technology they had at the time!"" than say, ""Well, I have no idea what they were capable of back then because it's all been altered and overshadowed by present technological advances in special effects..."" (come on, you all know that's exactly what you think too!). But, even so, the movie itself is still great one way or the other, because regardless of the level of special effects, what matters most is the story! If you'd like to know some other cool things about what made this film so great and so influential to our culture, check out a video I did to invite people to re-watch this movie! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn6heIayYTM it's totally the cheese!

","This film cannot be denied praise for many reasons. The great acting, great visuals, great dialogue, and a boatload of magic. This movie is classic. It feels like one of those movies that a hundred years from now will still be watched by millions. The ending which probably everyone who is reading this know is one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It takes its time, and moves slowly so you can fully soak in the beauty of it. As for the rest of the film it is filled with wonder. The direction is great throughout. Spielberg really did a good job at making everything feel magical. What really gives this film the magic it has is the score. John Williams does an amazing job. Without his great score the film wouldn't be complete. So overall this movie is the definition of timeless. A film that still today will fill you with amazement.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"

","I hadn't seen E.T. in about 15 years when I was maybe 6 years old. It's a movie that everyone has seen and acknowledges as a good movie, but it really deserves more than that. I think the movie suffers from the stigma of being a ""family movie"" so that people are reluctant to list it as the great movie that it is. When I picked it up at the movie store, I saw that a review on the box said ""One of the great American films."" Yeah right, I thought. Surely this is just the obligatory lip service that is so often directed at Spielberg because he's such a commercial American success. Wow, was I ever jaded, and this movie made me realize just how much so. I loved this movie.<br/><br/>It's a testament to the film's greatness that it can have such broad appeal and still maintain a level of artistry that keeps the movie fresh after all these years. It's difficult to summarize why this movie is so good, but all I can say is that it reminds us of why we all fell in love with movies in the first place. It's magical, it's fun, it's touching, and it's beautiful. I'll even say a few bold things about it's place in movie history. I believe that it is:<br/><br/><ul><li>Spielberg's best movie </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One of the top 3 movies of the 80's </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The greatest science fiction film of all time</li></ul><br/><br/>Wow.

","E.T. is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. The story, acting, and music are all phenomenal. It truly is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story is about an Extra Terristrial (E.T.) who gets left behind on Earth on accident. Soon he befriends a young boy named Elliot and the two form a friendship that changes both their lives.<br/><br/>The story is a pretty good one. This time an alien that comes to Earth is not a bad guy or a threat. Rather it is peaceful and just wants to return home. At the beginning this film is pretty scary, but as soon as you see Elliot and E.T. become friends the film is really touching and moving and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>E.T. is a great character. Peaceful and curious, he just wants to go home. Also he has the awesome ability of telekenisis and can heal things with his fingers. One of the greatest non human characters in film history.<br/><br/>The children actors in this film are legendary. Drew Barrymore is great as Gertie. Henry Thomas puts forth a legendary performance as Elliot, true that it no doubt will be his most memorable role and one that always will be associated with him. Also the actor who played Elliots brother was good as well.<br/><br/>The music, is legendary. John Williams does a phenomenal job putting together a score that perfectly fits the film at the important points.<br/><br/>One of the greatest films of all time.

","Assignment 5-4 Professor DeSando April 26, 2010 Catt Campbell E. T.: The Extra Terrestrial<br/><br/>E. T. was first seen by viewing audiences in 1982, it brought hope and love to people from all different walks of life, ""Mary"" Dee Wallace, inspired mothers to trust their first instinct when dealing with their children. ""Elliot"" Henry Thomas gave children hope that their fantasy's can come true. The central insight is a multiplex of wonder, misunderstanding, and friendship. As Elliot finds himself entangled in a new found friendship with an unidentifiable species, he finds it difficult to reveal the true nature of his new found friend. He begins to go off into a spiral of lies, distant behavior, and adult decision making that he thought was beyond his wildest dreams. As Elliot begins to embark on the task of helping his friend, he finds himself and family lives at risk. What is young Elliot to do save his Extra Terrestrial friend, or try to salvage some sort of normal way of life with his family? As the saga unfolds we see young Elliot and his family makes sacrifices, new hopes, and redeems happiness by making the ultimate sacrifice. As in Disney movie The Princess and the Frog, we see how sacrifice and love concur all misleading evils. The lighting throughout the whole movie is an intricate part of the film; Spielberg does a fantastic job of relaying the emotion of the character in each shot delivered. You feel as if you're living in the scene with the character, as they take the falls, fight off the villains, and cry their eyes out! Spielberg motif in E. T. is subtle, but evident in how he selects the holiday played out in the film ""Halloween"", giving you mind blogging clues smoothly and allowing the audience to make their own conclusions on what might be coming next. He offers you a sense of relatable emotion to E. T.'s character, and almost validating that human beings come from another species with the scene where Elliot sleeps outside unharmed waiting on his Extra Terrestrial friend. Once again the lighting in this scene is drizzled with dim unfrosted lighting giving audience a jilted perspective of what Elliot emotion is going through. The audience is left with no choice, but to wonder how this friendship occurred and does it have sustainable longevity. We as the audience can only hope that the outcome for both Elliot and his Extra Terrestrial friend sustains the hands of time."

","I'm not normally one to bash other people's opinions, but if you dislike this movie, than you had better have some damn good reasons for it. E.T. is one of those movie that I just can't see anyone disliking, it's pretty much perfect in every way. Yeah there are parts that are better than others, but I can't understand disliking it.<br/><br/>Are there any problems? Well I guess the only reason someone could dislike it is because it tries way too hard to tug at your heartstrings. It may be a little too sentimental.<br/><br/>But you know what this movie can be as overly sentimental as it wants. The relationships between everyone in the movie are perfect. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot makes it almost heartbreaking when they get sick. Elliot and his siblings relationship is perfect, that is exactly how siblings act. The kids with their mother. It all works. The special effects are amazing, it's hilarious, and to date, has the scariest scene in any movie as far as my opinion goes. THe scene in the weeds where Elliot finds E.T. is still scares me.<br/><br/>Is there any more reasons to keep talking, everyone knows this movie is great, and if you don't...well, that's your opinion I guess, but I still find it weird."

","This movie show us a sympathy between an alien and a human. they could communicate with each other by telepathy. Also. They connected with telepathy or something special. So, both was one. Either E.T or Eliot hurt, if that happened, another one would also get hurt. In movie, although E.T was died, Eliot could survive fortunately. And by a miracle, E.T was revived again, and they successfully ran away from the F.B.I. And then E.T went to his planet. An alien and a human, they could communicate, it's very interesting for me. really, Does an alien exist? I think , they could exist long time ago and somewhere. but now. they can't exist at least in the earth. however,they might exist other solar system. Anyway, A hero never dies."

Elliott left Reese's Pieces to lure the alien later known as E.T., who was a major voice make up of animals and recordings of Pat Welsh, back to the house and up into his bedroom.<br/><br/>Elliot acts sick the next day in order to stay at home with his new found friend that he later introduces to his brother Michael and his sister Gertie later on. After swearing to keep the alien a secret they help hide him from their mom, Mary; who is played by Dee Wallace. The three children decide to keep the alien, who they soon find out has powers.<br/><br/>The alien shows powers healing a plant and levitating different balls when he was trying to communicate where he was from.

As their journey continues they ultimately meet up with a scientist who wants to dissect E. T. Determined not to let that happen and after watching E.T. and Elliot nearly die, his siblings and a few of Michael's friends help them escape. E. T. levitates the bike while being pursued by the scientist, he is then able to reach his mother ship where he is able to escape unharmed by humanity and learning that he will always have a friend in Elliot here on Earth.<br/><br/>There were a number of special effects that were done on this film such as piecing together the voice for E. T. The lighting in the dark forest and the camera angle during the levitation of the bike scene were outstanding. I remember seeing this film as a child in the drive-in and the effects and lighting were truly what made it a great film.<br/><br/>In addition to trying to help the boys the main focus of the theme of this movie on the part of E. T. is that there is no place like home, this, is closely related to the same theme that was seen in another great movie, The Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>My personal opinion of this movie: It was one of the Greatest of All Times."

","An alien is stranded on Earth and a bunch of suburban kids attempt to help him get home.<br/><br/>It's amazing to think that such a simple and standard story would go on to become a global phenomenon. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, directed by Steven Spielberg, blasted its way into pop culture and simultaneously became one of the most cherished films of all time. It's not hard to see why, for E.T. appeals to every member of the family, from the joyous set ups as E.T. stumbles around middle America suburbia, to the doses of magic so gleefully constructed by Spielberg's inner child. Those wishing to scratch away at the surface (and there are many who have previously) will find Spielberg affecting his picture with divorce subtexts (his parents divorce was known to upset him deeply), whilst the government ""villains"" show an astute aside to paranoia of the times and suspicions of political operatives.<br/><br/>Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore and Peter Coyote star. The score, now famous and likely to bring about goose bumps with at the opening bars, is from John Williams, with cinematography coming from Allen Daviau. Shown in the main from a child's perspective, the film is still a wonder that charms and informs on repeat viewings. So much so that as it approaches its 40th birthday, its longevity and all encompassing appeal shows no sign of abating. Something that Spielberg and his crew can rightly feel very proud about. 9/10"

","It received a standing ovation at Cannes. It brought Princess Diana and Ronald and Nancy Reagan to tears. It made a star of seven-year-old Drew Barrymore, raked in the most box office revenue of any movie made up to that time (and more than any movie made in the '80s), made us realize that ugly space turds could be lovable and peaceful, spawned a swarm of lesser copycats and even Richard Attenborough, the director of Gandhi, the film that beat it to Best Picture at the Academy Awards, conceded that it was robbed. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, underneath all the hype and even its apparent ""saccharine"" nature that in some ways has tainted its reputation, is still a film that can reduce grown men to blubbering messes by the time the end credits begin to roll, and that can still enchant viewers young and old as much as it did in 1982.<br/><br/>Working from a story he had nurtured since childhood and that evolved into a wonderful screenplay by Melissa Mathison, Spielberg – in following the adventures of Elliott (Henry Thomas), a lonely 10-year-old boy from a single-parent family who is befriended by an alien botanist left behind on Earth by accident by his people – offers a knockout directorial effort that is by far one of his best. By cleverly choosing to shoot the film chronologicically he coaxes wonderful performances from all his cast, both the kids and the adults (Thomas drew on the memory of the day his dog died in order to achieve the emotion he needed to evoke on the last day of filming). More importantly for a fantasy film, he marriages all the post-production elements seamlessly: Allen Daviau's cinematography in the bike flight sequences provides the viewer with an adrenaline rush that has rarely been matched before or since in cinema, the visual effects (albeit largely due to the touch-ups that occurred for the film's 20th anniversary re-release in 2002), don't show 27 years, and John Williams' towering score ought to be compared to works by any classical composer.<br/><br/>Its huge success made it a worldwide phenomenon in its time and its fanbase just keep growing in numbers, and rightfully so. However, despite its enviable performance at the box office, and the considerable amount of praise that critics and audiences continue to heap on it, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial also remains one of the most widely misunderstood of all films. Frequently still written off by some as just a standard piece of frothy, cutesy juvenile drivel, this is actually far darker film than it initially seems. In the true fashion of most of the blockbusters he's helmed, here Spielberg makes you look underneath all the wondrous fantasy aspects of the story to uncover its true thematic power and importance. E.T. actually offers depictions of nuclear family break-ups, loneliness, isolation, humans testing on non-human species, and tolerance, and some have even claimed E.T. is a Christ allegory (which Spielberg vehemently denies.) Once the viewer discovers these deeply-buried thematic elements of the story, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial becomes much more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Although Spielberg considers this to be the epitome of all his work as a director, I very slightly prefer Schindler's List and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this has a fair claim to be the very last word in family film-making. It's a film that I can watch whenever I'm need of inspiration, and time has done nothing to diminish its wonder. Who would've thought that an ugly space turd could work his magic on successive generations like that, even after nearly 30 years?"

A touching and heart warming film that will make you cry, it will make you laugh and if you're an adult, will bring you back to that nostalgic place where the most special of things happened to you for the first time.<br/><br/>What makes ET a more memorable piece of work is the astounding and epic scoring of John Williams.

","""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"" has always been a favorite movie of mine since I saw it as a kid. There are many aspects as to I like this film, but the biggest reason is the character E.T. a diminutive, mushroom-shaped headed alien with two big eyes.<br/><br/>To briefly put the plot of ""E.T."", it is about a boy named Elliot who finds and befriends an alien who has been left behind. The movie pulls me into it like a melodrama. Rather than focusing on dialog, since E.T. doesn't speak, his/its pair of big eyes and human-like facial expressions grasps me through the many emotions he/it expresses. When he/it does speak, it is minimal and rudimentary-almost nonverbal like a parrot and his words are from the heart. <br/><br/>The fictional character E.T. touches and brings gladness to my heart every time I see it, and every time I think about him/it. It fills my heart with innocence, hope, and good cheer. The movie reminds of the imagination I had as a child, as well as the innocence. In addition, the film's ""feel good"" attitude has outstanding visual effects, beautiful cinematography, and John Williams' ultimate score (second to ""Star Wars""). Henry Thomas's performance as the boy Elliot is among the best I've seen in a child actor. He doesn't sound rehearsed or coached like so many other child actors are; he is sheer excellence and believable as a kid who wants a friend and gets his wish. <br/><br/>This movie also has some of Steven Spielberg's most brilliant direction, an individual who can tell a unique and great narrative, supported by awe-inspiring camera shots and angles, (particularly with the bicycle sequence). ""E.T."" is a movie that is to be seen for all ages. It will make you laugh, tense, and even cry. 10/10"

","My Take: A classic family movie. Moving, tear-jerking and simply brilliant.<br/><br/>(This is a review of the 2002 re-restored edition) <br/><br/>Come on, admit it! It gets you every time. I would. You know what I am talking about, those scenes that still bring a small tear into our eyes and a cheer to our hearts. Whether it's the scene where E.T., who got sick, is desperately being cured by a couple of scientists who only want him alive for the (non-dying) sake of science, while the boy who becomes his friend only wants him alive because of their friendship. Or what about that scene near the end, the scene where little E.T., finally found his way back to his spaceship. As the lights flood from the doorway and the doors almost close, as E.T.'s earth-bound friends go teary-eyed, a dog walks into the ship's door, desperately wanting to go but can't. This, and perhaps many other scenes, is what makes E.T. the classic that it is. Re-released in a new restored version, it only makes E.T. more a classic that it is. The film adds many great things to the already great piece, but thankfully doesn't take anything else, at least not those that made it good.<br/><br/>Being born in the 90's, the restored version of E.T. is the only way I this classic met my eyes back when I was a kid, even until now. But this ""new"" version is still quite the film critics and public alike described. Maybe because the film's restorations, unlike the restorations George Lucas did to his STAR WARS trilogy, the 'changes' done here weren't major. Things like adding a new CGI E.T. in a few scenes were Carlo Rambaldi's puppet didn't look pretty convincing or digitally removing guns since Steven Spielberg felt it to be too intense for his vision are very small alterations to a brilliant film. Other than that, the sound and picture quality is cleaned-up for good measure, making it as good-as-new. In that way, it does the film some justice and at the same time, giving it a little makeover.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's the story that still wins us over in this, or any other version. The power of E.T.'s adventure on earth with his friend Elliot (Henry Thomas) and his gang (not to mention Drew Barrymore's familiar performance as Elliot's charming sister Gertie). When the film was released at the Cannes Film Festival back then, it received a standing ovation. Or in simple screenings in the theater alone, E.T. has the power to grab our hearts and mellow it until our eyes shed a tear. Be it joy or sympathy, this is a movie with big emotions. We care about the characters and what happens to them. Is it no wonder those scenes in this film still has the power to grab the audience and let them go with tears and cheers. E.T. is still one of the finest piece of family entertainment, perhaps one of the best films ever made. Okay, that maybe an overstatement, but could you disagree? <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

The story talks about a alien who is stranded on earth, who then meets a young outcast, who he quickly befriends, and forms a special relationship with. I just have to say that a movie that can make cry, smile, cheer for joy, and rejoice all at the same time must be amazing ... especially when E.T. dies, and comes back to life. Also, the part where Elliot and E.T. go into the forest at night, and then they fly against the moon, is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. I mean, the part where they ride through, and then suddenly drop then fly away, gave me goosebumps the first time I saw it. And that scene will stay with me for the rest of my life. I just can't express my love for this film any other way: I love it so much, and it's just so beautiful. I can watch it over and over again, yet it keeps getting better. It's one of those films that just makes you wonder, and imagine. The direction is just so brilliant, and the story is so heartwarming and touching.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 10/10 ...

Then there are those I have recently revisited, sometimes for the first time since their initial release. Into this category falls 'E.T.'- The Extra-Terrestrial.' People might remember that 'E.T.' and 'Poltergeist' were released almost simultaneously back in '82. 'Poltergeist' I've watched probably twenty times since. 'E.T' I had seen... once. That probably tells you something. I was definitely not as enamored with the film as it seemed the rest of the earth's population was. I thought it was a cute flick, nothing more or less. So when I sat down to watch it again after twenty-six years, I wondered if my feelings would have changed. The first thing that struck me was how little I remembered about the film, the details anyway. But when it was all said and done, I would say my appraisal now is about what it was then... maybe a little higher. I think Spielberg's approach to films like this is one that you either embrace and enjoy almost giddily, or it kind of gets on your nerves. I must be in the latter group. I can certainly understand its appeal, particularly to kids, but not limited to them. Spielberg has a concept of the modern suburban family that he has explored many times, and speaking of 'Poltergeist', it shares many of those ideas and feelings with 'E.T.', right down to similar dialogue, humor, even the family dog. The kids can be naughty, but not juvenile delinquent naughty; they're just off in their own little worlds, they don't listen and the parents don't seem to mind much. Kids break a lamp? Parents just stand there smiling and shaking their heads- those darn kids, what WILL they do next? The families tend to be dysfunctional, but in such a happy, loving, caring kind of way, what kind of ogre would criticize them? There is a moment in the climax of 'Poltergeist' that is very telling; the parents are asked who punishes the kids, and neither one knows the answer. Obviously because they never do. Anyway, 'E.T.' presents the prototypical such family (no Dad present, but hey, no biggie) and you wonder how the Mom (Dee Wallace) not only keeps her cheery disposition but her sanity with this group of kids. When E.T. himself waddles onto the scene, Mom is so oblivious to her surroundings that she doesn't know he's there, even when he walks past her three or four times. Henry Thomas was a great choice to play the boy, Elliott, who finds and befriends E.T. The movie is really seen through his eyes as much as E.T.'s, and the idea of a symbiotic relationship developing between them is the great central idea of the film, just as the one great scene is the one where E.T.'s feelings, including getting tipsy, are transmitted to Elliott while he's in school. There are other good parts scattered here and there throughout the movie, notably the bits featuring a very young Drew Barrymore, who is the very epitome of 'cute.' (Interesting too, that she was the only one to have a successful film career afterward.) But then that's 'E.T.'s problem, or its salvation, depending on your point of view- it's just too damn cute."

","Good Movie, but... It is the but one doesn't expect from one of the ""greatest movies of all time"". The realisation of the concept was excellent and the camera work better still. I speak from only a limited experience and do not have a formal understanding of how it all works, but the way the scenes shifted and the placement of the cameras was quite outstanding. The emotions of Elliott was quite well drawn out, and the ET was made quite well considering the technology in the early 80s. But that's about it, the positives of the movie. The acting was very wooden, especially that of the ""scientists"" who came marching like zombies wearing astronaut suits! Now which scientist will you find walking like a zombie with hands outstretched? Even the realism of the entire thing was too stretched. How can a bunch of boys run off with a high security and priority experiment specimen and then escape full eight police squads on a bikes just like that? Further there are a lot many loopholes which left a lot to be explained. Like how did the ET come back to life, and why did it die in the first place? There were way too many things which just happened, without any logic. In my opinion, a decent movie, from which Koi Mil Gaya took inspiration (and ended up being a better movie!) but definitely does NOT make it to my best movies list. Perhaps again some time later, I might appreciate some more things about this one?!! Seriously overrated, i had more expectation of Spielberg."

","Steven Spielberg, you did it man. So far I had cried for three movie. Titanic, The Braveheart and now, E.T.<br/><br/>This is not a movie of alien invasion nor human-alien battle. It's a movie about friendship, family and love. E.T. is a stranded alien. Elliot along with his brother, sister and friends takes care of the E.T. Elliot took it, no, took him home and hid him in his room. E.T. learned to talk. E.T. loved everybody. E.T. was also funny and cute. But, they had to send him back home as E.T. wanted to leave for home. When E.T. died, I couldn't breath. After he came back alive, I felt so happy. Finally, E.T. before leaving home, tells Elliot, ""Come"". It was really heartbreaking. I really cried. I didn't want E.T. to leave.<br/><br/>Spielberg had really brought the emotions out of us. Kudos to you man. This movie is a complete magical delight. Watch this movie. Don't miss it. It will be impossible to find a person who doesn't like this movie.

","I can't help but be a little irritated at the people knocking this film. I can only assume they have no heart or imagination. It is a beautiful film that tells it's story almost perfectly. I am saddened that people don't feel there is room for such a beautiful film in today's world - it's a sad indictment on our cynical society. Someone said that there's no humour in the film - it's filled with humour. Another said that the special effect's aren't up to much. I watch the film and believe that there's a little alien stuck on earth - so they work pretty well. There are no pointless effects that are only there for the sake of it as in many modern films. Maybe the people who feel that this film is overrated should go and watch the Phantom Menace - a soulless piece of film/merchandising but with plenty of good special effects."
"kenjha","6","0","2","30 November 2007"," Stupid Alien Tricks
","Amazingly successful movie about a boy and his alien gets off to an OK start but becomes increasingly annoying, thanks to a stupid and overly sentimental script and Spielberg's manipulative yet amateurish direction. Even setting aside the alien story, the situations are so contrived that they insult the viewer's intelligence. ET seems to have been given random and contradictory features and powers. The federal authorities, who apparently don't say a word to each other, are basically like robots. The part where ET gets sick and the feds put on the astronaut suits is utterly ridiculous. Williams's score is memorable if overused to pull emotional strings."

","this is the first in a trilogy (three movies that are part of one story, usually with the second and third films sucking) where e.t. plays an alien which is not hard for him since he is an alien. his second role in aliens is somewhat different than e.t. because he had to train for many months at a killer monster camp on a moon of jupiter to get ready for the part. the third in the sequence is close encounters of the third kind with is partially a play on words since it is the third part of the trilogy and a close encounter of the third kind is when you see an alien and make direct contact with it. seeing a ufo is of the first kind and seeing an alien from a distance is the second kind. if you happen to make out with an alien you shouldn't tell anyone as no one has of yet so there really isn't a tier for you. e.t. is stranded on earth and he is an alien botanist. the plot is basically that his species had never heard of a pine tree and they came to see one. they had not a clue that the pine cones were sharp and could cut and they ran onto the ship. e.t. had inadvertently found a pear tree and was eating the delicious ""pine cones"" when his friends left him. i don't want to ruin anything so i won't let go of the rest of the story."

I had loved the movie from then and I still do.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has got to be the greatest director alive, and he is on my imaginary list of people I would be honored to shake hands with."
"matlefebvre20","10","0","1","26 April 2007"," ""Close Encounters"" with a heart
","""E.T."" is some kind of a new version of the movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". But the targeted audience isn't the same, the aliens that are shown are different and director Steven Spielberg put much more accent on emotion and feelings in ""E.T."" for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>Since it was released 25 years ago, ""E.T."" is still considered as a classic children's film, but it's not necessary to include the ""children's"" note, because ""classic film"" is well enough to describe this incredible movie.<br/><br/>The story and the characters quickly became popular, even for those who haven't seen the movie yet. It's because ""E.T."" quickly entered into popular culture and it must be believed that it's not about to get out of it soon.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is also known as the quintessential children's (or family) film, because it contains every item that the genre could possibly offer and it's shown in an immaculate way.<br/><br/>First, we see the heroic children, resourceful and very intelligent. There is the main character and best friend of E.T. the extra-terrestrial, Elliott (an astounding performance from young Henry Thomas). At the beginning of his adventure, we see Elliott as a not-so-brave boy, often lost in his own world. Eventually, he will take his courage with both hands when he discovers that there is an alien in his backyard.<br/><br/>There's also Elliott's younger sister Gertie (cute little Drew Barrymore) and his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and let's not forget the other kids.<br/><br/>The adults are typically shown as fearsome opponents or as goofy characters. So we can see scientists who want to get the hand on the poor extra-terrestrial and we suspect since the movie's very first scenes (where they chase E.T.'s spaceship) that they're the bad guys of the story. It creates some kind of contrast with ""Close Encounters"", where the viewer expresses resentment, but also sympathy towards the scientists.<br/><br/>Elliott's single mother Mary (Dee Wallace) is an idiot character however, in the sense where she seems to be totally devoid of reason, at which point she becomes unbearable. I really expected her to be far better than she is actually.<br/><br/>In order to succeed with his movie, Spielberg efficiently topples over the sentimental and the special effects. And he never, under any circumstance, miss.<br/><br/>In the case of the special effects, it's not a surprise, because it's Spielberg. But remember that the year is 1982 at this moment. The question that must be asked is not ""Will he use them?"", but ""How will he use them?"". Spielberg's answer is remarkable. We can see him playing with flowers in their pot, but no-one could forget the incredible bicycle flight. This scene hasn't aged a bit and it still surprises.<br/><br/>But the most spectacular element of the movie is not the artificial created by Industrial, Light & Magic, but by the feelings expressed by the characters, especially the kids. Spielberg wisely decided to shoot every scene in chronological order, so the emotional response from the children would be more natural. In this way, we can really see the links that are created between Elliott and E.T., reaching a very high level during E.T.'s ""death"" and ""resurrection"" in the two-thirds of the movie.<br/><br/>But nothing could beat the unforgettable scenes at the very end when E.T. must go back to his far away planet. The young Gertie is touching and Michael, even if he's a teenager, shows in a clear and irrevocable way that he also owns feelings for the alien. And how could we forget the legendary good-bye hug between Elliott and E.T.? I'm not an emotional kind of guy, but I've almost cried while watching these pictures. This scene could easily make the stone hearts melt in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is the crossover between the young Spielberg and the more mature Spielberg. The director has fun with the special effects like he did with the other movies that he previously released at the time, that is ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but he also shows that he still has his child's heart within himself and he transmits it very well. The emotions experienced by the characters are signs that the director begins to grow up and these are hints that lead to masterpieces like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>Of all the numerous Spielberg-made classics, ""E.T."" largely owns its place on the podium. According to me, it's the third greatest Spielberg movie, ""Close Encounters"" being in second place and ""Schindler's List"" coming on the top. But I perfectly understand why Spielberg himself declares that ""E.T."" is his personal favorite. Among all of his other movies, none of them has captured the beauty of childhood in such an eloquent way.<br/><br/>""E.T."" is universal entertainment. The kids will appreciate the characters and the visual effects which will definitely impress them. Grown-ups will love the movie for the same reasons, but something else could be added up. It's that kind of nostalgia that comes from the film. Some kind of envy for the past. Because ""E.T."" is a fable that demonstrates the importance of childhood and it shows that the greatest souvenirs from a lifetime always come from that period."

","The first time I ever watched this film was at the age of 5, on a dark and stormy night having just got back from Wales. My dad first introduced me to film with the words, ""Son, I have a film for you to watch. It is a film about a man from outer space!"" And since then, E.T. has been stuck in my head, for all the wrong reasons! The first time Elliot sees E.T. in the Cornfield was a scene that would become my worst nightmare for 10 years. The matter wasn't helped when British Telecommications used it as their advertising slogan several years ago. However, since Christmas 2006, when it was last broadcast here in the UK, I have been in awe of this film! I see now that it was a beautifully made story of love, compassion, friendship (and deeper meanings such as racial equality and biblical references), and not a horror film which, to my mind, would surpass the Alien movies. The acting is very good for a kids film (which I usually look upon with utter distaste), and certainly, I don't think there has been a decent film about ""good"" Aliens since (apart from maybe the rather overlooked ""Cocoon""). I have heard of people who believe that you have to be an child to like this film and that it is completely overrated. I say ""Bollocks!"" True you need a certain amount of imagination to look at this film and understand its subliminal meanings and its homage to childhood nostalgia, but the way I see it, to look at this film with such prejudice, distasteful comments is to deny the bliss of a typical childhood altogether. You do not even have to be philosophical to enjoy this film either. Its comic values are high, especially with the inventions of colourful insults such as ""Penis breath"", which some of my friends still use today, the score is one of William's finest, and the general use of ""Mis-en-scene"" is inventive and highly affective. I honestly don't see what people have against the 2002 edition, because Spielberg only wanted to make E.T.'s expressions more real, and to try and tackle the issue of a post 9/11 World. But I can seriously say that since that night 10 years ago, I really have been turned for the better. Basically completely flawless - 10/10.<br/><br/>P.S.

Of course, he wants to ""phone home"" so he can go back.<br/><br/>E.T. shows the classic emotion of love, loss and separation. While this is all very good, it seems like it only fulfills half of what I expected.<br/><br/>It starts off when an alien ship lands on Earth, and leaves a passenger behind. This alien is found by Elliot, a young boy. They form a bond, and become unusually connected.<br/><br/>""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" shows the classic emotions of love, friendship and the heart-shattering death and separation. Sound a bit complex for a family film, doesn't it? Well, it's really not all that. The emotions seem to be simplified, without enough depth to affect the viewer. To me, it felt as if they were merely introduced.<br/><br/>The story seems predictable. I think it's been told before with dogs. (I believe it happened in White Fang.) The only real difference between the dog stories and E.T. is that E.T. is on a much bigger scale. I mean, you've never seen dogs build such machines, have you? Yet, E.T. still seems to never fulfill what it seems to have promised. As I said before, the emotions aren't deep enough to let the viewer feel sorry or touched by the characters. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The ending doesn't seem to be any surprise too. Films don't need surprise endings, but the ending in E.T. seems not at all emotional. The only thing that really helps the ending is a build-up of music. (END OF SPOILERS) One thing that made this film a disappointment washype. Yes, you've heard that word before, haven't you? I know that everybody thinks it isn't a good reason to dislike films, but many people are let down by a movie because of it. Let me explain -It was number 108 in Haiwell's top 1000 movies list.<br/><br/>-It got **** out of **** by a critic who gave seemingly lower scores to Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Joy Luck Club and Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>-It got 94 out of 100 on metacritic.com, which is enough to get it into the top 10. (I don't know why it isn't there.) - It was somewhere in ""Four Star Movies: The best 101 Movies Ever Made"" and around the 80's if I remember correctly.<br/><br/>It's pretty hard for a film to live up to all that.<br/><br/>The final flaw is that E.T. seems so short! I believe it's around one hour and 55 minutes long, but it seems only like 80 minutes. Of course, children don't want to watch a movie with the length of films such as ""The Godfather"" (even though adults will appreciate them) but the film never left me satisfied with a feeling of accomplishment.<br/><br/>Overall, E.T. was a huge disappointment. It has emotion, but it doesn't appear to have enough of anything to make the emotion work. The ""touching"" moments look almost too predictable, short and shallow to work. I know lots and lots of people will disagree with me, and I'm almost prepared to accept that.<br/><br/>Note: ""The viewer"" is referring to me.<br/><br/>Good: Well, it will be emotional for some.<br/><br/>Bad: The emotions don't seem to be very emotional. The film seems to have a very short running time. (Even though the box says that it goes on for over 100 minutes.)

","E.T. is a world-famous movie, no one has not heard of this movie. I thought the reason that Elliott and E.T. became friends easily is because Elliott had the same feelings as E.T.At first, Elliott was not a happy, talkative and self-confident child.He was too young for his brother, his father did not live with him and his mother was always busy. Similarly, E.T. was alone on Earth without friends. He did not know anything about humans and he did not speak their language. He was frightened and lone. <br/><br/>I thought that the most impressive part was the friendship between a human boy and an alien. They belonged to different planets, they spoke different language, but they had the same feeling. Elliott could feel what E.T. felt. Although they had many difficulties: Elliott's mum wanted to separate them and the police wanted to catch them. They overcome those difficulties one by one. Elliott also tried his best to help his best friend. He gave food to E.T., helped E.T.to make a transmitter and helped him to his planet.<br/><br/>They told us that friendship is important and we must treasure it."

","It took me a number of years to finally appreciate the brilliance of E.T. I saw it originally around the time of its 5th anniversary and, as a seven year old found it rather dull. I didn't return to the movie for more than a dozen years and, in the mean time, I had grown and developed a taste for more subtle film-making. Though subtle may not be synonymous with Steven Spielberg, I do believe that the adjective is appropriate for E.T. Yes, there's the requisite chase at the end and the suspense engendered by the adult characters, but, on the whole, this movie is a subtle exploration of family and how it works in today's society.<br/><br/>A lot of people hate Steven Spielberg, think of him as a hack who doesn't deserve his notoriety. Looking at E.T. again, I wonder how they can say this. E.T. is a fantastic movie that is fun for kids and also teaches them a lesson about acceptance and love that in the hands of a lesser-filmmaker would have been heavy-handed and trite. Spielberg knows that there's a lesson buried within his movie - a lesson to accept others as they are regardless of their differences - but he does not press this upon us.<br/><br/>That is why, for me, E.T. will always be his defining picture. Within it are the adventure elements that characterize his brilliant first-phase and the social consciousness that appears in his later work. However, the social consciousness, as it does in The Terminal and to an extent Schindler's List, does not overpower the story and beat us over the head. For me, that subtle treatment of a very ""adult"" theme in an otherwise science fiction movie proves Spielberg's brilliance regardless of the naysayers' opinions."

The time was right for a sci-fi fantasy for kids that would also draw great crowds of ""grown-up kids"" to the theaters. The Disney Production was the very first to require a PG-Rating, quite a departure for the previously 100% family-oriented (and G-Rated) Disney Studios. Aside from a few mildly violent scenes and ""no-no-vocabulary"", there was nothing to keep even the youngest of viewers away from this cinematic delight.<br/><br/>The story of a boy who first hides, then protects ""E.T."", an adorable 3 ft. tall alien from outer space who was left on Planet Earth by accident, is a feast of laughs and touching moments, throughout the nearly 2 hours of running time. Your eyes will be misty by the time everything is worked out in the end. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg pioneered the inclusion of ""sponsor messages"" in video versions of films, enabling him to drop the excessive purchase price (up to this time around $100.00 per VHS tape!) to an affordable level ($29.95).

","Sad, happy, funny, whatever.<br/><br/>I saw this film when I was like five and I liked it than I saw it when it came to theaters I was like 11 than I just saw it like two mounts ago. This film is such a classic and that's because of the grate story, the terrific performances and the memorable special effects! Although this is a film about an extra terrestrial, I think it's also about people, all living things and what we do to them. Several scenes illustrate this like the frog scene and the paramedic scene. One very memorable part in my mind is when the government walks over the hill that has always given me the creeps.<br/><br/>PLOT; when an extra terrestrial is left behind he must struggle to survive.<br/><br/>He meats a boy and slowly becomes more attached to him. But not just Elliot and his sister know about this alien, yes there are others watching!<br/><br/>I think this film can be seen by annoy age and appreciated, some scenes may be too intense for little children. I would rate this film 7half/10"

","I put this on sometimes. Usually on Sundays when the weather is depressing or something happened or I want some Innocence to erase whatever gross display of hedonism I witnessed on Friday and Saturday. It's good for that. It's not a great work of art or anything but then it wasn't meant to be. Intellectuals born in 1947 won't like it. Douchy know-it-alls who think they're so cool won't either. Those who once wanted a Mogwai or called themselves a Goonie Will. However Spielberg has really lost it. I can't believe he took the guns out of the movie! The heartless bastard.... (He also asked Drew Barrymore to keep her clothes on back when she was in her nekkid phase.) There had better be an option on the DVD. South Park did an excellent episode where they totally called him on it."

I think that the sci fi thing was great I know it was. and this isn't thge good time to talk about the actors but Henry Thomas was great in it. I think flower films produced this or did it?????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Well this movie was great I would give it an 10.10 I think that Drew is Cool too in this movie that is why I like it.<br/><br/>Stay Cool Major Payne........."

","This childish view of alien relations not only denounces science as the faith of mankind, but it makes the alien creature a martyr symbol, impervious to the inklings of failure that most men have to endure.  Almost as bad as the NBC sit-com drama ""ALF"", which attempted to make fun of a furry stuffed rodent from some other planet.  If you find this repulsive, then may I suggest that the alien was probably carrying some type of disease with him and the director makes it seem like its a great thing to have a dirty creature from the Planet zero in your house.  All around boredom and yawn sequences are found throughout.  Only see this for the special effects which are worn and outdated."

","SPOILERS Why is it that this film takes a ridiculously long to get into, and yet by the end, you find yourself swearing your head off at those b***ard scientists and wishing that they'd all go and jump off a cliff? This film is depressingly good. E.T. is almost exactly the same age as me & looking at it now, Drew Barrymore might look a bit young (obviously by Charlies Angels 1 & 2 she's gorgeous), but the film is scarily entertaining. Compared with some films, ET might not be as good as some slightly less dated films, yet when either drunk or stoned, this film is entertaining. Surely this is the point. Watch ET (as if you haven't already!) & enjoy it, just remember that compared with a few modern films, there are better. This film is an original, but that doesn't make it good."

","Spielberg's five best films are: Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws, and a coin flip between Close Encounters of the Third Kind & Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. E.T. is not his masterpiece.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>his over-the-top skills as a filmmaker were cemented here with his painstaking attention to detail and his fantastic, almost child-like sense of discovery. For all the complaints about its bizarre subject matter (I still can?t explain the ?invasion? of the house by freaky-looking NASA agents) the film at its core has a remarkably simple message about communication, friendship, and love. Besides, you know the little brown guy is all right when he makes an important discovery in the fridge ? potato salad bad, beer good."

"SinjinSB","8","0","1","8 November 2002"," A fun, emotional family movie
","Spielberg brought us a fun, emotional family movie about kids who find an alien that was accidently left behind. Though much of what happens is pretty unbelievable, for some reason it seems we are willing to accept it for the sake of the movie. There's a good 80s cast of kids and adults, including Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton (with his cool Space Invaders shirt), C. Thomas Howell, Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote...and a young Erika Eleniak, of Baywatch & Playboy fame, as the girl that Elliott kisses in the classroom. There is a good theme of acceptance. Unlike most other movies with aliens, everyone welcomes E.T., even the adults. I hadn't seen the movie in well over a decade, and I was pleasantly surprised that I still enjoyed it as much as I did back in the 80s. With it now being released on DVD, I'm glad it will bring E.T. to a whole new generation of kids<br/><br/>*** (Out of 4)"

","I am sitting by a computer at this exact time trying to figure out what words to put into this review on ""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"".This film is definitely a treasure to behold and a wonderful imaginative masterpiece from Steven Spielberg.Spielberg seems to guide the audience through a magical journey dealing with lonliness and friendship that rightfully makes this one of the greatest motion pictures that I have ever seen.Alot of what comes from this film is what we imagined and went through as a kid.""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"" was released on June 11,1982 when I was ten years old.It was a time when I spent my days fantasizing about the films of ""Star Wars"" which also had a huge impact on me.Watching this film,I found that this film never gets tiring.It never loses its charm.Technicly,storywise and characterwise,director Steven Spielberg's film is such a great film that I think it's also one of the most important.The film won four Academy Awards.But not one of those categories were in the major categories.When ""Ghandhi"" beat ""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"" for Best Picture,that had to be one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history.While ""Ghandhi"" was a three hour plus film that dealt with the power of one man,""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"" was a film that asked us to enjoy ourselves and have a good time while we watch the film.The visual effects,which won the Academy Award,was impressive and still is today.But I have to admit that the award should have gone to ""Blade Runner"" because of it's amazing futuristic images.Nevertheless,the effects are a sight to stare and adds more imagination to the viewer.""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"" came into our lives 20 years ago.For that amount of time,moviegoers were treated with a rare classic that stands the test of time.""E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial"" is a film that I hail as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest and will never lose its place in cinematic history."

","Too bad a few of you have given this film a ""sickly sweet"" review.  E.T. is a classic, the ""Wizard of Oz of my generation.  Maybe it is a bit ""sentimental,"" but there's nothing wrong with that.  Here are a few more ""sentimental"" films which have (or should) become popular classics:  ""Mary Poppins;""  ""Peter Pan"" (the Mary Martin TV version);  ""The World of Henry Orient;  ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""   Even the original ""Planet of the Apes"" has moments of sentimentality.  To quote a certain LITTLE MISS SHOWBIZ:  ""Don't be a Grumpy Wumpy.""  In my own words: you sad, cynical SOBs should look inside and find the inner child--and the inner E.T.

"hb_ver","Null","0","1","21 October 2002"," A sweet story of friendship and faith!
","Steven Spielberg has created a fairy tale for the 80s as a little boy<br/><br/>Elliot befriends a lovable alien creature from outer space in one of<br/><br/>the most loved movies ever made.  Spielberg carefully recreates<br/><br/>what could be any boy's childhood fantasies and carefully weaves<br/><br/>them into a story about family in the suburbs trying to hold on<br/><br/>together after their dad leaves their mother and heads towards<br/><br/>Mexico.  Dee Wallace is perfect as the depressed and yet loving<br/><br/>mother of three, a teen, a little boy (Elliot) played memorably by<br/><br/>Henry Thomas, and a little girl (a never more appealing Drew<br/><br/>Barrymore).  E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial) is left stranded on earth<br/><br/>after his spaceship leaves him behind and he becomes a survivor<br/><br/>with the help of Elliot, whom begins to literally feel all of the alien's<br/><br/>emotions.  Problem comes when government agents are on the<br/><br/>hot trail to capture E.T. and Elliot and his friends must help get E.T.<br/><br/>back to his home planet.  Undeniably one of the best movies of the<br/><br/>80s with movie magic to spare.  Spielberg's ""feel good"" happy<br/><br/>ending and idealized happy family after broken bonds is evident<br/><br/>here.  Witness the powerfully told story of love, friendship, family,<br/><br/>and ultimate sacrifice.  An originally comic and heart-warming<br/><br/>movie for all ages!  10/10"

","As if it wasn't bad enough that Lucas ruined the Star Wars films, now Spielberg is hacking up the classic E.T. It's sad when great filmmakers become pathetic spas' in their old age. Replacing guns with walkie talkies? That is just gay. And cutting out the line about dressing up as a terrorist for Halloween. C'mon, bad people do bad things in this world. Get over it already! I shudder to think of a special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. They'll probably animate it so that the swordsman pulls out a gun and shoots before Indy shoots him."

","I know this is apt to be a minority opinion, and I hope this doesn't hurt the feelings of the trillion or so people who really love this movie, but I didn't really care for it.  I saw it at the end of the summer of 1982 after hearing for several weeks that it was the greatest movie ever made in the history of the universe.  I thought it was a nice movie, very pleasant, very charming, and very well-crafted.  Mr. Spielberg definitely knows what he's doing when it comes to putting a movie together.  But is the greatest film ever made, or even a great film period?  I'm sincerely sorry, but I honestly don't think so.<br/><br/>""Didn't live up to the hype"" is how I thought of it at them time.  Still, I can think of many worse ways to pass a sweltering summer afternoon."

","With all the hoopla & rumours about this edition, my wife & I<br/><br/>decided to see it the first day it came out, in Rockland County, NY,<br/><br/>at the 5 p.m. showing.   I've seen this movie everytime it came out<br/><br/>in the theater, and maybe 6 times when it came out on video<br/><br/>awhile ago and besides E.T. and a bathtub scene, I don't see what<br/><br/>all the hype is about.  The sound stunk, which is due to a lousy job<br/><br/>by the theater crew at Loew's Cinemas and it stunk because a<br/><br/>father kept talking to his kids, other than that, the sound was o.k. The ""bad"" ""evil"" words that were in E.T. are still in E.T., like ""Penis<br/><br/>Breath"", and ""Douche Bag"" are still in the movie.   In the original<br/><br/>edition, I didn't notice the guns too much, so the walkie talkies<br/><br/>weren't too much of a change for me.

"Aeris4ever","Null","0","1","13 March 2002"," Think hard about your children before taking them to E.T.
","And I really mean that.  Like wicket, who posted a comment earlier, I was terrified during the entire death sequence of ""E.T.""  So terrified that my dad had to take me out of the theater.  I was 5 back then, my first movie theater experience; definitely not a good one.  If you have sensitive children who are afraid of monsters or intense E.R.-type action, complete with defibrillators and scary men in spacesuits, spare them the agony and leave them at home.  E.T. is barely cute to begin with.  When he's white, half dead and screaming on the bathroom floor, he's absolutely horrifying. And all the while, he's sucking the life out of Elliot, making him seem even more evil.  It's a shame that a movie with such a good beginning and ending had to be tainted with intense scenes that could ruin the entire experience for some children.  I've already been scarred by this movie, so I know I won't see its re-release.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 8, but it really depends on the child.  ""E.T."" is not family-friendly, in my opinion."
