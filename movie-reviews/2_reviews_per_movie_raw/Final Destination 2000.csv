","Final Destination, or Flight 180' as it was titled right up until the last minute, was a surprise hit of 2000.  It was made with a modest budget of $23m it grossed a nice sum of $53m in the US.  It was in the UK, however, where the film really shone, up against the massive epic Gladiator at the time the movie managed to gross a none too bad £11m but what made it better was it was a true sleeper hit, it spent 14 weeks in the UK film charts. With no big name actors, and no major publicity the film did so well because of word of mouth and the word was it was damn good.<br/><br/>I admit I was sceptical at first in reading about Final Destination.  It seemed like a tired teen horror movie that seemed to be spewing out of America at that time, indeed it was only until about 3 weeks in to it being released that I actually lifted my bum off my sofa and put my bum on the seat in front of the big screen to actually watch the movie.  I loved it, and it was made better by the low expectations I had of it.  It isn't groundbreaking but it is effectively chilly at times, the acting is surprisingly good and the plot is pretty fresh.<br/><br/>James Wong (X Files) came up with the idea of the movie, about cheating death, and it does seem to have a kind of X Files ring to it.  The story goes as follows.  Alex (Devon Sawa) is off, with his classmates, to France. Now being in America France is like our version ofAmerica, so it's a pretty big deal.  While on the plane he has a premonition of the plane exploding, slightly scared, he wakes up and finds that some of his premonition turns out real.  Scared for his life, and the others on the plane, he cause a fuss which sees him and several other classmates chucked off the plane.  Some of his companions are none too pleaseduntil they see Flight 180 blow up, killing everyone on the plane.<br/><br/>Thus begins the cat and mouse chase by Death himself.  One by one, in seemingly accidental' ways, the survivors of the ill-fated crash are dying. While others dismiss the idea of Death coming for revenge, Alex isn't going to let it go and soon he convinces friend Clear (Ali Larter) that it is up to them to try and stop Death himself.<br/><br/>As this happens we can witness some of the most imaginative death scenes ever.  Thanks to the movie not having a masked killer doing the rounds the death scenes are not limited to the knife in back/stomach/head/eye' routine.  Indeed, the first death scene is both funny and horrific all in one because, like with many of the deaths in this movie, it can really seem as that can actually happen.  It gives you something to think about.<br/><br/>The special effects, for a movie with as small as budget as this, are excellent (apparently they did actually spend half of their budget in the SFX).  The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see, its worrying to watch.<br/><br/>For a movie aimed at the teenager end of the market, and for a genre renowned for hammy acting, the people in this movie actually do a good job.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa, no stranger to movies, is perfect at playing the lead role of the troubled Alex.  Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) does a major turnaround from what you are used to seeing him as, this time he's the typical school jock, flash car, blonde girlfriend, bad temper, but luckily he doesn't play it into overkill.  Another nice surprise is Sean William Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Too many teen movies), while we are used to seeing him as the guy who cracks jokes and makes fun of the others, he plays the geeky guy this time, and he provides us with quite a bit of comic relief.  We also have a nice cameo of Tony Todd (aka the Candyman) as Bludworth, who plays the man at the morgue, he is suitably chilling, and is set to play a larger part in the sequel.<br/><br/>Suspense wise this film doesn't fail either.  In many films like this you are guessing who will be killed next.  Not so in this movie.  You are actually told who is going to meet Death next.  However this doesn't spoil it.  Suspense is carried over by how the person will die.  If you know a person is going to die as soon as the camera pans of them, and their all alone, then your waiting in anticipation for them to die, but there are many false scares along the way.  Also the suspense is kept up throughout the movie, it doesn't seem to drag too much at any time.<br/><br/>There are very few bad points to the movie.  Obviously it will depend on your taste whether you like it or not, whether you consider it too teeny' or too teeny but just right anyway.  This film does have fun as well as generate scares.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that there is an alternate ending to the movie and quite a few deleted scenes, namely a main subplot where Clear becomes pregnant. I think that it was wise to omit these parts, the ending seemed cheesy, but the one we are left with is excellent.<br/><br/>Final Destination, thanks to an imaginative story, nice acting and some elaborate death scenes breathes new life into the tired genre of teen horror.  It is not as widely recognized as the Scream trilogy, but in many respects it's better. Lets hope the sequel maintains the high standard it has set.<br/><br/>FINAL DESTINATION IS<br/><br/>Different  Nicely acted   Filled with imaginative deaths<br/><br/>FINAL DESTINATION IS NOT<br/><br/>Low on suspense  A typical teen horror   Going to be shown as in-flight entertainment"
"MissCzarChasm","10","105","141","26 March 2000"," Finally a horror film worth a lot of Praise!
","Final Destination has made my list as one of the best horror films in the wake of the teen/slasher revival. in fact it's the most original horror film since the original Scream and it may be better than Scream. There have been many cheap imitations(Urban Legend, i still know what you did last summer, etc) but this one is a keeper.<br/><br/>The film begins with the most exhillerating 15 minutes in recent memory(and if you're afraid of flying be prepared to be shocked). Alex browning(Devon Sawa) is getting ready to leave on a class trip to France. while on the plane he has a vision that the plan is going to explode. Later he awakes from this vison and immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and sure enough moments after the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.<br/><br/>The one thing i thought was trully good about this film was whenever ""Death"" came after the remaining students that got off the plane it wasn't some grim reaper type guy you could see. whenever death was around it was very subtle. shadows, wind, etc. death never showed his ugly head. he used everyday thingst o kill his victims. in fact it was stuff that you could accidentally do in your home and that is what makes this film scary.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Devon Sawa proves that he can carry a film. he has great talent. Ali Larter is a terrific actress who is well on her way to becoming the best actress ofher generation, but Kerr smith of dawson's Creek shines here. he was really good and i hope to see him in more films.<br/><br/>Great film worth every dollar i spent to see it. 10"

","Inventive, effectively eerie spine-chiller is a step up in the teen horror genre. High schooler Sawa has a horrific vision of his plane crashing just moments before its departure on a class field trip. He and several others exit the plane only to discover that it does in fact crash, but things take a shocking turn when the remaining survivors begin to die in the most mysterious ways. Story is intriguing, the suspense flows well throughout, and there are enough violent deaths to satisfy the target audience. The ending is a bit of a disappointment and should have been planned out better, but overall this is one of the better films of the genre. ***"
"a_jester66","8","11","12","26 March 2000"," Creepy and Real
","This movie was frightening for one simple reason, it isn't afraid to go the route of talking about death, fate and if the inevitable is really unavoidable or if deaths plan can be fathomed and subsequently outwitted. The opening scene is downright scary, come on who hasn't got on a plane and wondered if it would crash, and let me tell you I am not in a hurry to get on one now.  Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.  Trust me on this one and give it a shot."

","FINAL DESTINATION / (2000) ***<br/><br/>
Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad E. Donella, Amanda Detmer, and Kristen Cloke. Directed by James Wong. Written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and James Wong. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated R (for terror violence and language).<br/><br/>
	I think it is safe to say every individual has different feelings about death. Some fear it. Others deny it. Most are weary in some way regarding decease. ""Final Destination"" is a perfect thriller for skeptics, detailing seven confused individuals who accidentally escape demise, discovering the impossibility of defrauding their destined time. The film's atmosphere provokes cringe through a presumably omnipresent force stalking the characters, producing audience participation whether the Grim Reaper is footsteps away from us all. <br/><br/>	Devon Sawa (""Idle Hands,"" ""Wild America"") is a high school senior named Alex Browning. He and his French class are at an airport flying to Paris for a field trip with their teacher, Ms. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Once on the plane Alex begins to experience a dream-like vision of the jet exploding in midair killing all of its passengers. As the plane is about to descend, Alex notices his illusion gradually comes to life. This leaves him no choice but to cause a small riot leaving him and six other passengers thrown off the flight. <br/><br/>Students Carter (Kerr Smith), the ignorant jerk and girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), Alex's best friend, Tod (Chad E. Donella), other peers Billy (Seann William Scott), Clear (Ali Larter), Ms. Lewton and Alex watch from the airport as their late flight bursts into flames within minutes after takeoff-leaving these characters suspiciously confused about fate.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time depicting its setup. The rushed opening leads to lack of character development. Whereas the character's personalities are clear, we feel little remorse for many of them. The dramatic premise is horrific and revealing, playing like an extended ""The X Files"" episode without paranormal detectives. ""Final Destination"" is creative and full of variety; we witness the plane crash from two different perspectives, as a passenger and an observer. <br/><br/>Days after the crash, the survivors begin to die in unusual manners-almost as if a curse of death was placed on them for cheating demise. Alex digs deeper and discovers his companions are being killed by strange coincidences in the order they would have died from the explosion on the flight. In desperation, he attempts to contradict death for everyone remaining while under superstition of two disillusioned law enforcers.<br/><br/>
There are a few overlooked characters in ""Final Destination,"" mostly adults who seem to have an IQ score in the mid-nineties. The teenager's parents are left out most of the story. There is also a briefly creepy appearance by a mortician but is short-circuited by the plot. He is one of the many characters who end up explaining a lot of the plot to us.<br/><br/>	Most recent teen horror romps feature a madman chasing characters with sharp objects. ""Final Destination"" is too smart to fall in that cliché, however. It has a punctual reason for inhabiting teens: these are young people full of energy and life, all the more reason for them to fight death.<br/><br/>
The film, written by Jeffrey Reddick, Glen Morgan and director James Wong, never explains why the Alex character has visions of upcoming disasters. The idea makes for an intriguing story, but there are no interesting subplots or side characters here. Therefore without being backed up by supporting stories the filmmakers must thoroughly justify the character's reason for being. Wong seems to overlook Alex's illusions, a concept holding the entire movie together. <br/><br/>	Although ""Final Destination"" provides many edge-of-your-seat surprises and tension, the film likes to poke fun at many of its scenes. Like the average teenage thriller, the movie takes itself seriously about three quarters of the time-leaving the last quarter as comic relief. Certainly having nothing against comedic sequences in horror flicks, I just prefer a movie true to its genre. Even though ""Final Destination"" is nowhere near perfect, it is the truest film to the teen slasher gender along time.<br/><br/>
""Final Destination"" is brought to you by New Line Cinema."
"purplepink15","10","26","33","20 March 2000"," I loved this movie!!!
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!! It was so scary and entertaining, and the acting was really good.  The guys were really cute too!  I even jumped out of my seat at one point and I've never done that before in my life!! Go see this movie!!!!"
"Barky44","8","29","38","5 June 2005"," Quite good for a teen slasher flick
","I really liked this movie. It's probably one of the better teen slasher flicks to ever hit the screen.<br/><br/>Let's face it: teen slasher flicks are not outstanding cinema. The writing is always lame, the plots are even lamer, they're usually vehicles for the latest trends in fashion and music and showcases of the heartthrob and/or bombshell-of-the-month. They're really just vehicles for post-pubescent hormonal stimulation.<br/><br/>But ""Final Destination"" is different. First, it has real imagination going for it. The plot is unlike your typical ""madman in the corn chases teenage bombshell through puddles,"" it actually took some thought to put this together. It's not just shock-factor movie-making, they actually sat down and outlines how all the deaths would work in a way that keeps the plot alive. A tale of kids trying to cheat death's design is much harder to write than a dude with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>Then there's the death scenes themselves. Outstanding! I love a clever death scene in movies like this ... it's why you pay the $8! And these are some doozies. You can tell the filmmakers sat around for hours simply trying to find the coolest way to kill people. And if you have a sick mind (like yours truly), you'll find these death scenes simply hysterical! A really good movie. 8 out of 10. I'm giving it a high score because it's outstanding within it's genre.<br/><br/>Barky"

","I have to admit that when I first saw the previews for Final Destination, I didn't think much.  But after reading several reviews that said how good it was, I thought about seeing it, but couldn't because of a busy year. <br/><br/>
The story is about a kid named Alex(Devon Sawa) who just so happens to have a fear of flying.  With a class of 49 students, they are going to France on a field trip.  When Alex has a horrific premonition about dying in plane crash, he freaks out and is kicked off the plane with five other students and teacher.  Minutes after getting kicked off, and Alex is calm, the unexpected happens, the plane actually does explode.  <br/><br/>Over the next few weeks, however, teachers, the survivors, as well as the police become increasingly suspicious of Alex.  Some of his friends even think of him as a god.  Anyway, the survivors of the plane crash soon begin dying in gruesome and sometimes horrific fashions.  Alex soon discovers that by getting off the ill-fated flight, that he had intervened with Death's predetermined pattern.  Death, however, has made a new pattern and Alex must find out what it is to save his friends as well as himself. <br/><br/>
I have to say that this movie scared me and my parents good.  I also must say that this film deserves a lot praise.  Although the plot is not original, however the antagonist is, Death itself.  What I really liked about it was that Death never showed itself and that it turned simple everyday items into murder weapons.<br/><br/>Of course no horror movie is perfect.  There is one beef I do have with Final Destination.  Some of the death scenes are pretty creative and terrifying, but some of them seemed to have been forced.  I mean who is going to place a beverage on top of a computer monitor?<br/><br/>Other than this one minor flaw, Final Destination is still a great and scary horror film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"sethfan","8","5","5","22 March 2000"," Fasten your seat belts!
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that genuinely kept me on the edge of my seat.  Final Destination is a true roller coaster ride.  It is not your ""typical teen-age horror flick.""  This one is original with cleverly crafted and blocked death sequences.  I promise you...you _will_ jump!  And of course it has Devon Sawa who is a charming and talented actor (check him out in Idle Hands for a great performance).  Don't read too many reviews that might accidentally give something away!  In fact stop reading this now and just go see this great movie...and be ready for the ride of your life!"
"movieguy1021","8","34","49","18 December 2003"," Final Destination: 8/10
","When you go to watch a movie like Final Destination, which is obviously a teen horror movie, you take your chances. You could get something genuinely creepy yet tongue-in-cheek, like Scream, or you could wind up seeing something like Darkness Falls or They. You just never know. When Final Destination came up on my Netflix list, I didn't know what to expect. Would it be something original and scary, or just some lame dud? Thankfully, it turned out to be the former.<br/><br/>Alex (Devon Sawa), along with about 40 others, are all set to take off on a plane destined for their senior trip in France. Right before it is set to take off, however, he has a premonition that shows him that soon after takeoff the plane will crash and everyone on board will be dead. He and others are forced off of the plane, and, sure enough, the plane crashes with everyone else on board. While everyone thinks that Alex caused the accident, he knows that they were supposed to die on board. Soon, everyone who was supposed to be on the plane start dying one by one.<br/><br/>Knowing that this was written and directed by the same team who did Willard, I knew that a lot of the movie wouldn't be just needless blood, but that there would be some sort of a creepy atmosphere to it all. And, by gum, there was. Although it wasn't as atmospheric as the aforementioned movie, and it relied a lot on sudden violence, it was still creepy. It seems like horror movies today rely on quick jumps to scare the audience. Final Destination sure had some, but also the music and the general movie itself was thrilling. When you could see that something was going to happen, you wanted to yell at the character to not do so-and-so. Then you sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Something else that surprised me was how many special effects were needed. That was one major drawback. At times, the special effects didn't look real AT ALL (re: the bathroom scene), or there were too many when less is more (re: the final, climactic storm). One other thing that upset me was the constant need to do odd lighting. Because of the off-again, on-again lighting, it's sometimes impossible to tell what's happening. In Final Destination's pursuit to become something ultra-modern, nifty camera movements are tried, but for the unnecessary reasons. For example, a long, overhead tracking shot is used when two people are going to the bathroom. Very unnecessary, if you ask me. I just realized how much Glen Morgan and James Wong are fascinated with people going to the bathroom. There must be a few scenes of that in Final Destination, and one quite humorous one in Willard<br/><br/>I also thought that the movie took too long to get started. We understand that Alex will see the plane crashing, but for about the first half hour that's all that's `implied'. It's very annoying. Thankfully, the characters aren't as stupid as they usually are in teen horror movies, and I did like all of the talk about `death's pattern', etc. Overall, get on board to Final Destination and it won't crash.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and terror, and for language."
"Anonymous_Maxine","5","22","31","23 August 2001"," A relatively interesting premise, but Final Destination ultimately sinks nearly to the level of the mass of bonehead teen thrillers that have been so prevalent in the 90s.
","(spoilers) Final Destination starts off really well, with our unlikely hero Alex in a great scene where he has a dream that the airplane that he is on with all of his high school friends (what high school goes to Europe for a senior trip?!) is going to explode upon take off. This is unquestionably the best scene in the film, both for its creativeness as well as its effectiveness. This kid falls asleep on the plane as everyone is boarding (another common occurrence among high school kids on planes filled with their friends, I'm sure), and has a dream about a defective seat back table and a subsequent, and pretty impressive, explosion on the plane that kills everyone.<br/><br/>
As the plane is going up in flames and people are getting sucked out through the hole in the side of the plane and burning to death and whatnot, Alex wakes up in a cold sweat and a frantic panic. Suddenly back to reality, he climbs over people trying to get back to the seat where his dream takes place, and when he gets there, he finds the same defective seat back table that was in his dream and therefore concludes that it was a clairvoyant dream and starts yelling that the plane is going to explode. Not bad for a movie that doesn't appear to be anything more than the latest teen slasher movie. And to top it all off, the part where the plane actually does explode (as seen from inside the airport), and especially the brief pause before the windows of the airport explode inward as well, is also one of the more satisfying scenes in the film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's pretty much all downhill from there. It seems that by avoiding being blown to bits on the plane, the kids who got off (some whether they liked it or not) seem to have `cheated' Death, and Death doesn't seem to be too happy about it. They are apparently being stalked by Death, as he (or, more likely, she) begins killing them one by one in increasingly outlandish and sometimes laughable death scenes. Is this really as original and entertaining as the explosion scene at the beginning of the film? Probably not. In fact, not even close. A bunch of scared teenagers being killed off one by one. Can you name another movie where this has happened? Can you really name a horror movie made in the 90s where this HASN'T happened?<br/><br/>On the one hand, you KNOW that nothing like these scenes would ever happen in real life. For the most part, computers that people have in their homes do not have anything in them that would explode if vodka were accidentally spilled into the monitor, and even if there was something like that inside it, it probably wouldn't explode through the screen, the strongest part of the entire thing. I also fail to feel any sympathy for someone who strangles in the bathroom because he thrashed his legs around while hanging by his neck from a cord, kicking his feet everywhere except directly underneath him. Take some knowledge, people (as this poor guy would have said), if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, stand up. It'll save your life. And don't even get me started on the power line at the end of the film that whipped around like a severed worm in fast forward. This is just garbage, couldn't they think of something better than that? Power lines do not behave like loose fire hoses on full blast when they are cut, they behave like cut cords. Probably the only death scene in the film that was really shocking and impressive (as well as relieving, given the character) was the one with the city bus.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this stuff does have a sort of purpose. Sure, every death in the film was ludicrous (even the rather grisly one dealt to Seann William Scott), but this gives shape to the character of Death. It's one of the film's good points that the Grim Reaper wasn't personified as a huge shape in a black cloak, stalking the kids and killing them. That would have put Final Destination in the same stagnant pool with all of these other goofy teen slashers and also would have ruined the movie beyond all hope. Instead, we get these outlandish and often ridiculously exaggerated death scenes, so it almost gives the feeling that Death is taking time out of his busy schedule to hand these people their asses personally. As Mallory Knox would say, `There's no escapin' here!' <br/><br/>There are very few interesting things about this movie, other than such things as that you can see Tony Todd, known as virtually nothing other than the Candyman, in a small role as the freakiest mortician on the planet. Also, it's interesting to ponder what would possibly have made Alex so hated and feared for saving those people's lives, especially when he is alienated the most by the very people that he saved. Carter, in particular, develops an unfathomable hatred for Alex that swells to the exploding point. You'd think those jerks would be grateful. <br/><br/>At any rate, the film as a whole is entertaining enough, but doesn't make much progress in attempting to elevate itself above the recent abundance of terrible teen thrillers and slasher movies and horror films. It is far above the abysmal level of such messes as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Valentine, as well as hideous spoofs like the Scary Movies, but Final Destination is definitely not meant for a more mature audience. If you decide to watch it, try to enjoy it for what it is, but keep your expectations low."

But today I decided that maybe I should give these movies a chance, I heard from a couple people that they were pretty good. I apologize to the writers and director of Final Destination, because this was one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>Basically, Alex and his fellow students, including four teachers, are going on a field trip to Paris, but Alex has a horrifying nightmare of the plane crashing horribly and exploding killing everyone.

","There are a number of super talented actor/directors in Hollywood. One of the most prolific is James Wong. In this film which he not only wrote, but directed as well he displays what many would consider his best work to date. This is the story of Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) who accompanies his high school friends on a field trip to France. However, moments before the plane departs, Alex has a premonition the plane will explode in mid-air. Sensing he is about to die, he breaks for the exit in a violent plea to leave the aircraft. When he demands to be put off, several of his friends add to his fear by panicking. When they are asked to leave, they are held by the security police in the waiting area, where they all see the plane depart and then moments later explode in mid-air. There after things which should go better for him, having saved peoples lives, go terribly wrong. One by one all the people whom he saved begin to die mysteriously with Alex realizing he knows why. Death stalks everyone, but in this story, they are warned in advance. The movie has some horrific moments, which the audience senses become more pronounced as death arrives.

","LOVED IT.<br/><br/>Imagine any great slasher with no killer.  No person to blame, nobody to see and NO IDEA HOW THAT PERSON WILL DIE.  That's about the simple horror of Final Destination, and it was done in almost artistic ways.<br/><br/>While many movie-makers have been unwilling or unable to get into the meat & potatoes behind a good R-rated movie, the creators of Final Destination have no such restraint.  In fact, the death scenes were so freakishly violent and intricate that they were interesting in and of themselves.  Imagine the force of death (not the Grim Reaper, but the ""phenomenon of accidents"", if you will) being MAJORLY p***ed for having missed a few.  Hence the plot.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the director displayed ""the little things"" hyper-accurately.  That alone made watching it really hard at times without wincing, flinching or screaming out loud.  (*those who have seen this know EXACTLY what I'm talking about*)<br/><br/>As someone who goes to the movies every Friday, I have been waiting for this FOREVER!!<br/><br/>Oh, and by movie, I mean MOVIE...  not FILM, not INDIE, not FLICK.  A MOVIE is something that I first hear of through word of mouth, first see a glimpse of via previews of another MOVIE, and, after seeing it, leave the theater flashing back through great scenes and lines for the next few hours saying to myself ""that was great!""<br/><br/>Final Destination was a great movie.  They don't make them like this too often.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you were looking for flaws you could find them (no movie is perfect), but I wasn't and enjoyed my ride thoroughly as a result.  Personally, I think that if you had the time to pay attention to those flaws while watching it for the very first time, I've got news for you:  you missed a great movie."

","I first saw this in 2001 on a TV channel. Cant remember whether it was hbo or local cable. Was very eager to watch this. By this time the VHS business had already closed in mumbai. The Lcd n vcd were total flop. Had seen n enjoyed all its sequels, especially the 5th part. Revisited the 1st recently on a DVD. I own all the parts. The plot of this movie was very refreshing n intriguing. A bunch of teens r heading off on a school trip n one of the fella falls asleep and has a bad dream/premonition that the plane they are on will explode just after it leaves the runway, mercilessly killing everyone on board. The fella causes a ruckus n is removed from the plane along with few others. Weirdly, the said plane does explode n as the tag line of the film says, u cant cheat death. The survivors r later followed by a sinister dark shadow.... The tension n suspense is maintained throughout. Very original concept. The writing is really unique. The gore and death scenes are really intense. The deaths are impressively choreographed, occasionally funny and liberally bloody. The acting is decent. The effects are done to great effect. There are some terrific scares here."
"dbdumonteil","Null","29","50","24 October 2003"," death like time has got its own plans
","Without being an absolute masterpiece, ""Final Destination"" is a good fantastic movie that deserves to be watched. It borrows several elements from other movies or novels such as ""Scream"" or ""And then there were none"" but it exploits them very well. And this is helped thanks to a clever script that includes a few qualities, notably this one: we can't really see death but we can feel its presence and its cleverness. Moreover, the suspense is well lead during all the movie until the end.<br/><br/>But if ""Final Destination"" isn't a masterpiece, it's because it also contains faults: for example, how can Alex, the hero of the film succeed in seeing these odd visions about ""accidents that are going to happen""? Then, he doesn't get on well with one of the main characters (you can consider him as his worst enemy) and however they'll be compelled to help each other in order to escape from death. You could also say that certain sequences are predictable while some are on the verge of unlikely.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, a rather good fantastic movie."
"draftyrafters","8","3","3","27 March 2000"," Fly the Friendly Skies
","If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another ""guy with a hook"" campfire story.  Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.<br/><br/>Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part.  Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.<br/><br/>If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.<br/><br/>The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites.  These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.<br/><br/>The premise:  those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list.  This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife.  There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.<br/><br/>The craftsmanship here is excellent.  The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing.  We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters.  We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements.  No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences.  And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight.  The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time.  Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.<br/><br/>The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film.  A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however.  The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.<br/><br/>The premise is, of course, self-destructive.  Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again.  It doesn't end until they die.  This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive ""tag-you're-dead"" quality of the plot.  It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.<br/><br/>Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre.  Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains.  It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.<br/><br/>Oooh.  Scary, huh?"
"negeati","8","3","3","22 March 2000"," cliched, yet smart and very, oh so very scary
","""Final Destination"" is a wonderful surprise after expecting very little from it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is everything what ""Scream 3"" wanted to be. Not as smart as ""Scream"", but just as scary. Sometimes even scarier. <br/><br/>The way they die is fun and refreshing. Of course, there is nothing to laugh about. But director James Wong (in a surprisingly relaxed debut) makes each frightening scene long-lasting and breathtaking. He makes an enourmously entertaining movie out of a tiny budget. The killing scenes are shocking. One of the characters is disposed off so quickly that your heart just stops. Another one upsets a computer. Another one teases us with the way he would die: slit his throat, electrocute himself. He dies in a horrifying way, completely different than what expected.The scene is gut-wrenching, just by looking into his blood-shot eyes. Finally, the last one is beheaded. The sequence is almost as good as ""Sleepy Hollow""'s decapitations, which means it is fantastic. I just love the way the guy stood there without a head on his shoulders. <br/><br/>There are also some drawbacks but they are so insignificant that they do not ruin the movie in any way. The use of the same idea with small variations. Alcohol burns, and so does turpentine. I wish that the initial plane explosion would have been grander. Lastly, the end is a bit of a let-down. After a very dynamic middle, the end feels weak. I heard that this was not the original ending. I hope that the other one was more upbeat.<br/><br/>
But being a horror movie fan, I am very satisfied with the ""Final Destination"". 8/10."

","Well, Devon Sawa stars as Alex who along with his High School classmates are heading to France. Before the flight, Alex begins to feel strange and sees indicators that death is about to greet him. He freaks out after a vision before the plane takes off, and he and a few others end up back at the terminal. Of course, the plane explodes and Alex and the remaining few have escaped death, but unfortunately that wasn't part of  Death's plan.<br/><br/>'Final Destination' started off very promising especially before and during Alex's vision, and Devon Sawa does a great job. Unfortunately, the remaining characters and script becomes very ludicrous and obvious after the first victim. This is where the film falls apart as the characters themselves become silly and cliche, as well as the script where the dialogue is used to explain the plot-points. It really felt obvious when Tony Todd arrives unbelievably as a mortician to explain the situation to Alex and co- and especially the audience. Many things wouldn't occur as they did in this film, and eventually I was getting frustrated with the silly indicators that death is coming. When one of the characters plays a John Denver record, I was like ""gimme a break""! Seriously, the concept alone could have made this movie chillingly scary if it was done right. Unfortunately, it wasn't, and none of the characters were developed well enough to have there own underlying signs or chemistry for that matter. It got very annoying very quickly, and don't get me started on the stupid ending. Hollywood needs to write better scripts, and 'Final Destination' is yet another forgettable film without the tongue and cheek and clever self-awareness of the 'Scream' series, nor the innovativeness of 'The Blair Witch Project'. Ali Larter and Seann William Scott also stars in 'Final Destination', but I would hardly recommend this film as some others have on here. Nice concept, poor film. ** out of *****!"

","Normally, I'm not spooked by a film but this movie sure as hell gave me the chills. <br/><br/>'Final Destination' was a taut, sharp and intelligent piece of horror, not reliant on that many gore effects for shocks. Indeed the films horror was based on a good use of suspense rather than out-and-out gore. I've got to admit, some deaths came out of nowhere and those who did die, died in less obvious ways than you may have thought of.<br/><br/>It gave us mere mortals something to think about too, in that (a)I'm not flying again for a long time and (b) death is not an accident but is planned so that when your time comes, you can do absolutely nothing about it. You can only cheat death temporarily. It'll get you in the end, by any means necessary no matter what plans you have made to avoid it. Morbid to be honest, but entirely true.<br/><br/>The downside to this movie was the confusing explanation of how the pattern of 'Death' was explained. It lost me. Can someone explain. It seems as though the writers became stuck for an explanation as to how 'Death' moved from victim to victim and thought hey this'll do for now.<br/><br/>This is only a minor quibble about a very good movie. I haven't seen an intelligent horror film like this since. Well, since. Good use of horror movie in-jokes too. I love the use of using surnames of horror directors and actors as character names. Some were obvious (Hitchcock, Lewton), some less so (Waggner, Schreck).<br/><br/>Highly recommended but not a date movie."

","Ahhh, a classic horror film. The slasher films are back (then again, did they ever leave?). 'Final Destination' is an interesting concept where Death itself is the antagonist in a slasher film.<br/><br/>After an impressive opening, the film gets more freaky. All the characters die in freak accidents, and - come to think of it - is actually so possible. For these youngsters, death is sure to knock on the door. Even though we expect it, some deaths are very unexpected - if you know what I mean - and quite shocking. The execution (pardon the pun!) of the plot is interesting and rather thrilling. The very idea of cheating death is alluring.<br/><br/>Even more interesting, is when the characters realize they will die in the order of which they were supposed to die. Paying attention to signs all around you might save your life, but then death moves on to the next person in line, until it is your turn again, and again you have to try and outwit it. Very clever premise indeed!<br/><br/>The film is atmospheric and foreboding, with disaster lurking around every corner. The cast is pretty good and convincing, and so are the visual effects. The action sequences are also very well done. A great amount of detail went into the making of this film."

","I don't know what the authors of the other comments are on about, I really liked this film. Maybe they tried to look too deep into the film, which is difficult since it is as shallow as they come. If you ignore the facts that the acting is a little wooden and the plot slightly contrived then this is a good enough way to spend a couple of hours, if only for the chance to see the characters getting picked off one by one in increasingly brutal ways. It would seem that Death is not someone you really want to annoy since he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to pay-back time.<br/><br/>There was quite a lot of hype surrounding the film in the UK, what with the TV adverts showing people jumping out of their seats in terror every 10 minutes and I must admit that I did jump, but only about twice.

","It's not very often, but when it happens it marks the talking point for every movie conversation. A horror movie that is truly worthy of the title. Acting that isn't shady, a story line that's believable and not too far-fetched. Firstly, let me point something out, the advertisements for the movie are real! In no way will I allow for any spoilers in this comment because if anyone had spoiled this for me I'd have hunted them down and destroyed them. Okay, I strongly liked this movie and thought it well worthy of 9 out of 10. Why? Well bad acting ruins a film, good acting enhances a film. For this film the acting was brilliant! I haven't read any other comments so I don't know what the general consensus is but I thought the acting, on the whole was great.   Devon Sawa, as the spotty faced, modern version of Nostradamus was immense. This guy has ability. The film opens, as you may know, with a guy called Alex Browning(Sawa) and a school class going to France. He feels weird and has a strange feeling. Anyway, to cut to the chase he gets on the plane and has a vision of how exactly the next five or ten minutes will play out. As it turns out, he ain't gonna leave that plane for a Kit Kat break....to put it mildly. He foresees the plane exploding and him turning to toast. Low and behold, when this vision ends, two girls ask him to swap seats, as happened exactly at the beginning of his vision. Anyway, the catalogue of events that transpires allows panicky Alex to decide that it would be in his, and everyone else's best interests if they left the plane. Here is a taste of the acting ability to come. He seems genuinely scared, his acting during this scene was as good a performance as I have seen in a long time. Moreover, he was helped by a few other noticeable performances. However, the directing was great as was the story-line. The plot - to defeat death. Throughout the film the manner in which the survivors from the plane crash are popped off by a vengeful and truly annoyed Grim Reaper makes me hope that when the big guy wants me, I don't do anything stupid like survive. If you haven't yet seen this film because of the hype , or because you are fed up with the post-Scream fanaticism that has swept throughout the country for the last few years, think again. I implore you to go to the next showing of this movie cos if you don't you will regret it. By the way, if it weren't for the neds who crowded into the cinema at the same time as my friends and I caught this movie, who talked and laughed for 30 minutes after every death scene and who, basically, could have ruined the film, it could have been well worth a ten!"

","Okay, I'll give this movie one credit.  The scene where the girl gets obliterated by the bus was shocking and somewhat original,yet totally unrealistic, much like the rest of the film.  Did you know that Vodka can be ignited just like gasoline?  or that a coffee cup hold about a gallon of liquid?  Perhaps that your computer monitor might blow up should liquid get inside of it...even while off?  Or get this--a house blows up, completely engulfed in flames--yet the fbi can get finger prints off a knife in the house, and footprints off the wood floor.  Right.  I especially love the kindness of people in this film--the bus that smashes the girl doesn't stop...guess he figures he'll clean up after he gets back to the station. But even beyond the unbelievability is the horribly contrived dialogue. The entire scene with the mortician I was just shaking my head, ashamed that i had paid $8 to see this crap.  I was actually laughing out loud at the final deaths in the film, they were so pathetically constructed.  They might as well have had bags labelled blasting caps lying around the garages in this film.

I say inevitably because there is a group of teens involved so obviously there can be no long-term seriousness. Still, I was a little surprised just how unseriously the movie ends. When one compares the excellent beginning with the ridiculous horror/comedy ending, it is like looking at two different movies. It's a pity that the premise wasn't taken and ""assigned"" to a cast of adults, i.e. that a ""serious"" horror film wasn't made. Nevertheless, FD is never dull; even the obviously weaker second half. The flight disaster scenes are terrific, the murder scenes are very good, and there is real interest as to what is going to happen next, in spite of a premonition that the conclusion can't and won't be satisfactory. The conclusion is almost like a mockery of all the previous happenings (the movie turns from horror into the horror comedy genre). Easily the dumbest scene, however, isn't the ending but the way the aggressive teen turns around his car to beat up the movie's main hero, and nearly kills the bicycle-driving teen - while completely ignoring the fact that he nearly killed him and caused an accident! That was really, really dumb."

","A high school class is boarding a plane to go on a trip. One of the boys' has a vision of the plane exploding and decides to get off. A few other teens join him as well as the French teacher. Upon take off the plane does blow up and so the group effectively eluded death... at least for the moment.<br/><br/>One scene wraps up this movie for me: <br/><br/>The teacher is cooking something on the stove. She has a mug near the fire and it gets hot. She pours some liquor into the mug and the cold liquor cracks the hot mug unbeknownst to her. She proceeds to walk into her living room near her computer. Some of her drink leaks through the fine crack in the mug and gets into the computer monitor. The computer monitor short circuits AND BLOWS UP!! sending a shard of glass flying right into the lady's neck. She still isn't dead though. With blood spewing from her neck she stumbles into the kitchen to get a towel. The fire is still going on the gas stove and they bring a lot of attention to that. Somehow she falls down on her back, but she is still groping for a towel. While on her back, with one hand still trying to stop the bleeding, she grabs the towel she was groping for. OOPS!!! The towel was under a wooden block full of stored knives!! They all fall out of the storage block, face down no less, and puncture her in numerous places. Death is not finished yet. To make sure she is dead, and that her young student doesn't rescue her, the towel caught on fire and proceeded to burn up the entire kitchen, the rest of the house, and of course her as well.<br/><br/>AB-SURD!! That describes the movie. It was wholly absurd. How many freakish ways can you be killed? I guess the makers of this movie wanted to explore all 6 million. It was bad enough that a girl got hit by a silent bus that was traveling 60 mph and didn't brake though it had splattered flesh all over it, and that a ""live"" wire took on a new meaning when it came to life and literally attacked people, but they had to go way over the top with the teacher. I don't mind reality being stretched a bit, but there are limits to where my intellect just says: ""This is too much."""

They are left in the departure lounge as the plane takes off, then they all witness it as it blows up in mid air killing everyone aboard just like in Alex's vision. Those who walked off the plane try to get on with their lives but start to die under mysterious circumstances leading Alex to believe that death has come back to claim those he saved...<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by James Wong I have to say I thought Final Destination when it originally came out was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre which was producing boring unimaginative teen crap for years like they were coming off on a production line, at the time I originally saw it at the cinema I genuinely thought Final Destination tried to be something that bit different yet still gave horror fans what they wanted. The script by Wong, producer Glen Morgan & Jeffrey Reddick was apparently based on a potential The X-Files (1993 - 2002) episode & I must admit I loved the idea behind it, I thought it was clever, fun & made a great central premise for killing off teens in spectacular ways. The character's are good considering their clichÃ©d American teen origins, the dialogue is good with it's plot explained just about enough to make sense without going overboard & at less than 100 minutes it moves along like a rocket with some extremely satisfying & clever set-pieces. The film also has a healthy respect for the genre & there are lots of homages & references to other genre films including naming the cast after old horror stars & director's, Valerie Lewton anyone? Of course it's not perfect & I'm not trying to say it is, while they are OK the character's are just faceless teens when all said & done, the mortician character is just very out-of-place, one could say it's a touch silly & the set-pieces go from sinister & clever acts which conspire to dispense of a character to overblown full on ghostly events like possessed electric cables, exploding cars & entire house's blowing up & some of it's own rules are broken as if Alex wasn't the next victim because he never actually changed seats why did death try to kill him when he was at the cabin before Carter who was as it is revealed the next victim? Still, I'll leave the nit picking to the monkeys because I just thought it was a highly entertaining & pretty original teen horror flick with a good story & decent gore.<br/><br/>Director Wong does a good job & the film is very stylish & great to look at although I'm coming off the back of a terrible run of zero budget shot on a digital camcorder crap that makes something that looks this good an absolute god send. There's a lot of visual gags here, I loved the prevailing sense of doom at the airport with the informations boards displaying words like 'departed' & 'terminal'! Plus there's a John Denver song playing in the airport toilets &, of course, he died in a plane crash! I was more than pleased to see the makers haven't skipped on the gore either, there's decapitations, hangings, embalming's, stabbings, broken glass in necks, someone gets splattered by a bus in a great scene & there's plenty of blood splashed around. The film has a nice eerie tension & has a few genuine jumpy scare moments.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 this is very well made, the CGI effects are decent although not perfect while the make-up effects are very good. The film is set in a south New York but was shot in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is pretty good from a recognisable & good looking teenage cast, horror regular Tony Todd makes a small & somewhat pointless cameo.<br/><br/>Final Destination is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest teen horror popcorn flicks this millennium & it's as simple & straight forward as that. This proved enough of a success to spawn two sequels, the even better Final Destination 2 (2003) & Final Destination 3 (2006)."
"the red duchess","7","5","8","28 August 2000"," Surrealist suspense(spoilers)
","'Final Destination' pulls off a great trick.  While managing to retain a commendably non-'Scream' seriousness of purpose, a solemn accretion of suspense, a faithfulness to genuine fears and emotions, the multiple deaths in the film are as blackly funny as they are elaborately gruesome; but this note of the comic in an otherwise grimly portentous movie, never betrays its ambitions.  These ARE some deaths, though; some intolerably protracted, implausibly set up, yet deliciously executed; others sharp, horrifying, hilarious shocks, one of which suggest the scriptwriters must have seen Lynne-Maree Danzay's brilliant short 'Fetch', where autobuses are used to similar effect.<br/><br/>With films like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'X-Men', it looks like Surrealism, once mocked as a dotty, marginal movement, has finally pervaded the Hollywood mainstream.  Not only does most of the action take place at night, but there is also an early suggestion that the whole thing is dreamt by Alex, not just the first plane crash - as he falls asleep on the eve of the trip, the clock showing 1:00 fades into the 180 that is the number of the plane; the dissolve is drawn attention to, signalling a move into the dream or imagined that the film never comes out of.  The narrative, therefore, becomes an expanded Unconscious, a drama of a whole set of fears.<br/><br/>It is appropriate that Alex is 17, on the brink of adulthood - his dad dolefully suggests that his whole life is ahead of him, as if freedom, youth, fun are all at an end.  And they are.  As all fears are often sexual in basis, it is appropriate that Alex doesn't reach the final destination of the title at first - the plane crash is a coitus interruptus, like the bomb that stops the kiss in 'Touch of Evil'; it is a stunting of growth, a refusal to move into adulthood, to progress sexually (Paris, of course, being the stereotypical city of love).  As his friends are either trying to get off with girls, or are lucky enough to have one, Alex remains a solitary figure, locked into his own mind, whose only sexual relief is an old copy of Penthouse.<br/><br/>Whereas the teen movie, for all its modish trappings, is generally conservative, concerned with finding a mate, fitting in, asserting order, like a Shakespearean comedy, setting the continuity of the species in motion, Alex is a destructive force, linked to death (the scrappaper with Tod written on it, as well as alluding to his friend, also refers to the German word for death), sterility; we are never quite convinced that the events are out of his control.  In one brilliant sequence of cross-cutting, Alex's opening of his Penthouse is linked with the leak of Tod's toilet, setting in motion his friend's death, Alex's onanistic seed a murderous power.<br/><br/>As the film proceeds, he becomes increasingly detached from community, from reality, setting himself up as a godlike power, imposing patterns on the randomness of life, right down to the obscurely arrogant climactic gesture of self-sacrifice.  Even when order seems to be asserted at the end, he has finally reached Paris, and he has a relationship with a woman, has joined the status quo, he is unable to deal with it, he has to destroy it.  Like Melville's 'Le Samourai', 'Destination' is a dream of masculine selfhood, of wholeness, of the fears that it will be diluted, fragmented, by compromise, society, difference.  As a study in heightened megalomania,  'Destination' reaches heights from modest ambitions unavailable to the risible pretentions of the 'Beach'.<br/><br/>The Surrealist aesthetic also informs the film's treatment of suspense, a steady accretion of 'normal', familiar, domestic details, imbued with the terror of a diseased mind - the opening airport sequences are a masterpiece of anticipatory dread, the everyday made malevolent.  The unsensational revelation of the plane explosion, a mere firework, in the background as boys fight, is staggeringly, resonantly beautiful, sequences such as the tasteless memorial to the air-crash victims - a statue of an eagle! - suggest that Surrealism, as Breton said of the English, is less a view of the world than a way of life.  For some reason films like this and 'The Faculty' are treated with hostility and indifference by critics.  Don't you realise you are living in a golden age of horror movies?"

What was Alex suppose to do, sit in his seat with his hands folded saying ""Oh well, we're going to die. Can't stop it, IT'S DEATH'S PLAN!"" Who gave him the vision, I'm thinking God, and how dare Death think his plan is better then God's plan, if God wanted these people to live, then why did he stop him. Another thing, since Death is a solid creature that can arrange fatal accidents, then why can't at least the audience see it. I mean really, this is a movie, not freaking radio. I would like to see the monster. Finally the ending, which basically saying you can never escape death. If you are going to die, then just die. Even if you see it coming ahead of time, just sit down and except it. If not, you'll have an invisible monster out to kill you for messing up his ""plan"". Why don't you just stop watching them and they'll stop making them. I mean they must be running out of idea, there is no final destination in a roller coaster.

Once again, we have several talented actors wasting away in this in cohesive implausible, and totally worthless pieces of fluff. As with the second one, the directors decided they wanted to come up with some of the most impossible, and in some cases, unnessaryily goreish, ways to kill people off. The whole premise of the series is weak, and rather offensive. The lowest of any horror film series, only watch if you want to see how over the top a horror film can be.

","I'd heard good things about this movie, but they were totally undeserved. Granted, the basic premise of the film is fantastic, and unusually original in this genre, but the script is absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>For example, without spoiling the 'plot', the complete pattern is worked out after just one incident: now I may be wrong, but I think a pattern is defined as a series of events linked in some way. From that point on the dialogue was awful, the supposed 'make you jump' moments may as well have had an on-screen countdown they were so obvious, and the film became overwhelmed in sheer banality.<br/><br/>The ending did give a little bit of interest, until you realise that it leaves the door open for a sequel, at which point you just wonder...why?<br/><br/>Only rent this film if you are extremely bored or hung over.<br/><br/>The John Denver music was in there due to the 'ironic' fact that he died in a plane crash.<br/><br/>3/10"

Each death scene shows a person doing regular activities, and they focus on about 17 different ways that person could die, until finally, after a ridiculous long amount of time, the person dies in the most completely impossible and stupid manner you could imagine. And not only that, the dialogue falls flat on the floor. There's nothing about the movie that even makes you remotely care about whether any of the characters live or die. I would expect better out of a high school project. I won't describe any of the death scenes in case you actually want to watch it, but my advice is: DON'T.

","This is a clever little movie.<br/><br/>I'm 53, and go to see teen movies out of curiousity and to try to stay tuned to a quickly evolving, often intriguing culture. Sometimes I get discouraged at how mindless culturemakers think teens are. I felt this way after seeing Romeo Must Die.<br/><br/>But this movie gave me hope, as did the little gem GO last year. I know that there are many who would go looking to be scared, who would take this movie (or any one) seriously -- folks who even rank grossness as a thrill.<br/><br/>But this movie is like the first Scream movies in making fun not at slasher flicks, but at the people who come to see slasher picks, or more precisely, the reasons they do. However, this movie does so much better than scream because it uses a novel device: many of the deaths are extremely complex sequences of improbable coincidences. <br/><br/>It fits with the story, as only death could string these together. But it provides what Scream lacked: a greater distance from the actual slash. In fact this movie is NOT scary, nor gory by current standards. Instead, it spends its time on introspection about the medium. Andy Warhol sophistication finally hits teen culture. The level of this humor gives me hope about the future of the minds of our kids.<br/><br/>I only wonder what can come of it next.

The potential for a decent movie is there in the first 15 minutes, but the movie falls off so badly that you will be checking the clock several times, hoping for a final destination. That is so common in today's movies, find a decent hook, but never follow it up with strong characters or story development. Instead, resort to retread scenes that you have seen in countless other teen movies. This movie was stupid and geared for a 7th grade mentality. And if you don't die laughing at the end when they are supposedly in Paris at a cafe, there is something wrong with you.

The entire film is packed to the brim with the traditional ""horror-movie"" cliches, such as the curtains blowing in the wind and the strikes of lightning occurring every time something bad is about to happen. Not only that, but each death becomes more and more predictable as the film progresses, and by the time Billy was randomly decapitated by a piece of metal sent flying by a train, I was just laughing. The only commendable aspect of the whole saga was that the enemy, Death, was never visible, although whenever he was about to strike, there would be a lamentably stereotypical shadow cast across the room. Not even the plane crash was remotely scary, and the actors showed very little emotion about the fact that 50 of their classmates had just been killed in a mile-high fireball. Several killings were unbelievably improbable, such as Todd's ""suicide"" in the bath, Terry's collision with the bus (which I cannot believe nobody saw coming), and the electrocution and train scenes, where, amazingly, Alex manages to cheat Death. For a film which was supposed to promote the idea that Death is unavoidable, ""Final Destination"" has an abysmally happy ending. The cherry on the cake though, was seeing Tony Todd in cameo role as the morgue attendant who tells Alex, ""I'll be seeing you soon."" Worth seeing so that you can spend a couple of hours mocking every aspect, but this movie can't really score more than a 4."

When one of the number, Todd is killed, Alex realises that they have not cheated death and that the reaper is returning for them in turn.<br/><br/>When I originally saw this film I was not that taken with it, however seeing the sequel made me realise just how superior to that, the original was.  The plot, taken from an X-Files idea is quite clever and originally worked out throughout the film.  Each death (or potential death) is shocking or tense or exciting, there is little of the obscene cruelty that exists within the sequel.  Here the characters are just a little more than meat to be sliced and diced in fancy manners.<br/><br/>The cast are reasonably good.  Many are simply student clichés who have their time counted down.  Not knowing who was famous and who wasn't here I didn't know who would live and who would die and it made it quite exciting. Sawa leads the cast well and is a good character  his madness in the cabin is worth seeing.  Todd (Candyman himself) makes a brief cameo that helps the film and is nicely creepy and trashy at the same time.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable trashy film that has gore and suspense and is enjoyable to watch.

","The idea of cheating death, and then having death itself 'chase' you until the only conclusion ensues is a frightening one, and a really great premise for a horror movie. Death is the ultimate unknown and the idea of it being a malicious presence should give way to a classic horror movie. However, anything that should have been good about this movie isn't, and unfortunately it ends up being another teen slasher, just with an invisible killer instead of some goon in a mask. After a relatively decent start, the movie descends into a routine, cliché ridden, teen horror movie with not an interesting character nor a frightening scenario in sight. The story follows a group of teenagers and their teacher (also a teenager) that survive a plane crash after one of them has a premonition and gets himself thrown off the plane. What then follows is a series of over the top death scenes intertwined with a boring 'investigation'.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film is rubbish as the death sequences aren't that bad. We've got one kid being strangled in the bath, another is decapitated by a piece of stray metal while another is mauled by glass from a computer monitor, and later a set of kitchen knives. However, it's all spoilt by the boring characters and silly dialogue (imagine 'death' is after you; would you really 'challenge' it with harsh language?). I'm all against remakes, but this is a premise I'd love to see tackled by a talented group of people. With a good cast, interesting writing and a talented director; this idea could be taken all the way to the realms of the horror classic. Unfortunately, the chances of anyone making a film like that these days is slim because all of these sorts of things have to be done with 'teens' (a.k.a. actors in their early twenties, playing teens) for teens to ensure that the film will sell.

Why are movies about predestination being made, the idea is as old and outdated as bloodletting, the miracle cure.  Donnie Darko, Memento, and the Matrix were all the same way, shoving people into categories where their fate was predetermined; it is the ultimate fantasy for people who need explanations for life's travails, because it means that all of the bad things that happen to them are not their fault.  People, there is no grand plan for each one of us.  If there were, then why bother doing anything, your fate is already sealed.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is about as enjoyable as a root canal.

In fact, it's not the movie itself that is creepy but the whole idea behind it really gives you goosebumps. Alex and his class are going to France for a workweek. Many little signs make Alex afraid and a vision right before take-off makes him cause a scene. He and 5 others are thrown off the plane. While they're fighting in the lobby the plane explodes and all 287 passengers die. At that point you might think they're the luckiest people alive but...think again. They all start to die in the order they were supposed to die on the exploding plane. Why ?? Because Death had planned it that way. And there's no way you can escape your destiny. Alex starts to realize tries and tries to beat death again for himself and all the other survivors. Because he gets these little clues about what's gonna happen, he's always one step ahead... The first hour of this film is really good. The tension is built up efficiently and you just stare at it with your mouth wide open. You really awaits what will gonna happen next. The big advantage of this film is that it actually has no heroes. You have the feeling all the characters can die any minute. After this first astonishing hour, it all gets wasted a little. There are a little too many ""miraculous escapes"" to keep you alert. That's a damn shame cause you really get the feeling the makers could have provided this film with a better ending. Yet, no worries because by then the film proved itself already as highlight of the new generation of horror. For the rest: there's a good amount of violence, blood and gore so even the fans of that are satisfied. The cast does well actually.

Final Destination comes across as an aspiring slasher film with one thing missing: a slasher.  This should be a movie about being hunted by an invisible force, and as such, there should be suspense.

","I have to confess that after The Sixth Sense debacle, every magazine giving away the twist, I avoided reading a single review of Final Destination until I'd actually seen the thing. The fact that there IS no clever twist doesn't make it a bad film, just one more factor making it a mediocre one.<br/><br/>Glen Morgan and James Wong, Executive Producers for both ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and ""The X-Files"", dealt a lot of expectation for this movie. Their ten scripts for The X-Files (most notably ""Squeeze"", ""Beyond The Sea"" and ""E.B.E."") created high hopes. But then high hopes is what the ant had and it didn't do him much good either.<br/><br/>Maybe, like me, you're the anally retentive sort that is distracted by detail. Like in similarly air-based ""Die Hard 2"", where Bruce asks an airport receptionist to send a fax. The fact that this plot development saw her send the fax upside down - meaning the other end would have received only a blank sheet of paper - kept distracting me. Likewise, the two girls who ask the leads to change seats so that they can sit together. Why? There were three seats in each row anyway!<br/><br/>But I digress. The film, itself, then, is the sort of movie that has that peculiar type of Transatlantic irony - ie., not really very funny, but we'll pretend it is and send it up anyway. I hate snobbery, but suffice it to say if you think the ""humour"" within this film is ""wry"" or ""clever"" then you're probably dead from the neck up. A bit like the guy in this film who... no, that's a spoiler... The ""joke"" is sewn right from the start, with multiple ""ironic"" references to impending doom, the lead quote from this review being probably the most subtle. There's also an unjustifiably snotty jibe at the much more entertaining and likeable ""Stuart Little"".<br/><br/>The actual idea behind the picture - a group cheat death only to find the laws of death's predeterminism creeping up on them - looks tremendous on paper, and could have made for a fantastic movie. But while the initial idea is strong, and relatively original, the conception is weak and flawed. For a start, there's the average direction and acting, coupled with the age of the group. If this had been a much older cast, rather than schoolkids, it would have possible to get more depth into the piece. But then again, maybe it would have been nice not to have a 100% all-white, sparkly-teethed photogenic cast either. A little character variation wouldn't have gone amiss.<br/><br/>Proceedings carry on as the characters each in turn meet a grisly death. While I won't, to be spoiler-free, reveal who gets it first, it is pretty obvious that the guy that puts the pieces together WON'T get it too early on in the movie. It's also basic narrative convention that the more interesting ones will get a slightly longer lifespan. In Hollywood only the bland die young. So knowing what trio will live on to see out most of the duration takes the fun away a little.<br/><br/>One nice possible in-joke was the lead denying having a ""narcisstic DD complex"" Anyone know what this is? Wouldn't be a reference to a certain Mr. Duchovny by any chance? Other than the everyday, run-of-the-mill execution, the other problem I had was with the scariness of the movie. A fantastic trailer was shown on television, showing people leaping out of their seats, hurling popcorn everywhere. As a bit of an idiot, I had planned to see the film with friends and do this whether I found it scary or not, just to act the fool.

","Well what can one expect from director James Wong, whose other claim to fame was another terrible film released back in early November of 2001 -The One, which starred Jet Li. I just found Final Destination to be so insulting as a film on so many different levels. It's obvious that I don't like the director's work at all. But the acting is awful, as well. Afterall, it is nothing more than some dumb teeny-bopper horror flick. And the talent that it brought into to perform for these films is never all that great to begin with. Also, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary or shocking, came off as stupidly funny. I couldn't wait for this film to end, and I do NOT recommend seeing it. The release of Final Destination 2 has just hit theaters and naturally every teen in the country wants to see it. The only thing that might be good about the sequel is a car crash that is supposedly filmed very well. But beyond that, it doesn't appear very promising either. BOMB."

","At the beginning, the plot seemed promising but then it turned out to be terribly stupid. What bothered me most about the movie was the way they used cheap techniques to make it scary. And by that I mean all the stupid, non-sense accident scenes which are supposed to scare you. Now we are led to believe that ""death has a pattern and chooses its victims according to that pattern"". Suppose that it is true, why do all the people have to die in bizarre accidents? Are there not other ways of dying, say a heart-attack or sudden internal-bleeding or any sort of sickness? And why has it never occurred to the main character that the next victim could die just by a natural cause and not by accident? But no, people had to die in those bizarre accidents so the audience could be scared! Well, I was neither scared nor amused by these cheap tricks; I wonder who were. Throughout the movie I kept I wondering what the main message was, that death has a pattern, that we can change it? And why death always had to come as accident? Could the main character stop deaths from happening if it came as, say cancer? And one more thing: why did the main character have to presume that death was going to come immediately right after it took a victim. I mean just because he figured out who the next victim was going to be and could make a list of that, it did not mean that death was gonna hit the next victim right away!!! It could have taken 10 years for death to strike its next victim. It seemed as if not only did the main character know in advance the cause of death but the time of the death too. So, I think these otherwise-could-be false presumptions were expected to be taken for granted and the events were deliberately set-up which made the whole thing seem so obvious. Not a good scary movie."

It's insulting to sit there and watch a bunch of teens who are trying to outrun the angel of death even though they will die eventually.  The fact that Alex saw 'Death's plan' meant he wasn't supposed to die on that plane and those students who listened to him weren't supposed to die there either. Those who lived were meant to die at those points in the movie.  The teacher was supposed to die in her house.  The ditzy, fraidy blonde was supposed to get KO'ed by the bus.  I think making a movie were someone is trying to outrun death when it is going to catch up with him or her eventually is truly sardonic.  Maybe, that's the point of the film.

"TheMovieDiorama","5","2","3","4 September 2019"," Final Destination uses its precognitive abilities to spawn a franchise devoid of suspense.
","Yes, another influential horror series that is ferociously mediocre and stupid beyond belief. The franchise filled with inventive death sequences, narrow survivability and teeny weeny clichés all started here with Wong, a man clearly hellbent in forcing audiences to be mildly cautious of everything, everyone and everywhere. Except he forgot one crucial aspect. He had seemingly directed/written a horror, but where's the suspense? Where's the horror? And holy flailing live wire where's the characterisation? A teenager cheats death after experiencing a premonition of a plane (which clearly wasn't suitable for take off...) exploding. He and a multitude of students leave the plane before the catastrophic event takes place and now Death is curing his boredom by finding inventive ways to kill these fools.<br/><br/>For instance, a teenager strangling themselves with a shower and unable to stand up. Or a girl being slammed by the most silent speeding bus. Maybe a monitor exploding like a bomb and dispersing shards of glass into a woman's neck. No wait, I got it! Decapitation by shrapnel! Anyway, despite how inventive and gloriously gory these death sequences were, whilst suspending your disbelief for the vast majority of the film's runtime, masquerading plot conveniences as determinism is incredibly lazy writing. Hang on! I know exactly what you're thinking. ""Uhhh the point of these films is that Death is controlling their outcomes"". And I get it. I'm fine with that. But you're going to try and convince me that all the survivors happened to be at the same café as one of them meets their early demise, to which was all part of Death's plan? Or Billy riding his bicycle at the exact moment a house explodes? No. Those are just conveniences that outline the amateurish writing capabilities of the screenplay writers.<br/><br/>Speaking of screenplay, nearly every line of dialogue is used to theorise about Death's plan. These students aren't having natural conversations about their lives or what they had for breakfast. They discuss death in so much detail, that one could mistake them for being morticians. Cheer up guys, please! The lack of characterisation is woeful, and in turn makes us care less about who meets their demise or not. Honestly, didn't give a toss who got impaled by a washing line. Wong had his mind purely set on ""how"" they were going to die, as opposed to ""who"", and in turn deviated from the much required suspense that Final Destination craved.<br/><br/>Fortunately the practical effects make up for the absent tension, particularly the introductory plane catastrophe, inducing plenty of gore being splattered on the screen. The acting was functional for a teen horror, although Sawa and Larter were standouts with their underdeveloped pairing, and the Goldberg effect on some of the deaths were fascinating to watch unravel. But then you see Death retreat the water that mysteriously followed Tod on the bathroom floor, and we're back to nonsensical stupidity.<br/><br/>Final Destination is a film I appreciate, especially for its influence and staying power in the horror genre. Forever watchable and a great film to put on during a popcorn night. However it's irrefutably mediocre, with stupidity around every corner and morticians randomly delivering excessive exposition, so much so that Death has seemingly possessed everyone into thinking it's actually decent."

","The beginning is actually quite good, though not recommended for those with fear of flying. Main character Alex gets a vision of the plane he's in, and that's about to airlift him and his classmates to Paris, exploding. He panics, and together with some of his friends gets kicked off. Of course, the plane then explodes as foreseen. Alex has cheated Death. But as he finds out, this simply means that the survivors are still listed to die, and to be sure, soon enough one after the other gets killed in the gruesome and unlikely ways befitting, I suppose, of this genre. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's rules, and to thwart his plan. That's where things become silly. It is the usual problem in horror movies with supernatural forces: the supernatural world behaves so utterly banal and childish that it stops being scary. Why on earth would Death play a game like this? Logic is obviously thrown overboard entirely. Why would a girl who knows she's next in line to die, go outside in a raging thunderstorm where broken, live power lines are lashing about, to rescue her dog? How do Alex and his chums know so exactly where and how they can get into the morgue at night? Why does Alex repeatedly almost die when sheltering in a wood cabin, and why does the strange wind that presages a death blow through the cabin, even though Alex figures out a minute later that it isn't actually his turn yet? How come the three survivors eventually go on for six months without trouble, even though it turns out they are still scheduled to die? Did Death need a break?? I don't even care to wonder about the psychology of the characters, who are able to deal with one friend's gruesome death after another without shedding a single tear. Worst of all are the obligatory FBI men, who for some strange reason do not arrest a kid who is repeatedly found at the scene of violent deaths, and whose fingerprints are found on a knife sticking in a dead body. They do pick him up when a scared teacher sees him in her front yard, but then - ...just let him go again. Huh? And oh yes, of course: when they finally do decide to arrest him, in the middle of the night in a dark wood, they obviously turn on their sirens and lights, so that he can see and hear them coming a mile away, and has plenty of time to escape. In short: if you are feeling in the mood for something fairly dumb, with an occasional effective scare thrown in, as well as a few cute kids to look at, this will do. If you are looking for intelligent entertainment, look elsewhere."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>I had heard some rather good things about this movie, and was kind of looking forward to finally seeing it, but unfortunately it turned out to be a rather big disappointment. <br/><br/>I was looking for a clever thriller, but instead I got a slightly above average slasher movie (group of teens gets killed by maniac, you know the drill). OK, the ""maniac"" in this case is intangible (it's none other than ""Death"" in person) but it's still a movie about a group of kids getting slaughtered in strange ways.<br/><br/>In fact, the entire movie amounts to little more than a series of freak accidents that are so unlikely and exaggerated that I couldn't help but laugh during a large number of them. The line ""don't move"" the main character says to his teacher while she's bleeding to death, pinned to the ground by a very large stake knife was absolutely hilarious! It's not like she CAN actually go anywhere, is it? <br/><br/>I also found the plot behind the accidents (some people have cheated Death and now Death wants his revenge) to be more absurd than interesting or mystical. If Death really wanted them dead so eagerly, I'm sure he could come up with something a little less absurd than this.<br/><br/>
Also, the lead actor is pretty unconvincing. He reminds be of the runner-up in the Dutch version of ""American Idol"" and is equally untalented. The rest of the acting is passable but that's about it. <br/><br/>All in all, I found this to be a rather hollow movie. It's reasonably original, but it's definitely more a slasher movie than a really good thriller like ""Sixth Sense"". <br/><br/>*1/2 out of **** stars"

","Yet another excellent premise ruined by pandering to a teenage audience in the worst possible way - through a plethora of over-the-top scare tactics and with a lack of unpredictability.<br/><br/>I waited until this wretched film got to the dollar theatre, and that's the thing I'm most thankful for about the entire experience. I feel guilty for recommending that my friends and I go see it, I feel robbed for not knowing about rottentomatoes.com back in the day (which has saved the day multiple times since Final Destination), and I wished that I had snuck in.<br/><br/>
The opening scene should have said it all - there was every shlock scare effect in the book, mostly being the wind whistling through a room and shuffling some papers around. And it didn't stop there, like I was hoping against hope - the emotions were trite and the scares false throughout the movie's short run time.<br/><br/>And as for anyone who avoided planes after this movie: you're a tool of the system and most likely avoided air travel for a full year after 9/11 (when, in fact, it was the safest time imaginable to travel, and the cheapest).<br/><br/>
At any rate, the best part, a jewel in the rough, was that simpering girlfriend getting plowed by the bus. That was classic. The rest was disposable.<br/><br/>And yet... I'll see the sequel, maybe even on opening night, as laughing at a movie is getting to be as common and as pleasurable as laughing or shrieking along with a movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who bought the DVD for anything other than the scant sexual content should break it into small pieces and go for the gusto in the vein of what they obviously are reaching for: a way to hurt themselves and like it because the media told them to.

","I actually wasn't going to watch this movie, I had the TV on while I was doing something else and this movie came up. I was hooked, however, by the plane crash scene in the beginning, which must be the scariest, most horrific, most realistic scene of this type ever. The story about its being a dream that comes true after the dreamer and some other passengers leave the plane and are therefore saved, this was also interesting, as well as the fear, instead of gratitude, that the dreamer inspires. Maybe this was not such a bad movie after all.<br/><br/>Ah, but in the end it was. All of a sudden it becomes a supernatural teen slasher movie, with Death playing the part of Freddy Kruger, Jason and other famous slashers. After the first survivor dies, the dreamer protagonist works out that by escaping the plane they have cheated Death, who does not take kindly to this, and therefore sets out to finish his business, by killing the survivors one by one, in true slasher movie fashion. Our hero not only deducts this, but he is also more or less warned about this by an odd mortician who may or may not be Death himself. And then he works out Death's ""design"" (a favorite word of the scriptwriter), by guessing who will be the next victim, and how the victims can be saved if someone else intervenes on time. If this sounds terminally ridiculous, it is because the movie well... is silly indeed. Even those who loved the movie cannot deny that every word I've just written is true.<br/><br/>The problem here is an indigestible mixture of things that just don't work together; it is like a pizza with meringue and cheese topping. There is nothing wrong with a good slasher movie, if your tastes run that way, but good slasher movies never take themselves seriously, something fully understood and taken to the limits by Scream, a top example. Final Destination, however, takes itself dead seriously (sorry, bad pun). Its mixture of profound speculation about the possibility of cheating death and the slapstick nature of the death scenes is just self-defeating. Since Death cannot wield the knife himself, everybody just has to die in an accident; not just any accident, they have to be particularly bizarre and convoluted, and (unintentionally, I suspect) hilarious.<br/><br/>Anyway. If it is shown on TV, you can watch the opening minutes. Then you can find yourself something else to do."

I kind of knew what I was getting myself into, but... whew!  This one wasn't even laughable.  It left me with a dark and unsettling fear of my bathroom and death may present itself to me in the form of a leaky toilet.  Or the fear that my computer will violently explode if I spill a small amount of liquor on the monitor.  Plus, I'm now afraid that ever time I hear a John Denver tune, the bell of death tolls for thee.  (Except for ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy!"" because life really ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle.)<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't see the movie, you're thinking, ""what the heck is he talking about?""  For those of you who have, you may now hopefully begin to see the downright silliness in this film.  People in this movie are killed in the same fashion as the villians in ""The Naked Gun"" series.  But at least in those movies it was meant to be funny.  But, in ""Final D"" (as its fans call it) death comes to some cast members in a long and complicated manner. Some may suggest to me that this is dark comedy.  But, then again, some people are not very bright. After quite some time, I simply found myself shouting ""just die already!"" at my television.  After it was all over finally, I was briefly expecting George Kennedy to come in and say, ""Oh Frank!  That's so horrible!  My father went the same way.""<br/><br/>But, I must admit, I'm a tad biased.  I'm absolutly sick of the new current horror genre that stars hot, young stars of the WB.  Horror movies went from being bad and knowing that they're bad, to be being bad and pretending to be whitty.  I understand a few people were lured in with the vague promise of a horrifying plane crash scene.  But if that's all you're looking for, you can watch Edward Norton's crash fantasy in ""Fight Club."" At least that was shown in a more tasteful manner and not just made for people who like to see other people die.  (Come on!  Admit it!  That's the only reason people watch horror flicks.  It's the violence, right?  You can't tell me it's the plot!)<br/><br/>Another problem I had was character names.  The main character's middle name is ""Chance.""  (Whoa! Now I get it!  That's such an ironic twist! HA!HA!HA!HA!)  One is ""Clear Waters,""  which is just too darn goofy.  (Is she related to Muddy Waters? HA!HA!  I'm on fire!)  There is a William and a Valerie in the film, and ""Billy"" and ""Val"" are credited as their nicknames. Did they really need to explain THAT?  It's not like I was sitting though the whole movie going, ""Now are Valerie and Val the same person?  How can that be?""<br/><br/>Another problem I had was the title.  It's redundant.  Is there any kind of destinations other than final ones?  (Oh!  What a minute.  That's back to the dark ironic twist thing again, isn't it?  Wow! Zing!  That went way over my head!)<br/><br/>I won't waste our time going into the plot of even bother rating this move... I loathe it too much.

","When I first heard about Final Destination, I found the premise intriguing. Death stalking it's victims, unseen terror.  I actually saw it hoping that it would be an elevation above the teen horror flick genre.  Hope as I might, the burst into flames as quickly as the plane that sets up this cliche ridden, badly written, and horribly acted film.  Alex Browning is journeying with his classmates on a year end trip to Paris.  The movie opens admirably, despite several predictable moments (Alex's father saying ""Live it up, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you"", when thunder suddenly booms in the background and ominous notes take over.  We are introduced to all the key characters at the airport, several creepy, morbid kids who would benefit from psychological counselling.  Anyway, as Alex boards the plane, he falls asleep and is struck by a extremely vivid (and frightening) vision of the plan exploding.  When he causes a ruckus, Alex and several other members of his class are forced off.  Upon takeoff, guess what happens. The plane explodes, leaving the seven survivors to mourn for the two-hundred and eighty killed.  Now the idiocy begins.  Toilet water chases people through their houses, knives fly, kitchens explode, small sheet metal becomes deadly, decapitating flying blades.  James Wong, who did several X-Files episodes, obviously hoped to capitalize on this original idea of seven people who have cheated death, and have angered the cosmic existance.  But he is a rookie, and, though their is no boogeyman, the deaths of several expendable students are completely cliched.  The acting is forced, Devon Sawa and Ali Larter prove incapable of evoking sympathy, and Tony Todd as the death-obsessed mortician, is almost painful to watch.  However, challenging the acting for the statuette of 'pointless endeavour' is the writing.  Idiotic sick jokes fall flat, mindless murders grow tedious, and embarassingly bad lines pervade this film.  The stupid psychobabble makes the story seem incredibly corny, while an abyssmal ending, attempting black comedy, mares any chance of redemption.  A good outline for movie, but nothing more.

Some special effects were nice but I bet the higher the rating on imdb.com the lower the age of the voter. Hopefully those highschool-films will soon reach their final destination."

","I don't want to sit down here and type out the premise of the movie, because it's been done already.  What I would like to mention is that people seem to overlook this one: Morgan & Wong, yes, worked on The X-Files, but they also wrote and directed many episodes of Chris Carter's Millennium - a TV series that ran three seasons on Fox, which in my opinion was much better and scarier than The X-Files. In fact it was the best of Television ever, nothing comes close.<br/><br/>If you liked Final Destination, definitely check out Millennium (running in syndication on the FX channel).  Episodes: ""The Fourth Horseman"" and ""The Time is Now"" are very much in the vein of FD.  Because of the gore and intensity they brought to the show, I thought for sure it was going to be thrown off the air immediately.  Luckily it lasted for a bit longer.<br/><br/>
Morgan and Wong don't pull any punches.<br/><br/>My only criticism is their inaccurate depiction of the Hare Krishna devotee in the airport.  They're actually good people, but are depicted as brain dead psychos.  And Morgan and Wong do this every opportunity they get when they have a story in the airport.  Ha.  Oh well . . ."

The acting wasn't as bad as the story, but no amount of Hollywood talent could have made this film worthwhile unless it had been written as a comedy.<br/><br/>The film presents Death as so methodical and swift, but so many times that all of the people who walked off the plane before it crashed are grouped together, Death is taking a breather, apparently! I mean, for cryin' out loud! At least 39 days have passed before Death even decides to take care of his unfinished business!<br/><br/>As for the ending, I have to wonder if the writers hadn't been watching some Road Runner cartoons as they wrote it! If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>So many people have praised this film for being original. But in my opinion, it borrows much from ""The Frighteners,"" a horror/comedy from a few years back. If you want to see a film with someone dealing with Death in a decent horror/comedy context, I'd highly recommend watching ""The Frighteners"" instead of ""Final Destination.""<br/><br/>I suppose if you want a good ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type of laugh-fest, ""Final Destination"" might be the sort of movie for you.

","Final Destination does not know what it wants to be. It lacks coherency and direction and whenever it doesn't know what to do, it throws in a cheap gag to help it stumble along.<br/><br/>The crux of the problem with this abysmal farce is that instead of using a vaguely interesting concept (without ruining too much, something to do with 'the grand scheme of life', fate, etc.) to create an truly original flick it gets trapped in the Hollywood machine and therefore has to spoon feed the viewer, e.g. by making death into Death, i.e. a new baddie like freddie kruger, jason, leatherface, etc. Here, Death is made almost human so that the dumb viewer can grasp who the baddie is - pathetic and insulting.<br/><br/>Needless to say that the characters and acting are awful. Yet another generation of third rate zitty teenage actors of the worst kind. The acting is so poor its not even amusing in the most camp B-movie attractiveness kind of way possible.

The plane explodes and then fate picks off each of the survivors one by one to balance the books so to speak.

","This first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.<br/><br/>I've seen all five of the currently five-film franchise, but they each tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of filmmaking, technically speaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.<br/><br/>This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there's Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.<br/><br/>For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.<br/><br/>The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I'd give ""Final Destination"" a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the 'exciting' things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.<br/><br/>The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (6.5/10)"

The characters too simplistic and one-dimensional, you have different character types that maintain the same thought process throughout the film. Alex has Ali Larter's character in love with him, a young guy who's seen looking at his penthouse magazine, yet never once wavers from thinking about death's design. There are also too many coincidences. They all happen to be at a certain place at the same time, or Billy riding his bike by when Alex's running out and why did he not warn the FBI that Valerie was next instead of just standing outside her house. The slow build up excellent, dealing with the deaths of those on the plane and the death scenes of those before they know it's coming. Though once it gets down to the last four and they know they're next, it's not as interesting. X-Files writers Wong and Morgan, use quite a few actors that appeared once or twice on the show."

","'FINAL DESTINATION' was directed by James Wong and stars Devon Sawa, Ali Larter and Kerr Smith. ​After a student(Devon Sawa) visions the plane he's about to board explode, he throws a fit and gets him and a group of his friends kicked of the flight. Second into the air, the plane explodes. All seems fine but when the survivors begin getting knocked off one by one, they must band together to discover the truth.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a genuinely frightening and scary experience - you WILL be disappointed. This movie is more comedic than anything. I laughed so much more than I felt frightened. Now I think about it, I wasn't frightened at all. I wasn't even disturbed by the deaths. It was all just kind of dull. Watch this movie if you're drinking with friends because you will have a laugh, just don't watch it if you're looking for a horror movie.<br/><br/>I really like the gimmick of this movie. It's pretty interesting and I would love to see it be explored more, with a different cast and director. The actual story itself was very poorly written. Character's are stupid and this makes it very hard to care about them. A lot of the things that happen in this movie make no sense and the deaths itself contain no logic behind them. I understand they tried to excuse it but there should still be logic and setup to each kill to justify it. Maybe even include red herrings; keep the viewer guessing. Another flaw with the deaths is how generic and boring they are. Needless gore and violence is the one thing I would remove from movies today if I could; it's sick and never works. That said, I would have actually liked to see more creativity and thought put into the deaths. Keep it comic violence and make the movie a full blown comedy; that'd be fun.<br/><br/>The only performance in this movie that wasn't completely robotic and forgettable was Kristen Cloke as Valerie Lewton. Even that performance was just barely passable. The rest of the acting was pathetic. Devon Sawa was shocking, Ali Larter was abysmal, Kerr Smith tried but failed - no one impressed me and only one person barely escaped my scold. Every movie like this were the cast are getting picked off one by one needs to include likable characters to make me want them to live or an interesting antagonist to make the deaths interesting. This movie succeeds at neither. The characters are dull, bland and forgettable, and the antagonist(I won't spoil it) doesn't appear for the entirety of the movie. This lack of good characters makes me actively dislike the characters and means I don't care if they die which means I have lesser interest in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie hit the trifecta of trashy cinematography. It was badly lit, shot and edited. Nothing in this movie is technically proficient. The effects are also atrocious. I don't care if it was made in the year 2000, realistic dinosaurs were made in 1993.<br/><br/>This movie was not at all frightening(if anything, it was comedic). I laughed a lot in this movie due to the clichés and lack of genuinely frightening moments. There is a scene towards the end were I should have been on the edge of my seat but I was on the verge of crying with laughter. For what this movie is attempting to do, it fails. But for sheer entertainment value, I'll recommend this movie. Watch it with some friends. I'll rate it 3 Expert Getaway Strategies out of 10."

Over all it was a very solid film with cool deaths and good story even though it kind of glosses over how Alex stays alive after sacrificing himself for Clear (and honestly I'm surprised Alex, Clear and Carter stayed alive for 6 months with death being so eager to kill off everyone who survived the plane crash). But apart from the coincidences and the weird 'Alex sacrifices himself but doesn't' thing it's a very good film which is well worth a watch!"

","Final Destination began out as rather thrilling Scream clone in the late 90s. It just seems like a Scream clone, all the actors are pretty boys and girls from the WB like Urban Legend, Cursed, Dracula 2000, all those Scream sequels. But there is a level of intelligence involve in this, instead of another masked killer, we have a force of nature. A thing that can't be seen that comes calling to take teens to the grave. Death. A force more powerful that a psychotic killer or even Dracula. That marks a difference from many other of it's Scream-like brethren. It's more original, and it spends more time talking philosophy with teens about Death and fate then the other entries in this franchise did. The series honestly became more of a slasher as it went along, which is OK, but certainly lost some of the great aspects of the first one. It's also ironic that this is the least gory one of the series, though still squirm worthy and horrific in it's deaths."
"taylorkingston","10","1","1","18 October 2014"," Such a great movie...
","I love this movie. It's so inventive and creative. It has so much imagination put into it. And I love the idea that the killer isn't a random man with a machete, or anything like that. The killer is Death itself. It makes for a much more interesting watch.<br/><br/>In this movie, Alex Browning and his friends are all going to France on a school trip. But before take off, Alex has a vision that the plane will take off like normal, and then explode. We see his vision and it is very graphic, which I liked. He starts screaming, and tries to get off the plane. He gets in a fight with a fellow student, and is kicked off, and a few others follow him. Some because they are his friends or teachers, and some because they believe him. He and his friends are told they aren't allowed to re-board. So they watch the plane take off. Then, just like in Alex's vision, the plane explodes. Everyone thinks Alex had something to do with it. Could be a terrorist plot. But it's not. Over the next few weeks, all of the survivors, who got off the plan, start dying mysterious deaths. Alex and Clear, one of the passengers who believed him, find out that Death is killing them one by one, in the order they would have, if they hadn't gotten off the plane. They try to find a way to stay alive, but does it work? For now. They find out that if they interrupt someones death, then it skips that person and goes to the next on the list. And it works, until they realize that it's going to come back around.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","2 June 2014"," Just go there already!
","My prerequisite for a horror movie is pretty simple: Did it scare me?. Most horror movies don't reach that goal but 'Final Destination' contains three scenes that had me gripping the armrests of my chair.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a high school kid named Alex (Devon Sawa) who is about to head off to Paris with his senior class. He has a vision that the plane is about to go down in flames. This leads to the first of the scary scenes. The side of the plane explodes with some of the passengers screaming as their seats get sucked out into the night sky and the flames burn everyone else alive.<br/><br/>He awakes to find that it was a dream and begins screaming that he has to get off. Well, a handful of them are spared and as they stand in the airport lobby arguing the plane explodes in mid-air. The way that shot is handled is ingenious: We see a wideshot of the window inside the airport with the actors at the bottom of the screen arguing and the explosion happens in the top left corner of the screen. This is one of the most effectively scary plane crashes that I have seen in a movie.<br/><br/>After the death of one of the survivors Alex begins to sense that there is a pattern. An undertaker (played over-the-top by Tony Todd) informs him that there is in fact a pattern that death takes. Now Alex can figure out how the rest of the survivors are going to die. Preventing their deaths isn't going to be so easy since the FBI is breathing down his neck and every time he fails to save someone, it looks like he did it.<br/><br/>The plot as you may have surmised is completely stupid. We see what will happen a mile away and some of Alex's reactions are completely out of context (If you had just seen someone decapitated, would you start yelling about your theory of death?).<br/><br/>What works are the scary moments. The plane crash is the scariest part of the movie and there is knuckle-biting scene involving a car stalled on the railroad tracks that had most moviegoers peering through their fingers. But for me, there is a moment that was a complete shock, a moment when a character is casually talking and dies as suddenly as a light going off. Those moments make the movie worth seeing. 'Final Destination' isn't a great film but it met my scare quotient. This is workable junk food cinema from a genre that is usually as bland as a junk food wrapper."
"Rickting","8","1","1","19 February 2014"," My guilty pleasure
","Final Destination is one of the only badly reviewed films I like, and among with its sequels it is my guilty pleasure. It concerns a student who foresees a plane crash and gets himself and 6 others off the plane, before a month later death starts coming after them in freak accidents and they have to work out how to stop death. That might be the best horror movie premise ever, and while the final product is a mixed bag it's never boring. Final Destination doesn't care about those who aren't horror fans and therefore some of the most important film elements such as acting and writing are neglected. In terms of acting, Devon Sawa gives one of the best performances of the series; Tony Todd steals the show as the creepy mortician and Sean William Scott adds some comic relief to the film but many of the other performances certainly aren't stellar. The script is the most developed and character driven of the franchise, but it's still not a great screenplay. Despite it's amazing premise, FD doesn't take the premise as far as it should and if it had done this it might have reduced the need for the now somewhat excessive stream of sequels.<br/><br/>What people forget about FD is that despite not being scary (Then again, neither is Carrie or The Wicker Man but they're still fantastic) it is menacing, suspenseful, eerie and well directed. There is a sustained sense of intrigue throughout, and it holds up very well on multiple viewings. FD is not so much a film as a spooky, deliriously enjoyable and gleefully silly fun fair ghost train attraction, and it speeds through its eerie visuals, tense disaster sequences and Gothic thrills with admirable enthusiasm. Despite some less than great CGI, the plane crash is awesome, and the bus death scene is truly shocking and unexpected. The finale with Clear Rivers (Portrayed in an overly understated manner by Ali Larter) is also very tense, although the ending feels more routine. FD is a very fun horror film and I still hugely enjoy it although more as an enjoyable thrill ride rather than a work of actual quality.

","Alex (Devon Sawa) is going to France on a school trip. He falls asleep and has a vivid dream where everyone dies in a fiery crash. It's so vivid that he freaks out and gets thrown off the plane with many of his fellow students. The plane actually explodes and those people seem to escape death. Only something is hunting them down one at a time.<br/><br/>It's a great original concept. However it doesn't lend itself to being filmed in a compelling way. Basically weird things happen and everybody dies. There isn't a crazy manic. The kids aren't trying to outrun somebody. Death is invisible. That's the whole point. It's just one weird death after another. There's something much more visceral about an axe murderer gutting his young nubile victims."

","In this John Hughes movie gone to hell, a French Class en route for Paris for an end of the year trip is ill-fated by the unpreventable plane crash, which will kill all aboard. But few are sparred from the flight, after teenager Alex Browning has a premonition of the deadly flight. They rejoice in their luck, but soon, Death soon sets out to collect the souls who evaded their ending, now they must figure out how to evade his gruesome agenda. <br/><br/>Inspired by an actual case, in which a Mother called her daughter, the day before her flight, saying that she had suffered a dream depicting the crash. Concerned for her mother, the daughter rescheduled her flight,and as fate would have it, the plane crashed shortly after takeoff. <br/><br/>I like to think of this movie like The Twilight Zone movie, just a hell of a lot more bloody! The Hitchcockian feel to it adds more pleasure to the film's experience. I will admit, I rarely watch horror films, mainly because over time, they've become an overdone, generic work after another, when I do watch something that meets the term horror, it's usually psychological or a murder mystery, take for instance ""And Then There Were None"". But, sometimes I will build up the bravery to sit through them, and most of the time, I am pleased with what I see. Luckily, this was one of the films that I enjoyed! <br/><br/>The best part of the film's franchise is the Rube Goldberg-esque death scenes, as the series progresses, these become more creatively done, in this feature, the most creative death was the one that took place at a restaurant. But this being the first film, I give it a pass! But, like most franchises,the greatness dies off. <br/><br/>I've heard through recent reviews that the 5th installment was actually the best, all ignorance to the 4th chapter, which was said to be the dullest out of the series, agreeably amongst all fans and critics. But, I have yet to see 4 and 5, as I have only seen 1 -3, as I am not too much of a horror fan! Out of all the films, I have to say that this has the best acting, directing, and writing. <br/><br/>I give the film an 8.5/10 ticket stub. The perfect Halloween film, just make sure for the love of God that there are no children in the room, and fare warning, if you had some near death experience in the past few days, this may not be of fare mind to you!"

","After watching Final Destination 5 I set out to buy this one & others!<br/><br/>After watching this one I thought it was very well put together! It really gives you the best idea as to what the film & cheating death means (which I never knew before watching the franchise). <br/><br/>Alex Browning has a premonition of a plane explosion & panics & gets off with 6 others including a teacher. Only for the incident to to place for real! Then a month goes by with the police & people growing suspicious of Alex then afterwards Death starts pursuing those who cheated their fates by manipulating the environments in deadly ways in order to kill them in the order they should die in. Alex gets accused/blamed for each death & his friends grow increasingly suspicious of him & think he has something to do with them all (including the plane explosion) & start avoiding him! <br/><br/>The first few deaths I liked Todd Wagner's strangulation in the bathtub was well done as well as Mrs. Lewtons Kitchen death. With the kitchen knifes impaling her in the chest.<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like were how the deaths progressed throughout the film. Such as Clears death scene how there was just no build ups to the death scene & how ridiculously it was done with the pool & the blowing winds! I would have preferred them to be like Todd's Death or even Valerie's death. Where it's takes place in a single place or room etc with objects about.<br/><br/>But overall despite the milked exaggeration here & there it was a pretty good concept for a Teen Horror Film!<br/><br/>7/10"

","The word 'original' gets thrown around a lot in film criticism but 'Final Destination' is a truly original and devilishly inventive horror film. It is clever and unusual and the young cast is likable and play their roles well.<br/><br/>Seated upon a plane which is about to take off for Paris, France, young Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a terrifying premonition in which he and his group of fellow students and teachers are killed when the plane explodes shortly after takeoff. Understandably, he flips out, and his resulting panic causes him and a small group of his friends and one of their teachers to be thrown off the flight. Mere minutes later, they watch in horror, shock, and disbelief, as Alex's premonition comes true and the plane does, indeed, explode.<br/><br/>But, it turns out that they are not quite so lucky as they think. They soon learn that Death will not be cheated of their lives so easily and before long that terrible spectre is hunting them down, one by one, and killing them in a series of what appear to be bizarre accidents. Can Alex figure out Death's design before it is too late?<br/><br/>The deaths in this film are cleverly put together and staged, and quite violent at times. There is a macabre kind of fun to be had in trying to figure out who will be next to fall beneath Death's merciless scythe. Another really neat thing about this film is that most of the main characters have surnames which reference great classic horror actors, directors, and producers. This is a really nice touch.<br/><br/>'Final Destination' is intelligently written and surely has one of the coolest final shots in film history. It is no surprise that the film has turned into a profitable franchise for its studio, New Line. What is a surprise is that the sequels are actually pretty good and they always kick off with an exceptionally well-staged catastrophe which sets the scene for what is to follow.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of horror, then 'Final Destination' should definitely be a part of your flight plan!"

","The plot = Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) along with his classmates are about to take a school trip to Paris, but Alex has a premonition that the plane crashes, so he and a handful of people leave the plane, it crashes, thinking that they've escaped near death, an unseen force known as death starts killing off the survivors one by one.<br/><br/>I remember going to see this movie in the cinema many years ago and never thought that this would start off a franchise. ""Final Destination"" is a really good movie and gives an almost entirely original concept. An unseen killing force known as death killing off the teens with tragic and nasty accidents. Okay I wasn't sold on the idea at first, as I'm old fashioned and prefer a straight up standard slasher, but when I saw this movie, I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Coming out at a time when the second slasher boom was starting to wane, ""Final Destination"" breathed new life into the genre. Okay it's a little slow to start off, but as it goes on it really kicks in and doesn't become predictable as the death scenes are accidents and could really happen making it suspenseful.<br/><br/>Another aspect that works is the cast, all of which give really good performances, not a bad one in sight which again is really rare in these types of movies. Devon Sawa was excellent as the lead, he manages to be sympathetic and convincing at the same time, pity he never did quite become a star after this. Ali Larter gives a well rounded performance as the female lead and plus has great chemistry with Devon Sawa. Kerr Smith plays the asshole jock really well. Kristen Cloke plays the teacher really well and makes you feel for her when her time comes, she should have had more screen time and Tony Todd was genuinely creepy in his small cameo role, it's always fun to see him in anything.<br/><br/>All in all A really good movie with an original idea that works for a change and an excellent cast really sums it up."

","I can't believe this film is 11 years old. This must be one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've ever had, and certainly one of the most memorable. Being 15 and seeing these cartoon death scenes in live action with gratuitous gore was awesome. I've decided to revisit the franchise and this film still holds up. There's great build up towards the opening disaster. It's filled with dread, even after having seen it so many times. The film is brilliant in that death is an unseen entity, you can't outrun it. As the death toll increases, the paranoia sets in. It also has some excellent moments of comedy without ever getting so stupid. Most importantly, we can actually care for some of these characters. They are not kept in this insular vacuum either. The FBI do take notice, but aren't trying to terrify these kids. It's weird, funny, and a little frightening. Perfect late night entertainment."

","One minute, you seeing in your own vision that something terrified is going to happen to the airplane after takeoff. Then, suddenly, it happens in real life.

From the first half-hour, you know that you're in for a different kind of thriller.<br/><br/>After the explosion, Death starts a design that leads to some deaths of the crash's survivors. One of the survivors, Alex {Devon Sawa} tries to figure out who get killed next and to stop and cheat Death. This is really one of those times to put your brain off logic and on focusing on what really happens next.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa is intelligent and not afraid as Alex and Ali Larter's performance as Clear is full of anguish. Plus, little comic support is provided by Chad Donella as Alex's pal, Tod.<br/><br/>James Hong's direction is intense and scary when it really needs to be. The smart script makes the viewer to keep guessing until the very end. The late Shirley Walker's score is chilling and reminds me of the old scores in the films of Hitchcock. The effects help give the death scenes a shiver to the body and bone as well as a shock to the mind. The final showdown and surprise ending has the same feeling as well.<br/><br/>The film gives a perfect after movie discussion for the question of ""what happens if or when we die?"" It even shows why the later sequels didn't have a heart and mind. Because the film was and always has been an original. This is one of the scariest movies out there and a perfect Halloween film.

I remember it giving me nightmares when I was a kid. This was my fav horrors as a kid but it still holds up pretty nicely and it was the time I was introduced to Ali Larter.

"StevePulaski","9","1","1","10 August 2011"," Might have you yelling ""oooh,"" ""oh!,"" and other things at the screen
","What makes Final Destination rise above other films of its horror genre is there is no designated killer. It's all just a series of ""accidents"" triggered by an non-present force. It's crafty, campy, and of a different breed. It's smart, stylistic, without being too over-the-top. The only scene I can think of in this film that pushes the limit is the scene where one person is strangled to death. It's clear the screenwriter pondered on how force can strangle someone.<br/><br/>This is another horror film where you don't know how to feel when watching it. Tense? Scared? Freaked? Sadistic? Excited? When I saw this film, around the age of seven, I was nothing but amazed. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was making these things fall and what was leading these people to die. When I watched movies, up until around ten, I truly didn't pay attention to any dialog (odd now how I brutally critique films that lack it), I just went along for the ride.<br/><br/>Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a class trip on a red-eye flight to Paris. Just before take-off, Alex has a brutal premonition where the plane explodes, and everyone dies. Upon awakening, Alex, like anyone, is freaked out and his panic causes classmates an orphan Clear (Larter), his bestfriend Tod (Donella), the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Cloke), his rival Carter (Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Detmer) and goof-off Billy (Scott).<br/><br/>Sure enough, the plane explodes in a fiery burst killing everyone. Alex, now realizes, he has an unprecedented ability to vision an accident before it occurs. Now, the people who made the lucky attempt to get off, and dodge death, are now killed off one by one in the order they would've died on the plane. The order I won't spoil because they explain it thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) in the film.<br/><br/>Over the years, the dialog in this film has gotten more attention by me. First it was about the deaths, then I listened to information that was around the deaths (like a few minutes before it would happen), then I would go crazy researching the film to get every pinpoint detail on the film before going back to watching it with my undivided attention. I was a mess. I loved the film. I loved every frame of it. Loved its dare to be different style of film-making, and loved every character, even the antagonist bully.<br/><br/>There are some movies you can't put a price on and Final Destination is the one for me. Despite its questionable premise, it tackles it in a fantastic, and enjoyable manor. It doesn't get too comical (you can save that for the fourth film), and even though you could see sequels in the film's headlights, you anticipate them to be just as good as the first if the film sticks to its formula, limits its comedy, and has believable, realistic deaths.<br/><br/>Starring: Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kristen Cloke, Kerr Smith, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer, and Tony Todd. Directed by: James Wong."

I thought that the deaths were OK but not as inventive as some of the others. I'll be honest, before seeing this I thought that it would be way more gory than it actually was. I wont deny it did make my toes curl when billy got half his head cut off but that was the only one I thought was particularly bad.

","In an agethe late 1990s and early 2000sof the horror revamp (thanks, Scream) comes one of the most clever and original horror/slashers to date: Final Destination. In fact, it was so smart, it was a slasher without a slasher and the main enemy/culprit that you won't see.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the character of ""Death"" has been mocked pretty heavily, thanks mostly to Family Guy, but here, it's not so nice. Sly, but fair. Invisible, but present.<br/><br/>A high school class is headed for 10 days to Paris, only ""nobody"" Alex (Sawa) has a pretty descript vision of their plane not making it a few hundred yards, let alone across the world. Awaking, and he really does, his outburst causes some of his peers and one teacher to deplane only to watch his premonition come true before their eyes. And, the FBI gets involved, thinking Alex has something to do with the explosion.<br/><br/>Picture it: the year was 2000. The date of release: 3/17/00. Just think if this movie would've been delayed another year and a half. Or even then, if it would be released at all.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, each of the survivors are naturally freaked, and when they ""mysteriously"" die one by one, Alex relies on his newly found intuition to solve the reasons of the deaths while heavily relying on Clear Rivers (Larter) – love that name, by the way – and Bludworth (Tony Todd of Candyman fame– the perfect choice for the undertaker.)<br/><br/>Apparently, there's a pattern, a new one, that is, since Alex stepped in Death's way. Is that a role you'd like to take? Or would you be able to double dip in saving the survivor's lives?<br/><br/>The movie, though a little hokey at times, is nearly brilliant for what it is. I remember shouting out, when it first came out, ""FINALLY,"" an intelligent horror movie. A thinker. And with a great cast. I would soon grow to love (yeah, I mean LOVE) Ali Larter, although the rest of the cast did what they needed to accomplish. Even Seann ""Stifler"" William Scott down played his typical over-the-top performance – but not by too much.<br/><br/>The movie was equally shot well, had well-thought out ""death-by-accident"" scenes and a good soundtrack/score. It's not too deep, but its fun and quick and tight – what all horror movies should be. Also, it was refreshing to see that the absence of sex, nudity and excessive amount of gore can still drive/sell a ""teen"" horror movie.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, if you haven't already partaken in Death's plan."

","Well, ""Final Destination"" deserves a good review for many aspects. It's originality, entertainment and philosophical thoughts. I personally began being fascinated with death and its similarities after a car accident, where me and my three friends didn't even get hurt. Our car went upside down and we didn't get even a scratch, which made me reflect about life for months. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing this movie for long time expecting it to deal with death, destiny and human will for survival, and it did exactly as I wanted to. I don't believe in such things as design and so, but a good movie like this one makes you reflect that it could exist. And if it exists, we will surely fight for ours lives.<br/><br/>I thought the ending was a little silly, but the movie made up for this."

It is simple and basic, mainly about these teenagers trying to escape a horrible encounter with death himself or itself. Because death can come in so many mysterious ways that can't be explained by science or common sense. I loved all the deaths it reminded me of a show now on TV called 1000 ways to die. It displays and explains how a person died in such a mysterious way or a bizarre way that some people can't describe it or won't believe it at first thought. The deaths were phenomenal and so unbelievable that I can't describe it or anyone else cannot do it. I really thought that the first scene on the plane was pretty good because you would never suspect a plane exploding or splitting it 2 ways it is so phenomenal and so unusual to learn and to process throughout the brain and the mind. I really thought that the last scene when the 3 teens are in Paris when the sign on a store or hotel comes swooping down and hits the teen who questions who is next to die on death's list and who will be saved. That scared me and I am like there had better be a sequel to this film and it better be as good as this one!

James Wong did a good job directing.  His style is far from innovative, but it provides the film with a nice tone.  The screenplay could have went better.  Though better than an average example, FD still suffers from lack of character developement and some mediocre dialogue.  There are far worse examples in the genre, though.  The acting was also good.  Ali Larter was the only one I really didn't care for.  She just seemed rather uninterested in what she was doing.  There really wasn't that many parts I found to be particularly suspenseful or scary, though they will keep you from slipping off into boredom.  The final 15 minutes or so was also rather dull. <br/><br/>A good example of later teen horror films.  There are evident negative elements, but there are some good ones too.  If you don't take yourself too seriously, you should find it at least decent.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>* * 1/2/ * * * *"
"tripwires","Null","1","1","6 July 2003"," Silly and unintentionally hilarious
","When this movie was screened at a movie marathon held in my school I laughed out loud, garnering me a few weird stares from my fellow schoolmates, who were actually pretty terrified by the nonsense that was going on on-screen. I laughed for that reason too, but more importantly, I found this movie extremely hilarious.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is my sadistic sense of humour, I don't know, but it's funny how the producers of this stupid, brainless ""horror"" movie could think of such creative ways to kill off their irritating characters whom nobody really care about. A good example would be the death of the teacher, whatever her name is. That scene nearly killed me, pun fully intended, especially when she needed help to actually get herself totally killed.<br/><br/>
""Final Destination"" had a great premise. It just had an extremely lousy and predictable execution. What could've been a truly terrifying movie about the inevitability of death and the suffering one goes through living with that knowledge became a rehashed, one-dimensional joke of a movie that had elements of previously and equally bad slasher movies in it. Its greatest flaw was its cardboard cut-out characters. With the exception of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter, the cast looked like they were picked from unwanted extras who failed to make it to the latest teenage flick. The characters irritated the living bejesus out of me because they were whining so much that I just wanted them to get killed already and put me out of my agony of watching such stupidity. The jock was predictably cocky, his girlfriend predictably bitchy, and the rest of them? Don't even remember.<br/><br/>The only good part about the movie is Devon Sawa and Ali Larter. Sawa is a good actor whose talent was wasted on playing a silly character, while Larter, whom I've never seen before prior to this, was surprisingly convincing as Clear Rivers (""Clear""? What kind of a name is CLEAR?!). She was pleasantly understated and provided a nice break from Alex's perpetual high-strungness, so to speak. The chemistry between them also helped to make the love angle that just HAD to be present a tad less sickening.<br/><br/>
Still, it was obvious that this movie existed for no reason other than to rake in the cash at the box office, which should explain the extreme gore factor. Somebody should tell the producers that sometimes, the thing that scares most is not what one can see, but what one cannot see. Our imagination is a powerful tool. They should learn to make use of it."
"squeezebox","Null","1","1","9 April 2003"," Great idea completely wasted
","A really eerie, intelligent, disturbing movie could have been made with this story.  A group of people get off a plane at the last second because one person has a horrifying premonition of death; after they've gotten off, the plane does indeed crash.  However, they were SUPPOSED to die as well, and since they haven't, Death, a living, conscious entity, is going to find them and finish the job.  Sounds like a great idea, huh?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in the wake of SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and URBAN LEGEND, the producers decided they'd make more money with a movie directed at stupid teeny-boppers than intelligent viewers.  The dialogue is plagued by the usual self-conscious SCREAM-like in-jokes, hip young (i.e. obnoxious, good-looking) characters and plot holes you could drive a semi through.<br/><br/>There are a couple of decent scenes.  A scene in which a boy slips and gets entangled by the shower curtain cord until he chokes to death is effectively grotesque, and a sequence in which the main character locks himself in a cabin to escape Death is well done.  But the rest of the movie is as predictable, obvious and boring as any other post-SCREAM teen horror flick. The main character becomes a suspect in the deaths, a love interest develops between him and a female survivor (WOW, now there's a surprise), and, of course, there's the obligatory twist ending, which anyone who's seen more then one horror movie will see coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>Followed by an equally idiotic sequel.  ""Not dying when we were supposed to caused a rift in death's design.""  WHO THE HELL TALKS LIKE THAT?????????????"
"clark-39","Null","1","1","29 January 2003"," Innovative movie wasted on teen audience.
","In Final Destination the characters are all out to keep Death itself from finishing them off since they are supposed to have died anyways in a plane crash. Eerie premonitions, a plot that holds much potential, and a great atmosphere...all gone down the drain with the teen horror garbage. Instead of highly executed characters and a little more fleshing out, the film wastes everything to feed this thing to the gore-hungry teen audience. The issues of death and all its aftershocks could have been buttered up into a better movie overall if the studio had not cast a teen audience and set it among a high school crowd. For the benefit of the doubt there is one cardboard adult character who doesn't make it very long. The opening is flavored with enough eerie fingerfood to make you think you're in for a treat. But as soon as the plane goes kaboom, so does the film. After that, we look forward to whiny teens running around while Death hunts them down in more and more ridiculous ways. Take away the dressy plot and it boils down to nothing more than another slasher. We wait on end while the cast drops one by one. Actually, the death scenes are not the problem, it's the way they are set up and what's in between all the messiness. The characters who don't make it all die fascinating deaths. I use fascinating in the sense that a simple turn of events, the smallest detail, sets off a chain reaction that leads to a very bizarre ending for the unlucky survivors. Death never looked so stylish. Hell, these deaths are downright classy and sleek. Death in this film is like the shiny silver on the blade of a knife. But for all the eye-candy, the holes need to be covered up better. For one thing, why does the main character Alex have a premonition in the first place? Just so Death can play cat-and-mouse? And what's with the stock characters? It's really sad because beneath it's teen horror goofiness are the blueprints for a fine film. All they had to do was scrape off all the bubble gum. The film reaches heights when it deals with the survivors reactions to all the stuff happening to them, and their view on Death. The film touches on loneliness, fear, and rejection. A character study begun and not finished. In the end, it is all swept away for the Clearasil crowd."
"unreconstructed","6","1","1","3 February 2003"," Better than average, that's about it: 6/10
","The downfall of this movie begins when two of the teenagers break into a morgue to visit the corpse of a dead friend. They are met there by a really bad plot device in the guise of a mortician. Morticians are expected to have coarsened sensibilities due to working alongside death every day and maybe a little eccentric as well, but this one is way over the top. Of course, he's not there as a real character but rather as a means to give away the plot along with any lingering mystery still contained in the movie. How he knows what he knows we dare not ask, we're just supposed to accept that someone who deals with corpses on a regular basis has a deep metaphysical insight into how death operates. Not only that, he also knows the precise predicament that the teenagers are in even though he's never met them. His only real function is to trim some time from the movie's length so that the real characters don't have to expend any excess energy discovering what they're up against.     I guess the other thing I didn't like about the movie was the ""teenage twist"" factor contained in the movie's ending. You know how it goes: the supernatural or fate, in this case, must play by certain rules so that the movie will seem more like a game to the target audience, mainly teenagers. But rules are kind of constraining and predictable, even to teenagers, so the movie sets up a false ending that's not really the ending because there's one more act to the game before it's over. Most recently the movie ""The Ring"" did this false ending along with countless others before it.<br/><br/>    To be honest, the movie overall is inferior to a decent X-Files episode. For example, the FBI agents just do not command respect; somehow they lack the deadly seriousness portrayed so well in that series. The victims in the movie are dispatched in particularly gruesome ways and although some are very effective in jolting the viewer it does give one the feeling you're watching a teen slasher movie with an invisible diabolical John Denver working in place of Freddy or Jason. I'm really kind of disappointed that Morgan and Wong didn't do a better job given their extensive background with the X-Files."

There many plot holes and the script is poor at best. What's just as bad is most of the characters are just bone heads. On the positive side there are some dramatic scenes that are exciting and original that leave you somewhat satisfied after the fact. However, those can't quite make up for it's faults.

"Skippy-60","9","1","1","23 March 2000"," GO EXPERIENCE THIS FILM!!!
","WARNING:  This review contains SPOLIERS!<br/><br/>Not in a long time has a movie ""stayed"" with me long after I left the theatre.  I saw it a week ago, and I still think about it everyday, and the questions it poses.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you probably already know what FINAL DESTINATION is about. But I'll cover the bases anyway. A student named Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a dream about a plane that he and his french class are on exploding in mid air.  When he wakes up, things start happening just as they had in the dream.  Alex freaks out, and is removed from the plane, along with five other classmates and a teacher.  As these seven are grounded, their classmates are Paris bound, and everyone is mad at Alex for disrupting their plans.  But lo and behold, as the seven (and the audience) watch in horror, the plane they have just left explodes shortly after takeoff.  The rest of the story is like this:  they cheated death.  Now death has to come back and finished what he started.<br/><br/>Now that I've set you all up, here is my personal review.  In one word: WOW!!.  Sure the plot may sound a bit cheesy, but believe me, this film is one heck of a roller coaster ride.  The first twenty minutes will hold you breathless as you await the inevitable plane crash.  After that happens, the film sustains the gloom created from the disaster, adding creepiness to the mix because you never know what's going to happen next.  Who will die next? And how?  The movie hints at how the people will die, but it's not until after the fact that you say ""oh, so THAT'S what they meant by that image!""<br/><br/>Speaking of images, this movie is filled with images you won't get out of your head for a while.  The horrific plane explosion is just one of many. The writing is such that you actually care for these characters, so when one of them dies, you feel a sense of shock and sadness.  And acting wise, the cast does a great job of showing us that what is happening is real to them. Sawa is terrific as the one who knows deaths design and must convince everyone else, and Ali Larter (who's great in everthing she does) is extraordinary at showing us the human factor of the tragedies.  I was hoping that Amanda Detmer would have more screen time, but she was unforgettable in what little role she had.  And cheers to Kerr Smith.  Not for a second did I see Jack from Dawson's Creek.  He was all Carter.<br/><br/>Even though there are some flaws in the film (you can clearly see a ""dead"" body's eyes moving) some of the explanations get confusing (at least they did to me) and some of the lines are corny, it's a wonderfully terrifying film that, on more that one occasion, made me jump out of my seat more that any film has in a LONG LONG time.  The story is an interesting idea that could have easily become a terrible B-movie, but all the writers, directors and cast bring such a maturity and sense of seriousness to it that you can't help but be engrossed by it.  And the film makes you think of your everyday life as well, making you think about what fate (and death) have in store for you. Finally!!! A ""teen"" movie that everyone can enjoy!!<br/><br/>For a great hour and a half of stunning entertainment, pay the money and see FINAL DESTINATION.<br/><br/>9/10"

"Angel-54","Null","1","1","20 March 2000"," Death is Comin 'Round
","I have read other comments on the movie final destination and there seems to be some mixed reviews. Personally I enjoyed it very much. The death scenes were quite elaborate and the plot of the story was very original. <br/><br/>With a cast of bright young actors including Devon Sawa (Idle Hands), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek), Ali Larter (Varsity Blues) and Seann William Scott (American Pie) this movie appeals to the teen generation for sure. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Alex Browning (Sawa) and his classmates boarding a plane for a class trip to France, but after Alex has a terrible vision of the plane exploding, he panics and is escorted off the plane along with several other students. Alex's vision comes true and then the horror begins. Because of Alex's actions, he and the other people have cheated death, thereby ruining Death's ""Great Plan"" and screwing up the pattern. So in order to stay alive Alex must again uses his visions to cheat death again, and by doing that he will supposedly be safe. This film has a great plot, and wonderful acting. There were however some questions that i was left with....1. Was Candyman supposed to be Death incarnate? 2. Why was Alex (Sawa) so special that only he could see the visions? Regardless of the questions left in your mind the movie really gets you thinking about death. Does Death really have a plan for all of us? Or can we change our own destinies. There are a few heart stopping moments, including one death scene that is totally unexpected. The others are kind of predictable but that is what makes it more intense,because you know what is going to happen but you watch the character go painfully slow through the events leading up to it. All in all, I thought it was an excellent movie and I would absolutely recommend it as a heart-stopping date flick....Go and see it...I give it an 8.5 out of 10."

","The problem with Final destination is the HUGE plot holes - eg whatever happened to Alex's parents in the second part?

","I have to disagree with the positive reviews. The truth is that Final Destination is irredeemably bad and isn't even comparable to the pretty average Urban Legend, let alone the wonderful Scream trilogy.<br/><br/>Final Destination, like Scream and its imitators, has people dying in a variety of gory ways that make people laugh; unlike Scream, it doesn't seem to be in on the joke that people are laughing because they're so badly executed.<br/><br/>Let's be honest: there's barely a plot, there's no humour and the special effects are pretty unremarkable. The cast is absolutely minimally talented (the guy from Dawson's Creek can't even convincingly play a one-dimensional character) and there's no attempt at character development. Plot holes are legion: if Clear Rivers's parents are both dead, who's been her legal guardian through school - and whose stuff is it that's all through her house in the background? At no point in the film do you seel sympathy for or interest in any of the characters.<br/><br/>Go and rent Scream again instead - even if you're already seen it a thousand times, it'll still be more satisfying than this vapid tosh."

"Minofed","Null","1","1","11 January 2001"," Death's Predestination
","""Final Destination"" is a riff on the Christian concept of predestination-the idea that God infallibly guides those who are destined for salvation.  In this film the idea is that all persons are infallibly predestined to die at a certain time in their life.  <br/><br/>The movie starts out promisingly.  A planeload of high school students and advisors are headed to Paris for a senior trip.  While waiting for the plane to take off, one of the students has some premonitions that they are going to crash.  He causes a commotion, and as a result six of the students and one advisor are kicked off the plane.  Then they watch in horror as the plane explodes after takeoff.<br/><br/>Most people who don't die in a plane crash go through survivor's guilt.  But because they have cheated death, the seven survivors here must instead dodge all sorts of deadly mishaps. <br/><br/>""Final Destination"" doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or not. Unlike the characters in ""Scream,"" who discuss horror film references while trying to dodge various slashers, the characters in ""Final Destination"" are not given a humorous moment.  ""Final Destination"" writers Jeffrey Reddick and Glen Morgan do name most of their characters after horror movie staples: Browning (after Tod Browning of ""Dracula"" and ""Freaks"" fame), Val Lewton (after the director of ""Cat People"") Shreck (after Max Shreck, star of ""Nosferatu"") Hitchcock, Chaney, and so on.  But my guess is the young people the film is targeting won't make the connection.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell if whatever humor the movie has is intentional or not. When death targets the characters, so many bad things happen at once that I was reminded of the character in ""Li'l Abner"" who walked around under a cloud.  The main character keeps hearing the song ""Rocky Mountain High"" (because John Denver died in a plane crash) before someone is about to die, but at the end of the song is being played by a Paris street musician-not likely.<br/><br/>In 1959 Rod Taylor starred in a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""And When the Sky Was Opened,"" as one of three astronauts who return from a trip to outer space, then discover they weren't supposed to survive.  When ""Final Destination"" began I was hoping it would move in the same direction as that episode.  Unfortunately, it doesn't."

Special effects and coincidences would do the rest. But the special effects didn't do nothing. All I noticed were some horribly irritating electricity wires flying across the screen. And despite all the coincidences, who by the way make the movie very unrealistic, the movie stays a little predictable.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes were great, the last 15 minutes sucked reeeally hard. It's just a bunch of things happening without a story: Alex escapes death for like 20 times, talks to himself about death not going to get him and stuff, and the last moment he realizes what everybody in the theater had already figured out (PLOT SPOILER:) he hadn't changed seats and it isn't his turn after all (while he had escaped death for 20 times, that doesn't make any sense) and so he runs to Clears house where things keep going wrong. The director must have said ""From this point, f**k the story, let's just have some more electricity, bad luck and everybody doing stupid things nobody else would do in their place."" If the movie had been longer like this I surely would have walked out of the theater. My God.<br/><br/>For some dumb reason, (PLOT SPOILER:) everyone survives the car that blew up and nothing happens for some months, until they go to Paris BY PLANE (40 of their friends died in an air crash and they just survived it, and a few months later they travel by plane? Hahahahahaha!) and suddenly death seems to remember them and things start to go wrong again.<br/><br/>The air crash and the first killing were great and certainly deserve a 10/10, but in the end its just such a horrible mess. 6/10"
"Hypercentury","10","1","1","29 June 2000"," This movie ROCKS!!
","I compare it to Scream, it was actually even better. The plot is completely different. It's not about a serial killer the killer is supposed to be death. That sounds  a little bit silly but it's not. The whole story is about accidents, an accident in which some persons had to die and they didn't. But ""you can't cheat death""!. The first scene is completely exciting and the last is surprising (as in every new horror movie). There were plenty of laughs and chills. I don't want to describe any of the scenes, just go on and watch this movie, It is action, it is thriller, and most of all, it is horror. It rocks! 10/10"
"BlkRose-2","7","1","1","26 June 2000"," Very disturbing
","All in all a good movie, although very disturbing especially in the fact that it is not concerned with something make-believe like werewolves or vampires but with death and fate which is beyond our control. I found Alex's vision of the plane explosion particularly disturbing, especially as I am afraid of flying and this was just so vivid and frightening. You could tell that the whole cinema was visibly shocked after this. Also, the subsequent deaths occurred as accidents which could happen to any of us!!"
"arsenal001","10","1","1","25 June 2000"," A must see for all fans of modern horror/thriller!
","This film is one of the best, most original modern horror films I've seen in a long time. Those of you who say the plot's non existent, lighten up! The originality and brilliant acting of the film make up for any plotholes. I agree with almost everyone else that this movie is not in the same league as Scream, however there are definitely more shocks throughout- whereas in most horror movies there's just one killer chasing a victim, in this film you're continually preparing yourself for the next shock, because you've no idea where and when it will come- or, in some cases, the shocks are completely unexpected (the bus scene???). The film contains everything to make for excellent, terrifying Friday night viewing- suspense (some of the death scenes are incredibly drawn out!), shocks, blood and a little humour! Go see it in a packed cinema to get the full effect- the whole audience will be gasping and screaming. This is one of those films that you just have to see again because there was so much you missed due to hiding behind the seat in front. Also, after leaving the cinema, I guarantee you will look twice before crossing the road.<br/><br/>Overall, great direction, great story, great acting, great movie- the last thing I saw Devon Sawa in was Casper, and he's gone a long way since then! Kerr Smith is brilliant, portraying a completely different role to that of Jack in Dawson's Creek- hopefully we'll see much more of him in the future. The ending seems a bit like it was made up on the spot, but apart from that this film is a definite must see. 10 out of 10."

","I went to see ""Final Destination"" without any expectations, I havent really seen any commercials for it and theres no well known actors in it.<br/><br/>I was surprised on how good it was. I saw a couple of comments on the IMDb before seeing it, and noticed that it was being said to be quite the same as Scream, for instance. I do not agree.<br/><br/>""Scream"" was the first in a series of ""new"" slasher movies, but it`s originallity really disappeared after the first one. The story of a serial killer has after ""Scream"" been portrayed in films like: ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""Urban Legend"". Another likeness amongst theese movies is that there is always young people being slayed of, and that was the only thing that annoyed me a bit about *""Final Destination"" as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, ""Final Destination"" is quite original when it comes to ""the killer"". Now, i won`t give anything away, but it`s really different, and if you`re ready for something else than the story of a mad serial killer doing it over and over (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, and hundreds of others...).<br/><br/>The cast is good and the best scene is in the aircraft and when Terry decides to take the bus....<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Again we are thrust into another horror about unlucky teenagers facing certain death, but this time around its great fun. Is it better than Scream? To tell the truth I'm not sure, but Final Destination boasts a cast of extreme talent from movie virgin Devon Sawa, Dawson's Creek's unsure homosexual Kerr Smith, House On Haunted Hill's Ali Larter, American Pie's bully Sean William Scott to horror legend Tony Todd (Last seen impaled in The Rock).<br/><br/>The story is original. A class of students are on their way to France when one student Alex Browning (Sawa) has a vision of the plane exploding. Him and six others are removed from the plane and sure enough the plane explodes. Each of them now has to fight for his or her life as death visits them one by one.<br/><br/>The plot is twisty and if it wasn't for a rushed ending, Final Destination would be a killer. Sawa, and indeed the rest of the cast are incredible, offering a whole new level to the horror genre. Rating > 4/5"
"Verbal-17","10","1","1","19 March 2000"," One of the most effective horror movies I've ever seen
","We've all seen a million deaths in movies, and for the most part we are desensitized to it, and we are able to predict the deaths we see on the screen. But occasionally, a movie comes along that surprises us with its scenes of death and violence. Part of the joy of Pulp Fiction was its unpredictability. Anyone who's seen Deep Blue Sea remembers the effect of the scene where a character dies completely unexpectedly. Final Destination succeeds where other horror movies have failed because it takes time to make characters interesting, makes their discussions about death and control over one's destiny intriguing, and their deaths are more than just predictable cliches. Of course, this is still a horror flick, but it's scary because monsters and serial killers can be beaten with sheer physical force, but what do you do when your enemy is death itself, that unseen, unstoppable force that has all of us on his list? This is at the core of what makes the horror genre so entertaining- it allows us to examine the subject of our own death, something we're all curious about, without having to stare it right in the face. If we see it in exaggerated style, on a movie screen, we're just voyeurs. ""Destination"" shows us death the way it really is- unpredictable, inevitable, sudden, meaningless. And that is truly scary.<br/><br/>Note: this would not make a very good in-flight movie."

What Final Destination does is pull you to the edge of your seat and keep you there right through to the end.  If you're looking for nerve-wracking escapist fun, with a dash of shock-comedy, you'll love this movie.  <br/><br/>Devon Sawa is surprisingly good as a psychic highschooler trying to save the lives of his classmates by literally cheating death.  Ali Larter is perfect as an unhappy young woman who share's Sawa's vision.  (She's also a living doll.)  <br/><br/>Definitely give this one a try."

","What if Death had a plan for you, but by matter of intervention that plan was cut short? What if you and a handful of other people were selected to die on a certain date, only you didn't. What would happen? In short, the question is this: Is Death egocentric? Because if Death's plan was altered, well, he could just shrug like most of us when our plans go awry and turn away. But in ""Final Destination,"" a film about a band of teenagers who never board a plane destined to explode in flight, it appears as though Death has a very large ego--one that doesn't like to be messed with. Why else would he chase the survivors down and try to kill them in a ritualistic pattern?<br/><br/>It's about time a clever premise intertwined with the teenage-horror genre. After years of being subjected to such ""quality"" material lining up the shelves at your local video store under the Horror Section, which might as well be named Horror for Teens, now you can stop worrying, because James Wong's ""Final Destination"" is not only smart, but tons of fun.<br/><br/>
Alex (Devon Sawa), a seventeen-year-old highschooler, is going on a funded trip to Paris, France, with a horde of other teens. His flight, 180, is about to take off with him in it when he intercepts a startling vision. In it, the plane starts to take off and suddenly malfunctions, exploding in a haze of fire.<br/><br/>Alex's dream starts to follow course. Scared, he panics and exits the plane before take-off, along with a few other misled youths and a schoolteacher. They wait behind and agree to catch the next flight to Paris, when their original source of travel explodes in the sky, just as predicted by Alex.<br/><br/>Alex is shunned by many as a freak in the weeks to come. His best friend (who nearly boarded the plane along with Alex) commits suicide out of anger, frustration and sadness. But Alex realizes that perhaps he did not commit suicide after all--maybe it was Death coming back to follow through with his plan. Soon more die, and Alex comes up with a diagram of the plane's structure, and labels where everyone was sitting. He sees a pattern: The deaths are in sync with the position of where the victims would have been on the plane if it had taken off with them in it. So Alex tries to cheat Death again by fighting back--he comes close to fatality along with his other grave-destined friends (Seann William Scott, Ali Larter), but manages to stay alive by the hairs on his chin. (Well, actually, he doesn't have any hairs on his chin. But that's irrelevant, right?)<br/><br/>""Final Destination"" has been done before in other ways, but this is one of the more memorable examples of the idea. It's a very smart teenage horror flick when you look at it in light of all the other profit-making Hollywood dreck. The beginning is beyond intriguing--the entire plane sequence and vision is handled with such great direction and timing by James Wong, it's easy to imagine how it could have been made by a lesser director without nearly the same gut-wrenching effect.<br/><br/>Wong, who co-wrote the script, uses some great camera techniques that help salvage this film. The acting isn't too bad either--Sean William Scott, who played Stifler in ""American Pie"" (1999), is especially funny in his role, much to the contrary with 2003's ""Bulletproof Monk."" Devon Sawa started his career with ""Night of the Twisters"" and hasn't been in too many memorable films since, including ""Wild America"" and ""Slackers,"" but this ranks as one of his better movies and roles.<br/><br/>""Final Destination"" is especially good in its first fifteen minutes, but after the plane segment, however, the film slowly but surely falls in a downward spiral.

","This, ultimately, is just a slasher movie. But it's unique in the sense that the killer isn't your traditional Freddy, Jason or Michael. It's literally just Death, an entity we never see personified, which is something the film takes great advantage of.<br/><br/>The film is fun to watch. Devon Sawa gives a fantastic performance. The humour, while not readily present, still lands well when it's used. The kills were well planned and executed, as was Alex's reaction/involvement in each.<br/><br/>It's far from a perfect film, but it's also a film that doesn't deserve the unexplainably low review it got over on Rotten Tomatoes (35% at the time of this writing). If you go into it expecting a slasher and are prepared to receive nothing more or less, you'll have a good time.<br/><br/>The only negative thing that I can personally say about this film is to criticize the pointless and tasteless joke on Michael Jackson. It had no place in the film and only served to add more negativity to a situation that was still ongoing and very hostile at that point in time. Any filmmaker who needs to drag Michael down for a laugh deserves a little bit of negative reaction thrown at their movie."

","This was a movie that I remember seeing when it first hit the movie channels growing up. I'm not sure if we got this off of pay per view or not, but regardless, it didn't take me long to see this one. It was also an interesting time as I seen Devon Sawa, Ali Larter and Seann William Scott in other things around this same time, but wasn't expecting them in a movie like this. It's been probably since college that I last saw this movie and it is thanks to Duncan and The Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis is after a teenager has a terrifying vision of him and his friends dying in a plane crash, he prevents the accident only to have Death hunt them down, one by one.<br/><br/>We start this movie off with seeing the room of Alex Browning (Sawa). He is supposed to be going on a field trip to France with his classmates. We get to see some images hinting to things to come later in the movie as well as an interaction with his parents about not ripping off a previous flight tag on his luggage. Alex thinks it is bad luck. He then heads to the airport with his best friend, Tod Waggner (Chad Donella), his brother George (Brendan Fehr) and driven by their father, Larry Gilman.<br/><br/>Alex gets an uneasy feeling about things in the airport. Things distract him and draw his attention, but he's not sure what they mean. We also get to meet the others that are coming on this trip with him. To name some of the important ones, we have an outcast of Clear Rivers (Larter), a jerk by the name of Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend is Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), a guy who is picked on of Billy Hitchcock (Scott) and their teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Before they get on the flight, Tod convinces Alex they need to use the bathroom where Alex notices John Denver playing. He points out he died in a plane crash.<br/><br/>They get on the plane and we get a scene where Tod won't switch seats to allow two girls to sit next to each other. Alex agrees though and they take off. Things don't go well as the plane ends up exploding. We see this is just a dream though. Alex wakes up in a panic and this agitates Carter. The two get in a tussle and are removed along with Billy who was in the way and Terry who went with her boyfriend. Clear exits as well, feeling uneasy and George tells Tod to check on Alex. Valerie gets off as well, having the other teacher get back on the flight.<br/><br/>To their dismay, exactly what Alex said would happen does, the plane explodes. They're then interrogated by government agents, including Agent Weine (Daniel Roebuck) and Agent Schreck (Roger Guenveur Smith). They know something is up, but they can't put their finger on it. They become even more suspicious when Tod dies. It is thought to be a suicide, but we see it play out and there are forces at play. It appears Death is correcting its plan that was altered, but can it ever be fully cheated?<br/><br/>Now with the recap out of the way, I've already said that this is a movie I haven't seen in some time, but watching it last night it really is pretty fresh still. I would catch this one whenever it was on movie challenges back in high school and after. I've also seen all of the sequels at least once and some of them a few times. For the most part, they're just fun, but I also think there is an interesting concept we are playing with here.<br/><br/>What is interesting here is that I read this was originally going to be an episode of The X-Files that they decided to flesh out into a feature film. I will say, I do notice inconsistencies with the story that felt like caused by rewrites. The first is that Tod and George are brothers. I did realize this time this was for a French class, not for like a senior trip so that didn't bother me. There was supposed to be underlying sub-plot that I'm glad they removed where Clear and Alex were in love. The problem though is that there's a comment she makes that he hasn't spoken a word to her in school, but then the agents are coming to her to figure out where he is. They clearly weren't close, so it feels like just some minor issues where they removed things, but didn't completely clean it up.<br/><br/>I will say though, I do love the idea that Death is an entity. It has a plan for us all. The movie never explains why Alex was given the premonitions. If this movie never gave us a sequel, I don't need this to be fleshed out and explained. I chalk it up to there are times I get a bad feeling about something and then something bad happens. There's no rational explanation. As humans we look for patterns and that is really what is happening. There are some that bit a bit cheesy to me where Alex can see a reflection for hints. I could do without that, but I like throwing the magazine and it cutting up a page to bear the name Tod. More of that works. They do really good though with symbolism of things like an owl or the spelling of Tod was used as it means death in German. John Denver also keeps being played and the way he did is an interesting parallel. These are all slight nods that just show care to me and almost giving that Death has a bit of flair for the dramatic.<br/><br/>I also have to give credit to this film. It is not the first one to have elaborate death scenes that play like the game mouse trap. What I like though is that this made it popular and in the horror community we use the term 'Final Destination'-esque deaths when you get little things that all culminate to the end. With that said, I think for the most part they're good in this movie. For whatever reason, one of my favorites is Tod throughout the whole series. We do get some CGI, not a lot. I would say the effects are pretty solid overall. There are just a couple times it doesn't hold up, but it is surprisingly well done. I like the cinematography that makes it feel like we're right there with Death as it is playing things out.<br/><br/>If I really have any gripes with the movie, it is with the acting. I don't have a problem with this cast in general. Sawa, Larter and Scott are all solid. There's a bit of overacting from Sawa and Scott. Larter has some issues with her dialogue, but I think that was probably from rewrites. I don't like Smiths' character if I'm honest. Cloke, Roebuck, Roger Smith, Donella and Detmer are all fine though. I do like the cameo from Tony Todd as he is quite creepy here. Plus any time you can give a legend like him screen time, you're doing it right. I do also love the care to name every character after silent and just after horror icons like Todd Browning, Val Lewton, Robert Weine, F.W. Murnau and Max Schreck to just name a few.<br/><br/>So now with that said, this movie isn't great by any sense, but this is a popcorn movie that I could legit pop in at any time and just enjoy it. I think that we have a solid concept that doesn't need to be fleshed out too much and it is an interesting premise for sure. There are some pretty creative deaths here that legit could be accidents or someone could be doing it. The logical explanations do work where you could question things. All of the effects aren't great, but good enough for me. The acting is a bit average. It doesn't need to be great as it isn't the focal point. I would also say the soundtrack is fine, but it doesn't stand out. I would give this movie above average in my opinion.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10"

"kennethting-35260","8","0","0","25 May 2020"," Final Destination - a conceptually winning horror movie that delivers fear from hopelessness
","Hopelessness, the state of giving up in believing anything will happen in accordance to one's expectation, is an essential emotion that must be elicited in the genre of horror movies. Despite its importance, many horror movies fail to deliver this fundamental element effectively because it is often limited to only a few scenes or characters. On the other hand, horror movies that can sustain the feeling of hopelessness from the beginning to the end among all characters in a convincible manner will stand out the most, instilling the minds of many audience permanently. Among all, Final Destination is an outstanding example. Final destination, both the title and the grand metaphor used to deliver the essence of the movie, is a referral to the last stage of our lives - death. While death has haunted us since the moment that we are conscious of our own existence, Final destination takes a step further and draw our fears not only from death itself, but from the hopelessness that stems from the absence of a second life and the inevitability nature of death.<br/><br/>The absence of a second life
If final destination is the grand metaphor for death itself, then the movie implies that there is nothing beyond death as it is the final stage of our lives. Indeed, the existence of a second life is questioned in the movie, as Alex looks up into the sky and asks ""Are they up there? Somehow...is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe?"". This suggests that Alex tends to believe that a second life does exist where deceased individuals can acquire a second chance and reverse the decisions that they have made from their former lives. Interestingly, Clear agrees with Alex as she says, ""It exists, that place...A place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here."" While the sentiments that they have expressed are laudable, the absence of any involvement from the deceased characters harshly demonstrates that the so-called ""second life"" only exists in their imagination, or more importantly, only in the audience's mind, thus drowning the audience in hopelessness.<br/><br/>The inevitability nature of death
Although the absence of a second life is seemingly depressing, the possibility of escaping from death instantly illuminates the morbid situation. Similar to the audience, the survivors in the movie summon every ounce of their courage in an attempt to escape their own death and control their fates. However, they have failed, and along with their failure, is the delivery of the message that death itself is inevitable, thereby extinguishing the last ray of hope in both the characters' and audience's mind.<br/><br/>While death has haunted humanity since the beginning of time, Final Destination successfully magnifies this fear conceptually by emphasizing its inevitability and eradicating the possibility of a second life. This pushes us into an abyss of hopelessness, where we now terrifyingly question, what if an afterlife does not exist? What if death is indeed our final destination?"

","So 20 years ago today, May 19th 2000 this movie was first aired in UK cinemas. It began the start of the Final destination series of movies that would last 11 years.
In this movie Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), is just your standard teenager that goes to Mt. Abraham High School in New York. The school has arranged a field trip to Paris for students and teachers. Alex is going, but the night before the flight from JFK, he is having trouble sleeping. All the students and teachers arrive in plenty of time to catch the Volee Airlines Boeing 747 Flight 180 to Charles De Gaulle, Paris. Alex seems to be a little worried about the flight, he become agitated on the walkway to board the plane. He eventually boards and finds his seat, but Christa (played by Lisa Marie Caruk) and Blake (played by Christine Chatelain) ask him to move seats, so they are able to sit together. Alex does move to allow the girls to sit together, he moves next to his best friend Tod Waggner (played by Chad Donella). When Alex sits down, he has a real to life experience of the plane taking off, circling NYC and then the plane has problems and it starts to tear up and eventually explodes, midair. Suddenly Alex comes around, it was all in his head! He'd been spooked! This then makes Alex want to leave the plane. He becomes involved in a scuffle with Carter Horton (played by Kerr Smith) and both get removed from the plane, along with Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), late arrival Billy Hitchcock (played by Seann William Scott), best friend Tod, Valerie Lewton (played by Kristen Cloke), who is one of the teachers on board, and Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) just decides to leave.

"Straker17","10","0","0","10 February 2019"," Original, if Slightly Dated, Thriller
","It's surprising that the first film in a long running series still remains one of the most beloved as, in a series known for high amounts of gore, the death scenes in the film seem a little less memorable in comparison. However, Final destination delivers on all of the campy thrills we have come to expect from teen horror movies, and it does so in a marvelously original fashion.<br/><br/>
What has now become an iconic plotline with horror fans, the film follows a group of high school students who escape death after one of them has a premonition of a plane crash. Inspired loosely by the real life story of a real life story in which a woman avoided death because of a gut feeling she shouldn't get on a plane, the movie manages to grasp at some genuine tension in it's earliest moments. As the film progresses, it begins to devolve into a more campy sense of dread, as you begin to await the deaths of the remaining teens.<br/><br/>
Devon Sawa turns in a capable performance as the lead, and he is backed up sufficiently by the supporting cast, including Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Kristen Cloke. The writing present here is solid, and the story provides us with a solid group of characters. Even despite some initial friction with some of them, you never really want to see any of them bite the dust, and as a result, watching death slowly approach them grasps a true sense of dread.<br/><br/>
The film is relatively old, as next year it will be coming up on it's 20th birthday. And while, you never fully expect the effects to look as good as a modern day film, the effects present here still leave much to be desired. However that is easily forgivable due to the amount of originality present in this now treasured movie.<br/><br/>
Regardless of the dated effects, it is impressive that a film, generally dismissed by critics of the time, has spawned a series that has cemented itself into the horror canon as well as this one has. The crown jewel of this movie is the now iconic bus death. Providing us with one of the more shocking deaths in a horror film. The impact this film has had on the horror genre is hard to ignore, and as a result the dated feel of the film is extremely easy to forgive. The film is as tense as it is entertaining, lending itself to be a film that will be watched and re-watched throughout future generations."

","The movie is thrilling and totally great. But I think, the concept has an error. Alex did cheat death at first time when he saw they were dying and later prevented that. He could survive because he knew about the future. But after that, when it was time for his friends, he didn't see anything though and prevented their deaths anyway. Like one of his friend was stuck in the train line, they rescued him and boom! He successfully cheated death. As far as I know, that's not how things work."

","When a vision saves him and his friends, a teenager intending to go to a class trip to Paris learns that the strange accidents befalling them are the result of Death coming to claim them for escaping the plane crash and sets out to prevent their deaths from continuing to kill them off.<br/><br/>This one ended up being quite an impressive and enjoyable effort. Among the numerous qualities here is the fact that there's a ton of high-quality suspense here which runs throughout this one since there's a lot of focus here in making the scenes suspenseful. Due to the ploy of not knowing when Death is going to strike and where, there's a big part of the film that gets really chilling as this one really plays up the accidental nature of the setups to drive home how randomly it strikes as the bathtub sequence, the attack at the teachers' house where all sorts of fun accidents are unleashed in order to keep playing up what's going to be the final killing blow and their encounter in the car out on the highway as they try to pull a friend out of a trapped car-seat with a train approaching them in the intersection which is incredibly fun. These are suspenseful setups that take the concept of his visions and really bring a thrilling underlining to the scene. There's plenty of suspenseful times elsewhere here, as the opening buildup on the plane before the takeoff which reveals itself as a startlingly realistic dream which sets up the remaining storyline about the clues and the possible manners of stopping the events from continuing, the save at the garage and the encounter out in the woods all come off just as good as the actual kill scenes in here which manage plenty of thrilling scenes all throughout here. As well, there's plenty of action here with this one that are just as much fun as the suspenseful ones which keeps this one moving along so well as each of these scenes plays out as truly fun action scenes that take the suspenseful setups into quite enjoyable levels as there's a great bit about actually getting the death scene going which goes all the way to the finale where that comes off really well. The other big plus here comes from the film's ingenious plotline where it continually manages to feature some great twists featuring the way Death is presented here as a physical, thinking entity that plans out life in advance without anything being done, working through this concept here in knocking off the survivors in a special order which is a truly original and unique idea that gets played out in a rather enjoyable manner. Along with the fine gore-packed kills, these here make this more enjoyable enough to hold out over the film's one flaw. There's almost nothing to like here about the federal investigation into the incidents which gets tiring with all their interludes that goes nowhere and never really gets resolved with the attempts to pin everything on him without having any real info to finger him on. Otherwise, this is only what keeps this one down.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Brief Nudity."

This movie makes accepting death easier, the only thing we can hope is that that day will be many years from today.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","0","0","1 December 2017"," Destination to death
","'Final Destination' is most notable for two things mainly. The first being that it was the introduction of a fascinating and clever premise that is pretty unique for a supernatural horror. The other being that it was the feature film directing debut of James Wong, best known beforehand as a veteran of 'The X Files'.<br/><br/>It spawned four sequels with the fifth film being released in 2011. While it is flawed and somewhat of an uneven film, the first 'Final Destination' is still, six years after the fifth film, one of the franchise's better outings. Perhaps even the best, and the one where the premise feels the freshest. The more stale the concept got, the more the novelty wore off and the less effective the film. Could 'Final Destination' have executed its premise better? Perhaps. Mostly, to me, it did it quite well.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Final Destination' looks pretty good for low budget. It's slickly shot and very atmospheric, while the plane effects in the Flight 180 plane scene/explosion are quite impressive. The music score has a suitable eeriness.<br/><br/>The film is never dull and is a vast majority of the time fun and suspenseful, with elaborately creative death scenes that are ingeniously unsettling. The film's highlight is the opening Flight 180 scene, anyone already with a fear of flying will have their fear exemplified and it is likely to turn people from boarding a plane for a while. Wong does competently with the directing and the portrayal of Death is an interesting and well done one.<br/><br/>Acting varies, with personable Devon Sawa, affecting Ali Larter and Tony Todd's creepy cameo coming off best. Really liked the characters' surnames, that were nifty homages to horror/suspense icons.<br/><br/>Not all the acting works however. The others are saddled with one-dimensional and flatly written roles and are a mix of bland (Kristen Cloke) and irritating (Kerr Smith), also found myself not being able to take Seann William Scott seriously.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is the script, which is very high in the cheese and awkwardness factors and there is some clumsy exposition that often feels under-explored and not really going anywhere. Generally the story is nice, but things could have been explained better and explored more and it's a little too reliant on coincidence. Things also take a dumb turn towards the end before the film concludes on a logic-defying note.<br/><br/>Overall, patchy but entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","6.5 out of 10 and here's why : The concept is good, an idea like this deserves quite a depiction, but there it is, Final Destination is a movie where people are facing a timed bomb-y Death, and they know it. It is a struggle against death. The only thing I hated is how deaths aren't completely incidental and they depicted it as some sort of 'transparent-yet-dark soul' which causes circumstances to change and voilà, death ! If only it were fully incidental then the scope of reality would've been preserved, without having to lean on supernatural stuff. Acting was good, though, so is the plot."
"jackcwelch23","7","0","0","19 October 2017"," Effectively scary and unnerving
","I remember seeing this film for the first time when I was 6 years old. I saw it at our holiday house in Byron Bay and only 3 movies have ever terrified me as much as this one did (Jeepers Creepers and A Nightmare On Elm Street) but the idea of this movie is still so great whenever I think about it. Instead of a blade wielding psycho we have death itself as our villain. And hey, it can take any of us out whenever it wants. It cannot be stopped. Unlike the Terminator, some plastic explosive will not do the trick. If you're chosen, your time is up mate. I couldn't sleep for about 3 weeks after watching it. I still don't know how i can get on a plane without having a nervous breakdown. <br/><br/>I also look on this movie fondly as it gave me a serious adrenaline rush of fear. It is more thought provoking than people give it credit too. We are only here on borrowed time after all. The big man in the sky will send the reaper to come calling for us someday. Maybe we should just be grateful we didn't end up on this particular death list, as I would like to die with my body parts intact at the very least. Another great thing about it is Devon Sawa's performance, believable and sympathetic. He brings credibility to a role that could have been cardboard. It is a great shame that his career never took off after this, but he can at least smile knowing he gave a memorable performance in at least one movie. It's still no masterpiece and it has an unsatisfying ending, and of course all the sequels sucked, but it will always send that shiver down my spine in the most satisfying way whenever I watch it. Times up flight 180."
"sol-","Null","0","0","6 October 2017"," Foresight
","Having foreseen the impending explosion of a plane and saved his friends' lives, a teenager becomes convinced that they accidentally cheated death and that a grim fate still awaits them in this slick horror-thriller. While similar to Thom Eberhardt's 'Sole Survivor', this latter film is still blessed with a fairly original premise and there are several intense moments to be had as the teens try to avoid Death coming for them after two of the surviving friends die in mysterious circumstances. The premise does, however, offer far more questions than answers, such as why Devon Sawa's character is sometimes able to foresee what will happen, why Death takes so long to come after them again, and most strikingly, why almost all of the deaths are elaborate and over-the-top. Imaginative death scenes are great in a movie such as a 'Friday the 13th' sequel, but here it just seems pointless if we assume that Death really wants the characters dead. While it might not all make sense, 'Final Destination' is nevertheless incredibly well filmed. The early moments of Sawa's hyper-awareness pre-flight are very well done and the camera hardly ever sits still throughout, often gliding and sweeping over the characters in a creepy manner. The film additionally deserves some credit for ending on a darkly comic laugh for what it is otherwise a rather grim take on fate and predestination."
"sebijin","8","0","0","9 August 2017"," I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while.
","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7-w8NjxzWc<br/><br/>I started a series called ""RECAP"" on YouTube where I recap and review movies, anime, TV shows and more. I'm going through the Final Destination series as the first movie franchise and it's been interesting going back and watching these films again after so many years. <br/><br/>I know they're older, but I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts about them as well. I ended up enjoying Final Destination 1, even though the series gets derivative after a while. <br/><br/>In terms of a premise for a film, Final Destination was the first of its kind. It's execution in discussing premonitions and death's design is really well fleshed out. We get tons of disturbing, but amazing death scenes, and the rest of the franchise pretty much does the same. As we continue to take a look at the rest of the franchise though, we will start to notice that these things that made the movie unique, ended up creating a ton of clichés. This could be for better or for worse.<br/><br/>To say that Final Destination is a horror film is a bit of a stretch, though it definitely has a few moments where you can feel uneasy and the gore is very apparent when it's main attraction is death. I would have to say though that this movie is more of a laugh fest at times than a horror film, of course, I myself tend to laugh at most horror films anyways, so some of that is just me. <br/><br/>The acting surprised me the most. When you think of a movie with teenagers in it, you'll commonly think that it's going to be a bad film and then together with the fact that this is a quote-on-quote horror film, the two don't really mix. But this particular group of actors worked really well together and played each of their stereotypical parts without being overly dramatic. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter to be exact, the actors that played Alex and Clear, both showed emotional attachments to their part. Not to mention the fact, that Tony Todd as a coroner was practically the perfect casting.<br/><br/>The cinematography was really well done. Even though the foreshadowing was pushed in our face every few minutes, at least it was done with some really neat shots with tons of close ups. What made the deaths particularly interesting, was the fact that some of these close up shots didn't have a thing to do with the actual death, so we actually had to guess what would end up being the final straw that broke the camel's back. <br/><br/>James Wong, the director and lead screenwriter of the film did an excellent job with this one. You could say that that's not too surprising, since he's also worked on The X-Files series. But he also did Dragonball Evolution...<br/><br/>For a movie that's now almost 18 years old, I must say, Final Destination is still worth watching. It's ironically good at times and for the most part, it's a pretty good film in general. I find myself enjoying it through and through. If you can get past the teenage stereotypes and the sometimes goofy and impossible deaths – this is the movie for you."

The first time I saw this film many years ago, I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD, and it has remained something of a guilty pleasure all this time.<br/><br/>Some films try way too hard to tick all the boxes and create the perfect picture, when sometimes all that's needed is an original, unique idea and enough imagination to put it into practice.

","This film had a definitely inserting concept, that a group of teens who have ""cheated"" death after abruptly departing an airplane that ends up exploding upon takeoff, who then find themselves fighting for their lives as death stalks them in the form of a series of elaborate fatal and/or near fatal accidents and mishaps (ranging from seemingly simple bathroom slip and falls, to downed power lines, to elaborate car and train sequences). The film was written and directed by ""X-Files"" veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong, so from a technical standpoint, it's a well crafted film with excitement, suspense, and thrills. However, I'm not sure the film's premise was enough to sustain a feature length film. It also doesn't help that the characters are not all that interesting, though it is kind of fun to see a young Ali Larter.

","The movie has an interesting premise: A high school student, aboard an airplane and waiting to depart on his French classes' flight to Paris, has a premonition: a ghastly vision of an explosion. He then raises a commotion and bolts from the craft. A few minutes later the plane explodes in midair just after takeoff, killing everyone aboard. The view from the terminal is terrific, with glass shattering everywhere. <br/><br/>The young man and six others – who have disembarked during the turmoil – have cheated death, but death, though unfeeling, hates to be cheated. And so for the rest of the movie death stalks the survivors, and picks them off one by one. Meanwhile the main character tries to figure out the death patterns to stay ahead of fate. As a mortician later tells Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and sympathizing friend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), ""The risk of cheating the plan, of disrespecting the design, could incite a fury that could terrorize even the Grim Reaper.""<br/><br/>The whole feeling is one of doom, that something is out to get you, as writer Mark Twain thought of his family tragedies. Inanimate objects turn against people, like water, wind, electrical wires, vodka, gas cans, knives, lanterns, fish hooks, candles, a garage- door opener, etc. And folks die in various ways, like an elaborate strangulation, decapitation, traffic accident, fire, etc. When John Denver's tune, ""Rocky Mountain High"" is played, watch out for a falling sign! So we have a bizarre chain of connected events, like a Rube Goldberg machine. In the early 20th century Goldberg created cartoons for newspapers that depicted complicated gadgets that performed tasks in complex ways. <br/><br/>FBI agents and others think that Alex is some kind of freak, especially because of his theories about death's design. The last half of the film focuses on Alex's increasing paranoia and precautions, like his opening of tin cans while wearing heavy gloves lest he should severely cut himself and get blood-poison. His lit candles are placed in water bowls as protection against an ill wind that may knock them over.<br/><br/>Despite an interesting story-line, the film has its negatives. For one, the acting is just so-so, especially with co-lead Ali Larter. In addition, this morphs into just another horror film. Also, there are the plot flaws. One may say, ""Why save someone's life as he will be doomed anyway?"" You may come to the same conclusion by adding, ""Why do we have doctors?"" Nevertheless Director James Wong's concept was popular enough with teen viewers so that four sequels were produced. But the characters were mostly created just to be knocked off, although not quite as badly as those in the ""Friday the Thirteenth"" series. You may be entertained by it."

","Tonight is movie night with the little ones. Having a hard time picking out an age appropriate movie? Look no further than Final Destination! This movie is jam packed with lots of kid friendly material. Whether it be the incredibly funny deaths or the sheer amount of blood and guts, this movie has it all. Starting at the beginning, we encounter a group of high school kids at the airport on their way to France. As they board the plane, we see a stupid looking baby and a mentally challenged man. It must be so nice that they are going to France, right? WRONG! These dumb looking buttheads are gonna die! Not only are we treated to seeing the death of a baby, but as a bonus, we are treated to the hilarious reaction of a mentally challenged man. I bet he thought it was an earthquake, lol. This man rolls around in his seat just as a mentally challenged man would as the plane goes down. Though thinking about that stupid baby dying is quite funny if I do say so myself. Heck, both of them are equally hilarious! The little ones will love watching some dumb cripple roll around during a plane crash. And surely the thought of a dead baby will give them nice, wholesome thoughts about life. But wait, there's more! You still have over an hour of blood and guts to go! There will be plenty of hilarious deaths that will have your kids rolling around in laughter (much like the mentally challenged man in the plane crash). So before putting in that Barney DVD, think about the important life values that your kids will learn from Final Destination. Why, i'm sure it will become your children's favorite film before bedtime!"

The plane does explode and the FBI get involved to investigate, but little does Alex and the others know, they are actually being starked by death for avoiding death.<br/><br/>Overall Final Destination is a good horror film. It is not a horror that is gory but does have some strong violence in there. the death scenes are very clever, each murder takes it's time to happen but when it does it hits you hard. the plot is original, the acting is good, Devon Sava, Ali Larter and Kerr Smith play the students that are being starked by death and Tony Todd (Candyman) has a small role playing coroner William Bludworth. the sfx are fantastic, the editing and directing are good and the ending is unexpected and amazing and deserved a sequel."

","'X-Files' veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong do well with this better than average, interesting horror movie. It's not wholly original - a little known movie titled ""Sole Survivor"" predates it by about 17 years, and its succession of elaborate murder set pieces calls to mind the ""Omen"" series - but it's slick and entertaining. Its premise hinges on the idea that Death has a ""design""; people can interfere with that design but are merely delaying the inevitable. Devon Sawa stars as Alex Browning, about to fly to Paris with his high school French class, only to experience a horrific vision of the airplane exploding. He and several others get off the airplane, which does indeed explode. However, the survivors won't have long to celebrate their good fortune as Death intends to claim them no matter what. Alex figures out the order in which they will perish and starts doing everything he can to intervene. The story becomes rather standard stuff as we watch our cast of characters get knocked off one at a time, and the brutality visited upon this unfortunate bunch is often extremely amusing, whether it involves stabbing, fire, decapitation, or being mowed down by a bus. Things get off to a moody, atmospheric, and ominous start with some well done opening credits and the viewer does get a sense of impending doom right away. One of the best touches is turning John Denver's song ""Rocky Mountain High"" (the late singer having perished in a plane crash himself) into a harbinger of death. The material is sincerely played by its cast, also including Ali Larter ('Heroes'), Kerr Smith ('Dawson's Creek'), Seann William ""Stifler"" Scott (""Goon""), Chad Donella (""Disturbing Behavior""), Daniel Roebuck (""Halloween II"" '09), Brendan Fehr (""The Forsaken""), etc. The sequence with charismatic genre veteran Tony Todd as enigmatic mortician Mr. Bludworth is far and away the best, with Todd making the most of his brief screen time. Pacing is good, the special effects mostly convincing, and all in all the movie makes for a good diversion, although it eventually gets bogged down in the whole idea of just what the order of death should be, and the ending is just not terribly satisfactory. Still, filmmakers have certainly gotten a lot of mileage out of the concept here, with three sequels and one prequel having followed this initial entry. This is fun enough material with a lot of shocks, a bit of self-referential flavour to the writing (characters are named after notable filmmakers and actors of the 1920's, 30's, and 40's), and a fair amount of style. Seven out of 10."

","I wasn't expecting much popping this movie into my DVD tray. I was surprised to find this film has quite a lot to offer. A group of students board a plane to Paris, before they take off a teen, by the name of Alex Browning (Devan Sawa) has a vision, a vision that involves the plane exploding mid-flight and incinerating all it's passengers. When he awakes from his trance he rushes off the plane taking 7 other passengers with him. They are forced to stay at the port and watch in horror as Alex's vision becomes an all so real reality. Scared, confused, and curious, the students and their families slowly begin to return to a somewhat normal life, that is until the remaining survivors start to drop off like flies. Death has returned for them and with a vengeance!<br/><br/>I have a weird thing about kids dying in movies even if they are 17-18 years old, but plot intrigued me and really made me think, for a horror or even ""slasher"" film there is a lot under the surface. I liked the idea that death isn't a force but more of a person and a mind, that can think and analyze problems. Down to the bone though this film is just a slasher dressed up in fancy clothes. Characters are hacked of in a very violent and gory fashion. Instead of an actual killer, there is again the idea of death. Don't take that last statement negatively though, the movie was very well done and I was surprised how well written it was and even the acting. But the real treat here is for the gore fans not many films are released lately that don't have death styles executed before in repetitive fashion. Scenes throw winks here and there for a chuckle or false lead into thinking a character is knocked off in a certain way, a pattern that repeats and get old after awhile and I fear is repeated in a poor fashion. A few of the death scenes are a bit far fetched, but this isn't a movie where your meant to think. Not only are the death scenes creative but they may make you think twice to check and see if your shaving blade is rusty. <br/><br/>6/10"

","I think I made the mistake of watching the final destination films backwards. I saw the third first and then watched the first, because I really enjoyed the third. Either way I didn't enjoy the first as much as I enjoyed the third. The first is the same concept, Kid gets on plane, kid gets premonition, kid freaks out, kid gets in a fight which gets them thrown off the plane, idiot guy who thinks its all stupid and so on. Final destination is quite slow paced as well. It has to explain the premonition and the clues and why this is all happening and stuff, which I think even if I hadn't seen the third, I would have understood without all the talking. The deaths were no where near as gruesome as I expected either. They seemed quite simple, but that shouldn't be thought too much about, I mean this was the first film, they were exploring what they could do. Some scenes are very well done though. One scene that stands out for me is a scene when Carter's car is on the tracks and a train is coming right for it. That scene is incredibly tense, and I honestly was almost standing up screaming at the T.V for him to get out of the car. Another thing about this film that is good, is that it's unpredictable. I had no idea when some deaths were going to occur, which made it a lot more creepy. This film played on my mind a lot more than the third, because in this one things happen for no reason, such as water leaking out of the toilet, there was no reason for that to happen, but in the third it's more in stages, such as temperature turned up in room caused the fan to come on which caused the palm tree to fall over which caused the CD rack to fall and so on. I do think that most people would love this film, because even though it is slow the acting is good, it's tense, very unpredictable and a lot scarier than the third. I must say that I love the third film, and was slightly disappointed when I watched th first, but I still love the final destination series. It's definitely worth the watch, especially if you have seen the others, because for one you will understand the others a lot more."

Highly recommended - I have the DVD, Carnival Of Souls is now considered a sort of lost classic. I like the cheesy organ score, done one finger style on a cheap carnival organ by the director himself.<br/><br/>The Final Destination films have an interesting Rube Goldberg way of unfolding events, that is simple minded and amusing amidst the faux-philosophical conversations the otherwise clueless teens are engaging in. Each death is like the old Mousetrap game, obvious the moment the ball starts rolling down the chute, while the teens try to act like it's Rubik's cube unfathomable! <br/><br/>And gawd do I laff at that old coroner who suddenly hands them the answers to the universe between burning bodies, whenever they think to ask him (which has only been twice in two films, whereas you'd think they'd be sitting at his feet trying to pick the mystical genius' brain 24-7! Makes no sense, and is just tossed in as a way to ""explain"" what death is doing, and it's done so shamelessly cheesy that I like it!)<br/><br/>I take the FD films as a humorous twist on Carnival Of Souls and enjoy them as such. I found #2 very confusing to see first, especially the reintroduction of Bangs and the explanation of how the other survivor of the first film died (I still have no idea what the heck they were talking about). But the early multi-car/truck crash in #2 was riveting and I got sucked into the story, even if it was hard to pickup without even knowing I was watching a sequel (it was on TV for an hour before I looked up the title). <br/><br/>The teen actors themselves are all blah cyphers, meaningless and interchangeable other than Bangs herself, but the writing and situations are cool, especially the surreal dialogue at the most inappropriate times (I died laffing when, seconds after seeing their friend sliced in two next to the railroad track and his blood still dripping off them, the kid starts lecturing Bangs about his newest intricate theory of the progression of deaths, even before they start running away from the approaching sirens!!).<br/><br/>I like being pleasantly surprised by films I've never heard of.

Soon after, fate kills them off (using creative freak accidents) in the order in which they should have been killed in the plane.  After reading that, you'd probably think it sounded like a good movie.  So did I.  Unfortunately, there are too many teen cliches to mess it up.

Of course the plane blows up  but mysteriously  one by one  the survivors begin to die in horrible circumstances.

However the penultimate scene where Devon Sawa and Ali Later battle `Death' at Ali's house is quite `electrifying' (no pun intended!).<br/><br/>After watching the DVD extras (deleted scenes / interviews with `executives')  it documents the trouble the film makers had in making an audience satisfying ending.  POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS  the original ending had Alex dying to save his pregnant girlfriend  thus cheating Death.  But the test audience had a bad reaction to this  feeling a bit distant from it after the first half of the movie was so different.  They reworked the ending  so Alex survived and Kerr Smith ultimately dies.  This made it into a typical horror movie ending (you know  a final shock right before the end credits).

The numbers three and seven play an important role in the scheme of things.  It deals with unpredictability, predetermination, fate, and the philosophy of life and death.  It contains one of the most creative death scenes in a horror movie that I've seen in a long time. Final Destination(2000) compares very favorably to The Dead Zone(1983), Don't Look Now(1972), and Seven Notes in Black(1977)."

","A teenage movie about death.  Interesting but how do you get people to see it?  Can't be serious - no one will come and it can't be campy - Hollywood won't finance it.  So the lowest common denominator of teenage movies is loudness and violence. Throw in a little seriousness and make it a little campy.  What you get is ""The Final Destination"",  a film without any shred of merit nor decency.  The film playfully bounces off the memory of two recent airplane disasters near New York, TWA 800 and Egypt Air 990 as well as John Denver's untimely air crash as if they were mere props to be used and abused. How ever did it manage to avoid John Kennedy Jr?  Its ingenious setup of death as something no one can cheat is tossed aside in favor of a childish game of who will die next and in what manner of blood and gore - strangulation, bludgeoning, beheading, smacked dead by a bus or train, or worse, a runaway neon sign.   You have a feeling the filmmakers initially wanted this film to take the high ground, especially the scene of the eulogy given by one of the teenage survivors, when he says death to young people shouldn't be thought of at a distance but as real as the next moment.  But just as abruptly, the subdued turns heavy-handed and any semblance of caring turns into mindless pillage.  ""The Final Destination"" starts out giving comfort to those who mourn but ends up desecrating life as well as death. Is that what teenage movies are all about?"

","It looks like an interesting movie, doesn't it? High-school kid has horrible vision of an exploding plane while his plane's sitting on the runway, freaks out, and leaves the plane, taking a few classmates and a teacher with him. Boom! Plane explodes. Did the kid save them, or is he just off his rocker? Don't look for anyone you recognize in the cast. I've watched about a billion movies, and I recognized only the last guy I listed up there (Tony Todd, from Candyman). Basically, this is a movie in the young-people-scared-out-of-their-wits vein that was popularized with the Scream films. This one, fortunately, is well-written, albeit with some plot holes. Still, it's an intriguing premise. Does Death have a plan for each of us? If so, then this kid's act of getting people off the plane screwed it up royally, and now Death's really ticked off and - surprise! - one by one, the survivors are picked off. But this is a tiny cut about the standard people-being-killed-one-by-one movie. It's not just a matter of how people are killed in this movie; that would be the easy, tried-and-true method. In Final Destination, the fun is in figuring out who's next, and if the premise is to be believed (that Death does have a plan), then the mystery of who is supposed to die next will keep you guessing. There's some pleasure in figuring out who's next, since there are some characters you kind of hope get it sooner rather than later. That said, the acting is nothing to speak of - rather bland, really - and the direction itself is really bad. But the story's interesting and the effects, gory as they are, are frighteningly realistic. PRO: Story, effects. You want blood, you got it! CON: Acting, directing, effects. This is NOT for squeamish people. My score: 6"

","""Final Destination"" is definitely a cut above the rest. It approaches it's story professionally, making every death count. I admit, however, some of the dialouge is pretty bad. But besides this, and an ill-timed scene with Tony Todd, ""Final Destination"" will take you on a satisfying, and wild trip.

While some of the effects were laughable (the head, etc), I thought that the film took an interesting premise and developed it almost enough. It fell a little short sometimes with the logistics of how Alex was enlightened on the plane, but the scene with the mortician/Death character (the aforementioned Tony Todd) was, I felt, quite necessary and well done. Acting was fairly shaky, especially on the female end, but the beauty of this kind of movie is that it can be absolutely enjoyable without being technically great, or even that good.

","What really had me going about Final Destination was not the terrifying and gory deaths, or the the non-stop entertainment plot, or even the most original and frightening beginning since Scream. What really got me to enjoy this movie was the completely new idea of the ""slasher movie without the slasher"" idea, the magnificently shot scenes which kept you so freaked out about what was going to happen, the freaky and eerie score, and the amazingly fresh plot. After three years of lame and predictable slasher movies (with the exception of the well done Scream movies), Final Destination gives us a totally new look on death. Has there ever been any way of death in movies that aren't murders, accidents, or suicides? Final Destination gives us something new: the form of death itself gets cheated by five teenagers who get removed from a plane which explodes in mid-air. They were supposed to die with the rest of the passangers. Now Death is mad, and it decides to kill off the teenagers one-by-one to balance things out, using accidents and framed suicides to hide the fact that death is on a rampage of revenge. As each character dies throughout the story, the main character Alex, who can somehow see the deaths before they happen, looks desperately and tries to find Death's pattern of killing, because if he finds that, they can cheat death again.<br/><br/>This movie has some problems, like the scene with the mortician, but because of the fresh story, the superb death scenes, the fine acting, and the very eerie feeling you get while watching the movie, you hardly even notice them. The movie also has great comedy in it, something only the Scream movies have perfected.<br/><br/>So all in all, Final Destination is a thrill machine that definitely kept me going the whole time. I very much hope that movies like these are made more often now that slashers are finally being forgotten."

","This movie is up there with the original Scream. It is full of suspense, frightening, and very entertaining. The opening sequence (the vision on the plane) starts out creepy, then gets downright terrifying. The subsequent killings are gory, but done in a creative manner (much like the killings in the early, good slasher films), so you are shocked and laughing at the same time. There are many little horror movie in-jokes and ""signs"" in the background of the movie (check out the license plate of the car) that point towards death, making it a natural for repeat viewing. Sure, there seems to be some inconsistencies (I never really could figure out that ""pattern"" of killings), but you just don't want to think too hard here because you're having too much fun.<br/><br/>As someone who has been watching all types of horror films for 30 years, I'm not easy to please or surprise.

","It's hard to explain exactly what I think of this film. If it can be placed under the category of teen slasher horror type flick (along with the ""Scream"" trilogy, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legends,"" and ""The Faculty""), then I'd have to admit it performed very well. Otherwise, if that is not what you are looking for, then just don't see it.<br/><br/>However, ""Final Destination"" gives a new twist to the genre (introduced by the tag line ""You can't cheat death"") by attacking and terrorizing the characters with a killer that absolutely cannot be killed (or stopped, as you will see in the end). And since the killer is not really human, the deaths don't necessarily have to be realistic (anything short of completely unbelievable is an understatement), which is actually somewhat refreshing; it forces you to kind of use your imagination; and if you can't, it provides the pretty (read: gory and bloody) pictures for you.<br/><br/>The main principles by which the characters follow regarding ""Death's Design"" was reminiscent of John Calvin's belief of predestination which ignited during the Protestant Reformation. This belief was that God decided in advance who lives and who dies. The movie reconstructs this idea very well, and even leaves you wondering whether they were right about Death's Design or whether they were just following the plan all along.<br/><br/>Other than all that, the film proves exciting through the end (you will NOT be bored), because as we all know, Death is relentless. People may complain about the ridiculous dialogue (which it has, but that's not what this genre is popular for) or about the idiotic actions of characters (which they are, but that is all too common and expected in slasher films), or the supernatural causes of death (which is what will make this movie memorable longer than Scream), but overall it does exactly what movies of this genre are supposed to do: scare you--scare you because you don't know who's going to die, and scare you even more if you do."

He goes nuts, he and some of his friends (and one teacher/chaperone) get kicked off the plane, and lo and behold, it explodes shortly after takeoff.  Amidst suspicion, Alex watches as his friends are picked off one by one by the force that had intended to kill them all on the plane, if not for their untimely escape.<br/><br/>This one gets some points for special effects (the plane crash ""vision"" at the beginning is superb!) and gore, but loses points for storyline.  This is just too contrived, and predictable.  It's the old ""we were supposed to die but we didn't and now it's coming back to finish us off"" theme.  I found that waiting to see who was going to die next, and in what fashion, was the most entertaining thing about this film.  Some of the methods, while nothing new, are portrayed quite well with the use of special effects.<br/><br/>This is obviously an attempt to cash in on the recent return of teen-slasher flicks, with a slightly new angle.

","'Final destination' starts out very fine indeed! From the ominous title-sequence, accompanied by Shirley Walkers effective score, until the inventive first murder, the atmosphere is thick with foreboding and threatening omens. And the airplane accident must surely be the most terrifying ever to be put onto celluloid! Scary stuff, to be sure!!! However, the movie goes downhill from there. The murders become more and more unconvincingly contrived (the bus-accident is a very well handled shock, though) and characters, grown-ups as well as adolescents, behave increasingly silly. Anyway, it's well above average for this kind of horror-thriller even if the final isn't as surprising as the filmmakers probably intended.

","Another teen horror flick in the wake of ""Scream 3"" written by the guys who put the creepy in the X-Files. Sounds like a wild ride or is it? The story centers around a group of teens who survive an airliner explosion through a bizarre incident. After the crash, one teen (Devon Sawa) becomes completely convinced that the Grim Reaper is after him and he is hunting the group in the way they should have died in the explosion. Producer, co-screenwriter, and director James Wong re-teams with his partner Glen Morgan for a stab at the silver screen. Morgan and Wong's greatest exploit has to have been the couple seasons of the X-Files where it became the staple for TV suspense and to this day the series is still trying to recapture. They have continue to dabble in TV with such series as the little seen but at times brilliant ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and NBC's recent hit ""The Others"". But with the debut of ""Final Destination it's the team's first real venture onto the silver screen. Destination starts off with a great opening 20 minutes where we are shocked and dumbfounded by the opening plot. I haven't seen that thrilling of a plane disaster scene since 1993's ""Alive"". Wow, what a scene. And as the film moves along a lot of the scenes are shocking and keep you on your toes. But it's the latter half of the film that bugged me. The time I am talking about is just when ex-Hollywood sex symbol Ali Larter's hair starts to get blonder. Ever notice that in Hollywood films they always dumb down the leading lady until she is supposed to catch the hero's eye? It's at that point that Sawa's avoidance of the Grim Reaper get really hokey. That cabin scene is a perfect example. Every movie like this needs a supernatural ending and the finale here is gimmickry and unrealistic. If you love the humor-horror trilogy of ""Scream"" like so many million people then Destination has all that to offer but watch out for a couple goofy things along the way.  I guess other ""Scream"" clone ""I Know What You Did this Summer"" and especially its sequel got this back lash too. The young people out there will love this, I am sure.

I would go as far as to say that what should have brought excitement to the screen made the film a bit boring and predictable. The ending was dire, are we supposed to believe that Alex was going to be killed ? - Give me a break.

It'll make you cringe, laugh and think beyond all conceivable doubt.  The film's line ""Am I next?"" is all that I can really remember of the script.  The crash scene in the plane is very realistic (too realistic in fact!). Don't go and see this if you have any fears of flying!  I give it a 6.5 out of 10."

You have a more powerful killer. The death. The thing that makes Final Destination so original and fresh is that you really never know when the surprises will jump right out of the screen. You don't have a lot of gore like, for example, you have in Hellbound Hellraiser 2 (another excellent horror film, check it out), but the way the people die will really scare the hell out of you!Final Destination is an original very well-written story, and you also have terrific performances, an excellent director and a very good production.

","Already on board of it, high school student Alex has a grizzly vision of the plane, that will take him and his schoolmates to France, exploding. He gets a fit, gets in a fight and he and four other kids and one teacher are thrown off the plane. The plane takes off without them and...it blows up. After the incident, Alex is avoided like the plague, but very soon Alex has the idea that he messed up the death-plan from above and he tries to warn his fellow survivors that they're still scheduled to be beamed up to the sky.<br/><br/>Okay, the fact that the 'enemy' is never shown and the teenagers are killed by apparently natural causes (although, how 'natural' is being badly cut by glass from an exploding computer monitor while you fall on a set of knives trying to escape your burning house?) is quite original but otherwise this is a by the numbers horror-flick with the usual bunch of teenagers. This movie even adds pseudo-philosophical chatter and the premise that everyone who ever escaped death will still be dealt with a little later is preposterous. While opening credits roll, we see cliche spooky things: a wind blowing; a curtain moving; a door slamming...it's the whole problem with this movie: it tries very hard to convince the viewer that it's scary; don't tell and constantly remind the audience that they're watching a scary movie -- just BE scary. A view of the demises are quite 'nice', others are boring, and guest actor Tony Todd's bull***t monologue and the avoidance of the name `God' because-we-want-to-keep-the-tone-of-the-film -'light'-and-don't-want-to-offend-religious-folks, brings this already mediocre movie down even more.

","In a crowded field of teen horror movies, it's a shame Final Destination didn't stand out more. It's well acted, well directed, and-- for the most part-- smartly written. Trouble is, it's inconsistent. Another problem is that ""Concept of Death"" is such a hard villain to root against (or for, if that's your taste).<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see high school characters played by actors who could probably get carded-- for the most part. Devon Sawa was great in the lead and played his role straight.<br/><br/>Ali Lerner is one to watch (um, professionally, I mean) though she was more engrossing in the sadly underrated ""House on Haunted Hill"" (a must-have film for horror collectors whose brief box office life I blame on ""The Haunting"" for souring audiences, but that's for another review).<br/><br/>Tony Todd's performance as the mortician is fantastic, but it's too brief. He should have been used more, at least in more than one scene.<br/><br/>Death has many ways of killing you in the bathroom, the kitchen, or on the street. You know people are going to die --and the writers know you know-- so the appeal is in ""how"" they get knocked off one by one. Glen Morgan and James Wong will treat you to some of the best red herrings in horror films, setting up so many ways to die that you're kept guessing.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's over the top. The teacher's death was more like a bloody Wile E. Coyote nightmare, enough was enough. The final confrontation with death is intense but fun-- the teacher's death was comical and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Kudos still go to Morgan and Wong for giving us a real storyline with real enough characters (I'd expect nothing less from the team that gave us Space: Above & Beyond), instead of the usual throwaway dialogue to fill time between killings. At times I wish the script had more balance of drama and horror, but they knew where the money was.<br/><br/>And more kudos go to Wong for raising the bar on airplane disasters in films.

"David Fick","5","0","0","7 July 2000"," (5/10) Excellent concept let down by poor execution
","Every once in a while a film gets made that is really bad  but that is, for some reason, enjoyable at the same time.  Final Destination falls into this category, as a film that works with an excellent concept, the potential of which is, sadly, unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The film is standard teen horror fare with a twist  the villain is no psycho waiting round the bend, but Death itself and the group of seven must try to find ways to cheat this supernatural power in order to stay alive. The key to solving the mystery is Alex (Devon Sawa)  who has the visions that allow him to save his friends, or ultimately condemn them to the life hereafter.<br/><br/>The fault of this film lies with the sloppy writing and the indifferent direction of the piece.  The dialogue is self-indulgent and immature and the level of characterization is poor, with no attempts at development or even a full depiction of the static characters which are presented here.  The vision which lies at the heart of the story remains there  it does not surface for the viewer to see; we do not actually care about the characters whose lives we touch by watching the film.<br/><br/>Of course, even the most skilled actors would struggle to perform such poorly written roles as the ones encountered in this screenplay.  Devon Sawa, who has lost his boyhood looks, does not have the presence to carry this film  or probably any other film  to success.  Ali Larter probably fares the best as the outcast Clear,  - the most credibly written character in the piece.  Kerr Smith is wasted in his role as Carter; this is nothing more than an attempt to move away from his television persona in Dawson's Creek. <br/><br/>Where this film does succeed, however, is in the elaborate death scenes which punctuate the narrative, creating an horrific and paranoiac tone which is easily taken home with the audience.  The handling of these scenes succeeds in creating large amounts of tension, and the outcome is disturbingly cathartic for those who witness them.<br/><br/>Final Destination could have been a great film  there are parts which spring to life, but as a whole the piece remains a mediocre study of the way in which we view death  and life."

Probably because what happens to the characters in the film could just as well happen to you or me. Innocent, everyday items suddenly become fatal instruments of death. I also liked the idea of fate and/or ""death"" being the killer, not some loony mask-covered psychopath. There was a nice creepy atmosphere to most of the film which I really enjoyed. And I walked out of the cinema with an eerie feeling, always looking over my shoulder and checking MANY times before I crossed the road. In that respect, the movie was brilliant. There were a couple of flaws, however, which somewhat muddled up the general impression. First of all, the ""Billy"" character. Now why do scary films nowadays have to have this clichèd ""funny"" types in them, always making silly comments at the wrong moments? Take some of the ""golden oldies"" of horror - ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Omen"", ""The Exorcist"" - they became a success because they kept the scary mood going throughout the film, not mixing it up with stupid attempts at humor. It just ruins the whole atmosphere of the film. Secondly, I felt the ending was a bit stretched, and it does open up nicely for a sequel...But, all in all, I enjoyed this film; I found the acting to be generally believeable (which is not always true of teen horror movies), and I was repeatedly scared and surprised by some of the sudden happenings in the movie. Oh - and the airplane sequence at the beginning is...upsetting, to say the least.

","James Wong and Glen Morgan, the team behind TV favourites The X-Files' and Space: Above and Beyond' move into Kevin Williamson territory with this teen-horror flick. But can they beat the Scream-king at his own game? Well, no, to be honest.<br/><br/>A group of teenagers (who all 'ironically' have the same surnames as classic horror directors) bound for Paris leave their plane when Alex (Devon Sawa) has a disturbing vision of the plane exploding. Guess what? The plane takes off and explodes in mid-air. Death, it seems, isn't too happy at a load of irritating American kids getting away with it, and comes after them one by one, contriving increasingly bizarre and gruesome accidents for them to succumb to. Alex realises this and sets about trying to cheat death again.<br/><br/>This is as good a concept as any for this type of film and you can forgive Wong, who directs, the element of silliness that creeps in towards the end. But other factors are missing. None of the characters are particularly well written, with Alex and his friend Tod (Chad Donella) being the most appealing. When Tod, previously the source of the humour, buys it rather too early, the film rests on Sawa as Alex. He doesn't do a bad job, but he just isn't leading-man material, being neither attractive or funny enough to carry this sort of film. The rest of the teenagers are a hotch-potch of divorce-affected arty types, stupid jocks (Seann William Scott, Stifler from 'American Pie', is badly wasted) and rebellious macho-men, most of whom you just want to see kicking the bucket as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>
That said, the shocks come quick and fast and some are extremely well-done and entirely unexpected. Others are over-contrived and farcical, but they all do the job  by the end of it all, you'll be paranoid about kitchen utensils and air travel will seem a very bad idea.

","Final Destination' was disappointing. I expected a clever, intelligent splatterfest along the lines of Scream' but this is a poor imitation. The initial idea is good  a bunch of students cheating death by plane crash by receiving a premonition, then death catching up with them, but it fails to live up to it's promise. <br/><br/>This film tries hard to be SOMETHING  but whatever it is it just doesn't happen. For instance, one of the students is in the bathroom; spooky music starts up; he's sitting on the loo (ouch); a tap underneath comes loose by itself & water drips out; he gets up from the loo (phew); he sees a shadow in the mirror; he picks up a razor & cuts himself on the neck; the water moves purposefully towards his bare feet; NO, he's put down the razor & walks away just before the water touches his feet; he plugs in a radio (water, electricity  ouch); again he moves just before the water reaches him; etc., etc. Is this supposed to be funny, knowingly clever, scary, all three? I don't know, but for me it was just dull.<br/><br/>This sort of voyeuristically sadistic who's going to get it next & how' game, although basically in very bad taste, can be very funny: for instance in Scream'. The difference is that Scream' is clever enough to make it obvious that the characters being bumped off in increasingly messy ways were parodies of themselves & not meant to be taken seriously; here however it seems we're supposed to believe that they are real. In expecting us to take sadistic delight in guessing who gets it next & in what particularly grisly manner I think makes a movie like this just plain nasty, & childishly so.<br/><br/>
At the risk of getting a touch of the Mary Whitehouses (God forbid) I think it is exactly this sort of movie which contributes to making society, (particularly American society & with it the rest of the Western world), numb to pain, suffering & violence in a way that immunises us from the real thing: so that the war in the Gulf, the Kosovan crisis, become just another TV show -  & we forget that there are real people out there suffering & dying horribly, or maybe we just don't care. <br/><br/>OK  end of sermon! I said we're supposed to believe the characters are real  supposed' because they are badly realised, & mostly caricatures: either shallow & nasty, stupid or plain dull. It's possible we're meant to think that they are in fact parodies of themselves but if this is the case it's so badly done it just doesn't come across at all. In fact I doubt if that much thought has gone into it. There are a few genuine shocks & funny moments, mostly based around sudden & unexpected deaths, (although in hindsight I think I found it funny because I wanted it to be so), but overall this left me flat. After the 1st sticky death I lost interest, I didn't give a monkeys' about the characters, the story was thin & the direction mediocre. The best part of the whole thing was a brief cameo by Tony Candyman' Todd as a creepy mortician.<br/><br/>This is doubly disappointing for me as director James Wong along with co-writer Glen Morgan were responsible for some of the very best of the early X-Files' as well as Space: Above & Beyond' & are capable of much better than this. <br/><br/>My verdict: best avoided  unless you're a schoolkid, which I suspect is the target audience: 'it's not big, & it's not clever'. <br/><br/>RATING: 3/10"

It kept me on the edge of my seat more for this reason than for any shock/horror value (although there are a few gory moments, but these don't dominate the film).

Take a look at the first interrogation scene and laugh in the knowledge that anyone could have shot it better.<br/><br/>On the upside, the sound is good and it will make you jump a few times.

","I agree with the many commenters here who rate Final Destination highly while conceding its lame script and painfully one-dimensional portrayals. Seems like every few minutes there was a line of dialog or plot device that made me want to roll my eyes.  Yet the film still rattled me in the right places.  It's very suspenseful despite several elements that just about anyone would find predictable or contrived.  In the latter category (MILD SPOILER AHEAD), I was both entertained and embarrassed by the incredibly convoluted Rube-Goldberg-style buildup to almost every death or near-death. It's quite unrealistic that nobody dies *simply* in this film, but the whole premise of the story pretty well dismisses a requirement for realism anyway."

When something would occur that you might expect, something would happen right afterward that one would not expect.  So, im my opinion that made up for it.  I dunno, I kinda liked it.

","In the wake of the post modern teen slasher blood fests that were Scream 1, 2 & 3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, H20 and the other million, it is rare to catch a Late 20th Century, Early 21st century horror that seems up to the task of the genre. That is creating tension and scaring the bejesus out of its audience. Final Destination (Aside from the very lack-lustre title sequence that has been done to a death) succeeds on almost every level.<br/><br/>Wonderfully acted by a cast of relatively unknown actors, (Kerr Smith of Dawson's Creek and Aly Larter of House on Haunted Hill being the only real known stars) the story is tried and tested, what Wong has to do is tell it in a new, better way.<br/><br/>The opening 25 minutes, right up to the planes explosion, are adrenaline packed and succeed in drawing you into the spiders web that is the story. A guy who predicts a plane crash and saves the lives of six people only to then realise that you can't cheat death, it will come back and get ya. The little details make the film good, the silhouetted toy that appears to be hanging (a la Bone Collector), the cameo by Tony Todd (a la David Warner in Scream 2), the subtlety of the gusts of wind (a la Twister), all add up to create the environment that we desire.<br/><br/>The film does have its shocks and its scares but on the whole isn't a film about trying to physically scare its audience. The outright scare sequence are few and far between. Instead of physically scaring his audience, Wong strives to create dramatic and uneasy tension. The fate of the seven people has already been written, the question is, can they change the script?<br/><br/>One criticism of the film would lie in its traditional 'pre-ending-ending' Seemingly wrapping things up, then stopping, looking around and saying, hold up, there's more. The film could and probably should have had the conviction to stray away from this cliched finale and come up with something new and original.

","This film is certainly the best teen horror/thriller that we've seen in a few years (since Scream & I Know What You Did...) It starts with a tense, spooky 15 min opening scene, then picks up speed and never stops. Final Destination ups the spook factor and distinguishes itself with its killer, Death. We never see any manifestation of death other than a shadow here, a sudden wind there, which is much more frightening than a psycho killer. The deaths are truly inspired and surprising. The writers take everyday situations and add an inspired macabre twist. The characters are a little stereotypical, but the young actors are better than most. Kerr Smith stands out, taking on a character completely different from Dawson's Creek's Jack, and though I never particularly cared for Devon Sawa before, he carries his lead role here wonderfully. This is the best night at the movies I've had in quite a while, and I was still spooked well after the movie was over."

","After 20 odd years of almost countless movies whose titles include the words ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" and all the imitators that followed, it would seem impossible that a truly original idea for the basic teen slasher movie could have survived.   Oddly enough, Final Destination is different, although, for the most part, it still remains as predictable.<br/><br/>
In Final Destination these kids are downright geniuses compared to the morons that are usually running scared in those other films.   They have more depth, and deep philosophical insight.   Also, instead of trying to escape a weird psychotic killer, they must find a way to escape fate. Death itself is the enemy, and death is no fool.<br/><br/>The major factor that raises the intelligence quotient of this movie is the X-Files alumni Glen Morgan (screenplay) and James Wong (director).   The lighting and camera angles have a familiar look and feel.   The story and dialog have that unnatural creepiness that gnaws at the back of you skull.<br/><br/>

","I managed to see FINAL DESTINATION on a recent trip to America and I had high expectations as I had heard the premise and I was intrigued by the possibility of a horror film with an enemy that was impossible escaping from, Death. The film starts with a cracking opener. Alex Browning is (Sawa) about to take a flight to Paris with his school. He has an horrific premonition where the plane explodes mid-air, killing everyone on board. He then wakes and is desperate to get off. Him and a couple of others, including a teacher, get thrown off the plane. As they are waiting at the airport they witness what Alex feared would come true. Soon after this, they soon start dying in mysterious and gruesome circumstances. The death scenes are highly inventive and much more violent than anything SCREAM or URBAN LEGEND could come up with. The film lets you down in one respect as you hope after the opening scene, the film would be a mysterious thriller. All you realise it is used for is a gimmick for a teen slasher movie, without a slasher. But, compared to other teen slasher flicks, FINAL DESTINATION stands head above its peers. The acting is surprisingly great (LARTER is definitely one to watch), the pace is breakneck, the film is well shot and there are some genuine shocks. Think SAMUEL L's nasty surprise in DEEP BLUE SEA. Plus there is a great cliffhanger final scene. An added bonus is the film's non-Hollywood style. The slogan, You Can't Cheat Death is wonderfully cynical and no character, despite their place in the credits is above a gruesome execution. All, in all FINAL DESTINATION is a great teen horror film. Nothing more, nothing less."

","We've all heard the phrase, `kids do the craziest things-they think they're invincible.""  Given the recent surge of teen slasher movies like ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend,"" Hollywood producers are well aware of this truth. Seems like they're serving up a little reminder to the youth of America: Your number could come up at any moment, just like anybody else.<br/><br/>Even if Hollywood has no such intentions, it has discovered that their younger audiences are getting more sophisticated and are looking for new and clever ways to see themselves get killed. The latest killing spree film, Final Destination, doesn't mess around with guns and psycho killers, but gets right to the point: The killer here literally IS Death, which proves It can get pretty creative when it comes time to claim somebody. The idea is that Death has a design for everyone, that each moment of our lives is just a cycle of events that lead up to the End.  We're free to live our lives as long as Death lets us. Pretty depressing stuff but there is a point, which I'll explore in a minute. First, the nuts and bolts of the story...<br/><br/>Seems Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a high school senior, is given a special, unexplained ability to foresee his demise.  He sees it exactly as it's going to happen, in one of the most terrifying sequences ever filmed.  Apparently Death hadn't taken this into account; Alex goes berzerk and warns others of what's about to happen. A few people are saved, but most of the people involved proceed right into Death's arms, just as Alex foresaw (I'm not going to give away the details of this opening sequence, simply because too many other people, plus the film's trailer, have already ruined it). So here we have seven people who Death was all ready to claim, alive and safe. Apparently, this makes Death mad and It starts to pick them off one by one. Seeing as these people, five of Alex's fellow students and one teacher, defied Death's original plan, Death has to get creative. The most mundane of household objects, most of which we would never think of as lethal, are used together in bizarre, sometimes silly, chain reactions of events that lead to the kill.  All of these scenes are shocking, gruesome, or both, so be warned: this film is not for everybody.<br/><br/>Along with having visions of his own death, Alex is able to foresee others' deaths and tries again to cheat the Reaper. He beat It once, and believes he can do so again (ah, the ego of the teenage male). There's a scene in which Alex knows it's his turn to go, so he locks himself inside a remote cabin and duct tapes down anything and everything that could possibly turn into a lethal object. He eats pudding from a tin can, having used leather work gloves to open it, sloshing the food around in his mouth to make sure there's nothing hard inside that he could choke on. This was a funny moment, and humor is something this movie uses well to give the audience a break. The scene reminded me of the way a parent of a curious toddler would start to think about household objects in a way she never thought of them before. This parent starts thinking of scenarios in which, a ball of yarn for instance, could become lethal.  Whether you think this is wisdom or paranoia, that parent understands one thing: Death does not discriminate. It happens to the helpless, the innocent, those who least `deserve' it. As cold and unfeeling as this film seems most of the time, it takes care to illustrate this point.<br/><br/>This ain't no masterpiece, but this was an innovative piece of work; a worthy first crack at feature directing by TV veteran James Wong.  In the simplest terms, Final Destination is one hell of a good thrill ride. Suspend your disbelief at the ticket office and buckle up.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","Horror? Well, no. Not really. Final Destination manages to be horrifying only in a scene or two throughout its plot, though it is scary in its own way. The obsessive use of symbols and references to death would actually have been clever if it wasn't used somewhat heavy handedly at points. Some of the character relationships just don't make sense, and could have used more background to develop them. And the whole deal about the FBI trying to pin the death of his friends on the protagonist, who is convinced he's found ""death's pattern"" and is working to beat it just never quite worked for me, which is just as well, since it would have been too predictable anyway.<br/><br/>I did like the overall concept, though. Don't get me wrong on that. So often to we hear and use the term ""cheating death"" that it is refreshing to see death doesn't always take it lying down. <g> And by eschewing the temptation to make death a personified figure and instead using wild, chaotic forces in the world around us as the agents of death's plan, Final Destination managed to be scarier than a typical slasher style movie would have ever managed. In fact, if only I had felt more for the characters, and understood better their relationships, I might actually have loved this movie.<br/><br/>As it is, I am eagerly looking forward to some future film making genius remaking it someday."

Final Destination is an excellent film that brings about audience interaction when the elaborate death scenes are playing out on screen.  The basic plot is seven people survive a horrific plane crash after Alex (Devon Sawa) has a vision of the plane blowing up. The survivors are soon to learn that by surviving the explosion they upset Death's plan, and now the Grim Reaper is after revenge.  Unlike most teen horror flicks, Final Destination is actually quite low on gore, and actually has intelligent deaths.  What's more, its nature that is killing them, so the movie isn't spoilt by some wacky character in a halloween mask.  If you like suspense (this movie loves to draw out the scary scenes) and horror combined, this movie is a must see.<br/><br/>Oh, and for those who don't know a Rube Goldberg device is a machine made up of normally unrelated objects, that when combined in a certain pattern and ""set off"" culminate in a single action.

","Newline has obviously paid a number of desperate people to leave favorable comments about this movie.  There is no other explanation that permits me my sanity.  <br/><br/>I was marginally excited during the very first death scene.  At least it briefly stopped me from wondering whether or not the projectionist would spill some coke and mercifully begin a chain of events leading to the explosion of the theater. That this scene occurs a good half hour into the movie didn't bother me as much as the fact that the half hour clearly hints that the actual final destination will be a town I am forced to visit far too often: middle-class-white cliche city.  <br/><br/>Is this a realistic portrayal of American teens?  Sadly, it often is.  Does this make me care whether or not and how Cindy and Bobby will die and what their romantic preferences are?  It's like asking me to care about what brand of tomato soup tastes the best.  Any imaginable alternative will be plain, bland, predictable, and will significantly increase the likelihood of future heart failure.  <br/><br/>Suffice it to say, I pretty much predicted the key moments in the 'plot' a good five excruciating minutes beforehand.  This 'plot' also manages to flow about as smoothly as a monkeywrench through my colon.  Although I must admit the sudden flashes forward in time and the abrupt meaningless ending gives me hope that the director experienced a sudden flash of intelligence on the set and ran off screaming into the Canadian wilderness.  If only the brainless moviegoers could achieve a similar enlightenment.<br/><br/>P.S. I did not pay to see this movie, if I had I would be writing this from a hospital ward or more likely one of our nation's many fine asylums."

The movie basically is a series of random people getting horribly killed in random ways.  I can imagine the ""Writers"" of this movie sitting around saying: ""Okay, lets introduce a cast of characters... and then they'll all die... think we can stretch that into two hours?""  It has no redeeming value whatsoever.  I am not exaggerating, this movie must be stopped.  If it isn't it may be the downfall of civilization as we know it.  People who see it will suddenly lose the will to live.  For God's sake please do not see this movie.  I'm not sure I can live with the guilt that I actually paid money to see this.

","This is an interesting piece of work.<br/><br/>It was conceived and shot by crew members from ""The X-Files,"" and such, the directorial style is not as cinematic as it could be.  Shots and effects are simple and underwhelming, like you'd find on TV; they do what the script calls for and little more.  But the script itself is a remarkable piece of work.<br/><br/>As such, the film is smarter than you'd think it to be.  What most people would pass off as ""just a Horror film,"" is actually an incredibly taught Suspense film, that just happens to have some rather disturbing gory death scenes.<br/><br/>Sawa is a remarkable actor, he shows a lot more depth and talent here than he showed in the Intelligence-Isn't-Necessary (but still entertaining) ""Idle Hands.""  My only complaint is his under-reacting to watching friends get killed right in front of him, but I'd peg that on under-directing.  See above.<br/><br/>What is the Final Destination for all of us?  Who decides our fate?  What can we see in the world around us to answer these questions?<br/><br/>This film made me think, but it can be enjoyed on the level of Popcorn Flick, as well.  The concept, and its execution, were remarkably clever.  I hope James Wong is allowed to direct more films, so he can learn as he goes. This was a GREAT script, but only a GOOD director.  The finished product is still a lot of fun to watch (if you can stomach the death scenes, which are all more gory than they really need to be).<br/><br/>If I were grading this film I'd give it an 85 out of 100, but since we're dealing on a different scale, I'll round up.  9 out of 10."

Rather than an unhinged serial killer driven by a minor slight, the pursuer here is Death itself.  I was glad to see that the producers didn't rely on CGI effects for a grim hooded specter.  Instead, Death is a quiet and subtle foe announced only by a wisp of wind, a brief shadow, or an unnerving hum- which makes for an unsettling effect. <br/><br/>
The dialogue is definitely lacking (but I didn't go in expecting Hamlet) and several of the characters do nothing but whine - their deaths couldn't come soon enough for me. There is however a palpable tension which will keep you engaged, and deliver a few jumps.  <br/><br/>Make it a matinee."

"kfurnas","7","0","0","1 April 2000"," So far this year it sets the standard for thriller movies
","Few thrillers explore just how terrifying death can be. Most are concerned with mysteries, chases and nearly immortal bad guys.<br/><br/>""Final Destination,"" however, seems to want to put the entire focus of fright on death itself. Viewers find themselves thinking much more about how they think characters are going to die, and less about why.<br/><br/>Such a result can be chiefly attributed to the plot. Devon Sawa plays a high school student set to take a class trip to France. However, before the plane takes off, he envisions its explosion and demands to be removed from the plane. The commotion forces several other passengers off the plane, and, taking off without them, it explodes in mid-air.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie, those who got off the plane are stalked by death itself, who apparently was not amused by being cheated out of several lives.<br/><br/>There's little in terms of a story here, and the acting is just sort of blah. But by having no real villain in the film, it frees the death scenes into becoming among the most elaborate productions of any movie. There are no guns, axes or knives (well, almost no knives) that are standard in every other horror flick. Instead, this movie creates death scenes that require complex chains of events.<br/><br/>The thought this movie must have taken is amazing  not only to imagine the half-dozen death scenes that are in the movie  but to create circumstances that mislead the viewer into thinking others will occur.<br/><br/>Execution helps pull everything together. As elaborate and fast-paced as the action sequences are, the viewer can still figure out how it works because of perfect camera work.<br/><br/>The problems with this movie all result from a fruitless effort to make the movie overly intelligent. For example, as Sawa's character tries to figure out how to cheat death again, he breaks in to the mortuary to visit death's first victim after the plane crash. If that weren't ridiculous enough, he is confronted by the mortician who tells him (in a spooky voice) the secret behind death. This scene could (and should) have simply been deleted from the movie.<br/><br/>When the movie is not trying to be too intellectual, however, it's terrificly frightening and makes viewers squirm in their seats. So far this year, it sets the standard for thriller movies."

Critics who give this movie the credit of being ""highly realistic"" must have their heads screwed on backwards. Please. Only in a movie would some wind or a little crack lead to a highly elaborate and gruesome death.<br/><br/>It wasn't a poorly made film, actually it was done rather well. It has its moments (I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the best scene is about a quarter of a second long and involves a bus.) But where is the script? Where's the ending? Where's everything else that was meant to be explained? This movie really left questions on the tips of everyone's tongues. How come Alex, or only Alex, saw before hand what would happen with the plane? And what happened to the guy they met in the morgue? He was intended to be the grim reaper, right? Or maybe I just thought that the script was trying to be clever but in actuality it really was dumb.<br/><br/>And as far as I'm concerned, there is no ending. NO ending. Six months later they arrive at Paris, suddenly strike up a conversation about what happened, and then it suddenly starts happening again? And then the movie ends the way it does. Sheeesh. Its almost as if they got tired of writing the script so they just threw something together so they could get it out of the way.<br/><br/>Some people said, well they didn't explain it all because there will probably be a sequel.

I will save you one torture I had to endure throughout the film: there is no twist. If you've seen the trailer, you know exactly what happens in the film!

","While being a devout Horror fan for over a decade, I must sadly confess that I've missed out on many of the classics, by which I mean that even if I did end up eventually watching them, I was far too old to really appreciate them (and have thus lost most of the scare-effect in classics such as Children of the Corn, The Omen, Village of the Damned, and don't even get me started on Chucky). Thankfully, Final Destination is simply an excellent film, and therefore immortal.<br/><br/>The story altogether is original and compelling, showing a teenager which an obvious fear of flights getting a premonition of his plain bursting into flames. Thus he discovers his power to comprehend and anticipate death's ""pattern"", thereby avoiding it. What he doesn't realize before it's too late is that nobody cheats death. At first the story feels a little mixed up and not too well presented, even considering director James Wong's former known project (The X Files). With no build up whatsoever, the unfolding of the story feels like a long episode of the cult series, for better or for worse. Also, certain parts of the story are simply left out, and the audience is left with the sole option of figuring things out relying on later scenes. While not a dire shortcoming - this still feels amateurish and bluntly unnecessary, especially considering the few seconds it would have taken to set things right.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting, or more appropriately the cast. As a huge fan of both SLC Punk and Idle Hands, I simply couldn't take Devon Sawa as a serious (even tragic) character. I kept half expecting the joke or wise crack to magically appear around him, and that's the last thing one would want while watching a Horror film. Luckily I'd never realized he played the role of Stan in Eminem's music video, or it would have been ruined for me too. I assume this is a personal problem, as Sawa is a great actor and performs beautifully, and yet. Then of course there's the slightly weird choice of casting Steven Stifler as Billy (which brings us to the question - why have a Billy in the first place? Such films have absolutely zero need for a comic relief, this is not a slasher parody). After his immortal performance in American Pie (and later Road Trip), even seeing his face in a Horror film severely damages the sensation of fear and suspense. Lastly, Kristen Cloke as Miss Lewton. Having a young high- school teacher is a risky move, and takes some talented maneuvering to pull off (for instance Drew Barrymore in Donnie Darco). Cloke, while obviously a talented actress following bad directing instructions, is far too timid and overdoes the whole damsel in distress routine. Having such a character as a teacher, after presented as strong and secure at first, felt unrealistic (yes, I realize she's been traumatized, yet as I've said - overdoing it).<br/><br/>Then, of course, the ending, following a very weak plot twist (if it can even qualify as one) and being as predictable as one could imagine, and far too comical. If Sawa and Scott were too comic for my personal liking, the ending is simply too comical for the average Horror viewer. With such an ending as the wrapping paper, the entire project stinks of ""I want to be mainstream"". This is Horror... why try and be mainstream instead of trying to make a better film?<br/><br/>Please understand, the reason I have so much concrete criticism isn't by far that Final Destination is a bad film. On the contrary, the original and innovative story (even today, 16 years later! Hats off to screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick) could and would have been enough to make this film a masterpiece. Sadly, all these bad choices by Wong turned what could have been an excellent film, to just a good film. Such potential gone to waste...<br/><br/>All in all, I had a great time watching this. While obviously more Suspense than Horror, it's definitely one of the classics, and if at 30 and 16 years after its debut it still managed to leave such an impressive mark on me - I can't recommend it enough."
"mattiasflgrtll6","10","1","2","13 July 2015"," A modern horror classic!
","I love this movie. The concept sounded very intriguing, so I decided to give it a watch.<br/><br/>It starts off calm enough. However, it only takes mere minutes before you start to feel something is wrong. The signs changing by themselves to ""Final Destination"", GOD was that creepy! And it only gets worse. Alex Browning (the main character) knows something is wrong, he just can't put his finger on it yet. Soon, something horrible happens...! The plane falls apart and is about to explode! But this hasn't happened yet. It turns out it was Alex having a vision, so he then warns everyone what is going to happen. Only a few seem to understand that he's serious, but a few lives saved is better than no lives saved at all. Don't worry folks, this is NOT a spoiler. I thought so at first and went ""Jesus, give away the whole movie, why won't you?!"". But thankfully, I was wrong. Traumatized, but relieved, he comes out of the plane alive with a couple of people, seven or so. So everything is fine, right? Hell no! Shortly afterwards, one of the survivors die in the most bizarre way possible! (when you see it, you will be terrified at how cruel the death is, but also laugh at how inanely stupid it looks) And the killer is no one less than Death itself! Now this I found interesting. That it's not some slasher-type maniac but an entity you can't escape instead, is MUCH, MUCH scarier and chilling. Alex believes the death is not a coincidence and so, with the help of Clear Rivers, tries to figure out the mystery... Was the plane crash MEANT to happen? Is it possible to cheat Death?<br/><br/>This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Afterwards, I found myself looking around, wondering if any object near me could kill me!<br/><br/>Everything is excellent. The cinematography, the acting (Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were marvelous in their respective roles), the music and the overall direction (James Wong was a brilliant writer at The X Files, and seems to be doing just as well directing) couldn't have been better. It's also a movie where you have to pay attention, or you won't understand all the revelations in the plot. It's difficult not to spoil this movie, but let me just say that not only is it really spooky, it actually has its bit of dark comedy as well. And rarely have there been as many moments in a horror movie for me where I've been frightened and in hysterics at the same time. And it even has a great ending. A satisfying ending for a horror movie is always a pickle, since it in some cases can be too ludicrous or cheesy. But here it was simply perfect. The characters also all have their interesting personalities. I'm pleasantly surprised over how I actually cared about almost everybody, even that dumb jerk Carter. Well okay, Valerie Newton was an unbearable selfish bastard. That's one exception right there. By the way, there's also... Bludworth. I have no idea who on earth he is supposed to be or what the hell is wrong with him... but he unsettles me. His voice got under your skin and he almost sounded like something evil was lurking under the surface. It's disappointing that he appeared so little, but at least he's in the sequel too. Maybe he has a larger role there. Tony Todd was like a natural in that part.<br/><br/>Now, there is one strange detail... It's never explained or even hinted at, why Alex has these visions. How can he foresee deaths? Where did this gift come from? But this is a really small complaint. There was so much about the movie to adore and be inspired by that I could look past that and just find myself entertained.<br/><br/>Listen up, you talentless modern day horror directors: THIS is how you make a scary piece of work!<br/><br/>One last thing to you who read this: In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps and no escapes."
"Screen_Blitz","8","1","2","11 July 2015"," An intriguing teen horror-thriller
","James Wong, director of the hit television series ""X-Files"", steps inside the teen-horror genre with this intriguing disaster-thriller. Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), a high school senior is on his way on a week-long field trip with his French class to Paris. Shortly upon boarding the plane, Alex has a horrifying vision of the plane exploding. Plagued with paranoia, Alex panics and rushes off the plane, with seven others removed off board. Much to everyone's shock, Alex's nightmare comes true when the plane unexpectedly explodes upon takeoff, killing everyone on board. The survivors off board include Alex's best friend Todd (Chad E. Donella), his arch-rival Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terri (Amanda Detmer), orphaned girl Clear (Ali Larter), tag-along student Billy (Seann William Scott), and their teacher Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). While many become grief- stricken by their losses, Alex discovers that death is still after them when the survivors who originally escaped their demise begin dying in freak accidents.<br/><br/>Final Destination was definitely one of the most original horror films Hollywood has it offer. This isn't a typical horror movie. Instead of a blade-wielding killer in a mask, girls possessed by evil spirits, or people being attacked by monstrous creatures; this film deals with the killer being death itself. The concept involves teenagers who escape a deadly plane explosion and begin dying in really unusual accidents. Basically, these characters get killed from doing average, everyday stuff like cooking or hanging clothes. Yes, this may sound somewhat laughable, but this film does a good job making this suspenseful and intense. The plane crash sequence was pretty intense for me, it almost had me scared of going another plane ride. The death scenes were also pretty intense, although I think they could have been done better. <br/><br/>I really love the characters in this movie. Each one of the characters are very well developed and have their own personality. Alex, the main character was easily my favorite, along with Ali Larter's character Clear, the girl who stands by Alex's side after the plane disaster; unlike the other characters who blame Alex for the deaths of the people on the plane. The cast did an alright job as their characters, none of them really stand out from others."

","From the opening reel, as the haunting ominous music score plays, a evil and ugliness presents itself. As stopping at the dreaded number three of this series, (number two was a pretty good sequel) of course this one being the best, I liked the whole cool scenario, indeed something different. If I watched FD, again, (I haven't seen it was for years), it would pretty much have about the same impact of eerieness and foreboding, as first time around. On a class holiday to France, Devon Sawa (what happened to him) has a premonition the plane he boards, him and his mates board will burst into smithereens seconds after take off. Him and a score of students get off the plane. The others stay on it. The plane takes off again. Boom! It's just like Sawa envisioned. Then death starts hunting Sawa and his mates down, one by one, in a series of freak accidents. So becoming the hero here, Sawa must find a way to curb and beat this evil, before the handful become fewer. This is a cool 2000 movie, something completely different of that year. What's terrifying about Final Destination, is the story concept, as of the surviving kids, where death is inevitable, their fates decided. You're thinking, ""How could these survivors die, being so lucky?"". But, that was the killer element I loved. Some of them die in some pretty gruesome ways too, though this doesn't compare to No 2, I should warn you. It's frightening to imagine, living in a world where this story would be true. A comparison as to inevitability and fate, is like in the Hostel movies, where some lucky victims escape, but they're all not lucky for long, as the Elite hunts em' down. Their fates inevitable. Same frightening point here. Just check out it's last shock shot. FD boasts good performances from some up and coming stars, but as to lead, Sawa's diminishing future in thespian world, I can't help but feel sad if a little bugged. Chilling haunting psycho supernatural thriller/horror, all the way."

There is a plan of leaving this mortal coil in a specific order and you dare not disrupt the order.<br/><br/>After which the rest start dropping in a series of bizarre situations and this has been the secret of the success of Final Destination and its sequels.

","""But what if it was our time? What if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it still is our time?""<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone on Earth knows how these movies work, by now. A group of people (attractive teenagers, for the most part) narrowly escape certain Death as participants in some disaster. Yes, Death, with a capital D. But Death is not to be denied, so he sets up increasingly elaborate scenarios to kill off the survivors, while they attempt to thwart his plans yet again and live another day. <br/><br/>As you can tell from the description, these movies are basically just about the death scenes and trying to guess how each person is going to bite the bullet, before it happens. They're like Saw without the torture and convoluted back story.<br/><br/>Compared to the movies that came later in the series, the original Final Destination isn't nearly as inventive or brutal with its death scenes. Some of them will seem downright tame to today's audiences (this movie was released way back in 2000, after all). But, if you're a genre fan who can still find entertainment in even a mild dose of this formula, Final Destination probably won't be a waste of your 98 minutes."
"kdnor2011","7","1","2","11 July 2010"," I thought this movie would suck...I was wrong
","I'm actually a pretty big fan of the Final Destination series, I got into it after watching the third film. I actually watched this series in a weird order. I got caught up before the fifth movie came out, but I saw the others in order of 3,4,2,1. So when I finally did get around to watching the first movie, I actually thought it might suck. Because the fourth and second didn't really impress me very much. Well thankfully it just turns out that 2 and 4 weren't very good, because Final Destiantion turned out to be a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film would probably be the tone it goes for. Give the sequels credit, they were horror-comedy's. This film is straight up horror, sure we have Billy as the comedy relief, but for the most part this film is just a dreary dark horror film. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that the death scenes don't match well with the tone, and it becomes a little uneven. Sure getting hit by a bus is kind of simple. But the rest are pretty over the top that it becomes kind of funny. Also I don't care much for the subplot with the FBI, I can't understand how they would think this kid would kill his friends, or how he would even do it.<br/><br/>But the death scenes are actually pretty cool, they may not be overly complex, but they are just over the top enough to be entertaining. Most of the characters are likable, and portrayed very well by the young actors. Sure there are the characters you love to hate, but that just makes it more satisfying when they die. I laughed a descent number of times, and actually felt sad and sorry for these people. The effects are great and I love the final shot.<br/><br/>Final Destination is a pretty good movie, it's entertaining enough, and the characters are likable. The only big problem is that the tone and death scenes don't match that well."
"thekyles99","7","1","2","30 June 2010"," Wow, Hollyweird can be original???!!
","The first instalment of this ever so cool franchise. Although i find this the weakest one of the lot it still is very cool and stars the seldom seen underrated actor Devon sawa. These movies in this film have such an intense yet true story to tell. You cant cheat death, when its your time its your time and there is nothing you can do about it. When horror/thrillers were at there all time low (god they are doing this storyline again?) out came this film by director James Wong , an original idea something Hollyweird has been lacking of for the last 10 or so years. This original instalment has a school trip to Paris France , all the students are boarding and getting their seats when young Alex Browning drifts off and has a scary but unseemingly real dream that the plane is going to explode he and a few people who are either caught in his paranoia or believe him get escorted off the plane as to which they all watch in terror as the plane explodes just after take off. Did Alex save them? Maybe for now however the moral of these films and the story here is when your time is up your time is up. If you are one of the few who haven't had the pleasure of viewing any of the films in this ever so excellent series then i totally suggest you give these a try all 4 instalments. They only get better and better."

While watching this movie I was totally into it, predicting what would be the next scene(who dies next). The first 15 minutes of this film is exhilarating(Especially the Plane crash scene). <br/><br/>The story as follows, Alex browning(Devon Sawa) is getting ready to leave on a class trip to France. while on the plane he has a vision that the plan is going to explode and soon he realizes that's really gonna happen. Immediately he goes crazy telling everyone the plane is going to explode. eventually 6 students and alex leave the plane and after a moments the plane takes off it explodes. This is where the story gets interesting by getting off the plane Alex soon realizes that him and his friends have cheated Death and they have to figure out when death is coming back at them.<br/><br/>The concept of this movie looks stupid but who cares when there is tight gripping screenplay with lot of thrills to enjoy.

"blacklist-1","9","1","2","11 April 2010"," The best of the four no doubt!
","With three sequels under it's belt and two main directors James Wong who did FD 1 and 3 and David Ellis who did 2 and 4. The Final Destination franchise has been an enjoyable one. The first is of the best no doubt. As a general occurrence in Hollywood movies whatever the genre the first if there are sequels will always be the best though some in recent years has reversed that assumption like Spiderman 2 and Lethal Weapon 2.<br/><br/>Here though the first one is the best. James Wong directs this with skill and ease. He clearly knows his target demographics for this film horror fans and a teenage audience of fifteen years to early twenties. This being the case as all the main characters apart from one are teenagers. Looking at some of the reviews here FD has been highly criticised for a lot of aspects, which is fair enough as everyone has there own opinion. But let me tell you why this movie I give deserves a nine.<br/><br/>First off the deaths are extremely inventive, there is plenty of gore so those with a weak stomach wouldn't like this. With the sequels the deaths though still gruesome aren't very scary and you more tended to laugh, but with the first one there are some genuinely scary moments that did throw me off balance like when the bus kills Terry Chaney (played by Amanda Detmer), that just scared the crap out of me. Also the start with the plane crashing in Alex's premonition had me on edge and arguably the scariest scene of the movie was when Alex and Clear go to see Todd's dead body and they run into the mortician played excellently by Tony Todd. Throughout there is plenty of suspense and tension helped by great music in whether the characters will survive. Also what is rare with your average horror flicks is any emotional connection to the characters. I cared about Alex and Clear and as they become a couple I hoped they would survive and Carter I hated him! Though the script and dialogue was a bit rubbish, it's easily forgiven. The acting is to a good standard particularly Devon Sawa as Alex and Ali Larter as Clear Rivers. The story is also original and different, which makes it refreshing and the ending is great. In referring to the ending I also loved the soundtrack when the credits rolled up. It was great. The special effects though obviously they would look bad now was good for it's time.<br/><br/>That's why I think FD is a brilliant movie and deserves such a high rating and even though with each sequel they have been getting worse. FD will never lose it's touch and will remain for me the best of the franchise."
"callanvass","8","1","2","2 April 2010"," All the pointless sequels have diminished it's impact a little bit, but this still remains a great Horror film.
","Final Destination remains one of my favorite Horror films that I have in my collection. At the time a plot like this was not only unheard of, but absolutely frightening as well. It wasn't just about who could get killed off in the most brutal ways, or how many buckets of blood they could spray when a death scene hit our screens, at one time it wasn't just about making money, Final Destination was once scary. In a sense I do believe Death has a design planned for all of us, so that only made things more scarier for me in the end. Everyone fears death, even the people who say they don't, deep down they do and to see Death going out of its way to kill these characters off, it just sends chills down your spine. The opening airplane sequence has to be one of the most inventive and scariest openings I have ever seen. Just the way they had Alex|Sawa| dream it before hand, and then to have it happen after was brilliant in my opinion. When you 1st watch it it's really unpredictable on who will live, and who will die. We have a feeling who may live and who may die, but it's never fully clear. Final Destination wasn't always a money-making machine, Final Destination used to be scary, and now that 10 years have passed, I can say it still holds up well.<br/><br/>Performances. Devon Sawa does very well as Alex. He displays all the right emotions, and has all the ingredients to make the perfect hero. His relationship with Clear, and his chemistry with her was the key to the movie in many ways. Ali Larter is gorgeous without a doubt, but she also gives a fantastic performance to boot. It's really nice to see a horror film heroine who doesn't have all the predictable clichés tagged on her. Kerr Smith is grating to watch, but that's because the way his character is written. He's always bullying people, he's always angry, always bitching about something, I was surprised they left him on as long as they did. Kristen Cloke plays emotional very well, but after a while I wanted to slap her one to snap her out of it. Chad Donella plays Alex's best friend to a T, why couldn't they have let him survive a little longer?. Seann William Scott plays his usual comedy routine, only a little less arrogant, and it's in a Horror film, I like him but it isn't much of a stretch for him. Tony Todd is basically playing his Candyman part in his cameo.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Final Destination's impact has dwindled over the years a bit, due to all the pointless sequels, but it still remains an original and fine Horror film. Smartly written and most importantly scary, see it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The night before i viewed this film, i watched the latest final destination, the 2009 version. While that one was your typical , god damn awful teen horror flick, the original has more going for it and is packed with entertainment value.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters aren't wooden. None of them come out with any ridiculous one liners like they did in the 2009 film. All the actors played there part well. The only problem with the characters was that not one of them was likable. Even though the plot is similar to the latest version, this one doesn't seem to be to much over the top. When i say this i mean that the deaths aren't far fetch and aren't only use to portray the gore element of the film like in the latest version. In the original, the deaths are believable while at the same time there filled with gore.<br/><br/>The opening of this movie is great. the airport scene is filmed great and the special effects are brilliant. i don't know anyone who would turn the film off after the first 20 Min's. For once in the genre, the film gives an great script, good acting, original plot. This film rises above the rest within the teen horror genre. The only negative is that the ending is totally predictable, it quite easy to spot the characters making the mistake in there judgement. Overall this is a good film that deserves to be watched at least once. It a film that by far beats the rest, that is mostly junk, out there."

Miffed at being cheated, Death decides to have another pop at each of the survivors, claiming them in the order they would have died in the midair explosion.<br/><br/>This simple yet ingenious concept allows director James Wong to deliver a series of intricately designed and wonderfully imaginative death set-pieces that make this film one of the most genuinely entertaining and original horrors of the decade; not since The Omen films has violent death been so imaginatively planned and so much fun to watch unfold.<br/><br/>As each victim reaches the top of Death's hit list, seemingly insignificant incidents cause a snowball effect that ultimately results in a horrific demise: a leaky toilet pipe winds up causing a guy to choke to death in his bathtub; a tiny crack in a mug kick-starts a chain of events that climaxes in a huge explosion; and a train hurtling past a piece of debris makes another poor schmuck lose his head (although not completely—just from the lower jaw upwards!).<br/><br/>In an exciting finalé, Alex attempts to end the terror by trying to cheat death once again, only to realise that he has got the order all wrong, and it is pretty social outcast Clear (the lovely Ali Larter from Heroes) who is next up for the chop...<br/><br/>With spectacularly gory deaths, a very likable and talented young cast, a dark sense of humour, a cool cameo from Tony 'Candyman' Todd, and a totally unique killer, Final Destination goes to prove that not all big budget, major-studio, teen-orientated horror is totally worthless garbage."

","I was lying in my room bored out of my mind. The weather outside was a bit crappy and I decided to see what movies I could stream from Netflix. Final Destination was on my page, so I decided to watch that.<br/><br/>So, the movie starts out with a French class on a plane. One kid ""sees"" the plane blow up, and is thrown off of the plane for inciting panic. Several other students leave with him, including one girl who left simply because she believed him. In the terminal, they watch as the plane does explode. It's interesting thinking about this in a post-911 world. The kids are interviewed about the event and then let go after about 3 hours. They know that the kid was yelling about the plane exploding, so why didn't they hold him for longer. If that had happened now, that kid would have been detained for days before they determined he was innocent, if they ever did that at all. What follows seems like a typical slasher movie, just without an actual slasher. The antagonist is supposed to be an abstract concept like fate or death, but it's really just a shadowy Michael Myers or Jason.<br/><br/>Now seems like a good time to talk about the characters. They suck. Throughout the beginning of the movie, the survivors are giving the psychic kid(I have a hard time paying attention to names in movies) a hard time about predicting the explosion. I don't have much experience with death, but does this make any sense? I would expect them to be grieved, maybe even happy to be alive, but why would you target the guy that saved you? It doesn't make sense. There is also the girl who got off the plane because she believed him. She talks to him about believing him, and even believes him when the first guy died. However, after they establish that it wasn't a suicide, something that everyone else was saying, she suddenly stops believing him. Why? He made a prediction of his death, said it wasn't a suicide, this was confirmed, so you stop believing him? Idiot.<br/><br/>I can go on forever about the crappy characters in this movie. The stupid motives for driving like an idiot, the complete lack of any valid emotion after one of your friends is decapitated, and the convoluted cabin near death scene that occurred right before the main character decides that it shouldn't have.<br/><br/>If you're bored, you might get a kick out of watching it for the shear stupidity. But if you are expecting an interesting supernatural thriller, skip this one like it's death was just prevented."
"Chiidatbe","5","1","2","29 November 2008"," Good idea but script fails to make movie shine
","I think this movie could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>The Negatives: It had a really good idea but bad writing I think failed it. The deaths were also too over-the-top and dramatic, I think making them more simple would have been more shocking. I found many of the death scenes funny due to how dramatic they were. Also, I think a lot of the characters were badly written and the chemistry seemed very forced between them, the film also carried some truly horrible dialogue. Certain parts of the film were also heavily predictable.<br/><br/>The Positives: Most of the film was saved by good acting, particularly from Ali Larter. The tense scenes including Carter stopping the car on a railroad track as a train approaches and where Alex saves Clear.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie only worked as an idea and would love to someday see a re-make of it with a different writer and director."
"DavidSim240183","5","1","2","23 November 2007"," Never saw this coming
","Final Destination had quite an impact on teen audiences. Far more than I thought it would. Its one of these horror films that suddenly emerges out of nowhere, and before you know it, its the one thing on everybody's lips. Such is the case that everybody already knows the plot before they sit down to actually watch the film.<br/><br/>FD is a film that feels particularly unnerving in these post 9/11 days. There's no actual terrorism present, but the sight of a plane exploding is sure to bring back memories of that dark day in New York.<br/><br/>And one of the film's central characters, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) foresees the whole thing. He and a class of schoolmates are on they're way to Paris for a field trip, but Alex's vision throws a spanner in the works. He and six others get kicked off the plane, and not long after, it explodes.<br/><br/>The survivors barely have enough time to digest this when they start getting killed off one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. Death is not about to let people slip through its fingers, and Alex & Co must figure out a way to break the pattern of their supposed deaths before there won't be anyone left alive to do something about it.<br/><br/>For all its success, being expanded out into a trilogy and producing novelisations and such, Final Destination has a curiously thin premise to work from. Its basically a series of novelty death set-pieces strung together by a thin semblance of plot. That might not occur to you the first time around, but FD feels less satisfying the more times you view it.<br/><br/>I think for any teen film to be truly successful, it has to have a strong cast to pull it off. Films like Scream, The Faculty and Election were all excellent because of astute young actors playing their roles.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Final Destination doesn't have an exceptionally bright cast. And other than Ali Larter's tough, resourceful turn, I found the rest of the teens in this film rather forgettable.<br/><br/>Any teen film that has Seann William Scott is bound to turn me off. Fortunately he's not in the film often enough to ruin it. But whenever he is around I tend to tune FD out.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa is quite boring as our teen hero. Maybe that's not all his fault. The writers after all keep having him spout dialogue about how they should have died on that plane. Their lives follow a pattern, something Alex's premonition has shattered. The different theories he kept spinning regarding all this really drove me crazy after a while.<br/><br/>Ali Larter is really the only one here that actually makes an impression. She was the only one I felt sympathetic to throughout all this. She seems capable and industrious. All she really needs is a worthwhile script to work from and she could go on to become one of Hollywood's greatest leading ladies.<br/><br/>Even the usually reliable Tony Todd seems a little off his game. He only gets a cameo appearance as a mortician, but even he fails to impress. Odd considering what a fine actor Todd is. He seems a little over the top, even borderline hammy as the creepy mortician musing over life's plan for us all. And that's all the more strange after seeing how perfectly sinister he can be in films like Candyman.<br/><br/>The film's selling point turned out to be its death sequences. I can tell the filmmakers have researched films like The Omen, where people died in bizarre occurrences through decapitations and impalings. Here they've taken those single scenes and made an entire film out of it.<br/><br/>One thing that does give Final Destination some novelty is that unlike most stalker/slasher films, the killer isn't someone running around in a mask brandishing a butcher knife, but ordinary, everyday household objects.<br/><br/>It provides quite a bit of fascination how each one of these little lambs is going to cop it next. One of them ends up strangled to death through a simple slip on a puddle. Another gets creamed by a bus. A scene that's become almost as imitated as Psycho's shower scene.<br/><br/>The problem with FD is that this is what propels the film. Take all of them away, and you haven't got much of a film left. And even these death scenes get tiresome after a while, because they get increasingly outlandish and over the top.<br/><br/>In spite of the effect it had on teen audiences, I do feel Final Destination is somewhat overrated. It provides jolts and shocks aplenty first time around. But the more times you watch it, the less inspired it seems."

The following events when the death is chasing after the survivals of the flight is the second good topic, you can avoid death?, you can actually change your destiny? everyone's destiny is already defined?, and if you manage to change your destiny, you violate a rule of our existence and that have to be fixed by the destiny itself?, well some philosophy can also be made about this movie. What genre is this movie? fantasy or horror? i think that is more fantasy, but with ""horror type"" deaths. Is a nice story and good visual effects.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE FILM: Dewon Sawa plays Alex Chance Brwoning, a boy of high school that predicts that the plane in which they would fly to Paris in a school trip will burst into flames, he step out of the flight with some classmates, as they avoided death, the death start to follow everyone that dropped the flight, they are Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) an smart girl somewhat introverted, Carter Horton (Kerr Smith) one of the popular guy of school, the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), Billy Hitchcock (Sean William Scott), Tod Wagner (Chad Donella) and Terry (Amanda Detmer), they realize that escaping from death is more difficult that they tough, but they try for all means to stay alive!.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This is definitely NOT one of the best Horror movies I have seen. I find that review of it quite amusing. This movie could so easily fall into the category of American movies that are too much like trashy American Supernatural series that are being shown in their thousands from one side of the world to the other.. But! But, the way in which the director controls the atmosphere, especially when a frightening scene is coming up, also the suddenness of some of the deaths; which really does grab you from the back of the head and get you sitting up straight in your seat; for all of the above reasons this is truly a good movie.<br/><br/>It is not a 'great' movie.<br/><br/>The all too worn out and common 'American Teenagers Horror Movie' is enough for me to give it a lower rating -Unless it is strikingly different...which this film isn't. 6 stars"

","Yes, that's right, I loved this movie!!!  No, it's not ""The Exorcist""...it's unintentional camp.  An A-movie which never reached out of B status.  The plot is silly, the dialogue is sillier and the gore is absolutely wonderful - a decapitation at the jaw, a girl being turned into fruit salad via a bus and, in the film's classic sequence, the French Teacher is dragged through more hilarious Tex Avery torture in her house than O.J. Simpson in the opening scene of ""Naked Gun"".  Fabulous!!  On the star end, Devon Sawa is able pull off the haunted teen bit just as well as his Anton Tobias in the highly underrated ""Idle Hands"" - like Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible"", Sawa does his best to rise above and have fun with the craziness around him. And Ali Larter, who has to be the easiest thing to look at since Jessica Alba in the above mentioned Horror fav, is sexy and saucy as the adorable, steel welding Clear Rivers.  Watching her dive from possessed electrical wires was pure heaven!!!  This will be a huge guilty pleasure for horror fans everywhere!  Tons of fun, laughs and little frights!!! A+!"

","QUALITY KILLS!!!  A good death scene can make up for all the re-hashed formula-based waste of film leading up to it.  But this movie goes one better.  It's actually pretty good on top of having some first rate gore.<br/><br/>It's a classic slasher picture except that the killer this time is the angel of death himself.  He's a little ticked off at Alex and some of his classmates, because they managed to get themselves off of a plane that blows up right after it takes off.  Alex only intends to get himself off the plane, but some admittedly thin circumstances take place, and before you know it, 7 total get off the plane.  The reaper figures he had seven more deaths coming, so he's going to keep trying until he gets them.  Slowly but surely, those that cheated death start to get picked off in some unusual ways.  Alex seems to be at the center of all of this because he keeps showing up right as people die.  So the FBI thinks he's doing them in.  We, of course, know that he's not.  Alex knows when death is coming, because he's learned to look for the signs.  He also has figured out a way to tell who's going to be next.<br/><br/>It wasn't all good though.  The character Carter's actions are just stupid. There's no plausible explanation for them so they come off as silly.  Other than that, once you accept the premise, the fun can begin.

","The film Final Destination is actually not a teen slasher film in the ways like it does not have a masked killer or a 90210 style cast, what it does have is the extremely talented team of Glenn Morgan and James Wong who did many episodes of The X Files (particularly the chilling ""Home"" episode). The movie Final Destination is a great hart pounding film that explores Death in many ways and is at times a touching movie (especially the first half), a film with the emotion like this one has needs a good actor in the lead role and it has that in actor Devin Sawa (who was also very funny in last years Idle Hands), the only thing about the movie is that the killer IS death and as the tag line says ""you can't cheat death"" so you kinda know there all going to get it in the end and the scene with Tony Todd is kinda hokey but all in all this was one of the best movies of 2000 and IS the best horror movie in a long time (it's way better than Blair Witch Project).

","Freakish. On the edge of your seat terror. That's about all that came out of my mouth after this film ended. It stars Devon Sawa(Idle Hands, Now and Then) as a student who is going on a class trip to Paris. On entering the plane he has this surreal vision of the plane exploding. In a mad scramble to get off the plane he gets himself, and five other of his classmates kicked off the plane. The plane eventually takes off and explodes killing everyone on board. Months later each surviving member dies for unexplained reasons. This is a new twist on a very over done genre. There are the normal death scenes and scare moments but there done in such a way that your on the edge of your seat most of the film. This is also a bloody film. The death scenes are taken to a new level of nasty. It also has an ending that will leave you breathless. Even more so then the first I Know What You Did Last Summer. The actors pull off their scenes well and there's a very cool cameo but a cult horror legend. I give it an 8.5. This was a great supernatural horror film. Don't wait, go out and see this. And I warn anyone who has a fear of flying, the opening sequence is shocking."

","I came into FINAL DESTINATION not knowing what to expect and I have to say I left the theatre pleasantly surprised (actually, that's an understatement. The movie shocked me so unrelentingly that by the end I couldn't wait to get home and change my pants).  I am not usually one to enjoy teeny-bopper thrillers, and I have NEVER been one to clutch my bag of Bridge Mixture in horror in any sort of movie.  However, the throw-away, casual, tongue-in-cheek manner in which this movie depicted deaths was for incredibly shocking...and I can't believe I enjoyed it. That is not to say that FINAL DESTINATION was all pant-wetting fun.  The characters were thinly drawn and the second half of the movie reverts to a few too many teen-horror/thriller cliches.  My biggest quibble was with a character named Carter.  He ruined many scenes by being completely unbelievable in the way he behaved and talked.  Now, this complaint may seem silly in a movie so full of convoluted logic, but the massive leaps of faith that the plot required never bothered me. This movie was ceaselessly entertaining and creative.  If you're willing to suspend your belief for the duration, sneak in a package of Depends, and don't mind graphic, twisted death scenes, I encourage you to go see FINAL DESTINATION. You certainly won't be bored."

","Some very minor spoilers herein<br/><br/>Final Destination is def. one of the funniest movies of all time. After<br/><br/>a slew of teen slasher movies, it's refreshing to see a movie take<br/><br/>itself so seriously and still be so funny...<br/><br/>Having seen so many people give this movie rave reviews, I must<br/><br/>conclude that they are reviewing in the sarcastic, self-parodic<br/><br/>nature of the film. This movie contains middling acting, a terrible<br/><br/>script and absolutely awful realism.<br/><br/>I understand that we shouldn't expect an awful lot of reality, but<br/><br/>when a movie takes its premise so seriously, one would expect its<br/><br/>death scenes to be a little better than ""coffee mug cracks, leaks on<br/><br/>computer, causes electrical shortage, computer explodes, glass<br/><br/>impales woman wo runs into kitchen.

I have to admit that the beginning of this movie is thrilling, but after this the movie becomes slow and has no point at all.

","This film is advertised as a horror/thriller.  It starts out that way too. The story is interesting enough to be an effective thriller.  The first 20 minutes are the only moments that actually work as a triller, however.  Soon our heroes are trying to fend off exceedingly elaborate Rube Goldberg death traps.  The first one is very unpleasant.  But after that, they are so far out that it's almost funny.  By the final elaborate series of fateful coincidences, it's impossible to believe that the filmmakers weren't trying to be funny.  It's almost as if they started out with a idea they thought would make a good horror film, but eventually they couldn't figure out how to carry it through to the end, so they decided to get wacky.  A few years ago I would have hated this movie, but I've become so jaded by bad movies in my search for decent genre films that now it almost passes as a way to kill a couple of hours.  Almost.  With a bit of careful and restrained writing, this idea could have worked."

","intense is a word that some people may not be able to associate with the current trend of teen slasher flicks.  Many of the current brood of cinematic horror depends to much on humor and excessive gore and skimp on the story, shocks, and plot twists.  I am quite proud to say that FINAL DESTINATION does NOT fall into these holes...at least not too much. Everything about this movie is intense and well paced.  It also does something that few other horror movies do well and that is play with the audience's expectations, in a few death scenes the crowd braces itself for the oncoming death only to have it yanked away for a little longer, then have it taken away again until finally delivering the goods, and deliver it does.  the deaths, while not wholly original, are very well done and, in some cases ABSOLUTELY, JAW-DROPPINGLY SHOCKING.  Most importantly, the death scenes aren't particularly gory but they start off believable and realistic and get less believable as the film goes on, i took this to be an example of just how far Death will go to keep his/her plan.  Finally i was very impressed with the ending, it's not set in stone but it still leaves you wondering if everything is over.  All in all a very good movie...even better when you consider the CRAP that has passed for horror as of late."

"stamper","8","1","2","12 September 2000"," I do not think this is the Final Destination for this GREAT idea
","This movie is good people, you understand that. OK there are not big names in it nor in the cast, nor behind the chair, nor behind the pen, still it succeeds in doing something that I've have seen many films fail in over the years that featured big names. Of course I've seen failures with little names too, but that is not the point I'm trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make here is that how can a piece of sh.t movie like Mission to Mars be almost just as successful as this movie. I do not get it. I mean ,of course I thought, well, f.ck the reviews' and I went right on and saw Mission to Mars, but I wish I would not have. With this movie it was different, I was not too keen on going, actually I did NOT care if I saw it or not, because basically the Trailer was not too good and that is a pity. If the trailer would have been as good as the one for Mission to Mars (which had to be good, otherwise not so many people would have went to the cinema to watch that crappy movie), this film could have made 2 times the money it actually made at the box office.<br/><br/>Another thing that I have to say here, is, that despite all the booing and wooing of the past about teenie / high school flicks I must say there certainly are a lot of them these days that are worth seeing. Of course these are not the 10 Things I hate about you flicks, but rather the films involving teens that are different'. Like Cruel Intentions, Scream, Scream 2 or last year's hit American Pie. There are really a bunch of great movies out there that centre teens and I feel that they are doing it great, for they are not only looking to make the eye enjoy (as in sexy females and maybe gorgeous guy's) but there are stories there too. I mean these stories are not only better than some of the other stories out there, but they are really, definitely far better carried out. I mean two years ago or so, that The Avengers movie Trailer, it rocked, but what was the conclusion after watching it ? The film was carried out poorly. This one is actually a bit different, because the Trailer does not stand out, but the movie itself does, because it was carried out very good.<br/><br/>On to the film itself, what was good and what was bad? Well bad there is not much to say there, actually there is nothing to say there. What was good, well let's get onto that in a bit, but first of all, what about the actors? Well they all get their job done and that is what counts, they are all good. No outstanding folks here, nor on the Oscar nor on the Razzie side. While I'm on it, I must say that the film was not too thrilling, meaning you don't sit on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it was still entertaining enough.<br/><br/>On to the good stuff, what did I like ? Man that is like a thousand things. I liked the direction very much, for it was very well, not only angles and stuff, particularly in the death scenes, but also in the way of filming. I mean this film had not the biggest budget and yet it's effects are believable and good which is due to a style of direction that admits just the right amount of good effects to be there. Also, of course, a good thing when connected with direction was the editing. It was done at the right times and in good ways. The music was good too, I mean I never heard of the woman doing the music in this film before, but she got her sh.t together man, it was good. Now on to the film in particular, talking favourite scenes. My favourite scenes are the inside view of the exploding plane and deaths 2, 4 and of course 5. These are my favourite scenes, not only because they are carried out well but because they are somehow surprising (which counts only for the death scenes 2, 4 and 5). The surprise element is somehow too, the thing I liked very much in this film. You never knew exactly how someone was gonna die until it actually happened and even when you guessed it somehow was different than the most scenes I've seen in my life (that death scene 4 really surprised me in the way of how (the place) he was killed). Enough about the film and it's makers, what about the story ? It was not only inventive and new, but it also was smart, for it reflects a thought all humans have. Death is destiny and you can't escape death. OK there have been many films involving death or Satan, but few, really few were able to be original and bring to us a new dimension. This one did though and we should be glad it did.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is very good, for it leaves questions open plus it leaves the possibility of a second instalment open too, so it is good for both the viewer and the makers. Believe me, I do not like every sequel (although I'm pretty sure they are making a sequel to this one), but I sure like an ending like this one, for it is quick, abrupt and does not answer all the questions. Plus I found the sarcastic song at the credits rather funny too.<br/><br/>

","This movie was not what I expected from the comments of critics.  The movie kept me wondering and waiting for the next kill or scare.

Alex(Devon Sawa) sees the his plane to Paris explode, and that is when it all started for him and his other friends.  They are being killed off one by one, and only Alex understands why this is happening.  They run from death, but no one can escape their own destiny.  I am not going to ruin the ending for anyone, so I won't say anymore about the plot. I think this movie should be seen in the theater just for the kicks of being scared and it is good enough to spend $7.50 to see it.  Although most critics would disagree with me on this, I will still believe that the acting was superb,(especially Devon Sawa) the plot was interesting, and the movie was very scary."

","James Wong's Final Destination is a weird yet immensly entertaining horror film that has plenty of scares and a cool twist- the killer isn't some guy in a mask or a guy in a dress.  It's death, literally, coming for you.  The plot (spoilers I think) involves a kid who is going on a trip to Paris and on a TWA flight (I think this is a odd coincidence to TWA flight 800 plane that crashed in the summer of 1996).  But, the kid has a revelation before the flight begins that the plane is going to crash.  He gets off, and so do a few other kids in the comotion.  Two minutes later after the plane takes off, the plane crashes (talk about a messed up revelation).  But it gets better after that with the death.  Very clever, sometimes even funny, and always frightening, I think (unless nothing else comes along this year) this might be the best horror film of the year and definately one of the best teen slasher movies to come around in a while.

The ingeniousness of the actual deaths gives it a certain entertainment value but beyond that it's difficult to believe that even the actors are taking it seriously.

"baumer","Null","1","2","26 May 2000"," Reminiscent of early Hooper, Craven and Carpenter
","Horror has to be one of the hardest genres to master.  People think horror is simple because many of the horror films that they think of are films from the 80's that seem to have low production costs and a non existent cast. But look again at some of the good horror from the last 40 years and you will see that fine tuning the craft of horror is just as difficult as any other and that when you have a good horror film, they are some of the best films ever made.  Personally, I place Jaws and Halloween on my top ten list of best FILMS ever made.  Even look at films like SIXTH SENSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD and Hitchcock's PSYCHO and you will see not just good horror films, but good films.  You can add FINAL DESTINATION to that list of films.  There is enough chills and scenes of true terror to make you jump and to satisfy any serious horror buffs craving an increase in pulse.<br/><br/>To start off, the film has what has to be some of the best (and scariest ) fifteen minutes to open a film.  It involves a dream sequence that tells Devon Sawa that something terrible is going to happen.  He dreams of an airplane crash.  But not only does he dream of the crash itself, he dreams of details.  The camera manipulates us into feeling what he feels as it circles frantically around his room and then it gives us the details of impending doom which is imminently lurking in the shadows.  Then in real time, he tries to tell everyone that the plane is going to crash and he gets kicked off the flight just before it takes off.  And then, in one of the best scenes in horror film history, we watch as the plane, visible from the window, blows up.<br/><br/>You know a film has achieved it's perogative in scaring you when you have seen that particular scene in the trailers and it still scares you.  That is powerful film making and James Wong should be commended for his awesome vision.  Wong worked on some small movies like TRICK OR TREAT in the 80's and he is an X-FILES veteran.  But here he shows us that he has the same vision that made some of the greats from the past so stylistic.  I know I am heaping a load of praise on the film and the director when I mention names like TEXAS, HALLOWEEN, and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it is well deserved praise.<br/><br/>Final Destination doesn't have a true killer, not a tangible one anyway. There is no man with a hockey mask, or a dream figure with long finger knives that attack the kids in this film.  But what we get are subtle shots of unstoppable signs of death.  Winds gust up, shadows envelop the walls, the camera plays with us to make us think or in some cases lets us know that death is imminent.  An unforeseen deity? spirit? demon? is approaching and there is nothing that anyone can do to stop it.  <br/><br/>The casting is quite interesting as well.  Devon Sawa plays the main character and he is a wise choice even after his disasterous IDLE HANDS, but it is the supporting cast that is best part of the casting director. <br/><br/>
Kerr Smith sheds his sensitive gay persona from DAWSON'S CREEK and here plays a tough guy/jerk.  And he plays it quite well.  Stifler, from AMERICAN PIE, suffers the worst death in the film and although he is good, he is basically just another character.  I would have liked to see him play more of a role, the producers of Road Trip got it right when they basically gave him the same role as the one he played in American Pie.  But I guess this is a horror movie and that is of little consequence to the film.  Ali Larter from VARSITY BLUES fame ( and a stint on Dawson's Creek ) is the one that shines here the most.  Another reviewer in here noted that she was one of the best young actresses of her generation and although that is lofty praise, I have to concur.  She carries the film when Sawa is absent and I expect to see great things from her in the future.<br/><br/>Final Destination is one of the scarier films to come out in the last 40 years.

","If it wasn't for a few gory death scenes, this would be firmly a thriller, but I suppose it is a horror of some sorts - more a teen slasher film where some nauseating adolescents get what they undoubtedly deserve.<br/><br/>The main character, Alex Browning (scarily similar name to my own!) sees a hallucenation of a plane crash, and upon getting off a plane this actually happens.  The main premise is that there is a force of evil knocking off those who survived, which although not a novel idea was well brought across.<br/><br/>This film was occasionally frightening, and kept going right till the end - which is more than you can say for a lot of the Hollywood pap of recent times."

"tongjongsakulsri","10","1","3","2 October 2018"," Brilliant concept. Brilliant movie.
","Back in the 90s and early 2000s, Most of the horror movies including my favourites as well just had a masked killer chase teenagers. But this was a unique concept, considering how ""Death"" can go after the survivors of the plane crash simply without an entity. The movie is about a French class going on board Flight 180 to Paris, but one of the students called Alex saw how the plane was going to crash. 6 people got off the plane with him, thus Death comes after them one by one. They weren't supposed to get off the plane, their fates were set in action to die on the plane. But Alex changed that. In my opinion, that is a brilliant concept. At least it was during the 2000s.<br/><br/>The message they're trying to get here, is that you can't cheat Death. Death will always come back at you. So when you know there's going to be that one day that you will die, spend the time you have left now to live a full life. And people always say the Final Destination franchise has crappy deaths and cgi - Just go look the movies up online or something and watch for yourself. Especially this one, the first movie. I will admit that most of the deaths in the franchise aren't ""realistic"", but imagine if you're a director. You're really gonna let them all die by heart attacks and stab wounds? I'm still pretty sure if we didn't have this franchise we'd be stuck with 10 other masked killers by now. Overall, great acting, brilliant concept, brilliant movie."

Putting this under horror and thriller is an embarrassment for those genres, it really isn't scary, it never had me looking away or feeling in fear, the effects in the film are awful, Wile E. Coyote's injuries in Looney Tunes cartoons are honestly more realistic than these deaths, it's not one bit thrilling, the dialogue is stupid and tries to be comical way too often. Any bit of potential this film may have had is completely blown away by its brutal cast, they are some of the worst performances I've ever seen in a major Hollywood production, it surprises me that they even managed to get past one audition, they're ridiculously fake, the love scenes aren't convincing, nor is the confrontation between characters or any indication of friendship, there is literally no chemistry and because of this the cast fail at this movie big time.

"TrickyTheHorrorFreak","9","1","3","14 September 2006"," A decent idea turned into a fantastic horror movie!
","""Final Destination"" caught me completely by surprise. After watching the trailer I figured it to be another typical teenage driven horror movie with little substance or unique qualities to set it apart from the pack. I'm really glad I gave it a go after reading a few good reviews though, as it turned out to be so very much more than that. This is a rare and wonderful case where an at most decent idea is turned into a really fantastic film due to good performances, direction and great scripting.<br/><br/>Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say that Alex manages to avoid death under very strange circumstances. In doing so, he also saves the lives of five of his schoolmates as well as his teacher. But when one of those near-victims then dies soon after, Alex starts to fear that perhaps by cheating death, Death itself is coming back to set things straight. Sounds silly right! Well I guess it is, but it works really well in ""Final Destination"" and that's a credit to director James Wong and his cast and crew.<br/><br/>When any and every normal item and scenario suddenly becomes an opportunity for Death to end your existence, life itself becomes a terrifying experience. The creators of this movie had a huge amount of fun with the setup, constantly placing obvious dangers in front of the characters only to have them harmlessly pass them by. Over and over you will find yourself thinking ""he's turned the radio on in bathroom, he's gonna get it!"" or ""that gas has been on for far too long for her to light it, this is it for her!"" only to have nothing happen. There are some brilliant scenes in ""Final Destination"" based on this uncertainty and each one finishes with highly creative and often unexpected death scenes.<br/><br/>The cast are great and in particular Devon Sawa and Ali Larter in two of the main roles. But everyone plays their part in the scenario successfully except for perhaps Seann William Scott who funnily enough went on to be the most successful actor. He hadn't quite perfected his goof-ball antics at this point and while he's mildly amusing, he far more regularly appears to be quite pathetic and annoying. Tony Todd (of Candyman fame) has an unforgettable cameo which was a nice touch also utilizing a legend of the genre.<br/><br/>There's a real sense of fun to proceedings even though death is a rather serious topic and that's due to the creators not taking things too seriously themselves. They are playing with you as an audience and rather than frustrating everyone as could so easily have occurred, you'll find yourself happily going along for the ride. This movie was a complete success and with two sequels already released to both financial reward and fan praise, we may not have seen the final Final Destination just yet."

","This is not just a teen film with a thin story line, then some silly jokes and then some sex...no, this film is way better. The very beginning makes the film a blood chilling masterpiece - when a main hero sees a vision of the plane crash and is in panic, he and several other people are gotten off the plane and then the plane explodes right when taking off, and then the true horror begins. Death is seeking all those who survive, it hunts its preys and kills them with no mercy. The absolute masterpiece of the film is the scene of the teacher's death - when she is going to drink hot tea and then adds some icy vodka instead and thus the cup is cracked, she then puts the cup on her computer, vodka oozes in, the PC explodes, the glass wounds her face, she falls down and then more and more terrible details add to her terrible death. The only weak point is the idea that death chooses the order who and when to kill. We all will die, but in no specific order, I believe, and there is no design here..."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","30 May 2006"," A refreshingly original horror movie.
","In the '90's the Scream trilogy meant the revival of the horror genre and teen-horror in particular. After that lots of horror movie were created that all were very much alike and of average (at best) quality. ""Final Destination"" however is one fine exception and it distinct itself from other genre movies through its originality. I consider ""Final Destination"" to be one of the most refreshing and original horror movies of this decade.<br/><br/>It's not a horror movie with monsters or scary serial killers. It's a movie with an invisible villain; death itself, which is determined to kill everyone that escaped his clutches. It's a great and original concept that is executed even better as expected. The fact that the 'villain' is invisible provides the movie with some moments that makes this movie distinct itself from any other movie out of the same genre.<br/><br/>Reason why this movie was even better than I anticipated were the deaths in this movie. Every death in the movie is highly complex and wonderfully constructed and executed. You know something bad is going to happen but you never know how and when. Therefor the deaths and way of death all still come as a surprise. It makes the movie very tense and also both scary and gory to watch at times.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with a spectacular (but still obviously 'low' budget) plane crash. Fortunately after its beginning the movie doesn't loose any of its pace and the movie mostly remains spectacular to watch throughout its running time, which is only 98 minutes short.<br/><br/>All of the actors are obvious B-movie material, which is fine and works out really well for a genre movie like this one. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad but none of the actors will win any big award, or star in a blockbuster any time soon. Fine exception, I must admit, perhaps was Seann William Scott who plays a fun role and perhaps shows his very best acting skills yet, in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some awkward moments and some weak dialog and character treatment at times but thankfully it doesn't really make the movie any less entertaining or good to watch.<br/><br/>An highly recommendable, refreshingly original horror flick that surpasses almost every other horror movie of this decade, so far.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Final Destination is an original piece with a storyline somewhat out of the Twilight Zone. Basically a handful of teenagers escape death (due to the premonitions of the lead character) by boarding off of a plane which explodes shortly after it takes off. Shortly afterward, they all begin to die one by one...in what at first appears to be random circumstances.<br/><br/>My liking of this movie comes mostly due to the fact that movie offers a fairly original screenplay (in todays movies) and its (though light) existential approach. The acting is alright, nothing special, but then again nothing really bad (Ala some of the other slasher films of the late ninties).<br/><br/>In short I think this is one of the more intelligent and original films of recent days and would recommend people to watch it at least once. Like I said the acting is nothing special, and the story does have a couple of flaws in it, but overall its fairly enjoyable.<br/><br/>(If you haven't seen the movie yet...please READ NO FURTHER!!!) My biggest problem lies after the characters figure out about death's plan. To me it seems that there shouldn't have been anyway that they could have cheated the plan (in the second one it gets even worse)..but they do. I know some of you might point to the last scene...but the fact that they could make it even that long.....well suspension of disbelief I guess."

Some of the scenes are a bit hard to believe, but when you look at the ""badguy"" as something that will do whatever it needs to fulfill it's plans, there is nothing that cannot be done to see what ""he"" wants done is accomplished. It added a new twist to the horror film genre.

All before the flight, he has strange premonitions of death, and when he finally boards, he sees flashes of what horrible things could happen to the plane. <br/><br/>As he is dragged off in a panic, six of his fellow students and a teacher follow him or are thrown off for being disorderly.

","Final Destination(2000) is a very good film that was brutally cut and hurt by the censors.  Has its weaknesses including the lame ending.  One of the two alternative endings should have been used because the film would have been much better.  Inspired by the style of The X Files with the tone of Scream.<br/><br/>
The dream sequence during the opening moments are nightmarishly portrayed. The scene where Alex Browning sweats it out and exists the plane only to see the plane blow up in mid air reminds me of a scene in Get Shorty(1995) where there is a similar sitution.  What the film says is that you cannot escape your destiny no matter what course of action you take.  This was something that was also important in the Lucio Fulci Giallo, Seven Notes in Black(1977).<br/><br/>
Final Destination(2000) is in my opinion the best film in the post Scream explosion because there is an attempt at creativity.  The special effects in the film are some of the best in late 1990s teen horror films.  The death scenes are reminiscent of the glory days of Dario Argento, Mario Bava, and Lucio Fulci.  I hope that there will be a director's cut of Final Destination released on DVD just to see how better the film would be.<br/><br/>
The death sequence involving the teacher is the highlight of the film.  The actors perform decently as the pawns who try to escape death.  Final Destination(2000) uses ideas from Don't Look Now(1972), Seven Notes in Black(1977), The Eyes of Laura Mars(1978), & The Dead Zone(1983).  Final Destination(2000) was competently directed by X-Files member, James Wong."

"FlickJunkie-2","8","1","3","10 October 2000"," A fresh and entertaining approach to horror
","It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was `Scream'.  `Final Destination' has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dress up in some kind of costume.  Using `Death' as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.<br/><br/>This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.  <br/><br/>Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance. There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.<br/><br/>As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope. The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality. On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.<br/><br/>This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them."

Alex wasn't that HOT (at least not as hot as Kerr Smith) but he was really good. I must say, I was really surprised by his skills. And because he wasn't really famous, it makes the story more believable.<br/><br/>I saw the movie for the first time and 2001, then I was 11 so, I didn't really remember when I watched him again yesterday. Now I'm 15-year old girl who is really into movies. And I must say, this one is really great. I'm not someone who is really a believer in Faith, but now, I do believe that when it's your time, you will die. You can change the way you will and you can delay it, but eventually you'll die. That is something I learned by watching this movie. I think it will be all but I must say for the people who only read the big letters : THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GREAT! I've you wan't to see a real thriller, take THIS ONE! I give him a 9/10 ( I would give him a 10 but I can't because ""Urban Legend"" is my absolute favorite)"

","`Final Destination' is a fairly creepy, moderately entertaining little horror film dedicated to the proposition that, although one may not be able to exactly `cheat' death, one may be able to beat it on its own terms fair and square  provided one can figure out the rules that is. <br/><br/>
The movie begins as a group of forty high school students and three of their teachers board a plane departing from JFK on a field trip to Paris. Immediately before takeoff, one student receives a premonition that the plane will explode moments after becoming airborne, a vision that manages to get himself and several other passengers safely off before the inevitable occurs.  But as Alex and his fellow survivors soon discover, Death is not to be avoided quite so easily, as each becomes the target of a systematic plan of elimination.<br/><br/> If the details of the initial premise sound familiar, it is probably because they match almost perfectly those surrounding the downing of Flight 103 back in 1996.  Waving aside questions of taste and propriety  is it really right to use the details of a real life tragedy as fodder for a silly little horror flick?  let us concede that `Final Destination' taps into some pretty basic fears about the uncertain, random and arbitrary nature of Death.  The idea itself is enough to make us all stop and ponder the truth of our mortality and the truly tenuous thread by which we daily cling to this thing we call life.  But like so many horror films in the modern era, the premise is better than the execution.  The various deaths depicted herein become so choreographed and preposterous in their details that they actually end up diluting some of their own ability to disturb and terrify. Indeed, the more elaborate and high tech the death scenes become, the less creepy they seem.  We become bemused and detached when we should be cringing and empathetic.  Death simply has to work too hard in some of these scenes and the strain shows. <br/><br/>Thus, for all its originality of premise, the film, by making Death seem like nothing more disturbing than a conventional special effects showoff, robs Man's greatest enemy of his awe-inspiring and overwhelming power and sting!"

","""In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps, and no escapes!"", from one of the creators of The X Files, James Wong, this is a really clever scary movie. Basically Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and his class are getting on a plane for a field trip to Paris, France, but before the journey has even begun he is having weird thoughts, and ultimately he has a horrific premonition of the plane exploding on take off. He and a few of the other passengers are taken off the plane because of his panic, and then everyone is shocked when it turns out that the plane does indeed explode. But this is only the beginning of the nightmare, as after the funeral at the school, where the survivors pay tribute to those who died, the strange events take place. Tod Waggner (Chad E. Donella) is the first victim of a series of bizarre ""accidents"", as he slips on water and is strangled to death by the wall wire in the bath full of slippery products. Alex and his close friend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who got off the plane because she believed his premonition was true, they go to see Tod's body, and the mysterious mortician William Bludworth (Candyman's Tony Todd) gives them seemingly insightful knowledge about how Death (The Grim Reaper) works. They conclude that Death is stalking them until all the survivors of Flight 180 are dead, unless they can find a way to cheat death again, and at that point they witness Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer) suddenly hit by a bus. Alex works out the order that they were meant to die on the plane from his premonition and from the news giving detail about the direction of the explosion, and he works out that teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke) is next, but he is too late to save her from getting computer glass in her neck, a knife in her chest and dying in an explosion. The remaining survivors, Alex, Clear, Carter Horton (Kerr Smith) and Billy Hitchcock (American Pie's Seann William Scott) know they have to stick together if they want to live, but Death will always find a way to get them again. This is seen when Carter contemplates getting himself killed, and at the moment he changes his mind it looks like he won't survive, until Alex saves, and it skips to the next victim, Billy, who gets beheaded by a piece of car shrapnel whipped by the passing train. While Carter goes away knowing he is safe, Alex knows he will be next, but he manages to save himself, and then he dashes to rescue Clear who is trying to escape the various methods of death, such as glass shattering, electrocution, and an explosion, until Alex sacrifices himself. Six months pass, and Alex, Clear and Carter have arrived in Paris where the class were meant to be, and they are sure they have cheated death and defeated the design, until of course it comes again, and it fades to black when Carter is about to be crushed by a sign. Also starring Daniel Roebuck as Agent Weine and Roger Guenveur Smith as Agent Schreck. It was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. It is a very clever film because there is no psycho killer, no alien creature and no dangerous monster, the villain is simply Death itself, so all the killings can be as gory and inventive as possible, and they are, expect plenty of bizarre but affective incidents, and a good amount of blood, a most worthwhile horror thriller. Good!"

The film turns into a "" Teenagers dying one by one "" flick after this point which is a sub genre I`m not normally too keen on but this one is better than most mainly down to the way the director and screenwriter trick the audience into thinking a character is going to survive only to see them die seconds later<br/><br/>By no means a classic movie FINAL DESTINATION is still a fairly entertaining one"

Unlike the other two, I have no clue why this one bothers me like it does, but something about its blend of silly cgi death scenes played completely straight and obvious attempts to appeal to a more 'mainstream' (for lack of a better word) audience than most horror gets on my nerves. The premise is rather hard to take seriously, feeling rather like a mediocre Scream knock-off a la Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but with the killer replaced with a series of unlikely and usually fatal mishaps. Unfortunately, the film takes this silly premise too seriously, and squanders the potential for some delicious moments of black comedy. This, combined with the ugly early 2000s cgi and drab sets and lighting, leads to a dull and uninvolving viewing experience. The fact that something resembling a workplace safety video with characters and a higher budget could become so popular truly boggles the mind."

","Somewhere buried deep in the film's premise lies the kernel of an intriguing idea - and that's Final Destination's lone good point. What happens if someone on board a plane has a premonition of disaster, flees from the aircraft before takeoff, then watches in horror as it explodes once it is airborne. Of course, it takes about ten minutes for it to become apparent that Final Destination is only going to use this as a hook. The point of the movie has nothing to do with how the survivors cope with guilt and uncertainty. Instead, Final Destination is intent upon illustrating that, while it's possible for seven people to cheat death by disembarking from a doomed plane, the Devil still demands his due. So, with John Denver singing in the background, they start dying one-by-one. Even the special effects are no good. Near the beginning of the film, as Sawa's character, Alex, has a vision of the plane's destruction, we are treated to the same kind of visuals used several decades ago when Christopher Reeve's Superman took to the air. Later, for a beheading scene, the decapitation is so ineptly done that I found myself choking back laughter. Moments like that make you wonder if this film could have had a chance as camp. Unfortunately, the somber, serious tone deflates any hope of this."

Alex brings up a great point that he if he was yanking at the wire, he wasn't trying to kill himself--it was an accident. All that develops into is the coroner coming back with a weird remark that in death, there ARE no accidents or coincidences. Realistically, someone wouldn't have that reaction to a great point and I thought, ""Ok, could we quit being weird and acknowledge the point he just made? He was tugging at the wire, which means he didn't exactly set this situation up for himself. So how did this happen? It's bizarre. How can his death be explained?""

And into the over-saturated market of the teen flick comes FINAL DESTINATION, a dizzying and suspenseful shocker which has to be the best teen horror film we've had since SCREAM - all right, I know that's not saying much, but watch this anyway. Tired viewers will be glad to hear that this teen-orientated film isn't full of moronic dialogue and boring situations set in a school - instead, the film is focused entirely on the central premise, there is no deviation.<br/><br/>Created by the two guys who made THE X-FILES so interesting when it first started - James Wong and Glen Morgan - this is, at last, an original film. There is no bogeyman here, no masked slasher, instead the killer is fate itself. I'd give my right arm for a little bit of originality these days, which is why this film enthralled me so much. The film starts off excellently with a strong sense of impending doom and a horrific to watch plane explosion. It then slows down only to pick up the pace in the second half, becoming both exciting and thrilling. Of course, it's the deaths which are the highlights of the film, and these definitely do not disappoint.<br/><br/>Inbetween them, we get some typical teen angst as the shunned Sawa tries to convince his friends that they're about to die. Sawa, who starred in horror comedy IDLE HANDS, is surprisingly good in the lead role, giving us a likable neurotic who manages to be heroic when the time comes. Okay, so the rest of the cast are merely passable - full of the beautiful but bland faces populating most American soap operas these days - but it's nice to see Tony Todd pop up in a cameo as a creepy morgue attendant who gets all the best lines.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the death scenes are outstanding, yes, FANTASTIC; they consist of a series of commonplace accidents which culminate in the victim's demise. They're grisly and surprisingly gory in places, making a nice change these days from relatively bloodless stuff like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Okay, so the fiery, frenetic climax is a bit predictable but there's a nice twist at the very end. FINAL DESTINATION is a clever film, and one to be watched. It has a uniqueness about it which sets it above the rest and it's thoroughly enjoyable too - what more can be said?"

A group of students and a teacher are removed after a fight breaks loose. Devon Sawa claims that he saw the incident before it happened. Was he dreaming? At the funeral he is met with jeers by those who believe that he had something to do with the incident. Then the remaining students die graphically leaving Sawa to believe that they tricked death and are being reclaimed. Director James Wong gives an ominous appeal but despite a decent setup it is still a gratuitous gory mess. Ensemble cast include Sawa as well as Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Seann William Scott. To be fair, Sawa holds his own as he struggles to understand these visions and trying to outwit fate. The rest of the cast are mere types. Larter is that hot chick romantic interest.

","Final Destination, the first of one of the most popular horror franchises ever. The series of course, is well known for its own sense of how an everyday item or circumstance can kill you at anytime in a freak accident and most of all, it made lots'o money. With such a really creative concept, does this movie work? Well here's the story.<br/><br/>Alex Browning, played by Devon Sawa, is about to board a plane along with his classmates on a field trip to Paris. Alex then has a vision that the plane is going to explode. He panics and gets off the plane, along with several other people. And as the plane departs, it really does explode. Everyone's traumatized and tries to move on from it, but it appears that they were all meant to die on the plane, so Death itself comes after the survivors one by one.<br/><br/>While it's a first that a slasher like Freddy or Jason is chasing dumb teenagers, I will say it's an interesting concept. The teens, however, fall for the same things as they would in slasher flicks. The two main leads are the only ones who are aware of it while the others are either jerks or just don't care about it. But the fact that a supernatural force after them is interesting enough. Plus, I do like the creepy imagery they use which is to be used to be clues to how they'll die.<br/><br/>So, does the movie entirely work? Ehhhnnnnot really. The biggest problem with the movie is that some of the deaths are too comedic. The more drawn out they are, the less believable it is. The most simplistic one is a bus hitting someone, but even then, that was a little too silly. What makes it funny is that it comes right the hell out of nowhere and just smashes into her like a slapstick Tom & Jerry joke. See, if there was buildup to that, like say she tried to get out of the way or someone yelled at her to get away, but ultimately gets hit, it would've worked better. Not a whole lot better, just less unintentionally funny. Even the first death is too much of a stretch. Water leaks in the bathroom, causing someone to trip and have the clothes wire to be wrapped around his neck and it tightens and tightens until he dies of asphyxiation. See, that's just too hard to believe, but say if the water caused him to trip and hit his head on the bathtub, that'd be more believable; you don't need to have anything to be wrapped around his neck. Also, I'm not an expert at trains at anything but they do have BRAKE SYSTEMS, DON'T THEY?!?<br/><br/>So, yeah. The deaths are mediocre for the most part. How are the characters? As I mentioned before, they're your two-bit slasher teens. They're not that interesting because we've seen them before many times. The jock jerk that refuses to listen, the comic relief who cracks jokes just to create his own ""identity"", the adults won't catch on. The main character is pretty likable though. I do like how desperate he is in trying to figure out the whole thing before it's too late. I think the only interesting character was the mortician, played by Tony Todd. He's just so mysterious and dark; you can pretty much imply that he is either Death or an associate of Death.<br/><br/>So with all this, I don't think it's a terrible flick. I just think it could've been done a lot better. Like I said, it's a very well done concept. It's just too silly at times. It's sort of like watching a montage of Mortal Kombat Fatalities, just with an actual story. So if you're a fan of that sort of thing, than I say give it a view and you'll love it. I'll see you soon"

","Final Destination can safely be described as a 'teen horror' largely peopled by and clearly aimed at teenagers. <br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, concerns Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa) who is preparing for a school trip to Paris, France. His premonition of imminent disaster leads to him and several other characters leaving the subsequently doomed flight. However, 'Death' will not be cheated so easily...<br/><br/>The first act of this film leading up to and including the destruction of Flight 180 leads us to believe that we are watching a horror film with serious intent. Whilst there are comic vignettes being played out in typical teen fashion there is an underlying build up of tension.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this viewer at least, as soon as the characters are delineated and plot development clearly laid out, any serious intent is drowned out by an over-clever reliance on the formulaic filmmaking which has become the norm with this genre. Lead - or rather, 'stock' - characters other than our hero include the obligatory quirky girl Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), tough guy Carter Horton (Kerr Smith chewing up the scenery), his trampish girl Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), the hero's best friend Tod Waggner (Chad Donella), Billy Hitchcock (Sean William Scott) and teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). We can gain virtually no satisfaction at this point in working out the survival rate and the order of demise. Minor, yet somehow more interesting roles are given to Tony Todd as mortician Bludworth (a wasted part seemingly used simply to explain what is going on), and Daniel Roebuck alongside Roger Guenveur Smith as FBI Agents Weine and Schreck respectively, nicely bouncing off each other. Death's modus operandi veers between extremely complicated with lots of red herrings along the way (Tod's suicidal tendencies giving way to an eventual accidental hanging; Mrs. Lewton and a bizarre combination of steam, gas, electricity, alcohol, fire and kitchen knives), to the dramatic take-your-breath away split-second splattering moment (both Terry and Billy).<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is not enough to sustain our interest for what seems an overlong hour and a half. Clunky dialogue, predictable turns (particularly the 'twist' ending) and a story that (despite other reviewers - probably much younger than myself - claiming otherwise)is hardly original in concept leaves us with a finished product which whilst not being 'bad' simply does not rise above the dross that makes up the vast majority of this genre. for this we have to blame director and co-writer James Wong along with his writing cohorts Glen Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick. The overuse of foreshadowing along with too many visual references - '180' pops up again and again which would be fine if the film were released under the working title of Flight 180 - in-jokes like naming characters after famous horror stars and directors; and an obsession with people sitting on toilet seats all indicate the fun the makers were having. All of which simply detracts from the point of the exercise. Background music courtesy of Adam Hamilton and Shirley Walker could best be described as a cross between forgettable and bland but fortunately remains firmly in the background.<br/><br/>The estimated budget for this film was $23 million, most of which, judging by the credits, went on special effects which were actually fairly impressive. Unfortunately special effects alone seldom make great movies. <br/><br/>Up to this time, this film has spawned three sequels and a prequel. It is to be hoped by this reviewer at least, that they are improvements on the original..."

","This movie is really confusing, I mean Death is the villain stalking the characters, but how can you make Death a bad guy? No, I know what the movie tries to accomplish, I understand the film makers try to personify Death in the scenes where characters are killed off, but it don't work, it looks stupid. I bought a VHS copy of this movie for one dollar, you could tell the scene the previous owner really liked by how worn the tape spool is, its the scene where somebody gets creamed by a bus, that's what these Final Destination movies are really about, gruesome death scenes. ATTENTION ALL HUMANS: Horror is the master genre, it is capable of seamlessly combining all other genres ( comedy,tragedy,sci- fi,historical,etc.etc.)- When you make cheap, ill-conceived, franchise driven gore porn, you make the entire human race look foolish. In regards to the ugly premise of the Final Destination movies, I paraphrase the great sage and eminent junky William S. Burroughs- We face death each day and for that time we are immortal."
"shechapter127","6","0","1","2 June 2013"," Final Destination lacks subtlety but is too tame
","From the opening titles it's clear Final Destination is a film about death and the makers really lay it on thick as if the audience is incapable of following a storyline without constant reminders about the subject. There are images of death, deathly screams, even a copy of Death of a Salesman.<br/><br/>In the beginning we join Alex (Devon Sawa) a superstitious 17-year-old who is preparing to go to France on a school field trip. ""You've got your whole life ahead of you,"" says his dad, like a black cat crossing his path to smash a mirror over his head.<br/><br/>When Alex and his classmates arrive at the airport, director James Wong continues to treat you like the big idiot you are. Alex is handed a 'Death is not the end' flyer and the camera zooms in on the word terminal. Numbers are significant throughout the film, as if to say, 'your number's up'.<br/><br/>Before the flight takes off, Alex has a premonition that it's going to blow up. He and some of the other students are subsequently removed from the plane and are sitting in the lounge in time to see it explode in a fireball. But there's no escaping death and one-by-one the grim reaper picks off the survivors.<br/><br/>You spend most of the film trying to guess how they are going to die and Wong often leads you down the wrong path ­– like when Tod (Chad Donella) starts to shave and nicks his neck and then plucks his nose hairs with a pair of sharp scissors – neither of these things get him but you're made to think they will and you start to see danger everywhere. It's after the death of his friend that Alex starts to piece together the clues: ""Death has a new design for all of you.""<br/><br/>When Final Destination was released in 2000, it was an original concept. It went on to win awards, including the Best Performance by a Younger Actor, and spawned a series of films. But it hasn't aged well and when you watch other horror films it seems rather tame in comparison."

","First let me say I am 71, thus not the intended demographic for this film. But I had seen Devon Sawa in ""The Boys Club"" from 1995 and really liked that film, so I decided to watch this 12 years after its original release. I remember almost going to see it when it opened, but never got around to it.<br/><br/>That said, after the first 15 minutes of this movie, I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy this seemingly original idea along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"". But soon it just devolved into a teen slasher film, with the killer being ""death cheated"", overly explained by the coroner about 30 minutes in. Then Devon has to come to discover death's plan and try to fool it, supposedly ending the plan through interrupting it. This allows for a lot of grisly close calls and murders which seemed to me totally ludicrous, with objects self propelling and fires or explosions trying to kill the intended victim.<br/><br/>I confess that I don't believe that any events in one's life are preplanned by fate other than genetic tendencies, so the premise itself was one I could not accept. But if the story had instead emphasized the guilt of having survived and how that affected them psychologically, perhaps a better film could have emerged, where the viewer could question whether there was intent or just coincidence. But that would have required some subtlety and an intelligent script, which were not in evidence in this pedestrian film. The clever surprise at the end was not enough to add more than one point to the rating. So a 2 from me instead of a 1. By the way, Devon Sawa did a good job, considering the poor material he was given. Hard for me to believe this sub-mediocre effort spawned numerous sequels or remakes. I wonder if I would have liked this more were I in my teens or twenties. Probably, since when I re-watch some of the films I thought were good back in the 50's, I often wonder how I could have possibly enjoyed them."

","This is a really bad pseudo-horror film that would almost fit better into the disaster movie genre. A high school senior, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), has a violent premonition while sitting on a plane waiting for departure for his senior class trip to Paris. He causes a commotion that gets him, several students and a teacher to be kicked off the plane. After leaving and while watching the departure, there's a disastrous mechanical failure and the plane explodes killing all aboard. The passengers who were kicked off are interviewed by the FBI, who're particularly interested in Alex because of his foreknowledge of the event and is treated as a suspect. And after all that the film goes into overdrive with this vague specter going around causing accidents that kill the survivors in grotesque (and unintentionally funny) ways. Alex learns from a creepy mortician named William Bludsworth (Tony Todd in his best Candyman face and voice) that he somehow cheated Death's design and its correcting this by doing away with the people who walked away from the plane disaster. Alex becomes determined to stop it.<br/><br/>Give the writer some credit for a semi-original idea in having Death itself kill a bunch of stupid teens rather than a masked psycho with butcher's tools but the execution is pure B-movie slasher and the acting is as bad as a high school play especially from Devon Sawa.

","FD is the kind of movies that you dare call a decent one. It's the sole movie that dealt with death as a character of its own. It's the only movie that made me see death as a person who chases people in a smart tactical way and more importantly in a way that is set ahead that if you can escape it once, you will definitely fail the next time for Death has plan B for you! The idea was new, I know what you will say that death premonitions have already been used in Movies. That's true but not in the frame where death is pictured as a character of intelligence of its own. In the movie, you can't but sense the presence of death as a human being but of Godly power.<br/><br/>And, if you like horror movies for the creativity of deaths scenes used, then Final Destination is surely your thing. Everybody almost loved the first one and criticized the rest but I have to disagree.

"hnt_dnl","8","0","1","29 August 2009"," Makes you think!
","FINAL DESTINATION was a pleasantly surprising flick when I first saw it not long after it came out and it still keeps me interested. Of course, you'd think a film with horrific deaths and populated mostly by teenagers would be a mindless slasher flick, but this is, frankly, not. The film draws you in immediately as it postulates that ""Death"" has a plan. It gives clues to the the film's protagonist Alex Browning (excellently played by Devon Sawa) at the outset. Alex is scheduled to go on Flight 180 to France on a trip with his fellow senior students and their chaperones, including Miss Lewton (effective Kristen Cloke of SPACE:ABOVE AND BEYOND).<br/><br/>Fellow students include the shy Clear (sexy Ali Larter of HEROES). Clear is an orphan whose parents died in a tragic accident and she has a strange emotional connection to Alex, even though they had never spoken before the trip. Also there is the abrasive Carter (menacing Kerr Smith of DAWSON'S CREEK), Alex's best friend Tod (Chad Donella), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), and the goofy Billy (comic relief Sean William Scott of American PIE fame).<br/><br/>Alex has a premonition that the flight will crash and in the ensuing melee and confusion, Alex, Miss Lewton, Clear, Carter, Tod, Terry, and Billy all end up off the plane and have to take a later flight. When the plane does indeed explode and crash, everyone realizes that Alex was right! What's really interesting is that Alex is not really looked upon as a hero, but rather as a spooky freak! There are varying levels of relief, curiosity, and fear exuded by all the characters after this incident and it is the fact that the plot went in this direction that makes FINAL DESTINATION a rather fascinating film.<br/><br/>In the ensuing months, each character, still spooked out by the crash, avoids Alex, except for Clear, who is drawn to him in an almost psychic way. I find Alex and Clear coming together rather touching and it is not done in a predictable, maudlin way. They simply have a strong bond, a connection. One by one, the plane survivors begin to die rather gruesome, mysterious deaths as ""Death"" indeed does seem to have intended them to die, so Alex sets out to try to cheat ""Death""! <br/><br/>That's what is really scary about this film: Instead of the killer being a physical being, it is ""Death"" itself! How do you control it? How do you stop the ultimate killer? While this film could have devolved into parody or inanity, it never does. The dialogue is very good and the performances uniformly exceptional. <br/><br/>Character actors Daniel Roebuck and Roger Smith (as federal agents investigating the mysterious crash and Alex's story) also do a fine job of making the film work. Veteran actor Tony Todd (CANDYMAN) also deserves praise for his spooky performance as a caretaker that Alex and Clear go to for help on how to cheat death. A very provocative film."

And with that Alex could now predict, by the sequence of who's seat on the plane the fireball first hit, who'll among those who survived will be the next persons to die. This of course has everyone, including the local police and FBI, feel that Alex was somehow responsible for the taking down of flight 180! But just how he could have known that the plane was going to crash is anyone's guess! Was it sabotage? Was it that Alex knew that there was a bomb planted on the plane by terrorists?

"happyendingrocks","8","0","1","16 June 2009"," A movie about the simple things in life... and death
","The best horror films exploit simple fears, and since no sane person isn't at least a little bit afraid of flying, Final Destination chooses a brilliant catalyst for its mirth. But a set-up isn't enough to carry a film on its own, and the reason Final Destination works so well is that the film-makers don't rely on their fantastic concept to push the movie. In less-capable hands, this story would have been a rote 10 Little Indians kill cycle, but by integrating genuine suspense and boundless creativity into the proceedings, Final Destination falls somewhere much closer to the category of modern classic.<br/><br/>Without recounting the plot, the core premise here is that no one can cheat death, and that by challenging fate, we oppose powers far beyond our control or understanding. The ""survivors"" who get off of doomed Flight 180 are perfect essays for the range of human reactions to the inevitability of death. Some leave the plane in a panic, like those among us who fear death to the extent that we let this fear lead us through our lives and out of situations that may contribute to whatever nasty end we imagine is in store for us. Much more interesting, the others who disembark the jet before its inevitable destruction are led away from their fate by simple twists of chance, each with a series of minor actions that test the fabric of fate just enough to forge their unnatural survival of an event they were destined to perish in.<br/><br/>This complex but identifiable crux is why Final Destination is such a masterfully-rendered work of horror. We've all had those moments in our life where a seemingly random series of events culminates in a significant occurrence. It's quite natural to question what forces are at work in these instances, and how many variables were required to lead us to the conclusion we face.<br/><br/>According to Final Destination, the force at work here is Death, itself. And this Death is a relentless shadow that uses pure elements like water and fire (again, simple fears) to create extravagant macabre Rube Goldberg devices to carry out its task. The way each individual piece of these machinations relates to something most of us would consider mundane (a leaky water line, a crack in a glass) heightens the powerful horror that permeates the film. After all, these victims aren't doing things we would never do and creating their demises by irresponsible actions; they are in situations that could actually happen to us, and the brilliantly slow and suspenseful set-ups that accompany each death force us to question: would WE notice the dripping water that eventually leads to our death? <br/><br/>The scenes in the airport at the beginning of the film are particularly gripping. The dread is built though a series of subtle images that don't look at all out of place in the airport (the departure board, the words ""final destination"" on the ticket), yet something about them is askew (note that the number on the luggage cart that drives beneath the plane as the characters board is ""666"", for instance). This series of little coincidences are all things that many of us would never pay attention to, or even notice to begin with, but if we saw them all as our main character does, could we draw any other conclusion than the one he realizes?<br/><br/>Of course, there is also a lot to be said for the gleefully orchestrated carnage that keeps the pulse of the film steadily pumping. The plane crash is a truly shocking set-piece; chances are, no one reading this has been in one, but seeing it unfold on this screen, we get the sense that not only could the film-makers' scenario happen, it would probably happen EXACTLY like we see it here.<br/><br/>Even knowing what's coming doesn't prepare the viewer for some of the more carefully-plotted ""gotcha"" moments. (If you aren't caught off guard by the bus hit, I'm guessing you have the same semi-psychic sense that drives our main character to get off the plane to begin with). By mixing in the right amount of carnage, and making it as over the top as the story allows, the film strikes a great balance between tension and release, a tenuous and not-often-realized phenomenon that classifies most of the best horror films of all time.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film, by any means. FD has flaws both minor (Clear Rivers is one of the worst film character names of all time) and major (the entire FBI subplot, and the wholly unrealistic actions of the two agents, which are in direct opposition to the ""this could happen to you"" element that makes the film so frightening). The film also takes a credibility leap when the characters start calmly discussing ""finding the patterns"" and ""getting skipped"" (would anyone in this situation really be able to understand and articulate the phenomenon they are experiencing?). But there's also lot to be said for making a good old-fashioned thriller, and since we know that's what we're in store for here, it's relatively easy to allow our analytical minds take a siesta and simply enjoy how well this entire concept is brought to, ahem, life.<br/><br/>""Simple"". There's that word again. We keep coming back to it because the notion of simplicity is key to the film's successful delivery. If the main point of the story is that Death is coming, that's pretty simple, and still effective. However, the interlace of actions and reactions that construct each kill, and indeed the entire notion of Death searching for those who escaped it, is anything but simple. So, this entity seems simple on the surface, but is in fact a more intricately constructed web than we could possibly imagine. Such is life, and such is Final Destination."

But I was wrong.<br/><br/>From the beginning it was entirely believable. These youngsters seemed to know their stuff, and whilst I never really cared for them, they at least conveyed a genuine fidelity to their parts. The growing hysteria with the anticipated plane-crash and the special-effects with which it was realised were extremely harrowing. The CGI was good enough to convince at first show, which is more than can be said for many a movie of much greater budget and scale.<br/><br/>How do you deal with someone who foresaw the crash in a world of air-terrorism? The authorities are phlegmatic and assume he must have had a hand in it somehow. Yet the inevitable and meticulous evaluation of the wreckage points to an accident. It's a dilemma. They just have to suspect him of something.<br/><br/>Meanwhile death has come-up short on its body-count and means to make good the deficit. And it's here that I knock points off. It is never explained (because Death doesn't give interviews) why it goes about developing such complicated and involved scenarios in order to harvest its crop. Why not just give them all heart attacks? The contrived and sometimes sudden deaths are tense, entertaining and shocking by turns but - as I say - the underlying premise of death's deviousness is never explained and leaves - at least for me - a gaping hole in the satisfaction ship.<br/><br/>Still; it's well-acted, well-directed, and well made. The effects are good and the surprises keep coming.<br/><br/>And one other thing that keeps coming that's no surprise at all is that its unexpected success has spawned a franchise of sequel after sequel.<br/><br/>Poor old Death, always playing catch-up to the accountants."

","The best kind of horror movies now a days are the horror movies with great ideas and strong differences from other movies and Final Destination is that and more. <br/><br/>This movie shows many different deaths including the the guy getting strangled in the bathroom, the girl getting knifed by the glass in the exploding computer, the girl getting hit by the speeding bus, the guy getting decapitated by the train, the guy getting electrocuted, and the guy getting hit by the swinging billboard and all of them being so different. This movie introduced death as a force. It also expresses that your death is written in stone and if you somehow skip it it will come after you. <br/><br/>There are so many ways that Final Destination can scare you. It isn't a slasher movie but does have it's share of gore and violence but gore and violence that is needed to express it's plot.

","Hi, my name is Inesa and I'm from Ukraine. ""Final destination"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen.I liked it very much, but I'm a bit disappointed that there are only 3 parts of it.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about what might happen next if there existed the 4th part.I'm sure, those who watched the 3rd part would agree that this is not the end.<br/><br/>What if in ""Final destination 4"" the main character finally meets Death, has a talk with her... for example -- she explains that if Alex did not walk out of the plane in first part there would be no other deaths, no car crash, no accident in the park and so on. That all these are the consequences of one's wrong deed. Just something like that.<br/><br/>And than, finally -- the main character understands that he or she has to die in order to stop all those stupid deaths and bring peace to all the people...<br/><br/>I understand that this might sound foolishly, but still, I'm interested in your opinions and would be grateful if the directors would still release the 4th part of this film."

","Watching horror movies a lot is like landing a plane. Any landing that you survive is a good one. Any horror movie that can scare the grits out of you is good, too. Sure, you may feel embarrassed after you recover from either a false alarm or a dreadful fright, but the filmmakers managed to grip you by her fears and generate adrenalin. Now, the acid test for a genuinely good horror flick is whether the storyline is strong enough to maintain momentum during the expository lulls between the scary scenes. Director James Wong's creepy ""Final Destination"" qualifies as an improbable but entertaining dead teenager movie with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until fade-out.<br/><br/>Airline authorities remove a mixed bag of high school seniors bound for France from their ill-fated jetliner at the last minute when 17-year old Alex Browning (Devon Sawa of ""Idle Hands"") has a premonition about their 747 blowing up after take-off. Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke of ""Stay Tuned""), one of the teachers riding escort, agrees to behind with these reprobates while her Parisian cohort shepherds the remainder of the class across the Atlantic Ocean. While airport security guards detain them in the lounge, Flight 180 ascends into the night skies and explodes into a blazing fireball, with no survivors! Typically, any movie with a protagonist that rescues a collection of characters from certain death would win not only their undying gratitude but also their lifelong loyalty. ""Final Destination"" dispenses with such hackneyed histrionics. Instead, the people that Alex saved either hate his guts or have to stay away from him until their grief heals. Everybody but Clear Rivers (Ali Larter of ""American Outlaws""), a Gothic-looking gal whose dad died in a convenience store robbery and whose mom lost her marbles and abandoned her, takes a shine to the ostracized Alex. She knows that Alex has a gift for predicting the future, rather like Christopher Walken did in David Cronenberg's ""The Dead Zone"" (1983). No matter how hard these survivors try to cheat Death in this suspenseful, nail-biting, supernatural horror chiller, the Grim Reaper reclaims them like lost luggage in the end.<br/><br/>Feverishly, Alex struggles to discern a pattern so that he can cheat Death and save the lives of his friends. Somewhere between its smart-aleck cynicism and its mischievous mayhem, this variation on ""The Dead Zone"" grapples with some high-flown philosophy. Can anybody cheat Death? Does the Grim Reaper work by some kind of design? ""Final Destination"" thrives on melodramatic shocks and surprises as well as several elaborately staged Rube Goldberg death traps to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. Picture ""The Omen"" movies cross-bred with a slasher saga, and you've got a fairly good idea what to expect from this outlandish but provocative thriller. Considering the credentials of freshman director James Wong, who co-wrote ""Final Destination"" with scenarist Glen Morgan, it should come as no surprise that ""Final Destination"" emerges as such an engrossing chiller. Wong and Morgan both worked on many of the most memorable ""X-Files"" episodes and it shows in ""Final Destination."""

","This is perhaps best described as a slasher flick with a twist. The concept is interesting and well-developed, and remains both throughout. As long as you can do away with your disbelief for the duration, and accept that Death is going through something of a flashy phase, you're likely to enjoy this. The plot is reasonable, and keeps things going. The ending... *wow*. Thank you, Wong. Awesome job on that. The pacing is good, this certainly never gets boring. The effects are exceptionally done all the way. The acting varies, but it's never distractingly poor. Dialog... about the same, with some real high points here and there. The humor is absolutely great. It's never forced nor does it ever try too hard, and genuine comedy is the result, and it doesn't reach a level where the seriousness of the whole is lost, either. The cinematography and editing, the technical side of this in general, in marvelous. While there is some violence herein, this operates more through building tension. Suspense. The shocks are rather effective(they sure still work on me, and I've watched this a bunch of times). The writing isn't entirely flawless. I recommend this to fans of atmospheric horror, as well as the people who worked on it. 7/10"

The film brought me thrills and chills and it doesn't fail to disappoint if you're in for a fright. I was shocked by the gruesome deaths and was pleased with the surprise ending. I would definitely recommend this film but it isn't for the faint hearted or squeamish.

I was impressed with Devon Sawa's acting, maybe one of his best films and teamed with Ali Larter they give a great performance.<br/><br/>You'll finish watching this film maybe with a different outlook to life, it certainly changed my attitude to fate and next time you're on a plane you'll think twice about those nightmares you've been having."

Before getting inside the plane he starts noticing some sort of ""coincideces"" or ""ironies"" around him. He doesn't pay attention to them at first, but after getting inside the plane he falls asleep and has a very weird and scary dream about it exploding. He suddenly awakens and tells everyone to get off the airplane. Nobody believes him, yet some of his friends get off with him, including one teacher.

","Reflecting the whole ""terror without a face"" reality Americans woke up to on September 11th, 2001; the first Final Destination (released during early 2000) stands as a shocking premonition of things to come - with the main focus on (You guessed it) an Airplane Crash. After a student on a field trip actually has a premonition of this happening during the first minutes of the film, he storms out of the plane, dragging a group of fellow classmates with him. Moments later, the plane lifts off without them  and explodes right after its lift off. However, this was not supposed to happen. <br/><br/>You see, Final Destination believes death has a plan for all of us, and if you ""missed the train"" the first time around, fate will come after you with a vengeance  combined with a horrible and gruesome death. The rest of the film sees the group of frightened teenagers who survived the crash avoiding the unavoidable  only to face the grim reaper later on in the film. This may sound dumb at first, but the concept of the movie, along with the idea one can actually ""cheat death"" is fascinating, IMO. <br/><br/>Trust me, these aren't your average horror fairs  they are instant classics, with some of the death scenes (at least in the first part) already part of the horror pantheon for years to come."

He wants to help his fellow survivors but it's a tough thing to make them believe a crazy story like this.<br/><br/>Directed by James Wong (Final Destination 3, The One) made an intriguing horror/fantasy/thriller that has an amusing dark sense of humour and a game cast. Wong certainly has plenty of moments of style and suspense. Wong and Co-Screenwriter of the film:Glen Morgan (Black Christmas ""2006"" and Willard ""2003"") certainly learned a lot from their days of writing television episodes like ""Space:Above and Beyond"", ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The X-Files"". Originally this film started as a TV script from Jeffery Reddick (Day of the Dead ""2008"", Final Destination 2 and Tarama). Which Reddick wrote it for a ""The X-Files"" episode at first. But the producers felt this could have been a terrific film.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes three commentary tracks. Commentary one is by co-writer/director:Wong, co-writer/producer:Morgan, editor:James Coblentz and co-writer/story credit by Reddick. Commentary two is by actors:Sawa, Smith, Cloke and Donella. Commentary three is by the late talented music composer:Shirley Walker (Batman:Mask of the Phantasm, Escape from L.A., Memoirs of an Invisible Man). DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Two great featurettes and more. Two/Thirds of the movie is certainly an very good movie. But then towards the last act of the movie turns extremely heavy-handed. I also felt towards the end, it starts making fun of their own rules as well. To be honest, i liked the ""Final Destination"" sequels better than the original. It also takes Reddick's clever premise much less seriously as it should and the sequels are slightly more entertaining. But what's i think. Still ""Final Destination"" is one of the better horror movies of the early 2000's. It's certainly worth seeing. (*** ½/*****)."
"vip_ebriega","7","0","2","18 October 2007"," A terrific scare show.
","My Take: One of the spookier and more creative horror movies today. <br/><br/>In watching a horror flick, there are two things that I would expect. Either it's a true scare ride that makes me want to run for cover or shows true moments of uniqueness for its genre that it is scary. Both pleasure are in the slasher flick FINAL DESTINATION, which is surprisingly more creative and stylishly spooky than other ""hack-and-slash"" horror/slasher yarns. Although the characters are the usual teenagers served up for slaughter, they do a very terrific job in setting us up for a scare, and doesn't disappoint when it comes to their delivery.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa's character is named Alex, who has some strange premonitions of doom when boarding a plane to France. When on board, Alex had a realistic daydream of doom and began yelling out ""This plane will explode at take-off."" This part gets a little wild. Hold on! It gets real serious when the plane DOES explode. His fellow French class members and school teacher manages to get out before the plane exploded, but are now, death has a new ""design"" for them. Obviously, death doesn't take no for an answer.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best things and most likely the biggest reason viewers (especially horror buffs and teenagers) to watch FINAL DESTINATION are the really good quality kills. I mean, if you want to get rid of that teenager, who knows that their doom is at hand, why not do it with some style? This film has some very creative death sequences which might be one of the best I've seen in a horror film since the ones in THE OMEN series. Sure the possibility of that happening to you can only happen in a move, but this is a movie, right? Cinematic, indeed, but very, very creative.<br/><br/>Sure it features teenage characters that are not given any personality, but in this kind of film, which is just made to kill off the teenagers quick (and good), I don't think it needs time to develop its characters. The film isn't good on the cerebral basis (in other words, it's sometimes isn't smart), but the storyline has some very neat ideas (like the death sequences) and director James Wong does a great job making it to a wild ride. I was so surprised how I liked this film (both as a stylish or a ""run for cover"" horror flick). FINAL DESTINATION is a terrific scare show.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","I don't understand all the negative reviews this movie is receiving. I mean it's made for teenagers which should be apparent by the cast, yet people insist on bashing it by saying that it is stupid because it is a teen slasher. Yes in essence it is very well a teen slasher, but it is much more original and thought provoking than most. Sure it has the stereotypical slasher movie type characters, Carter and his girlfriend being the prime examples of this, but thats to be expected.<br/><br/>Overall the plot was solid, the characters believable (for the most part) and the scrip appeared well written enough. There was very few cheesy lines and the romance between Alex and Clear was done well, neither rushed nor prolonged too much. The two had a lot of chemistry and worked well together on the screen.<br/><br/>There are a few inconsistencies with it that I myself can't overlook. For instance, why in the world would people stay on a plane if someone said it was going to explode. I know that he was just a kid and very few people will take the word of a kid seriously, but his outburst she have shaken at least a few people into walking off the plane. I know I would but then again that's just me.<br/><br/>I also don't know how he got away with supposedly killing the teacher when the police were sure he did it. At the end they just showed him in France with his friends rather than in jail for her death. They never did explain how his name got cleared.<br/><br/>Despite this though the movie is good. It's a teen movie at heart and perhaps it does lean more towards the slasher genre than anything else but it does so in style. It has the creativity that most slasher and indeed even horror films of it's time seemed to lack and that to an extent still seem to lack.<br/><br/>Overall not Oscar winning material but a very good film nevertheless. 8 out of ten."

Whilst preventing the worst from happening, Alex must also dodge the FBI, who believe Alex caused the explosion.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>The movie is defiantly a thriller, and is important for them to cast the right stars for the job. They really need to portray characters which are easily recognisable and can make you become emotional towards them. The stars chosen for this film are a good choice for the characters. The look of the characters fit well with how they are supposed to be acting. Kerr Smith as Carter Horton is a perfect example of this. He is portrayed as the meaner character of the bunch, and his looks and cocky attitude adds to this character.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>Like most recent horror flicks, the soundtrack is very dark and brooding. With this film it works very well, with the suspense. The music isn't used in the wrong way, which can often take away the scare factor. The film is more fun and scary when actions happen in a split second, rather than the music building up to something. Shirley Walker does a wonderful soundtrack which really fits in with the paranormal atmosphere of the story.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>The special effects in the film are actually amazing. A horror movie seems to accomplish its task of scaring the audience a lot better, when it is used with very little CGI. There are so many techniques used, to prevent the use of CGI, that it's hard to understand what a practical effect it. Like the death of Ms Lewton. It was impossible to tell that there was actually a wooden board above her body to prevent the knife from hitting here. All these different styles and techniques used is what make the film good.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Out of all the recent horror films which have been released, 'Final Destination' is probably one of the top flicks. The more horror films which are released, the harder it takes to create something original and scary, but 'Final Destination' triumphs this. This is one horror film, which would work perfectly watched in the dark, and would defiantly make you think twice about what death has planned. Enjoy.<br/><br/>""Don't talk to me.

","I watched Final Destination 3 without watching the first two, so thanks to DVDs, I'm going to make amends. The most I know about the first Final Destination was that explosion onboard an aircraft was one of the most realistic ever, and probably had this movie banned from inflight entertainment systems.<br/><br/>Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) has a fear of flights, and in his class outing to Paris, he had a premonition about the flight going boom, and created enough a ruckus to have him thrown out of the plane, together with a few of his friends and teacher. Naturally he becomes guilt ridden, and prime suspect when the plane explodes mid-air without a clue as to why (following the actual TWA flight 800). Together with Clear Rivers (what a name, played by Ali Larter), they discover that if they were destined to die in that flight, then Death will soon be on his way to complete his mission, in the order that they were supposed to go.<br/><br/>It brings to mind that our deaths are probably pre-ordained the moment we are born, and death has designed the way we have to go too. The premise is that should you beat that design, then you get a second chance. But are we up to that? Nope, because we want to see how the cardboard characters get sent on their way. However, the deaths presented here aren't really horrific or designed with grandeur, probably because they don't age so well over time. They do seem rather gimmicky in today's context.<br/><br/>Not expecting an adrenaline rush each time the characters die or beat death, the plot does get slowed down because of the romance bit between Alex and Clear (and most ended up on the cutting room floor), so they do come across pretty jarringly. And the group size for death is relatively small, so you don't go beyond that number, including survivors. It's a pretty decent thriller, but a reminder that the nature of these thrillers is that they age quite badly over time."

","""Final Destination"" is a horror movie that you can't help but love - while it might not be the scariest out there, it's originality and creative deaths make it great. The film starts off with a teenage senior named Alex (Devon Sawa) who is heading out on a field trip to Paris, France with his senior classmates. Afraid of flying to begin with, he is a little nervous. But after boarding the plane, he has a premonition of a horrible plane crash that kills himself and everyone onboard. Awaking from the dreamlike vision, he abruptly gets off of the plane, causing a scene, with a handful of other students and one of the teachers following. When the plane takes off, sure enough, it does explode, killing all onboard. But after the horrible accidents, those who survived (thanks to Alex's premonition) begin to die bizarre deaths. A loner named Clear (Ali Larter), who was among those who left the plane, teams together with Alex while they uncover that it just may be Death itself that has a 'plan'. And if the plan is intruded, those who cheated death are going to pay the consequences.<br/><br/>This film deserves a 10 alone just for the complete originality of it's story. I've never seen another film of this subject matter, and it's quite interesting how the film plays out. I think it's a great idea for a horror movie, unique and original. The entire personification of 'death' scenario is an interesting thing to play with. The plane-crash premonition was intense, and since I'm terrified of flying anyway, it made me pretty uneasy. The deaths that follow throughout the film are quick, sometimes unexpected, and genuinely shocking. Some of the deaths are anticipated, you know it's going to happen, which is quite suspenseful. But some of the others caught me completely off-guard, they were so abrupt and unexpected that I was nearly speechless. <br/><br/>The actors here were great, Devon Sawa fit the leading role as our hero who is trying to save all of his classmates as Death begins to pick them off. Ali Larter (from the ""House on Haunted Hill"" remake) plays his helpful sidekick, Clear, very well. The rest of the cast all did good jobs, and we even got a cameo from Tony Todd (of the ""Candyman"" series) as a mortician who Alex and Clear run into one night. The ending to film was clever and left it open-ended for the sequels that followed, which were both well-done but not quite as good as the original.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Final Destination"" is an excellent horror movie. It's not really scary, but it has one of the most original stories among recent horror films, and the creative deaths and inventive sequences that take place make it all the more better. Surely worth a look for horror and thriller fans alike. 9/10."

Donnella do good with their small roles.<br/><br/>However, I highly disliked Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the detectives that get in the way. They were annoying, pointless characters that just get in the way of an otherwise great horror movie.<br/><br/>This film also spawned two fun sequels and I do not see why it didn't skyrocket Devon Sawa's career."

","If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another ""guy with a hook"" campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.<br/><br/>Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.<br/><br/>If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.<br/><br/>The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.<br/><br/>The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.<br/><br/>The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.<br/><br/>The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.<br/><br/>The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive ""tag-you're-dead"" quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.<br/><br/>Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across."

","Basically, a guy has a premonition that the plane he's about to board with his class will blow up. He panics, and gets himself and a few others thrown off the plane. Then, it explodes. This is where it picks up speed. Death starts stalking them, killing them off in what I have to admit are some pretty unique ways.<br/><br/>This is not a bad horror flick. It at least has a plot, and isn't just a spectacle showing off new gore effects. The acting is pretty good, but some scenes could be improved. It has plenty of action and plot twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only thing that could be improved really (aside that it's not the world's best idea for a movie, and is sort of corny), would be some of the death scenes could be extended. Really, some of them just happen so fast you have to watch it again in slow motion just to see what happened. Other than that, this is a pretty darn good movie."

","Alex and other students are going to a field trip to Paris. They get on the plane. Alex has a bad feeling the plane's going to crash. They take off and the plane starts to shake violently. The lights start to turn on and off and an explosion occurs in the left side of the plane and people fall out of the whole. Then another explosion occurs and burns everyone to death!<br/><br/>Alex suddenly wakes up from a vivid dream and the the plane hasn't taken off, yet. He starts to hyperventilate and drags six people out of the plane. Some students get mad because they will have to miss a day in Paris but suddenly, the plane takes off and it explodes, just like Alex's dream. After this event, the seven survivors starts to get killed one by one with freak accidents. Alex and the help of his friend, Clear, has to find out when will Death starts to kill them, next.<br/><br/>This is one of your smarter teenage slasher films. No, it's no where like a killer chasing and killing people. But yes, it has a lot of violence. It's Death, in which you can't stop what's happening in part of life. The acting by Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were decent at best.<br/><br/>This movie has a very elaborate concept, in which many horror movies do not. The deaths in the movie are even foreshadowed through clues, which makes you want to look for them. You would even have to pay attention to easter eggs, like the fact that before each person dies, the same song is played.<br/><br/>Some deaths in the film are good, but many are more of a let down, since you ""might"" want them more violent. Still, they are pretty creative. I like the weird score by the composer, which gives a brooding effect through the film.<br/><br/>This is a smart but not a scary movie, for me at least. The deaths are good in this movie but they're not great. If you are tired of regular slasher movies where a killer kills people, then watch this movie and you'll like it."

","Final destination is a very unique horror movie that differs from the others. The reason? You cannot see the killer. In fact the killer isn't an he or she, but rather an ""it."" Not even a monster. It is Death itself. While it lacks good acting, (they may make it look real but you can tell some fake it and the only GOOD actor is Tony Todd.) Final Destination starts off with Alex Browning. Your regular guy at a regular school with regular friends and a regular life. He is taking a class trip to France with his best friends Tod Waggner and his brother George. Along with them are The Jock/jerk Carter Horton and his girlfriend Terry Cheney. The Teacher Valerie Lewton, and the funny guy but with no friends kid Billy Hitchcock and the lonely orphan girl at the school Clear Rivers.<br/><br/>Pre-boarding Flight ""180"" Alex sees on his flight board that his flight has been ""Terminated"" weird enough he goes on and sits down. He then takes a break at the bathroom and hears ""Rocky Mountain High"" by John Denver who happened to die in a plane crash.<br/><br/>Still a little shaken by the thought Alex boards the plane and sits down. And the plane takes off. At first it seems like a normal ride but then the turbulence builds and all of sudden the masks come down and taking one section of the plane out finally blowing it up into Alex's face.<br/><br/>And he wakes up. It was a premonition. Alex goes and has a freak attack and gets Tod, Carter, Billy, Terry, and Clear kicked off while George stays. When they are told that someone must stay with them Mrs. Lewton tells the other teacher to go back. As the arguing continues suddenly the plane does in fact blow up and they are taken by the FBI to be investigated. The agents though happen to be interested in Alex seeming that he was the one that started it all. Though they let him go.<br/><br/>A few months later after a memorial service for the victims everyone starts treating Alex like a freak and Tod's father is making him stay away from Alex because he is upset that George died. They all give him crap and the service ends.<br/><br/>Later that night while Alex is working at his desk an owl comes by his desk and Alex throws a pencil at it when the newspaper flys to the fan and gets sliced. A piece of paper he happens to read say ""Tod."" Meanwhile over at Tods while inside the bathroom we see a liquid emerge from the toilet and start to slowly make its way towards Tod. Tod slips on the liquid and the falls into the tub with the wire from the curtain around his neck and it strangles him. The liquid get sucked back down into the pipe.<br/><br/>Alex comes by later to find him dead having ""commited suicide."" All fingers point to Alex. He and Clear together who think the incident was a little too weird decide to go to the morgue where they meet the mortician William Bludworth (Tony Todd) who seems to know a lot about death. He explains to them how death works. He also points out that Tod was pulling at the wire. He explains that death has a design and that when you cheat death. Death makes a new design to kill those who were supposed to die.<br/><br/>Later Clear and Alex sit at a Cafe discussing what they just learned. As he looks to the window he sees a bus go by and then he looks to see that there was no bus. All of a sudden fate brings the group together and Carter starts to give Alex a bad time. Terry sick of it yells at Carter. She tells him that if he doesn't want to stop giving Alex a hard time then he can drop dead. Instantly a second later she is run over by a bus.<br/><br/>After this incident they realize that they must try to figure out deaths design and try to stop each other from getting killed.<br/><br/>This film is a really unique story that I can see becoming just like the Nightmare and Friday the 13th series. Just have them keep on throwing them at us.<br/><br/>The only thing this one lacks (not the other two) is the gore. Otherwise that I can watch this again and again. For a 90 minute horror movie this is one you should see. Enjoy!"

Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane, along with five other students; Clear, Carter, Billy, Terry and Tod, as too one of the teachers; Ms. Lewton. They don't believe Alex, thinking he's hysterical, yet when the plane explodes, they don't know what to believe.<br/><br/>Final Destination has a great premise. As they left the plane, the seven 'survivors', cheated death in doing so. Though death is not done with them, picking them off one by one; there's no cheating death. Yet Final Destination isn't that great of a film over all. The directing is clumsy at times, the acting is nothing great, the dialog is nothing special either, yet these aren't the elements that make Final Destination a great watch. It's the elaborate deaths scenes that make this so interesting. Each one is either out of no where or meticulously drawn out for some exciting suspense.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Kristen Cloke don't bring that memorable of performances.

Everyone who survived is about to pay the price because the grim reaper is an intractable enemy. Think of death here like The Terminator, or the unstoppable Borg from Star Trek, but with a malicious sense of humor.<br/><br/>Seeing Final Destination was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of my life. If they had been charging $100 a ticket, the price of admission would have been worth it. Movies like this should remind us all that waiting until a movie comes out on video is a poor decision. Almost invariably, the impact of seeing a movie is severely diminished on the TV screen (I don't care if you have a 70-inch plasma; nothing substitutes for seeing a movie in the theatre. When I saw Dawn of the Dead in the theatre, my heart was racing all night, and for the first time ever, I locked my bedroom door. When I watched it again on video.....zilch, nada.)<br/><br/>The script has plenty of clever twists and turns. The writing, editing, and cinematography are absolutely brilliant.

","Yes this is another horror flick where the characters die one by one. At least it's not this person that can't die chase them with the cattle prod. They die because death is chasing them. The only thing that really ""creeped me out"" about the movie was the plane crash. Having a fear of flying the crash scene at the beginning hit home and made me squirm.<br/><br/>The only real flaw in the movie (aside from the horror formula used over and over again) is the fact that if death wanted to get you it could find ways other than elaborate ways it does in this movie. Death would just give them all heart attacks and be done with it. It's like the when death wants to go get an ice cream cone it buys a cow and milks it and makes cream then mines the minerals to build a refrigerator to turn it into ice cream. It's all to hokey. If they could have figured out a way to not have that plot hole I might have given it a 8. But that dropped it down to a 7."
"Mr_PCM","7","0","1","2 February 2006"," A new twist on the slasher flick!
","Final Destination is your average run-of-the-mill teen horror movie, but with one key difference from most; a rather unique premise.<br/><br/>Having had a premonition that the flight he is boarding will blow up, Alex (Devon Sawa) causes panic by telling the plane, forcing the airline to disembark him and several other people. When the plane really does blow up soon after take-off, the FBI become convinced he caused the explosion. But they aren't the only ones on the survivors' tail. Death is also after them, and is determined to claim the souls that cheated it on the plane, and one by one they begin to die in bizarre and increasingly bloody accidents.<br/><br/>The film is simply far too ridiculous for words. But that is part of the fun  trying to figure out exactly what series of morbid co-incidences will lead to a gruesome death., and who will be next. But to compensate for this originality, the characters are all straight out of school clichés 101; the jock, the kook, the nerd, the princess  they might as well have cast the kids from The Breakfast Club! But what is interesting about the casting is some playing against type  most notably Seann William Scott as a nerd and Ali Larter considerably dressed down as the kook, while Kerr Smith enjoys a change of pace from his role as gay Jack as the jerk jock. The acting is all steady but never spectacular, except for a brief cameo by Tony Todd of Candyman fame who manages to steal the film from just a couple of minutes screen-time as a creepy morgue worker.<br/><br/>Certainly more original than any of the other major teen horror flick franchises doing the rounds such as Jeepers Creepers, and definitely worth a watch. But perhaps two sequels (including the forthcoming Final Destination 3) was perhaps stretching a good idea so far."

","Not only are the death scenes in this movie are thrilling, but this movie is what I call 'genuine original horror'. Often when we watch other horror movies that include monstrous creatures, psychotic killers, and weird ghosts or spirits like 'The Ring', this particular villain in Final Destination is the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper is a devilish spirit in who some of us believe and some of us don't. In this movie, I believe the tension will crawl up in your nerves, and possibly in the end thinking up of the question - Does the Grim Reaper really exist? or Is it true that some people who die of freak accidents are really stalked by Death or just coincidences? Death is what I would call the most inevitable villain, watching you at all times. Death does not appear in front of your eyes and is an invisible presence.

"SteveHevetS","8","0","3","25 December 2005"," Accidents happen all the time ... death has a design
","The first few scenes of Final Destination are designed to grab attention and set the scene for the remainder of the film, with minimal verbalization and a good dose of shock-value. Connections between characters are set in place ... in more than one way. All in all, everything a good intro should have.<br/><br/>There is, for a while, a sense of tension between Alex and other main characters during ensuing events. All but one of the characters are to some degree irrational about the situation that has unfolded. This is to me a merit of the film, because people are very often irrational in such situations, and understandably so. The film avoids the trap of simplistic or sentimental indulgences, opting for more complexity in the emotions and actions of the characters.<br/><br/>One of the things that stood out in this film from me was how little felt predictable, particularly given design is the central point. In fact, some of the events are downright unexpected, particularly the ... shall we say ... abrupt ones?<br/><br/>If you're going to build a film around a well-defined set of rules, then the plot should be developed within those rules, and sufficient information given about why the rules have been broken, when they're broken. Final Destination shows that with some thought it is possible to achieve this, and to good effect (why can't more horrors do so?) And even with a clear design, there is plenty of suspense. The malevolence in this film is subtle, in a fashion, yet at the same time it manages to pack quite a punch. Supernatural elements are used sparingly and effectively as a plot device, without becoming intrusive. The main characters are convincing, even if the acting of some of the more peripheral characters is left wanting at times. The cinematography and atmosphere round things out nicely.<br/><br/>This film has a cleverly conceived and coherent plot - one that stands up after the film is finished, and the events scrutinized. So what is the final destination for the characters? Find out ... it's a great ending."

","Final Destination was a really good film with a few surprises and lots of blood and gore, which made it a nice and decent film. The story involves a high school french class that are going on a trip to Paris. Then one of the Students-Alex(the main character)has a violent premonition that the plane will explode right after take-off. The premonition is very realistic and gory. It was very heart-pounding because the director-James Wong- put lots of work and effort into filming this movie especially the airplane sequence. Then when Alex wakes up from his vision, he tells everyone to get off and causes an argument with Carter Horton- another character. Alex and Cater get kicked off the plane along with Clear-a classmate that felt Alex's vision, Billy & Tod-Alex's Friends, Terry-Carter's girlfriend, and Ms. Lewton-a teacher that decided to stay with the students. Then when the 7 people are sitting in the lounge,Alex's vision becomes reality when the plane explodes after the take-off. Then a month later Tod- Alex's friend ends up dead. Soon the seven friends start dying in mysterious ways-as if Death had been tampered with and was looking for payback. The deaths in the movie are spectacular and are very realistic considering that there is no serial killer or maniac running around trying to kill everybody. It is about a group of normal teens ending up dead because they cheated death. What is most surprising is that the people in the movie die because of normal household items or something that you see everyday e.g.-knives,buses,trains,clothes lines,computers,etc. And the thought that being stalked by Death is just plain scary because Death is all around us everyday. That is what makes this movie a real twist in horror movies and what makes it very successful."

But as they have boarded the plane, Alex has a vision of the plane exploding. He panics and angers fellow student Carter. A fight follows and the both along with some friends of theirs and a teacher are kicked off the plane. As they argue over the missed flight at the gate, they see the plane explode, just as Alex said it would. The terrible tragic is hard to deal with, especially if you ""saw"" it happen before it did. The school has a memorial hoping to heal all wounds, but soon thereafter odd accidents happen to those who survived the crash. They've cheated Death, and Death doesn't appreciate being cheated very much.<br/><br/>Comment: As I heard of it I thought it was a stellar idea. You can't cheat Death, he will come for you. Though the end result is not bad, actually it is pretty good, it is not as good as I envisioned. Basically I thought you could spin it two ways. A) a horror comedy with a lot of freak accidents or B) a pure horror with a lot of deaths and scares. Now it's neither, or a little of both. First, there are too few people to kill of to begin with. Time as to be filled, so a subplot of Alex being suspected of foul play (and he has a incredible ability to incriminate himself) by the FBI. The subplot is good but does not fit any of my alternatives above, and I think it slows the pace of the movie a little too much. The cast is good even though this is (surprise) no Academy Award-winning performance. Best is Seann William Scott in a role very typical for him. Director James Wong and his crew of special effects workers should be mentioned. It is well worth to pay attention, and I also had as much fun reading through the trivia and checking up on them afterwards as I had watching the movie.<br/><br/>7/10"

","What made ""Final Destination"" so great was that it had a different approach to horror films. It wasn't your typically teenage-slasher flick type of movie with some madman hacking people to death with an ax. Instead, it dealt with the subject of 'death.'<br/><br/>Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) gets some of his classmates and a teacher off a plane which, he claims after having a dream, will explode. After the plane DOES explode, those Alex pulled off the plane begin to die, one by one. This just proves that, according to the film's tag-line, 'you can't cheat death.'<br/><br/>The ways the characters die are violent, but oddly realistic. The characters themselves make sense, and the direction by James Wong (of TV's 'The X Files') is great.<br/><br/>As you watch the film, you can't help but think that one day, your day will come.

","Of the teen horror movies which appeared in the nineties most were dumb gore fests with cheap shocks and a sexy, young cast. However, there were 2 stand outs: Scream, of course, and Final Destination. Both are intelligent, with involving story lines, good characters, genuine shocks, and grisly deaths. While Scream was full of parodies and self-referential stuff, Final Destination played on our fear of death- the one thing which we all cannot avoid. While it does make jokes about itself and its genre, they are fewer than Scream, and do not go as over the top as some other films. The director fills every scene with real tension and fear, and successfully combines this with excellent set pieces and stunts, as well as sustaining a brilliant story. There are few films that can do this so we should admire Final Destination.<br/><br/>128 students are planning to travel to France with their teachers for one last big school trip. However, the plane crashes, killing everyone on board. We then flash back and realise that it was the premonition of one of the students, Alex. He has been having a strange day, and when he sees that his premonition is coming true he tries to get everyone off the plane. Like a certain Twilight Zone episode he succeeds in only causing a minor panic and some embarrassment, and is thrown off the plane together with a few others who got involved. As they wait in the airport Alex relates what he saw and of course no one believes him. Suddenly the plane explodes, his premonition came true. In the aftermath, some of the survivors mourn, others see it as a second chance, the cops become interested in how Alex knew what was going to happen, and Alex has further visions. Soon the survivors are killed in bizarre ways, and the cops believe it is Alex. Alex thinks that death is stalking them because they cheated it, and he works out the order that they will die in, believing that if they can catch the visions and prevent themselves from dying again, they will be safe. This will not be easy though, as death can, and does strike from everywhere.<br/><br/>The idea behind the story is excellent, and it is stylishly and effectively executed. It will appeal to the teen audience it is aimed at, but also older viewers as it is a very thought-provoking, existential film. This may sound a bit extreme, but apart from going back to watch Bergman movies, this is the perfect film. One character, Carter believes he is in control of his own life, not some invisible force, and at one point tries to prove this by parking on train tracks in front of an approaching train. Alex becomes increasingly paranoid, hiding in a hut from death, safe-proofing it in every way he can. Clear tries to be strong, has learnt to be this way through a tough childhood and cannot believe that all life is is a series of days avoiding death. The other survivors all have their individuality, and are not pastiches of other characters from teen movies. As well as this, the performances are each outstanding, even from Sean William Scott who proves he is more than capable of being Stiffler forever. The side plot of the cops believing Alex is behind the deaths adds a depth which most teen horror films do not have.<br/><br/>Wong's direction is very stylish, and the deaths and set pieces are some of the most innovative ever, recalling the style of Argento, that everything is a potential killer. He also creates a massive amount of tension throughout, peaking with each death- the train and car scene will get the most flabby heart racing, the teacher in the kitchen is brilliantly staged within every fork and implement seeming deadly. The opening 15 minutes have to be among the most tense and exciting 15 minutes in movie history, confirming all those with a fear of flying to stay firmly on the ground. Though as you will see, the ground is far from safe. The film shows how we are not immortal, and without the humorous moments it might become too much. There are many famous shock moments, the bus scene being the best. Many have complained about this being stupid and unrealistic, but if death was stalking you, of course it would try to put the approaching bus under a veil of silence. It is beyond understanding that anyone could rate this a 1, but we can see why people may not like it. The premise may seem too far-fetched for people, but they seem to have forgotten that it is a fictitious horror film. Death here as a character does have a sense of humour, each death being ironic, gruesome or made to look like an accident, but this is all the more terrifying, that this force is coming after us for entertainment. Death wants immediate pay back for those who cheated it, but in the style of a Bond villain, likes to play with its victims first. Of course the deaths may seem impossible in the real world, but if it is Death stalking us, I think it has the power to bend a few rules. Most criticism of this film is petty and unexplained, meaning that the scoring of zero cannot be justified. For clever, shocking, exciting teen horror movies, there are very few better than this.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","I actually own Final Destinations one and two and Alex Browning LIVES at the end of the first one, but during the second movie at the beginning a police officer tells Kimberly that there was only one survivor out of the seven who got off the plane. Why would someone make a movie having someone live at the end of the first movie but in the second they don't mention that he lived and the person who survived was Clear Rivers? Don't get me wrong I love both movies but its kinda weird for someone to live at the end of the first movie but not mention or show he lived in the second one. I'd love to meet Devon Sawa anyways he's a good actor....I'd love to see what he would be like in real life...Yeah he maybe just another person like me and you but he's a lot more rich than I.

","Well, they won't be showing this one as an in-flight movie! A flight-phobic teenager (Devon Sawa) begins having premonitions and insights to a pattern in the way death comes to individuals.

It is a captivating concept, and the grisly deaths and disasters are spectacularly portrayed.

"subterranean-1","7","0","2","9 October 2004"," quite decent little teen horror flick
","I did not expect much of this movie. The idea, some people surviving a plane crash and then being haunted by death, seemed far-fetched, and I had heard some pretty negative comments from friends. But then not everyone is a fan of teen horror movies, and I guess the negative reactions were mostly due to that. Of course the plot is far-fetched, of course there are some inconsistencies, and of course this isn't anything meaningful. But I think that teen horror movies have to be judged by the standards of the genre. And seen from this perspective, it does pretty well. First of all the production values are good, the editing careful (watch the title sequence with all the little cues), the overall design nicely thought out. Casting is o.k., even though Kerr Smith may seem a little out of place to fans of ""Dawson's Creek"". There are enough graphic deaths to keep the more gore-oriented faction of fans reasonably satisfied, the love story (doesn't every teen horror flick need one) is nicely subdued, and most important - it is at no time apparent what is going to happen next. The end, which some people seem to have found confusing, actually makes a lot of sense and cleared up a nagging feeling of being cheated that I had during the last ten minutes or so, expecting a typical happy end. Instead it leaves the future of the two remaining survivors at stake - inviting the (probably rather cheap) sequel that movies of this genre need. All in all a wholly watchable effort."

","Final Destination has redefined horror. Giving us something else to be afraid of. We haven't had that in such a long time. Final Destination didn't focus on the gore of the movies like it did the shadows and music that made this film keep you on the edge of your seat. it follows in the footsteps of the original Hollywood horror films that used lighting and theme music to bring about a story that gets to us all. Everyone was basically tired of the Freddy and Jason movies as the became very predictable. With Final Destination we have learned that there are still things out there that scare us. In the new era of horror Hollywood has been gracious enough to lead us into a different direction and Final Destination is at the helm, with such movies as scream & I know What You Did Last Summer it just shows to us horror fans that Hollywood can still entertain our class of viewers.

","Not a fantastic summary I know, but that's what this movie is. It's good- but only in the genre of teen horror flicks. It's one of the best of that list.

But for this film, I was almost one of them. It's not scary in the least (unless you're easily shocked) but it is hilarious. I don't think that was really the point, but it makes for an OK 2 hours or so.

","Although not fantastically amazing special effects/cast/even storyline, there is just something about Final Destination which makes it a teen horror/thriller that you *have* to see. Maybe it is the fact that it doesn't have fantastic effects etc. The lead is a handsome young chappy who does a good job of his role, the rest of the cast play their parts well and though not the most famous of casts, they fit into their roles suitably well. The story is quite intricate with funky little twists and is good compared to others, I felt that this film had more story to it than most teen horrors which gave it it's charm. I give this film 8 out of 10 simply because I love it! The sequel however I feel failed it greatly and could have been done a lot better, thus I prefer to think of Final Destination on it's own without its sequel, because I know it doesn't do it justice."

I would never watch this movie again for any reason whatsoever (I honestly don't what it's still doing in my video collection). The movie is annoying with its constant f-this and f-that language.

  Wong's film is a real challenge for all of us that want to find out a second earlier at least what's there ahead of us, waiting... One thing is for sure: you cannot cheat death, nor predict what's next (remember what Master Yoda stated: ""Always in motion is the future""). Briefly, the story goes like this: having a vision of his plane to Paris crashing in flames, Chance Browning gets off, all sweaty, together with several of his fellows and a teacher. The vision gets real and everyone looks at him suspiciously. What they don't realize now is that they were meant to be on that plane and die. Which they will soon do, because Death has something else in store for them and this is definitely not survival.<br/><br/>  Extremely well-defined atmosphere (watch out for the anticipations in the opening credits), increasing tension, good acting and brilliant style in editing. Wong pays homage in a very interesting way to great horror movies history figures, naming his characters Browning, Waggner, Lewton a.s.o.<br/><br/>
Some viewers may not handle several horrific deaths (Tod's strangulation, for instance - by the way, ""Tod"" means ""death"" in German, how ironical!) for which goosebumps are guaranteed. <br/><br/>Anyway, ""Final Destination"" is a film NOT to be missed because it deals in fact with the raw stuff of our innermost expectances and fears.

It was a fun movie.<br/><br/>Of the five death scenes (excluding the flight of course), three were so daftly convoluted that you had to laugh. In fact, after the first one I found myself really looking forward to the subsequent deaths just to see what daft ideas they'd come up with next. The second death was more of a shock. It was unexpected, in a way, as I was expecting another 'Mousetrap' scenario but was left with my mouth open at the instant dismissal of an easily forgettable character.<br/><br/>The end pleased me. These films need twists, they can never be straight.<br/><br/>Acting in these type of films is rarely great. The lead, Devon Sawa, was half-decent, the rest made the minimum of effort. Seann William Scott as Billy Hitchcock was the worst, he didn't seem sure whether he was one of his no-brainer characters from `American Pie', or `Dude, Where's My Car', or was he acting straight. A strange amalgamation of the two happened instead - forget the recurrence of 25/9 and 180 etc., the recurrence of him falling off his bike was the only decent moments for him.<br/><br/>Overall it could've been so good; it's a great idea for a movie and was reasonably well executed. I'm not looking forward to the sequel."

","This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time (possibly, ever). I sat down to this movie, fearing it would fail (like many of its predecessors).<br/><br/>Was I ever wrong!<br/><br/>Alex, a high school senior, has a premonition that the plane carrying his class to Paris will never reach its final destination. As aspects of this premonition begin to come true, Alex freaks out - landing a teacher & some other students a one-way ticket off the plane. The plane blows up right after take-off, sending all on board to their final destination.<br/><br/>Death, furious that his ""design"" was cheated, pursues the survivors in the order they were intended to die. It is now up to Alex, who continues to forsee Death coming, to save his classmates & teacher. Unfortunately, nobody believes him (cliche, but works beautifully here).<br/><br/>One of the best elements of the film is the subtlety of Death. He does not stalk his victims with flesh-and-blood body, but through wind & shadow. The tools of his destruction are calculated & precise, using everyday items. Never before have I seen a killer so cunning.<br/><br/>I conclude that if you have not seen this movie, you're missing out on the genius that is Final Destination. Rent this movie - take my word on it!"

He has a nightmare about the plane exploding and when things happen when he wakes up that happened in the nightmare he wants to get off the plane but he starts a fight with Carter who thinks Alex is lying. Anyway when the fight happens 5 people are thrown off the plane. Alex's friend goes off to help Alex and a girl called Clear who also knows what's gonna happen goes off on her own free will. The plane crashes. Then Death keeps killing the survivors in order they would have died in the explosion.<br/><br/>This could have been a comedy horror because it had comedy elements for example someone says ""You may as well drop dead!"" but they drop dead suddenly after.<br/><br/>It has some of the best jump scares ever but I was hoping the Grim Reaper would take out a scythe to kill one of the survivors. He is death after all and the mortician mentioned him.<br/><br/>Another thing though is that there isn't enough gore in this film. There is one gory(if even) death scene. Note down for sequel there must be more gore.<br/><br/>There are characters you want to die that don't and people you want to survive that died in this film. Note again for sequel let likeable people survive and unlikeable people to be slaughtered.<br/><br/>It had a great ending.

Death itself is the evil at hand. That is what makes the movie stand alone in an extremely good way. It's unique and very scary. The characters are real and you can relate to them. The action. The thrills. The chills. The terror. It's all dramatic. You can tell the writers spent alot of time on the story. They made sure each character was just as good as the next. The death scenes were so unexpected, which made them all the better. This is the best horror/thriller movie I've seen in years because it goes to the limits and shakes the horror field by it's neck.

Alex, played by Devon Sawa, and his French class are going to take a flight to Paris. While the plane is boarding, Alex doses off and has a premonition of the plane exploding. He wakes up to find that most of the premonition is true. So he causes a fuss and gets him, and about 6 other people kicked off the plane. Thus begining the killer, death itself, to claim the lives of the people who cheated him once. Now Alex has to figure out the pattern which Death is following and cheat it once again.<br/><br/>Cast: Devon Sawa= Alex, Chad E. Donella= Todd, Ali Larter= Clear, Kerr Smith>Carter, and others.<br/><br/>Good Points: Drifts away from most horror flicks where there is a human killer. People die different. The love story, if implied, does not take up much of the screen time ( original ending ). Good acting.<br/><br/>Bad Points: The only real bad points i found were the alternate ending. What was that?!?! It was predictable, i'm glad they re-shot the ending.

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","2","14 June 2002"," One of the best of recent slew of teenage-death flicks.
","I enjoyed the low budget `Final Destination' and I can't particularly say why. Perhaps it's the plot which is reasonably entertaining  no masked killer this time, but instead Death itself. Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and his classmates are on a trip. As they board the plane Browning has a vision that they must get off the plane, that there's about to be an accident. Between his yelling, and a fight between two others, a number leave the plane. And lo and behold the plane crashes. But it doesn't end there  the survivors were never meant to survive, and Death plans to get those promised to Him<br/><br/>The cast of `Final Destination' are recognizable teenagers from TV series and a few movies. Their acting skills aren't up to much (can you ever see Kerr Smith clutching an Oscar?), but they get the job done albeit their performances are somewhat hammy and weak at times. It doesn't matter because you know most of them are film fodder, sacrificed to the gore machine.<br/><br/>It's the innovative deaths and plot resolving that made `Final Destination' stand out for me. For starters the deaths are completely over-the-top and yet this is okay, considering the ethereal nature of the force they're up against. Indeed the sheer over blown nature of it allows for chuckles and gasps at the ferocity of them  it's not that they're particularly gory, but more that they can be so imaginative.<br/><br/>There's a sense of enthusiasm about this movie, not only in Morgan's fun script, but in James `X-Files' Wong's direction which is able to actually create some tension, excitement and scares  something which is to be commended in these days of formulaic horror.<br/><br/>There's nothing fascinating about `Final Destination' and certainly it won't win any awards. Despite all this I very much enjoyed this movie, and am sufficiently impressed to go out of my way to see the forthcoming sequel. Worth catching. 6.9/10."

","When i first saw Final Destination, i jumped out of my skin. I was expecting it to be one of those dumb cheesy stalk and slash films that were spewing out of the US at an unimaginable rate.<br/><br/>It begins with Alex, a teen heading off to Paris for a school trip. On the Plane, he has a dream the plane is going to explode (very realistic and very heart-stopping). He makes a fuss and he and seven others are forced off the plane. In the Departure lounge,an arguement begins between Alex and Carter. Then, the plane explodes. Coincidence???<br/><br/>Soon, the survivors find themselves being hunted down- they are all dying in accidents...or are they?<br/><br/>This is an ingenious film. The idea of being stalked by death is one that i dont think i have come across before. The hip young cast added style to it.<br/><br/>
The special effects are very good. The plane crash is very believable, and there are some very gory moments (i.e. Mrs. Luton , a pc and a kitchen knife).<br/><br/>There are genuine tense moments. And there are shocks galore.<br/><br/>With the promise of Final Destination 2, i feel that this wont be as good. Final destination is really a one off film- the sequal will have a very similar plot- and is really cashing in on the success of the Final Destination. <br/><br/>So, Final Destination is a very good horror movie that doesnt contain all the cliches of many other horror movies. <br/><br/>Ideal for a saturday night with popcorn, a good drink and the curtains closed.

That's exactly what I was thinking when I walked out of the cinema. Death can come for me today, tonight, tomorrow or wait until I get married and have ten children. But I will get to my Final Destination, like a train that leaves the platform, like the sun at dawn, or the wave that dies on the beach. The film emphasizes the concept that there is no escape from death. That death is probably the only certainty of life. The idea of the film is excellent. The effort is admirable. But the final product is mediocre, mainly due to the very poor acting of the young protagonists.<br/><br/>A plane crash. There are no survivors, except for six students that walk off the plane just before the ill-fated aircraft takes off. They escape death and now death is coming back for them. The film is all about escaping your own destiny, by tracing a new path of life, different from the one that death has planned for you.<br/><br/>After the plane disaster each of the six young protagonists begins to die in the most absurd and unlikely ways. Alex, the main character, foresees everyone's death and tries to prevent it from happening. Will he be able to fight against his own destiny? Maybe. What is sure is that he is certainly able to have us scared for weeks.<br/><br/>Since last night I have seen 'signs' that hint my death at every corner. Not that I had ever forgotten that sooner or later I'd die, but now that's the only thing I can think of! The creativity, the tension, the originality of the film make it an interesting film to watch. The acting is so poor that sometimes you just want to walk out of the cinema. The script and direction are very good at times and ridiculous towards the end. Go and watch it, but please don't think too much about it, there are things that we should all forget about..."

Now the movie takes off into the bizzare as we find that you cannot cheat death, and apparently death will kill you only in bizzare ways.  The movie now becomes unitentionally laughable as death slowly stalks each victim before offing them.  You don't ever see death, you only get a hint right before you die.  Death even goes as far as to cover his tracks after each person dies, which makes you wonder why?

With some hilarious death scenes and general overall creepy tone, Final Destination could have been the next Scream (which every horror film released since 1996 has been so desperately trying to be).  However, Final Destination does not have the same tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that Scream had.  The film takes itself way too seriously when it just should have had more fun with its good ideas.  Instead the audience is forced to listen to a ludicrous dialogue.  With that said, the film is actually a blast if expectations are held low.  The death scenes are extremely graphic and were usually unexpected.  If it weren't for the bus killing and the beheading, Final Destination would just be another House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend, etc., etc., etc."

A French student's clairvoyant dream saves 6 other would-be pieces of fried chicken from a plane explosion that they witness from the terminal.  Thirty-nine days after the thirty-nine schoolchums die (including the professor that not too many seem broken up about), Death wants a little payback...in spades.  Our hero and his doomed friends try to figure out Death's ""design"" (killing each off in the order they would have died) and try to save each other from their fates while avoiding the FBI who want answers.<br/><br/>Okay, decent semi-Hitchcockian (note one of the characters named Hitchcock) opening and a decent plotline, What went wrong, right?<br/><br/>A few things, actually.  Firstly, there was no real love relationship at all.  This was an extremely subtle part hinted at but more or less was tacked on at the end.<br/><br/>Secondly, there is the ending itself.  How terrible was this?  It felt as if the testing audiences didn't like the original ending so some new situation was written and alternate footage shot at the last minute. Even so, did they think this ridiculousness gave closure? Not to spoil the ending but ask yourself this question, would you fly on a plane six months after you've had the forementioned ordeal?<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.  Leave this film 20 minutes before it ends and imagine your own version of an ending.  I'll bet you my $8 movie ticket that your idea far excelled the way it actually concludes.  Sad, isn't it?"

Why did the main character have that vision that the plane was going down, who the hell was Tony Todd supposed to be? Also add in some of the most overdone death scenes on the screen, the best one where someone dies after undergoing like a comedic experience of misfortune, such as having a knife in her chest, and then having a chair tip over and then hit the knife deeper into her chest, i was laughing out loud at that part. And if death can leak pipes and crack mugs, why the hell doesn't he just cave the damn house in on someone, or something that doesnt need to be so damn elaborate? Lets also mention how there was some of the worst dialogue ever and some of the most unrealistic sequences and people ever placed in a movie.

Originally, ""Death"" was inhabiting the body of ""someone"" and was killing off the survivors of Flight 180 in the order they would have died on the plane crash (which is similar to the film), and the survivors were trying to figure out who the killer was before they died.

""FINAL DESTINATION"" was a poorly written film and an uninteresting movie...I haven't heard such poor dialogue since the last Akiva Goldsman movie...Yeah...you've gotta give it credit for a few shocks and squeamish moments...I mean...any film that that can somehow top Samuel L. Jackson's death scene in ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" has a tiny bit of merit, but the only thing I could think about through the entire film was how much pancake makeup Devon Sawa had on to cover up his acne.

Most of the deaths were carried out by Death himself in this movie, so thats why the surprising body counts tend to look more like ""accidents"", and the way they were presented was original. Most of the bodycounts happen in an unexpected manner and you never know when to hold your breath or to let go, cause things just keep happening (referring to the scene where the dude gets stuck in his car and Alex runs over to save him, after that, its full of surprises).

Having seen this and many other films with my teenage children, I can say that once you figure out where the movie is going (not too hard) you can sit back and enjoy the visuals and the reasonably passable acting and 'go with the flow.' My only wish was that they had these kinds of special effects when I was a teenager."

Donella (Tod Waggner), Amanda Detmer (Terry Chaney), and Tony Todd (Daniel Bludworth)<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of **** (3 out of 4 stars)<br/><br/>Synopsis: His entire high school class is going to Paris, but Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa) can't seem to shake his fear of flying. Once aboard the plane, he has a violently disruptive premonition which gets him, five of his classmates including Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) and Carter Horton (played by Kerr Smith), and a teacher (played by Kristin Cloke) kicked off the plane. As the students watch the plane depart, they witness the horrifying disaster that proves the deadly premonition true. Now having dodged death once, the terror begins as Fate hunts them down one-by-one. Soon the survivors will discover that you can't cheat death and get away with it...<br/><br/>My Review: FINAL DESTINATION is the kind of movie that is so unbelievably suspenseful and intense, that it's hard NOT to shake in your seat. This type of premise for a movie has never been done before, making it officially original. <br/><br/>The death scenes are very clever because they show the audience that there are so many ways that the characters could die in their current situation(s), and that is a very big plus. The acting is very good. As the protagonists, Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, and Kerr Smith all play their roles very honestly and naturally. As the detectives, Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith are very stern and realistic, while at the same time being subtly funny. As the supporting characters, Kristin Cloke, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, and Amanda Detmer all turn in excellent performances. Tony 'The Candyman' Todd makes a surprising cameo as a sinister mortician, whom I believe to be the Grim Reaper in human form. Although his character seems under-written and useless at first, he is actually very important to the story, which you would know if you have seem the movie. All of the characters bring something unique to the film. In fact, there are no weak links in this cast.<br/><br/>Being a horror movie, it is inevitable that there will be some 'jump scares'. But, the scares for this movie are different because they are unexpected. Usually, you would have creepy yet obvious music playing as the killer jumps out at the heroine, but not in this movie. The composer (Shirley Walker) was very wise not to score the jump scenes, although her score for the rest of the movie is a masterpiece all on its own.<br/><br/>
Director James Wong, as well as the cast and the rest of the productive/creative staff have all done a great job in creating a strong, stylish, and surprisingly intelligent horror thriller that is guaranteed to increase the speed of your heartbeat. You won't look at life (or airplanes) the same way again!"

","I have already reviewed this film once. It was absolutely full of praise and I couldn't get enough of it. That was in April I think. Well, Final Destination to me is still the best film in the world, and in my opinion it always will be, it's just that I'm not obsessed with it anymore. I bought the video two days after renting it, then watched it every day for about two weeks. Now it's December, and almost a year since I fist saw it (I saw it on Jan 13th 2001)and I'm not really bothered about it now. Yeah, it's ace.

I've written masses of pages of stories about the characters which if you're interested you'll find at http://www.fanfiction.net.

But I'll just say this- Final Destination rocks, and is BETTER than the Matrix."
"Arthur Dent","Null","0","2","30 November 2001"," Very thought-provoking, if you don't just look at it
","I won't say anything about the content of Final Destination, for there are enough comments that do. I just want to make out why there's much more behind this then a standard horror movie.<br/><br/>Final Destination is not just another teen scream movie about a raving madman with a knife, mainly for the fact that there is no raving madman with a knife, but also because you actually have to think about it.<br/><br/>First of all, and in contrary to other slayer movies, it makes the viewer think a lot about death, especially one's own. When you watch a movie with a masked guy running around killing people for no reason, you can't really imagine this thing happening to you. But in Final Destination, there're just some sorts of ""accidents"" and it's Death itself who does the killing. Whether you imagine Death as a thinking being or merely as a... well, an event that happens doesn't matter. Fact is that everyone finally must die, and it could happen nearly anytime. That's not a very pleasant thought, so we don't often think about this, but while watching Final Destination with an open mind, you can't help getting thoughts coming to you about your own death. I admit that the ""accidents"" in the movie get more and more constructed and unrealistic (that's for the thrill of the movie, and it works very well), but in principle, some sort of less complicated but nevertheless lethal accidents could happen anytime to oneself. An average horror movie just frightens you, it doesn't leave you with disturbing thoughts for a long time. That's the one special point.<br/><br/>The other point is this idea of ""cheating death"". Alex, the main character, develops this thought about Death's plan to kill them, and to destroy this plan by rescuing his friends from dangerous situations. So, Death (or Destiny or whatever) plans your death, but you can escape from this fate. But in the end, Alex's girlfriend Clear makes a statement that could turn this whole belief around: Perhaps the plan was that everything should happen just like it did, and Alex never cheated Death. That would mean all the nearly-accidents he prevented weren't meant to be deadly, but to be just what they were. In real life, there are often situations when one thinks: ""That could have happened another way if I only had..."" or ""Glad that I did this, otherwise..."" But is there really this ""otherwise""? Or is there no other way everything could have happened? In other words: Is your life destined? Can you change anything that will happen in the future? For the fact that everyone must die, even if you could ""cheat Death"", you couldn't do this forever. So, is there a point at all about asking whether you can ""cheat Death""?<br/><br/>If you just spend a little time not only watching the movie but thinking about all this, you can get to some very interesting and very disturbing thoughts about destiny, determinism, fate and ""What would have been if..."".<br/><br/>Therefore, if you have already spent some time thinking about these themes, this movie will give you more to think about, and if you don't have, it will too."

","Alongside ""House on Haunted Hill"", this is one of the better follow-ups in the line of 'new' teen slasher horror flicks (starting from, of course, ""Scream""). What could I say? The acting is, in slasher terms, fine; especially the hero (Alex, played by Devon Sawa) gives a touching performance. Directing is good, but towards the end a bit too hectic - with a little less rushing the director might of had juiced up a bit more ""horror"". Then on the other side, at least it's never boring.<br/><br/>BTW, as the original ending has more balls (see it on DVD), the re-shot, ""2nd"", ending is propably the best 'recovery' I've ever seen!

"vasco_cid","Null","0","1","2 November 2001"," Loner Scream.
","Loner Scream, you may be asking whyÂ…. The meaning of this headline is maybe confuse but totally wrapped in sense, I mean since the fantastic Scream came out, we have been completely banged by some lame movies in the same line, trying to be as great or greater that Scream ever was, Urban Legend is an example. But this Final Destination despite of being a movie with the same lines as Scream, teenagers getting killed one by one, gallons of blood spilt and as much gore as Van Damme's bad acting. Alex Browning is a teenager going on a trip to France with his school. As soon as he gets in the plane, Alex over seas the plane exploding, killing every passenger aboard. Alex warns everybody but only him, five friends of his and a teacher get out. Everyone gets mad at Alex as they see the plane taking of without them aboard, while all of the sudden the plane explodes in front of their eyes just like Alex dreamt it would. They've cheated death, but death won't let them cheat it again, so they start dying one by one through a pattern that Alex later discovers. We may criticize horror movies for being always so much alike, but that's the way they are, it's a competition everyone of them is trying to be better that the other ones. The difference that this movie states it's it's own killer, it's not a Ghostface, nor a mad man behind a mask, is the death itself, it isn't a highly developed CGI creature, every time death was coming all you saw was wind or shadows. As to be predicted in the center of the story is almost the most intelligent being in the face of the Earth who always has an answer for everything, has always a plan in his head and bla, bla, bla, we all know that and is not a shock for anyone. What makes this movie a loner is that it is not as predictable as the other thousands, making it a loner however it is still Scream. Acting is averaged Devon Dawa wasn't the right choice while Ali Larter was (let's forget that this beautiful girl ever got into one of the worst movies ever made: The House On Haunted Hill). One of the deaths is gracious is completely unexpected and violent and also so great as the very last one in the movie. The question was left to be answered: Did they really cheated it, or was it just a matter of time?"

","There's not a whole lot you can say about a film like Final Destination without giving too much away.  So this'll be short and sweet: Watch the movie.  That's all I really need to say, but since I usually say more than I need to, there's more.<br/><br/>This movie crushes all other Teen Horror movies made in the past five years. It's refreshing to have a palatable sense of terror and urgency in the horror genre.  Instead of some guy in a fisherman's coat or spooky mask, they're running from Death.  You don't get a much more unconquerable foe than that.  And they didn't go through a whole lot of cheesy special effects to show you a Grim Reaper or Spectre of Death.  Just a change in the wind, a shadow in the background, a shimmer in the mood.  The filmmakers chose to heighten the tension by not showing the audience much, but leaving it up to their imagination to fill in the gaps.  And we all know the human imagination is the scariest thing out there.  Much more scary than a bladed glove or Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Film-wise, it's pretty strong.  The acting ranges from ""as expected"" to ""surprisingly good,"" and the story gives enough plot turns to keep you in a state of confused disbelief.  The cinematography is refreshingly original, and is stylish without reeking of pretense.  The point of view shots disorient and clarify simultaneously, and the camera movement is quite slow compared to other contemporary horror films.  The absence of quick cuts and fast-moving camera sweeps is partly why this film is a treat to watch: all the benefits of modern technology without the migrane-inducing MTV style that seems so popular nowadays.  And before people start saying that old people can't understand the fast-paced world that young people live in, let me just say that I'm in my early twenties and I understand exactly the kind of fast-paced world that young people are living in.  I just don't like flash without urgency, which is MTV.  Final Destination is urgency without flash, and that's refreshing.<br/><br/>I'm recommending this film to anyone who likes good Horror movies, and to those people who like bad Horror movies.  Perhaps it'll slap the latter group upside the head.  (7/10)"

","Interesting concept for a teen slasher flick (finally, everyone knows what's after them but they STILL can't do anything about it), and the acting was great, but there's only so much that can be done with a horrible script. The plot holes are big enough to drive that bus through (now THAT was a nice shock).  The dialogue, especially the responses of the characters, is just so unrealistic that the movie becomes laughable.  The death scenes are done very nicely at first, especially the real crash, and then they spiral down into absurdity.

","Maybe that's a tad bit harsh, (they were all good) but it seems to me that every horror flick that has surfaced since then has been labled a Scream clone or at least been compared to it.  While in some cases, they are clones (some are very generic) some are very good (most usually direct-to-video titles) but with Final Destination, I was completely blown away.  This one went down as a classic, in my book, and Ive seen it close to ten times in the last year.  It's a very fresh and inventive take on horror and a welcome change from the whole ""slasher with a motive"" formula, which is tried and true, but also tired and true.  Although, I love slasher flicks with a passion, and I can never get sick of 'em, this doesn't really count.  Let me explain (just a bit) on what seperates this film from the rest of the pack and why someone who usually doesn't enjoy slasher flicks might find something to like here.<br/><br/>First off, I'm really glad to see a horror flick that takes itself seriously and doesn't committ horror film-suicide by cracking in-jokes and making fun of itself.  In some cases that works really well, but it's growing very tiresome lately (Urban Legends 2, anyone?) and I'm glad they left it alone here.  The film focuses on our deepest, darkest fear (death) and it certainly doesn't make light of it.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* (minor) A group of high school kids are about to take a trip to France.  Once boarding the plain, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a dream of the plain crashing on take-off.  He totally goes ballistic, getting himself, five other students, and a teacher booted off the plain.  The plain takes off and sure enough, it explodes.  So what we have here is seven people who just cheated death and (you guessed it) death is none too happy about it, (even Death doesn't like being duped)so he goes about taking the last seven down (in slasher fashion) one by one and it's up to (guess who?) Alex to try and save the day.  (Or something like that.)<br/><br/>It's made clear from the get-go that death doesn't like to screw around. He means business.  Another cool thing is that you can't see death (it's not just some guy in a cloak).  You can feel the preasence.  It's also nice that this isn't the ""whodunnit?"" formula.  We know damn well who it is and he is virtually unstoppable.  So we have seven people here, death lurking around the corner and Alex at the center of it all doing his best to stop it. What follows is some of the most inventive and ellaborate, most well thought out death sequences I have ever seen, period.  I won't go into any detail here but I can tell you this much; I was scared s#!tless.<br/><br/>
The cast is pretty good here.  Devon Sawa (Idle Hands) is awesome here. He does his job extremely well, giving a very layered, textured, heart felt performance.  He's gonna make it huge pretty soon and he deserves it. Kerr Smith (Carter) does a better job here than he did in the more recent (The Forsaken).  His character is totally unlikeable and I was really looking forward to his demise.  He's the rich jock-boy with an attitude that we all went to high school.  He's always angry and impossible to reason with. Kristen Cloke was really good as Miss Newton.  She plays a teacher who seems to have lived a very sad life.  She plays the part beutifully and looks beautiful.<br/><br/>This movie is very well done and those concerned that the horror genre may be dying, need not fear.  As long as films like this are being made, it'll be around for a long time.  I hear that there's a sequel in the works but I'm not too sure that it needed a sequel."

","I stumbled upon this movie recently when nothing else was on.  Being an Ali Larter fan, I decided to try it out.  It was amazing!!  With such a young cast, I was worried about it becoming another teen slasher film, which it most certainly was not.  What I liked best was the pace - not a second was wasted, from the film's first ten minutes until the shocking conclusion (just when you thought you were safe...)<br/><br/>
  In fact, I appreciated the fact that - just when you thought you had been cheated - the ending comes about and turns your expectations upside down. Thrilling cutaway shots throughout lead to suspense by hanging clues in front of us.  And just when you think you've got it figured out, something else entirely happens... or does it?

I loved the way they made it where you wonder who's going die next and how they're going die. The deaths in the film were very unique and each one could really happen. There's no crazed killer on the loose killing off people one by one in this film, no these deaths could happen to anybody.<br/><br/>Even though this film was supposed to be about Death coming back at the teens who cheated him, you never actually get to see Death. In the origional script, it featured an actual Grim Reaper figure slicing and dicing his way through a teen cast, but they chose not to do it, thinking that way it wouldn't be compared to teen slashers like 'Scream.' <br/><br/>I'm glad they did that because it was a lot better then when you got to see Death in 'The Frighteners.' Don't get me wrong, he looked pretty cool in 'Frighteners' it's just a movie's much scarier if you can't see what's there. It was nice to finally see a teen movie that had no sex involved in it at all. That's a rarity. <br/><br/>It was also nice to see Tony Todd in a movie not as Candyman. He did a pretty good job playing the creepy mortician. There was a little gore in some parts of the film and nicely done special effects in some parts. I'm glad they didn't overdue it with the special effects like other horror films that I would like to remain nameless (The Haunting). <br/><br/>The acting was good and the film itself was pretty suspenseful. There were some parts that were meant to give the audience a quick jump in their seats and was proven successful. Not in my case though. This movie makes you think that maybe Death does have a plan for all of us and we can't escape it. Makes me wonder how I'm going die. <br/><br/>Well anyway, the ending was a lot better than I expected. There are actually two endings for the film. The first ending was screened to an audience before the release, but the filmmakers decided that the ending wasn't good enough. So, they went back and shot a different ending.<br/><br/>

","Final Destination is just one of those movies that in my opinion stands out completely from any other. It's a horror film, yeah, point taken, but it's just so different from all the others like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Halloween etc.<br/><br/>You don't actually 'see' 'death' and I think that makes it really special. It makes you think about things, such as fate, and actually freaks you out a lot, as the whole scenario seems quite logical, unlike most other horror movies. It is original, chilling, and extremely entertaining. It doesn't over do it with the special effects either, and this shows that James Wong and Glen Morgan actually put a lot of thought into how to make things look as realistic as possible.<br/><br/>The acting in Final Destination is fantastic. The first time I saw this movie I was left thinking what a great actor Devon Sawa is. You could completely empathise with his character, Alex Browning. In fact, all the actors were brilliant. They could really convince you that what was happening to the characters was real, and that was really spooky. The movie has a great ensemble cast, some of which will be instantly recognised from other popular TV shows or films, such as Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) Brendan Fehr (Roswell) and Seann. W. Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Dude Where's My Car)<br/><br/>Final Destination is full of action, and the first fifteen minutes really do get you hooked. It's not like most other movies where it gradually builds up to the action, this movie just has short sharp adrenaline pumping blasts of it, and it's great. There are some excellent 'jump' scenes aswell, which immediately re-grab your attention so your mind never wanders.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have much of a soundtrack, but to be quite honest it doesn't really need it. The atmosphere is pulled off fantastically by the eerie musical score composed by Shirley Walker, and totally fits in with the scenes.<br/><br/>Some people might say that Final Destination is just over-rated and ridiculous, but I disagree. It is because it goes just far enough to make you believe, and disbelieve it at the same time. The deaths could actually happen in the home or whatever, but for them to happen is a chance in a million. Yet, they could still happen.<br/><br/>Okay, Final Destination isn't one of the most famous box-office smash hits in the world like the Matrix or Gladiator, but I don't really care. As far as I'm concerned this movie is just an unsung hero, and people who rate this movie as being 'awful' just don't know how to appreciate a masterpiece. After all, who needs Oscars when this film is as good as I think it is already?"

","Final Destination was a very unique film, in that it was a teen horror flick, and it was good!  There is actual suspense and creepiness throughout the film, whereas in Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, they were trying too hard to add it in.  Plus what's scarier than a villain you can't see?  Everyone I know who has seen this film loved it, including me, and I despise most horror flicks.  It's not so much that this movie is an incredible movie on its own, but I think its popularity comes from it being a great horror film in a land of cheesy horror.

"NetDog","Null","0","2","18 February 2001"," That rare thing: A horror film that does its job
","I have spent my life trying to find a film that truly scares me and leaves an imprint on my mind. Back in the 1980s, when I was a teenager, ""The Evil Dead"" was said to be the one. It made me jump a lot, but didn't really scare me.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of the so-called ""Video Nasties"" banned under the Video Recordings Act of 1984, including the most notorious ones. ""Last House..."", ""I Spit..."" and the supposed nastiest of all, ""Cannibal Holocaust"", are all perhaps disturbing in a way but still not really scary. With the BBFC seeming ever more keen to cut gore and shock from any UK video release, I gave up my quest for a long while. I remained to be scared.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" and ""Sixth Sense"" recently left an imprint when I recently decided to re-embark on my quest, but ""Final Destination"" is the closest I've come yet to my personal holy grail.<br/><br/>The film didn't really scare me but it certainly served to shock. I'm not sure if it's the BBFC's new, more relaxed code at work but I was surprised at some of the graphic scenes. Pleasantly surprised that is that they don't see fit to dictate what we can and can't see to us so much and have stopped trying to nanny us. Some of the scenes in ""Final Destination"" were easily as strong, if not stronger than some scenes from the old ""Video Nasties"", and this in a film with a ""15"" certificate. I can't wait to see some ""18"" releases under the new regime.<br/><br/>The overall impression that I got from this film was one of originality. The story was intelligent, the unpleasant scenes realistic, in that they concerned fates that could befall any of us. Hollywood has tried to scare us before with the ""slasher"" genre, which doesn't work for me, especially when a lot of the more ""colourful"" action is off-camera, supposedly to scare us more by letting our imagination do the work. No, that's a cop out. What I want is full-on, sudden, shocking gore of the kind spattered around ""Final Destination"", coupled with a storyline that doesn't require too much suspension of disbelief and an intelligent plot.<br/><br/>If ""Final Destination"" is a bandwagon, I hope other film-makers jump on it, not to try to copy it, but to realise that there is an intelligent audience out here, hungry for a fright and waiting to be scared.<br/><br/>
There's the guantlet, now pick it up. Scare us, please!"

","I rented Final Destination because I had read a couple good reviews when it came out; however, I didn't expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The film actually had a plot and a scary one at that.  Alex is a typical high school senior going on a class trip to Paris, when he dozes off and dreams of the plane's explosion.  He freaks out and he and five other passengers are kicked off the plane, only to soon watch it explode.  From then on the movie is suspenseful and eerie.  I enjoyed it because of the atmosphere and its unpretentious stance, not trying to be too deep, but still conveying a sense of constant foreboding and a little insight on the nature of death etc.  It lacked the excessive gore and maniacal villians usually present in teen horror films.  Devon Sawa was convincing as Alex, looking effectively frightened and desperate.  Ali Larter (I think that's her name) is bland as the semi-believer, neglected daughter, slash love interest.  The guy from Dawson's Creek is cast as the typical jock and is really bad.  He's cocky, stupid, mean, and has some unexplainable hatred towards Alex.  Despite these faults, Final Destination is creepy, creative, and suspenseful.  I highly recommend this horror film for a good scare and its intelligent plot."
"JBoze313","Null","0","2","18 December 2000"," Very original, dialogue somewhat lacking....
","This is a really good movie.  It's entertaining, and for the first half hour, it goes straight horror....no scenes that are supposed to scare you, but instead make you laugh.  The overall premise is really original, like I said...I won't go into the story, because so many others have already gone over it.  Anyhow, the acting was good...I didn't care much for the female lead...she was fake if you ask me.  She completely overacted.  I don't know a lot about acting, not being one myself, but it just seemed laughable. Maybe I'm the only one who thought so, but I did.  The story is a nice idea, but the bulk of the script is lacking.  There is a scene every so often that you get into, and then you're back into a scene that just seems ridiculous, even if to a minimal degree.  The production values are high, and I think the overall look of the film is great, it all goes to add to the story, and it sets the mood perfectly.  Some scenes are very graphic, so they may turn some people off...not me tho...I couldn't help but laugh when the bitchy girl bit the dust.  That was the funniest movie in the moment, and I think some people at the drive in we were at were probably frightened of me...but oh well.  It's a good movie that I would recommend, but like I said...it's lacking..could have been better.  No movie is perfect tho.  I'll add one more thing as well--if you like this movie, buy it on DVD, it has three commentary tracks (director, producer, etc;  actors;  and an isolated track for the score (music) and the composer talks about the pieces and how they work to set the tone of the film.  There are a few documentaries, plus some other stuff..probably the best DVD of the 30 I have."

Although that may not be exactly correct, I still enjoyed myself during this intelligent and fierce thriller.<br/><br/>Death has a plan and Alex (Devon Sawa) has ruined it. After having a premonition the flight he and his school group are about to take will explode in mid air, he tries to warn everyone. Of course no one believes him and with a handful of classmates, he is thrown off the plane before it takes off. When the plane bursts apart just after take off, Alex realises he has cheated death  and now it's time for payback. One by one, the survivors begin to die in horrific, mysterious circumstances. Now that Alex has figured Death's plan, can he do anything to alter the destiny that awaits him?<br/><br/>Final Destination isn't a bad film. In fact, its pretty darn good. The performances are impressive, Devon Sawa possibly gave his best performance, while Dawsons Creek actor Kerr Smith gives a smartly evil role as Carter. Also Ali Larter, Chad Donella and Sean William Scott are very good performers for this horror flick. The script is very original, writer Glen Morgan deserves praise for his abilities on the keyboard. I love the deaths, they are very creative, and the direction is full of effort.<br/><br/>Although slightly sometimes Final Destination can be slightly overrated, I highly recommend it for an audience who want to have a scarily funny good time.<br/><br/>I rate Final Destination 7 out of 10."

"jonny-4","8","0","2","14 November 2000"," Top-notch teen date thriller entertainment
","Great fun teen horror thriller with an unknown cast and a very original twist on the slasher movie genre. A party of US smalltown high school kids are setting off for a trip to France when Alex (Devon Sawa) has a sudden, fearful premonition that their aircraft is about to explode on take-off (be warned, nervous fliers, this is probably the most chilling crash sequence since Alive). He flees the plane and in the panic five of his schoolmates and a teacher go with him. And sure enough, minutes later, the airline is blown to smithereens. So far so exciting, but if this is a slasher movie, where is the killer? Well, we're getting to that. As they try to rebuild their stricken hometown after the horror of the accident, the surviving kids start dying off and Alex soon realises that, having cheated Death once, destiny is trying to catch up on its homework. In a a sense, Death itself is the killer.<br/><br/>And for another twist, Alex works out that the victims are dying in the same order that they would have been killed had they remained in their seats on the airliner. And so, by the logic of rather silly paranormal movie lore, he leaps to the conclusion that by breaking the pattern of mystery killings, he can escape his otherwise certain doom. All this nonesense is delivered with frenetic pace and no small amount of directorial wit from former X-Files back-room-boy James Wong. Although it's not original in its use of pressure-cooker suspense (the train speeding towards the car stuck on the level crossing, the loose mains power cable whipping in the wind as teen X struggles to escape electrocution just millimetres away) but to his credit, Wong never ends these scenes quite the way you expect. Final Destination is delicious date movie entertainment; compares favourably with such comical teen thrillers as Scream and The Faculty and boasts a glorious surprise ending which will leave you with a wickedly satisfied smile on your face."

This film wasn't written for its literary genius, it was written to entertain its audience, and to give them a few thrills.<br/><br/>The opening scene on the airplane draws you in so fast, and it does not let you go until the end. And even at the end it doesn't quite let you go, because it leaves you thinking about it's interesting premise that deals with cheating death.  Yes, some of the death scenes were far fetched, but it's a movie.  Films are supposed to place you in another world. So I agree with the majority who gave Final Destination a good review.

"Jolie","Null","0","2","9 November 2000"," Ok, I can breathe again now.........
","What a film! I'll grant that the acting was mediocre and the plot questionable at times, but this film had an enormous impact. I was reminded of the Greek tragedies and their inexorable element of Fate. As Oedipus was fated to do the unthinkable, these young students were fated to die in a plane crash. But Fate did not account for the psychic impulses of Alex, nor their effect on Clear or his compatriots. <br/><br/>   I absolutely loved all of the conceptual elements of foreshadowing; the word ""Terminal"" flipping, the words ""Final Destination"" on the tag, the announcement of the ""Departure."" Even moments in the dialogue which mentioned having the rest of one's life ahead of them simply pointed the finger towards an unfortunate end. Notice the subject of Clear's book at the airport, with its photos of Diana in the car crash...or Miss L's record...or all of the instances where Alex feels the presence of death. This film is incredible when it comes to suspense. I was literally holding my breath as I watched. It took me a good half hour to calm down afterward. And sleep? Ha. I couldn't fall asleep for hours. Yet despite the film's masterful concept of Fate, we also see the determination of the human spirit to survive, as well as courage, devotion and the notion of self-sacrifice. The film's only setbacks are the moments of stupidity by the main characters. (e.g., Would you ever put a beverage on a computer monitor? Hello?) Otherwise, this film was incredibly powerful and causes the viewer to contemplate its ideas for hours afterward. Also, consider the fact that there is an alternate ending on the DVD version and see which one you prefer.......:)"

","I enjoyed this film a lot. Good premise, great opening, and some imaginative death scenes.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* I don't really want to go into the plot, but I have to mention the initial plane crash scene. It is so harrowing, and probably as realistic a depiction as you would ever want to see. You can feel the fear of the passengers, knowing you are going to die must be a terrible thing, and that is basically how the film progresses. The survivors know they are going to die and in what order, and so does the audience. Does this ruin the film? Not at all. Some of the ways the people are dispatched are pretty unbelievable, but then again, this is a film, and tumours or heart attacks wouldn't be particularly entertaining to watch. The second person to get it, being hit by a bus is fantastic. As the director says on the DVD commentary, you know it's going to happen, but it happens about 3 seconds before you expect it. So fast, and so shocking.<br/><br/>A great, entertaining film. Brain in neutral to a certain extent, but then again, that's why I watch films. To be entertained, not enlightened."

","This movie has a great concept, nice plot, moderate acting, but the idea of death choosing the most gruesome and ""coincidental"" death is... not understandable. It also doesn't leave many thought provoking questions hanging for you at the end.<br/><br/>Spoiler ahead:<br/><br/>A class takes a jet out to Paris, but one of the passengers, Alex, views what is going to happen before the jet takes off, and that is the jet will have a horrendous explosion. When he wakes up to find that he just viewed ""death's plan"" he warns the people what is going to happen. Only one other take him seriously, another follows him to beat him up, 3 others moderate the fight, and a final one just follows them for no reason. The 6 people view their jet exploding from the terminal.<br/><br/>Now, the basic concept is that you don't get away with ""cheating fate"" and the students now have their ""debt to pay"" so to say. Death carefully chooses each survivor according to at which point they would have died in the plane. A survivor named Tod is first. Now, death can do many things to kill a person. Tod is in his upstairs bathroom, and death loosens a toilet valve, leaving a slippery leak creeping up on Tod in the bathroom. After a few ""close calls"" with a shaver and a plug with a radio, Tod finally manages to slip on the floor, go into the bathtub with a coil strangling him to death.<br/><br/>Another very carefully ""planned"" death is where one of the teachers finds herself with a glass of vodka turning on the TV. A sharp object slices her throat, and a spark from the TV ignites the leaking vodka that was trailing from her mug on her way from the kitchen to the living room. She takes the sharp object out of her neck, and follows the trail of ignited vodka to the kitchen where she tries to get a rag on a rack of kitchen knives. The rack falls down, and one knife goes into her stomach. Alex goes into the house to save the day, but nearly dies when the house explodes from the gas in the stove.<br/><br/>Now, if death can control gas stoves, toilet valves, knives, vodka, and a coil of wire, why can't death just use the simplest way, and just push Tod out the window, and have the teacher just drown herself in the kitchen sink, or something else?<br/><br/>That is the only flaw I found in the movie. Of course, if death had chosen the ""easy way out"" it woudn't be a ""teen movie"".<br/><br/>The ending was completely spoiled, and unnesseccary. I like movies that ""leave me hanging with questions"". I don't mean just end without telling me the climax, but don't baby feed me the aftermath."

","FINAL DESTINATION was a very cool movie. It made you jump at the most expected and unexpected moments. If it deserves any Oscar nomination, it should go to James Wong for Best Director. He slowly shows you specific details that may or may not lead to a death, while keeping you guessing which one. Devon Sawa gives one of his best performances here, right up there with IDLE HANDS. Seeing it on DVD allowed me to see the deleted scenes, including the original ending. Commentary from the creators talking about the test screenings indicate there was a negative response to the much more deeper and disturbing original ending, so they went back and re-shot a much more funnier and more audience-pleasing ending. The airplane crash sequence was absolutely frightening, challenging anyone to fly again. Not even the people waiting at the gate are safe from a runway crash. I definitely recommend FINAL DESTINATION."

That you won't get a chance to tell your grandkids how you had to drive a whole ten feet to school in a broken down car with no air conditioning and they better thank their lucky stars that they didn't live in the late 1900's.<br/><br/>The acting was believable, although some of the characters' motivations seemed...odd.

They only have so much time to figure out the pattern that death has set before them and how to prevent the powers that be from deciding their ultimate fate.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't anything too involved and nothing you really had to think too hard about, and that's exactly what I was looking for. It presented an interesting idea of escaping the path that is set before us and taking control of the things that are often beyond our grasp, if but for a mere instant.<br/><br/>The entire movie looked and felt like an episode of ""The X-Files"" and that probably added to some of my enjoyment.

","Your opinion of ""Final Destination"" is all in how you take it. I took it as a movie with an interesting premise that was carried through in a fun way all the way to the end. While waiting to board a plane for a class trip to Paris, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has an accurate premonition of disaster, and after a panic attack is thrown off the plane along with a few other passengers. Were they meant to die in the plane? Death thinks so and will stay on their tail until it knocks them off one by one. The thing you have to understand about this movie is that it is not meant to be deathly serious. The John Denver songs and the way each attack by death is more outrageous than the last is indication of that. I guess some people just didn't catch on to those clues. A serious tone to this material would not have worked and neither would a slow pace. That is why the movie is fun and fast paced as well it should be."

One by one, the survivors are killed off in bizarre coincidences and Alex figures out that there is a design as to how every person will die and he sees that they are killed in the order they would have been killed on the plane.  Alex sets about changing this and attempting to save his friends, but as it turns out, when death has finished going through the design, it starts over again . . .<br/><br/>I thought that this was one of the best horror movies ever made.  I believe this because it has an original, unique storyline as well as some very gruesome and unsavoury moments.

","Final Destination is a great movie that is destined to be a late night classic. The movie is very creepy and is generally solid throughout.<br/><br/>Basically, after the plane explosion in the beginning of the movie, there are a few weak points. Imagine the majority of your senior class dying in a plane explosion. Now, compare how you would feel with how the characters in the movie seemed to feel. It is not real enough. Final Destination strives to be a serious movie but nobody seems to care about the deaths that happen around them. However, Devon Sawa does do a pretty decent job showing just how messed up he becomes after the initial tragedy, especially in the scenes immediately following his return home with his parents from the airport. Aside from that, everyone in the movie just seems to dead inside. The only time all characters as a whole seem human is the brief moment when all of their parents pick them up from airport security.<br/><br/>There are a few moments that are pretty scary but they are mainly cliche moments that rely on the audio. There are no real shocker moments. Computer digitized backgrounds hint at an upcoming death scene. Also, it's too bad Tony Todd wasn't a more vital character instead of a disrespectful mortician.<br/><br/>The DVD version of the movie is great but the deleted scenes may cause you to realize that scenes that you initially liked will later seem like hasty last-minute efforts to save the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great movie for general horror fans and is done the way horror movies should be done to at least get some praise from the public. I give this movie 3/4 Stars since I appreciate an original horror movie in the endless caravan of good ideas but poor outcomes."

","Way down here in the corner of the world; New Zealand, this movie has just been released, so naturally as soon as I knew it was in theatres I had to see it.  The trailer didn't really do the film justice however the trailer was the one thing attracting me to see it in the first place. Although I saw the trailer while sitting in the cinema awaitng 'Scary Movie' final destination was one movie at the back of my mind labelled the next must watch. I myself cannot scare easily, well not in the sense of horror movies, I found the Exorcist boring and pathetic disregarding the fact its old and Scream original but more humorous than frightening.  Although I do like the parody. As I went into the cinema I thought this movie would be another slash/horror one, with 'death' in the shape of the grim reaper dressed in a black cape holding an axe, popping out of closets and ripping the cast in half, however the movie was nothing of the sort.  It wasn't scary except the plane scene which seemed convincingly real, but was extremely suspenseful which threw many questions at me while i was watching. 'Who was next?', 'How would s/he die?', etc, the fact that Alex had visions and took notice of hints that death gave him were extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>The cast were good with great acting.  I had never thought too much of Kerr Smith, mainly because of his character on Dawsons Creek but he is very talented (and gorgeous) and I don't think he will get enough credit for the talent he produced in this film.  Ali Larter was excellent as well, I remember her from Varsity Blues, typically one of my guy friends I went with to see this movie, recognised her from the whipped bikini scene. In most movies nowadays the writers tend to not use the lead actress enough but I found they used her sufficiently and at the end of the movie her having the same feelings Alex did was a great twist.  Devon Sawa as always was great as the lead, he proved that carrying a movie was not too tough.  Seann William Scott was one of my favourites from American Pie and Road trip but I feel they didn't use his character enough in the film.  The directing was great, I loved the way the camera panned around Alex whenever he felt death, that was one of the main suspense factors.<br/><br/>I don't think it was much of a teen movie as I had suspected, it was very adulty for say and been rated R down here meant many teens couldn't see it anyway, (without sneaking in of course).  The writing was excellent and very original, I think that the main problem for this film is that it was released at the tail end of the teen horror backlash.  Many may not see it because of this and like me may think it will be another one of 'those'. It is not.  A great flick and I might just have to go see it again, just for the ending which is one of the best endings I have ever seen (it made me laugh while whispering 'what') I give it a 9"

The story line and originality in its script is very clever, and suspense inducing. The music that correlates with each scene of horror and suspense is typical, yet very well orchestrated. True, the actors arent necessarily the best when it came to dialogue, but its a Clever horror movie, and not one intended to go to becuz of skilled acting, although the kids in the movie do a well job in their parts. Theres one useless scene where at first you think maybe 2 kids will get on each other in a coffin in one of those chessy horror movie sex scenes, but then They run into an incounter with the ""CANDY MAN"", which might have been worse, but luckily its short and brief.

But to be honest it must be said, that the first 20 minutes (the plane crash and it's following events)and 10 min somewhere in the middle (as it turns out that there was a ""plan"") only were the best. The rest of this movie neither had a good script nor can it claim any continuity those kind of movies usually own. But aside from that it was really scary and exciting. Go, see it and don't mind the little mistakes, they are really not worth  mentioning. 10."

","I really enjoy this movie, but I hate the end.  I think this movie will have a second part, maybe we are in the beginin of a sequel like Scream or I know what you did last summer.  The thing I dont understand from this movie is the black guy that speaks with the actors, i think that he will be important in a sequel.  Well if you like good movies, WATCH IT!!!"

","Final Destination is a very good movie which worths every cent. Well it actually has a lot of scenes that are out there like the one with the teacher and the knifes in her kitchen, but the whole movie is a very good directed one and the actors are nice. After all you are going to the movie to spend to hours having fun. Scary???? Yes in some scenes it gave me the creeps. Better than ""SCREAM"" and much much better than ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"". In the end this movie makes you think: Do we really can avoid death for ever? Should we even try to avoid it?. The grade I gave to this movie is 8."

","Yes, there are plenty of plot holes in this movie, yes it´s another teen slasher, yes the ending has to much special effects and no decent plot. But... Despite all this... The idea is excellent and not so badly developed as it looks, the usual ""teen-clichés"" never get over the  story just to fill screen time, there are no f@#%-up dudes slashing teens with knifes, the deaths are original although by the end they got totally predictable (this is a Hollywood teen flic after all), the movie sometimes can get very uncomfortable because it has a brilliant dark creepy atmosphere, and despite all the shallow action and plot dumbness FINAL DESTINATION, still can put people talking about its theme. Death and destiny. Because in the middle of all that sometimes Hollywood mess, this story still raises interesting questions. And creepy ones also, it was great to listen to the unconfortable silence people were making in the theater sometimes where some questions were being pointed out in the movie. SCREAM didn´t do that at all, because couldn´t care less about the plot, we just wanted to see the next babe getting slashed. So in my opinion FINAL DESTINATION, is the best teen-movie around, altohugh i think it´s unfair to classify it like that, because despite all the flaws this still is a more intelligent movie than all the rest. After all, if it hadn´t a teen cast, nobody would think to compare it, with all the teen movies around. In fact i would love to see a more ""mature"" version of  this with an all adult cast, altough it might got ruined if it had Big Hollywood names on it, because a great thing in this teen cast is that there are no Hollywood big stars in it. Just recognizable faces, and this gives much more credibility, to the story, if you let yourself get carried away by the atmosphere, and forget about the ""little things"" for a minute. Nobody was complaining in the SCREAM movies ,right ? So why attack FINAL DESTINATION, because of that ?<br/><br/>This is a very good comercial movie. The best teen movie in years. It has a good idea, good atmosphere, it can make you wonder about your own destiny, and it´s fun to watch. Ok, i know the ending sucks, but well...maybe next time.<br/><br/>Overall, i don´t think this movie is a bad one. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 and THE PATRIOT. Now here´s to awful and empty movies. But i don´t see many people complaining about those. Go watch FINAL DESTINATION instead. Good movie.<br/><br/>But after this i´ll never get near an airplane, or a car, or a computer, or a house, or a...my god we´re trapped ! We´re all gonna die !!! Brrrrrr :-)"

","This film is based on an interesting premise, but that's the best thing I can say about it.  The ""cheating death"" thing works quite well to begin with - the main character figures out how things will happen via subtle (to him) visual clues.  This feels quite credible to begin with.  However, we end up with characters cheating death by ""running away"" and other such pathetic ruses.<br/><br/>My girlfriend and I went to see this film to the give the teen-horror genre one last go at producing something decent, but we were disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't bother seeing it - the trailer makes this film look like something special but it just isn't."
"The Masticator","Null","0","1","20 June 2000"," Filmmaking by numbers - but entertaining
","No one is ever going to claim that ""Final Destination"" is great cinema but it does what it sets out to - and very effectively. Storyline goes: kid has premonition of crash on plane, kid and some others get off plane, plane crashes, kid realises they were supposed to be on the plane and die when death starts stalking them. That's about it. If you don't get it, the Candyman turns up about halfway through to explain it. Seriously.<br/><br/>The deaths we see are pretty funny too, as director James Wong alternates between the classic horror-movie drawn-out death scenes and sudden, shocking demises after which you're surprised to find you're not covered in blood. Wong clearly keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek at all times, while the cast, who presumably know this isn't meant to be ""serious"", play the whole thing with the kind of wide-eyed innocence and seriousness it needs. None of your ""Scream"" style Jamie Kennedy nods and winks to the camera here - all the skill, frankly, is off-camera. Although, to be fair, you couldn't call it inspired - there's nothing we haven't seen here before in Carpenter or early Craven.<br/><br/>The ""teen"" leads (none of them a day under 20, and Kerr Smith is knocking on 30) are adequate, although the vague romance between Ali Larter and Devon Sawa (who makes these names up?) is less than convincing. Hardly important, though. As Bill Friedkin said of ""The Exorcist"", you'll get out of it what you bring to it, and if you've suspended disbelief bigtime and gone along with the ride, the ending will be about the best 30 seconds of cinema you've seen all year."

I can highley recommend this film for one viewing only.<br/><br/>On the second viewing (a week later) things were not so good. I started seeing holes in the plot and small cracks appearing in the storyline that just didn't quite gel. Unlike Sixth Sense I found Final Destination most enjoyable on it's first viewing.

"moviefan-45","3","0","1","4 June 2000"," not up to the best, not even close
","I normally don't bother to write comments when the movie I watched was bad. In the case of Final Destination, I am writing this because people are comparing this movie to scream and other  great horror movies. This movie is predictable, gory and boring . The people that were surprised by it have very limited imaginations. Just because this movie is not as bad as ""I know What you did last summer"" and just a little bit different does not make it any better. It is a sad attempt at the horror of the  unseen that is pulled off much better by ""The Exorcist"" and others."
"kitkat1x","Null","0","2","3 June 2000"," Worst movie I have ever seen
","***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>This is the worst movie that I have ever seen.  The producers pulled the 'bait and switch' by duping me into seeing the movie with a brilliant trailer.  The first 15 minutes of this movie depicting the plane crash were absolutely fantastic.  Unfortunately, the movie crashes and burns (no pun intended) from that point on.  The similarities to Flight 800 were the epitome of distaste (depicting a high school class bound for Paris from New York).  It was similarly distasteful for the producers to use obvious crash footage from Flight 800.  The plot is totally unbelievable and dumb, dumb, dumb.  Devon Sawa's memorization of where all of the survivors were seated on the plane, in order to predict 'death's design', totally lacked credibility.  None of the survivors, except one, showed an ounce of gratitude towards Devon Sawa's character for essentially saving their lives. Instead, they were angry at him, which I found unbelievable.  You could drive a truck through the many gaping holes in the plot.  Kerr Smith's 'Carter' was belligerent for no discernible reason.  I suppose that the director wanted to thrill us with the intricate nature of the subsequent deaths of the survivors, but I found it annoying, predictable and incredibly contrived.  What was with those creepy FBI agents?  Why were they popping up everywhere?  Tony Todd's role in the movie is never explained. Is he a mere undertaker (who, by the way, is totally unperturbed by two teens breaking into the mortuary in the dead of night), or is he Death?  This is obviously left for the viewer to decide.  By the end of the ""film"", the director obviously ran out of bad ideas.   Hence, the abrupt ending.  I was so sick of Carter that I cheered when that sign whacked him (as if we couldn't figure out by now that something was going to happen).  Notably, the ending leaves unanswered whether the remaining survivors ultimately cheat death. Does this pave the way for ""Final Destination II?""  I hope not.  Resist any and all efforts to convince you to see this utter failure.  Do yourself a favor.  Stay home and rent ""Sixth Sense"" instead."
"brightwhitelight","2","0","1","3 June 2000"," Oh, dear...
","This was not a good film. That I am sure of. The alarm bells started to ring about 5 minutes into the film, with the ridiculous style of direction - trying to be all modern and cool and keep the pace going, but still missing something - making a massive point of emphasising all of the little 'signs' of what was to come - these are the sort of things any director who assumed even a little intelligence in their audience would make a lot more subtle.<br/><br/>After the intro, there were very few redeeming features. As I watched I continued to get bogged down in the really awful, long and drawn out deaths, which had me almost cringing in embarrassment, the laughable dialog and acting in places (Tony Todd's 'creepy' undertaker was unbelievably poor), and the sheer predictability of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>In summary? Don't bother - this is one of those awkward films - it's not good enough to be a fun film, and it's not bad enough to be a fun film. If you want to see a good horror film, get the Shining. (2/10)"
"Yazmon","4","0","1","22 May 2000"," Remember TWA 800?
","There are some very unfortunate parallels with this film and the TWA 800 disaster 3 years ago. Not only is the flight number quite similar, that plan was also destined for Paris. The other obvious coincidence is that the TWA flight also carried a group of students and teachers who as far as I am aware all died on board. I'm not sure where they got the television footage, but I hope it was not from that flight.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the film was obvious and unfortunately not very scary at all. The characters were not expended upon, and the things they said and did, didn't always make a lot on sense. (At least in keeping with the character.)<br/><br/>There were a lot of loose ends, like the bloke in the undertakers. (Was he death?)

","Oh I was pleased to say the least that those bozos in Hollywood who have milked every last cent from us and shown us nothing but obligatory booby-shirt shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt, finally created a film under the same genre that challenged us as the audience to think! Final Destination was such a relief because there has not been an impressive horror movie made in these latter years since Scream in 1996. The film had an intriguing idea that was a beautiful back-drop for throwing teeny-boppers in the mix and scare the hell out of an audience. The first half an hour of the film left our entire audience in shock, thirsty for more. It wasn't old hat like all these other films where we see the guy with the hook in the first reel and roll our eyes, trying not to glance at our watches in eagerness to leave. What made the antagonist in Final Destination so terrifying was that it could not be brought on to screen in a physical form. There was no mask, no butcher knife (well, maybe one), and no explanation or motive. It was all up to the viewer to envision 'Death' in any way they wanted to.<br/><br/>I fully recommend this movie to all. The story and direction is beautiful, and like I said before, the first half an hour is a sight to see. Besides some pretty cheesy dialogue and a few petty performances, Final Destination delivers the goods and invites you to come fly the deadly skies."

"Æthelred","4","0","1","16 April 2000"," Great beginning, then fizzles out
","[WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br/><br/>You shouldn't be reading this unless you've already seen the movie, so I won't rehearse the plot (both puns intended).  Here are my comments:<br/><br/>The plane-explosion scene is very scary.  It's frightening to think that people might actually experience something similar in a real mid-air disaster.  That's by far the film's highlight--it's very well done.<br/><br/>So here's why I gave ""Final Destination"" a 4.<br/><br/>The plot is shallow.  Death wants revenge against the survivors and goes around killing them.  Where's the suspense in that?<br/><br/>The plot contains senseless material.  Does Alex notice the effect of ""Rocky Mountain High"" or not?  It seems not, so playing that tune, along with such other clichés as causing candles to be extinguished, wind to blow, lightning to strike, etc., only serves to tell the audience that another killing is nigh.  Talk about lack of subtlety!<br/><br/>I agree with a previous comment that it was insensitive to draw so many parallels to the TWA flight 800 crash (high school group, New York-to-Paris flight).  I also think it's kind of racially insensitive to make Death a black guy.<br/><br/>But what I really resented is that, as far as I could tell, the movie bowdlerized its own plot and ruined its integrity by failing to resolve the story.  The two main characters are left alive, but with no guarantee that Death has completed his mission.  And this outcome, I believe, must have been a deliberate marketing gimmick (no screenwriter could be that inept). If ""Final Destination"" had done really well, a sequel could have been made to disclose the main characters' fates.<br/><br/>It's sad that Hollywood is willing to screw up its movies for commercial considerations, and how oblivious many people seem to be to devices like these.  I have no hope that Hollywood will improve, but what's wrong with the reviewers?  I am amazed at the positive reviews ""Final Destination"" has garnered in presumably discerning places like the New Yorker magazine. Maybe the reviewers have seen too many mediocre films and are critically comatose.  Or perhaps I'm too cynical and/or misunderstood the ending.  But if I didn't, it's a far cry from ""the kicker of an ending [that] leaves the audience with a perfect final scream,"" as the New Yorker capsule review said."

"bikeman-2","4","0","1","12 March 2000"," Teen slasher film without the slasher, see it on cable.
","The premise of the new James Wong film, Final Destination, is that Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane, thereby cheating fate. However, fate is not so easily bested, and Alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances. Essentially, this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher.   Unfortunately, this is practically the only clever thing about the film. As far as teen horror flicks go, Final Destination is better than many.  There is enough shocking death, graphic gore, and requisite black humor to provide the essential ""roller coaster"" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick.  Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre. The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death. The scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue I have witnessed.  If you are looking for a Saturday night thriller to scare your date, this film might do the trick. Other than that, wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable."
