"EngineerSahab","7","52","58","23 June 2018"," An Entertaining & Exciting Stuff! - Here is an actor who always (with some exceptions) delivers.
","Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series ""avatar"". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, ""Barry Seal never says no"" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, ""I am just a gringo who always delivers""."

","Very few directors have tapped the clown in Tom Cruise the way Doug Liman has. He had directed Tom in Edge of Tomorrow which was humorous and was set amidst a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.<br/><br/>I felt Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the pilot in an extremely light-hearted and funny way. Cruise is known for playing roles that ooze oodles of dare-devilry. But most of those roles are of fictitious characters. For once Tom plays a real man whose daring knew no bounds. Captain Barry Seal was like a real-life Ethan Hunt. Hence I feel casting Cruise as Seal was an extremely appropriate decision and should help in filling Universal Studios Entertainment's coffers.<br/><br/>If you were awed after seeing the aerial sequences in Dunkirk, wait until you have seen this film. The planes are subjected to go through some intense acrobatics which will please you. If you were disappointed with Cruise after watching The Mummy, I can assure you that you will heave a sigh of relief after watching this film. The film's story is not only engaging but also witty and hilarious. There are hardly any stagnant moments so the probability of you getting bored is very low.<br/><br/>A very ironic thing about American Made is that in 1986 when Barry Seal must have gone through whatever turmoil he did, a young Tom Cruise played a pilot in Top Gun which released that year. Did he know he would pay a real-life pilot who was very relevant during those days almost 31 years later ?<br/><br/>Watch American Made . Don't watch it for Tom Cruise's stardom. Watch it because you deserve to watch an entertaining and great film on the big screen that coincidentally has a superstar playing the leading man. I humbly apologize for the length of this post but sometimes I just can't control myself from pouring my thoughts out"
"rabbitmoon","6","33","40","3 December 2017"," Entertaining, but quickly fades
","American Made was a good watch - the story keeps a good steady momentum, the direction and editing are vibrant and dynamic. It has the vibes of something like Wolf of Wall St or a Guy Ritchie film, where despite the nature of the events you find yourself rooting for a criminal and laughing at the black comedy of how things unfold. <br/><br/>But it stays firmly in the mode of fast-paced 'zany' without ever really digging into emotions, desperation, or any human reflection. Barry Seal as a character remains a breezy, zany blur. Its just that kind of film. I think Cruise has a lot to do with that - his vanity as an actor, having to be seen as either confused- smiley or cool-intense in any given moment limits his courage to do anything else (Born on the Fourth of July was a real anomaly for him in terms of range). <br/><br/>Its as entertaining as any two episodes of Narcos - but without Narcos' complexity and variance. Good but not great, definitely worthy of a viewing."

","If you ask anyone to list the top 10 film actors, chance is that ""Tom Cruise"" would make many people's lists. He's in everything isn't he?  Well, actually, no. Looking at his IMDb history, he's only averaged just over a movie per year for several years. I guess he's just traditionally made a big impact with the films he's done. This all rather changed in the last year with his offerings of the rather lacklustre ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (FFF) and the pretty dreadful ""The Mummy"" (Ff) as one of this summer's big blockbuster disappointments. So Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was sorely in need of a upward turn and fortunately ""American Made"" delivers in spades.<br/><br/>""Based on a True Story"" this is a biopic on the life of Barry Seal, a hot shot 'maverick' (pun intended) TWA pilot who gets drawn into a bizarre but highly lucrative spiral of gun- and drug-running to and from Central America at the behest of a CIA operative Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson). All this is completely mystifying to Barry's wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) who is, at least not initially, allowed to be 'in' on the covert activities.<br/><br/>The film is a roller-coaster ride of unbelievable action from beginning to end. In the same manner as you might have thought ""that SURELY can't be true"" when watching Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"", this thought constantly flits through your mind. At each turn Seal can't believe his luck, and Cruise brilliantly portrays the wide-eyed astonishment required. This is a role made for him. <br/><br/>Also delivering his best performance in years is Domhnall Gleeson (""Ex Machina"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as the CIA man with the (whacky) plan. Large chunks of the film are powered by his manic grin.<br/><br/>As an actress, Sarah Wright is new to me but as well as being just stunningly photogenic she works with Cruise really well (despite being 20 years his junior - not wanting to be ageist, but this is the second Cruise film in a row I've pointed that out!)). Wright also gets my honorary award for the best airplane sex scene this decade!<br/><br/>Written by Gary Spinelli (this being only his second feature) the script is full of wit and panache and - while almost certainly (judging from wiki) stretches the truth as far as Seal's cash-storage facilities - never completely over-eggs the pudding. <br/><br/>Doug Liman (""Jason Bourne"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") directs brilliantly, giving space among the action for enough character development to make you invest in what happens to the players. The 80's setting is lovingly crafted with a garish colour-palette with well-chosen documentary video inserts of Carter, Reagan, Oliver Stone, George Bush and others. It also takes really chutzpah to direct a film that (unless I missed it) had neither a title nor any credits until the end. <br/><br/>The only vaguely negative view I had about this film is that it quietly glosses over the huge pain, death and suffering that the smuggled drugs will be causing to thousands of Americans under the covers. And this mildly guilty thought lingers with you after the lights come up to slightly - just slightly - take the edge off the fun.   Stylish, thrilling, moving and enormously funny in places, this is action cinema at its best. A must see film. <br/><br/>(For the full graphical review of the film please visit http://bob- the- movie-man.com. Thanks.)"

","Fun movie, if not for the fact that the truth was changed to protect the guilty. <br/><br/>In real life, Barry Seal was fired from TWA in '72 when he was charged for smuggling plastic explosives across Mexico. He flew tons of coke into the States for multiple drug kingpins, including Escobar. When he was busted, he started working for the DEA as an informant. He was overweight, poisoned his fellow Americans with drugs; and didn't care about his family enough to enter WITSEC.<br/><br/>From a historical perspective, it should be taken with a grain of salt that a guy like Seal, given his position, can be placed in a situation where everything is cool, time after time after time after time again."

","In 1978, the skilled and ambitious TWA pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) smuggles Cuban cigars to increase his income. Out of the blue, he is contacted by the CIA agent Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), who asks him to work for the CIA photographing facilities over Central America using a state-of-art small plane. Soon Barry contacts General Noriega as a courier for the CIA and is contacted by the Medellin Cartel that wants him to transport drugs to the USA. Then Schafer asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua. Barry invites pilots that are his friends and plots routes to smuggle drugs for the cartel. The CIA closes eyes to the scheme and Barry becomes richer and richer. He uses the Arkansas town Mena to laundry his money. But the DEA and the FBI are tracking him down.

The plot is engaging and entertaining and the despicable Barry Seal is depicted as a family man by Tom Cruise that has good performance. The background of corruption, political interference, trafficking of weapons and drugs are treated like something usual by the story that can not be taken seriously.

","Bored TWA pilot Barry Seal is prevailed upon by shadowy CIA operative ""Shafer"" to fly spy photography missions for them and, subsequently, to courier materials to and from Noriega in Panama. This turns quickly and easily into smuggling cocaine for the Medellin cartel. Much money results and, before he knows it, Seal is in the middle of a very big, lucrative and dangerous business.<br/><br/>Barry Seal was a real person, and the events shown in this film largely took place. I'm not sure if they would have taken place in quite the way they are shown here, though. Tom Cruise plays Seal as a likeable chap, an almost-loser who is a mix between savvy and naive, and blessed with an ability to regard morally reprehensible activity as somehow justifiable.<br/><br/>The film is played almost as a comedy and is quite amusing throughout, despite the questionable and occasionally violent activity which takes place.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, but I found myself wondering about both the morality of portraying Seal as a likeable schmuck whose only crime was finding himself out of his depth, and also the presentation of what happened as a comedy. These were not merry japes."

","While we all eagerly await the release of the recently announced Top Gun sequel, Tom Cruise's latest slice of polished Hollywood entertainment American Made, allows us all to see what it's like when Maverick becomes a little naughty in his retirement from flying fighter jets, verbally sparring with Iceman and making out with Kelly McGillis.<br/><br/>Re-teaming with his Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman, American Made is a relentlessly energized and seriously fun examination of the true life story of American Airlines pilot Barry Seal, who gave up his life as an everyday pilot to not only become a CIA recruited pilot delivering messages, guns and various other treats to South American contacts, but a drug runner for the Pablo Escobar Columbian drug trade, which makes for a wild ride that would be utterly unbelievable were it not in fact based on truth.<br/><br/>Fair warning to all, Liman and his leading man are totally uninterested in giving a dry history lesson of Seal's exploits, as American Made sees the two Hollywood heavy hitters instead turn their trajectory towards delivering a heightened and often over the top examination of these events and with Liman bringing his Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow expertise with him to the event and with Cruise seemingly having the most fun his had in years, the risk to go for something different other than an awards baiting or dialogue heavy expose has paid off hugely, with American Made easily becoming one of the year's most purely fun and enjoyable rides.<br/><br/>At almost 60 years of age you'd be rightfully thinking it's about time that Cruise take a seat back and enjoy a more quiet time in his career but the unstoppable and enthusiastic leading man is having a blast here bringing Seal to life.<br/><br/>In almost every scene of the film, Cruise and Liman continue on with their rapport that they built in Edge of Tomorrow and Liman should be commended for bringing out Cruise's natural talents for comedy and when mixed with his easy going charisma that has made him such a beloved acting figure, Seal offers Cruise one of his best and most interesting roles in his long and varied career, no small feat when you consider the quality of his often underestimated C.V.<br/><br/>American Made's frenetic and sometimes scattered focus may detract from some viewers experiences and those looking for a more sombre take on a no doubt very serious topic may be disappointed but Liman and his cast's (that includes great bit turns from the likes of Sarah Wright as Seal's wife Lucy and Caleb Landry Jones as Lucy's dim-witted brother Bubba) ability to extract the absurdness and craziness of this whole situation and turn it into such a fun piece of entertainment should be a winner in the majority of cases, much like Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street did.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>With Cruise on top form and Liman instilling his film with a breathtaking amount of energy, American Made is a pure piece of cinematic entertainment and an awesomely fun companion piece to Cruise's other well-known plane centred star vehicle.<br/><br/>4 future presidents out of 5"

After the disaster that's THE MUMMY, Tom Cruise returns to form with some of his best work in the last 10 years outside the Mission Impossible franchise. Its a story based on the real life events of Barry Seal, a pilot who plays a crucial role in the Iran-Contra Affair, here we see Tom Cruise return to familiar territory where he makes us fall in love with a Semi-good guy who does bad things but we are not quite sure and root for him, because Tom Cruise makes us fall in love with him with his 1000 Watt Smile.

","I had virtually no expectations for this movie other than a trailer I had seen.<br/><br/>Turns out the entire movie is like a trailer. The whole movie was a series of jump-cuts from scene to scene. There were a ton of montages of Cruise flying, smuggling, etc. It felt like the movie tried to hard to not get bogged down in details, but as a result I found the movie hard to connect with. It didn't help that Cruise's character doesn't have much of a persona. He likes to fly and has questionable morals (such as being willing to smuggle drugs) but there is not much there beyond that. <br/><br/>I think they wanted to show that he loved his family but he made so many questionable decisions that put them at risk that it was hard to like his character. Plus some people have described this as a comedy but it totally lacked any laugh out loud moments or even internal chuckles.<br/><br/>I feel like this story could have been better told with more of a cohesive story line, rather than having Cruise montage his way through it all. It felt like a 2 hour trailer to me. <br/><br/>I gave 5 stars because the movie is somewhat entertaining, but I feel like it fell short of it's potential and I wouldn't watch it a 2nd time."

","I was lucky to get an advanced screening. First off, at least it kept my attention the whole way through. I had previously seen Cruise in the ""Mummy"" movie recently released and was not impressed with his acting there.<br/><br/>In this movie he returned to form and therefore the story-line was far more plausible. I say story-line, but in reality it is one of those docu-drama's, being based on fact. I wonder how much was dramatization as there were some parts where you would ask ""did this sh*t really happen?!""<br/><br/>Would I be inclined to add it to my DVD collection, no. It was good as a one time showing. I suspect the length of it worked somewhat against it.

Cruise is entirely game here, not once trying to make audience feel sorry for his character or thinking that maybe he had a heart of gold, after all. <br/><br/>Worth pointing out is also a stellar turn from a less prolific Domhnall Gleeson whose ambitious CIA operator is equally blind, naive and brilliant, and Gleeson makes his oily presence wonderfully effective."
"helmutty","9","53","85","3 September 2017"," An entertaining and fun well-made film boosted by great direction and acting.
","Doug Liman and Tom Cruise paired up together again for a fast-paced and colorful biography on Barry Seal. American Made may not have the blockbuster action but it holds up on its own firmly with the help of a great direction by Doug. Tom Cruise is definitely the main highlight of the film and he is what made it so entertaining.<br/><br/>The story: The pace is brisk; it takes the audience on a crazy ride from the start and never slows down. Though it never felt boring, sometimes I felt that it could have slowed down for some development. After the film ended, it seems that Doug and Tom had a clear mind on just keeping the audience as entertained as they can be. It cuts to the chase and never dwells on anything such as emotions. It moves quickly from event to event. Advantage is that I was not bored at all. Disadvantage is that it felt like a 2 hours montage on Barry Seal's life. There is no real tension or character's development. The realism is helped by the smart decision of filming like a documentary. Be warned: Action genre fans may be disappointed that is no big action. It is strangely classified as action. <br/><br/>Acting wise: Tom Cruise looks like he had lots of fun filming. It is just entertaining watching him immersed himself in the crazy and fast-paced world of Barry Seal. The rest of the cast are decent but not impressive.<br/><br/>Music wise: Christophe Beck created a decent mood of the different years. Since Doug wanted the film to feel realistic, it is not jam-packed with music. There are many moments where sounds and ambiance take the front seat. <br/><br/>Overall: It is not impressive but it is a solid entry to Doug Liman's and Tom Cruise's filmography. I went in with low expectation and had no idea about the outrageous stuff Barry Seal did. And not only was I entertained, I was immersed into the world of Barry."
"rekotreed","10","42","66","8 October 2017"," Blows the doors off the guns and drugs Iran Contra Scandal
","By Terry Reed, Author of Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA. It finally happened. The complex core of my book Compromised, the CIA's covert guns and drugs debacle cleverly mislabeled the Iran Contra Scandal, has hit the big screen thanks to the efforts of Universal Studios, Director Doug Liman, Screen Writer Gary Spinelli, Tom Cruise and a host of professionals. Liman told me he was attracted to this project as a result of insider information he gleaned from his father Arthur Liman, Chief Counsel for the US Senate's investigation of the Iran Contra affair.<br/><br/>As the person who wrote the original, first hand and definitive book on the Barry Seal/Mena, Arkansas operation, from the inside, I was the most skeptical critic the movie had to win over since I had lived much of the Mena ordeal right along side Barry Sealthe movie's main character played by Cruise.<br/><br/>Sure, there are major deviations from the historical record of what happened in Mena, and the screenwriter exercised his dramatic license combining characters and blending together events for the purpose of cramming this sordid story into 120 minutes of educational entertainment. But that's Hollywood.<br/><br/>As someone who worked with several major Hollywood production companies and screen writers (Clint Eastwood and Dennis Hackin just to drop names) who attempted to bring Compromised to the theaters, I realize how difficult it is find that balance between authenticity, entertainment, time constraints and marketability. Doug Liman has done just that! Those I worked with who attempted to whittle Compromised down to an understandable narrative were most often left with a docudrama type product that in most cases over-reflected the political bend of the whittlers. Just as the title of my book suggests, the Iran Contra scandal and the subsequent unraveling of a CIA covert operation run amuck impacts both political parties. Sure, most will argue that Hollywood is liberal and most likely to err on the side of protect-the-Democrats at all costs, but let's face it, the vast majority of the guns and drugs scandal imbedded within the Mena/Contra support program falls directly into Republican laps. Again, Liman did a superb job of staying true to the Mena geographical location and then suggesting strongly that then-Governor Bill Clinton had a hand in it when the US Attorney's efforts to apprehend Seal in Arkansas are thwarted.<br/><br/>But alas, two hours is a short time to compress history, relay intricate information into a comprehensible story line and then ultimately deal with the life and fate of Cruise's character, pilot Barry Seal. Cruise for the most part is receiving accolades for his Seal portrayal, and I agree American Made underscores that occasionally Cruise can move outside of his Mission Impossible persona and reacquaint us with the depths of his talent.<br/><br/>I must say how rewarding it is to have consulted on the movie with Doug Liman and his staff, and to see how he wove the nuances I provided into the scenes in such an authentic and unobtrusive way. The Contra training camp and mile-high-club scene are just a few of those nuggets that cause the screenplay to frequently place foot on terra firma.<br/><br/>Debbie Seal, the real life widow of Barry who unfortunately is being forced to relive this tragic chapter of her life by watching her husband's demise, saw the movie in a different light. She reminded me that Barry was double-crossed by the Reagan White House which not only resulted in her husband's death by Pablo Escobar, but also forced her to raise their three children alone. Debbie compared it to Jacqueline Kennedy watching a movie of the JFK assassination. A grim reality check.<br/><br/>The Mena/Iran Contra scandal resulted in many of us falling into the category of ""disposable assets"" and being falsely labeled when a covert White House back door operation ran amuck, and we became political liabilities. Much of what we suffered through was the result of cowardly behavior on behalf of the Reagan/Bush Administrations who knew full well that many of us who were recruited for this covert operation were ""left in the cold"" and disavowed when this violation of Congressional Law (The Boland Amendment) became public knowledge. Most of us were Vietnam Veterans who had skill sets needed for the operation and felt honored to be selected to become part of a CIA backed Air America style operation.<br/><br/>This is where I do take exception to the movie plot line. Many of us, myself included, had nothing to do with the transportation of illegal narcotics into America. We were briefed on Barry Seal's multi-prong, multi-agency (DEA, and US Customs undercover activities penetrating the Medellin Cartel that included ""controlled deliveries"" of cocaine) operation but the vast majority of us were tasked with the difficult and dangerous work of training the Contras to build out their own guerilla warfare weapons air delivery system and delivering both munitions and humanitarian aid in a war zone. The movie had two different opportunities to move deeper in this direction, but I presume time constraints kept the plot line humming along in the direction it took.<br/><br/>All in all it is a great first effort to bring the Iran Contra scandal to the movie theaters. It is about flawed human nature, war, life, death and the seedy behavior of politicians and the alphabet soup federal agencies that violate their own codes of ethics and policies,all in the guise of National Security.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen American Made do so. But I must brief you. Fasten your seat belt, stow your tray table and get ready for an exciting, educational and turbulent flight.<br/><br/>P.S. Thank you Doug Liman for your satchel charge effort to blow the doors off this scandal. Iran Contra still screams out for an in-depth and tell-all docudrama production that lets the political fall-out descend as it may and truly takes no prisoners. I am currently working on that project."

","A great story perfectly representing those years and with a stunning performance by Tom Cruise. I would say one of the best movie ever, in this genre, which is midway between a CIA based film and a biopic one. Barry's narration, delivered direct to camera, takes the form of a series of clips from a fuzzy home video supposedly shot in the mid-1980s, laying out the historical background in a dense fashion (he pretends at one point to confuse two countries) which seems most directly indebted to Adam McKay's The Big Short. The biggest coup is the casting of Cruise, who functions as a pure icon, recycling all his usual mannerisms – the grin, the hand gestures – and even revisiting his past as a pilot in Top Gun. The catch is that his depthless showboating for once seems intended as anything but likable."

","Lured by adventure and bucket loads of cash, a gutsy TWA pilot takes on flight operations for both the CIA and a Columbian drug cartel.<br/><br/>In this pacey action film, Tom Cruise pulls off the ultimate feat of an A List actor- he disappears in the role of Barry Seale, ace pilot, lover of risk, dedicated husband and father, and player of games with some pretty shady people. It's a fun role, but deadly serious, and Cruise gets the tone just right.<br/><br/>The director Doug Liman weaves his magic to recreate the effect of being there- in the naive eighties, in the middle of all the fun of flying and unexpected opportunity, with the cautionary tale of Barry Seal a window into the world of corruption we only only saw glimpses of at the time. My only complaint was that third act dragged a little, but it's a real life story, so what can you do.<br/><br/>Full credit to the excellent Domnhall Gleeson as the CIA spy who lures Barry into the web, he's one to watch in the future.<br/><br/>And kudos to Cruise who apparently did his own stunts.

","Cruise is superb in this film, and (in my opinion) his performance captures the audience's attention throughout the film. For me Sarah Wright (the main character's wife), and Alejandro Edda (a Cartel character) also made a mark on the film, with other actors being overshadowed. All in all this was a high-octane and highly entertaining film about real-life historical events that deserved to be made. On the negative side, I would say that it glamorizes the life of Barry Seal and makes him seem like a 'nice fun guy' which is unfortunate. The real-life Barry Seal was a drug smuggler who must have cared nothing for the people who suffered as a result of his drug-running, including the numerous victims of his Cartel 'friends'. Due to the controversial historical and political events portrayed (and also hinted at) in the film, it may have been deemed necessary to do this in order to produce the film in the first place..."

","It's naive to expect truth from 'based-on-true-story' projects, but narrative content should be required ingredient. 'American Made' plays like a movie trailer throughout its two-hour length, stirring together the standard motifs of 1980s cocaine smuggling sagas like 'Blow'. The story boils down to a procession of mustachioed Colombian cartel bosses, DEA agents and drug-courier aviators hauling cocaine, firearms and bags of cash around jungle landing strips, hotel lobbies and small town banks in the ugly fashions of the day.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise portrays pilot protagonist Barry Seal as an easygoing coke-smuggling, gun-running, Caddy-driving adventurer. His self-deprecating charm and aerial dare-devilry are supposed to hold the film together, but both charisma and exploits seem stale. After the CIA persuade Seal to aid their anti-communist follies in Central America, he fends off the various suspicions and demands of his dumb blonde wife, crooked associates and two-faced CIA handlers. The script never develops any of these stock characters as the story unfolds with the depth of a music video. At the conclusion, there's little reason to believe a word of it, or care what happens to any of the participants."
"diane-34","10","23","41","12 September 2017"," Hollywood finally gets it right
","When Hollywood gets it right and stops making movies for children they can actually make a beauty like this one. My wife and I just returned from such an accomplished film some minutes ago: American Made. <br/><br/>We have seen Tom Cruise in a number of his previous films (not necessarily by choice) and both of us kind of cringed at his screen presence. He delivered his lines well enough, but we did not see him as a genuine character; he seemed always to be playing his roles rather than living them. The exception was the movie we attended this afternoon; Cruise ""stepped into the role"", he became Barry Seal and us, the audience lived his demise with him from airline pilot to cocaine courier to arms smuggler for the American government.<br/><br/>This movie could not have been made while Ron Reagan was alive and the other principles like Ollie North sat in positions of decision-making power close to the Oval Office. This movie was about Barry Seal, Drug Smuggler and tangentially about the evil and stupidity that lurked in the minds of people that ran the American government and caused the deaths of many thousands of people in Central America.<br/><br/>This is a brave and thoughtful film that all lovers of America should see; besides its political strength see it because of it is a high film making aptitude."
"DJKwa","8","22","39","5 September 2017"," An entertaining take on an unbelievable true story
","If American Made proves one thing it's that truth is stranger than fiction. The story of American aircraft pilot Barry Seal who became a drug smuggler working for the Medellin cartel, casually rubbed shoulders with Pablo Escobar and ran a massive money laundering operation all while being employed by the CIA, would seem a stretch even by Hollywood's standards. Yet it's precisely the ""based on true events"" part of Seal's story that makes American Made such a fascinating film to watch.<br/><br/>We are first introduced to Seal as a disillusioned TWA pilot looking for something to put the thrill back in his life. When approached by the CIA to fly reconnaissance of communist factions in South America, he immediately jumps at the opportunity. Flying solo from the US on his own private two- engine plane, it's not long before Seal is intercepted by the Medellin cartel and offered large amounts of cash to smuggle drugs into the US. Ever the opportunist, Seal agrees and soon finds himself playing on both sides of the law and making more money than he knows what to do with. But as the demands from both sides grow increasingly untenable, Seal finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place, with his luck quickly drying up.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise brings his manic charisma to the role of Seal, and he's a good fit for the highflying, larger than life character. It's hard not to look with contempt at a man who transported illegal narcotics into the US en masse, but Cruise does a good job in humanising Seal and portraying him as more than just a criminal. At heart, Seal is a family man looking to provide for his wife and daughter but whose unrelenting pursuit of the American dream finds him working on both sides of the law. <br/><br/>The charisma Cruise brings to the role goes a long way in making Seal an endearing protagonist, and he seems to have fun in the role. Following the underwhelming performance of The Mummy earlier this year, American Made represents a return to form for him and a welcome return to the more grounded narratives in which he fares far better with. <br/><br/>Director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, Fair Game) complements Cruise's commanding performance with his highly energised filming style. The camera is rarely steady for more than a beat and its constant zooming, shaking and moving around lends the film an effective faux doco feel. On the flipside, however, the incessant camera movements are distracting during some of the quieter moments in the film. In one simple conversation scene in a diner, near the beginning of the film, the camera haphazardly changes angles and abruptly zooms in towards the characters as they speak. It's awkwardly staged and distracts from the dialogue. Luckily the film moves at such a fast clip that Liman's hyperactive filming works mostly well but some restraint would have gone a long way during the smaller scenes.<br/><br/>Overall American Made is a fascinating biopic about a larger than life character. The film benefits greatly from Cruise's committed performance and Liman's lively direction to provide an entertaining take on an unbelievable true story."

","What a turgid bore fest.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I like Tom Cruise but we have all seen these stories before and made much better - Lord Of War with Nick Cage was ten times better film than this.<br/><br/>Was not exciting in the least - there seemed to be a missing tension in the story; whether this was because of Tom Cruise' blasé performance and seeming safe atmosphere it just didn't convey any danger, suspense or even anything new to add to the genre.<br/><br/>Seen it all before drug cartel movies are ten a penny and this was not even worth a penny! Cannot believe the high 7.1 mark for this, just shows the level of expectation of our reality TV generation - how sad!"
"CANpatbuck3664","8","7","10","4 October 2017"," American Made is An Exciting Trip Piloted Expertly by Liman and Cruise
","This is one of those stories that is so crazy that you can't believe it could be true (I'm not sure what is and isn't 100% factual). The fact that this guy could be recruited and get swept up in so many different cons is unbelievable. Compounding that, the fact that he didn't get how dangerous this was is remarkable. The people behind this movie could spin straw to gold but I think the movie benefits immensely from having a compelling story to draw from. You also get some understanding about politics during the Cold War. The film is smart enough not to get too bogged down in what could be dry/heavy material and they wrap it up with some style to make it easier to wrap your head around it.<br/><br/>I think Barry Seal as a character will divide audiences. The movie tries to portray him as a thrill seeker who had exceptional skill but couldn't see past the end of his nose. Other people might view him as an opportunist that made a fortune playing one government agency against another and he personally helped further the drug trade in the U.S.A. I came down in the middle on him. I think the movie probably glosses over some of his darker aspects but he was ultimately a pilot whose greed and attitude both helped and hurt him. I tend to enjoy characters like this as protagonists, it's not always fun to follow the boy scout. Seal ends up being the sum of his decisions for better or worse and despite his missteps, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when they reached the epilogue.<br/><br/>I think this was an excellent role for Tom Cruise to take. It can be hard to separate him from Ethan Hunt (his Mission Impossible character) and I like seeing him play more morally grey characters. He's charming as Barry Seal but he never portrays him as a hero. He's not a villain either but Cruise elevates his game to sell how Seal got caught up in this success and struggled getting out. His Cajun accent is decent and he did a good job. I was surprised how much I liked Sarah Wright as Lucy Seal. She's a pretty face for sure but her character has a little more depth than I anticipated. Her performance reminded me of Margot Robbie's performance as Naomi in The Wolf of Wall Street (if you pitted them head to head, I'd still pick Robbie but Wright more than held her own). I like Domhnall Gleeson in other things but I didn't think he was as good in this. His character couldn't seem to pick a lane between being very straight-laced or being a slick double-talker and I don't think he was charismatic enough to make me remember Schafer. Jesse Plemons and Caleb Landry Jones are good as Sheriff Downing and JB but they're not in the movie for very long. I'd also credit Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejia and Jayma Mays for being solid in their respective supporting parts.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how American Made had a go-with-the-flow tone. It isn't hard to draw parallels between Seal's carefree attitude and how they decide to tell his story. The movie moves fast and it was pretty funny. They don't skate around how ridiculous Seal's situation is and they have no problem laughing along with you at his lack of common sense. His choices are taking him and his family down a path that almost everyone can see coming except him. They make the right call in keeping things light for the majority of it and I was laughing through most of the movie. But when the movie needs to show the consequences for his actions, the tone shifts appropriately. This can be jarring but I think they handled it about as well as they could have. Whether you like Seal or don't, his end is shocking but more or less expected.<br/><br/>Most of my problems with American Made are small and easy enough to toss aside. It took me a little time to get invested in Barry's story, the movie wasn't as strong at the very beginning. There isn't much exposition and you have to float for a bit to grasp Barry's ongoing dilemma. But after a while, I caught up with the pace of the movie and I couldn't help but enjoy the ride. The other thing is that while the ending is properly dramatic and is a punch to the gut, the overall arc of the story is easy to plot. Stepping back from the story, it follows the same major beats as many other movies in this genre. We rise and we fall with Barry and while I thought the story carried me through most of those quibbles, for the more discerning viewer, it might be hard to look past.<br/><br/>Doug Liman and Tom Cruise seem to be a good match for each other and they deliver an exceptional rise and fall caper movie. I love Edge of Tomorrow and they didn't disappoint in their follow-up. This is an interesting story that manages to be entertaining while sneakily teaching the audience about some of the inner-workings of the U.S. government and how they handled foreign conflicts in South America in the 1980s. I don't think this will make my 2017 top ten but I would be happy to see this again. I would encourage Liman and Cruise to continue making movies together and I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a fun crime story that happens to be a period piece."

"savethebears","2","32","63","30 September 2017"," Not good.
","First of all, the cinematography was garbage. I guess some directors think that it looks good to film a movie as if it were filmed by an amateur using a go-pro. Not only were the camera shots always shaky, they weren't even good. Some shots just seemed pointless. As if some high school first-time videographer was trying out shots that they thought would look good, like putting the camera on the floor. How creative. Not. Also, many shots seemed like they were zoomed in too far, cropping focal points out of the scene. <br/><br/>I personally don't think such camera techniques look good. They look cheap. The idea of a movie is to sink in to it and ""forget"" you're even watching a movie. Well, this camera person didn't have that concept in mind. Not at all.<br/><br/>Some videographers & directors take big risks trying out unique camera shots, and for some films their experiments work out. But it many others, they don't. And in this one, their unique camera style did not work.<br/><br/>And now going beyond the awful videography, I felt like the writing wasn't even that great. And ontop of that, I felt that the acting wasn't even that great. A real good movie has every cast member fitting a scene. A lot of the characters felt like actors. It felt cheap.<br/><br/>And besides the bad filming, poor-writing & sub-par acting, the movies whole storyline seems to glorify criminal drug-runners & make them look like a bunch of fun cool guys. In reality, that's not the case. The big cocaine dealers are hard criminals. <br/><br/>And furthermore, while the movie doesn't officially state that the CIA themselves were smuggling cocaine, it's clear they were. And for someone spin that as a good thing; pumping hard life-ruining narcotics into neighborhoods that otherwise would have been void of drugs, is absurd. Doesn't matter if they are ""funding anti-communist matters"". Not only would such tactics be ultimately irrelevant to US taxpayers interests, it in effect destroys US communities. <br/><br/>All around I found this film to be poorly produced & a dismal portrayal of any sort of realism. It's just a big Hollywood cool-guy party where are the characters are hip sunglass wearing party animals having fun swimming in money & enjoy life! There's no realism in the characters; it's absurd. <br/><br/>After one painful hour I left the theater. <br/><br/>I read one reviewer saying ""this is Tom Cruise's best film!""<br/><br/>Wow. Obviously their film criticism has no value. <br/><br/>To rate this film alongside Mission Impossible films, Jack Reacher, Edge of Tomorrow, War of Worlds & Oblivion is totally absurd.<br/><br/>Sadly I'd put this film in the same basket as ""The Mummy""."

Rest of the cast is also impressive. <br/><br/>The film is shot very well; the technical aspects are top notch. The locales showcased are just a pure treat to watch. Background score is also immersive. Another major plus is the action. This film redefines the action genre by giving a lot of cool action blocks but without being violent.

","After seeing the trailer of American Made, I was looking forward to this film. The trailer is misleading to say the least. I expected a combo of Blow and The Wolf Of Wallstreet. However, this film does not contain anything we haven't seen before. There are many movies with similar stories to this one, but none of them are this boring. There is no suspense in this movie. The story is not cohesive and predictable. It is not to blame on the acting of the cast. It's just a badly written story and the movie is to long."
"MichaelNontonMulu","7","13","23","27 August 2017"," The Fun Way of Showing Biography of Barry Seal's Unique Life
","For a biography movie, this one was interestingly done. The way the story was told made it seemed quite fun. Some portions were using dark humor and Tom Cruise was real charming in here. I could actually picture him as this real unique character. His relationship with his wife and family was also real fun to look at, especially during the moment when he tried to convince her about the good about his works.<br/><br/>One cool thing about the movie was the very good costumes and sets. It was like we were transformed into the world of the 1970s and early 1980s when the film was set. Especially the make up effects of Tom Cruise was also exceptional. He looked a lot younger than his actual age here. Even my wife was very amazed with his appearance and looks. In addition to the costumes and sets, the film was also having some songs from that period which enhanced the aura of 70s and 80s here.<br/><br/>The main attraction of this movie was definitely the uniqueness of Barry Seal's life as a pilot and smuggler and also the impacts he had in the US history during the Ronald Reagan's presidency then. It even had some political figures mentioned as well. The title of the movie also suit the story very nicely. You would understand why it has such title by the end of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, you could already guess the conclusion of the movie. Especially if you are a history buff who already knew the story of Barry Seal. There appeared to be various versions of his life story, so I am not sure either whether the one we saw here was the real actual version. But anyway, in term of entertainment, the movie was made into a non boring kind of biographical movie. However, those who were expecting to see Tom Cruise kick a$$ in this movie would probably be disappointed cause this is not that kind of movie. There were some action scenes but this film could not be categorized as action type. There were no very emotional moments as well (which I found rather odd as usually biography movie would have some of those parts).<br/><br/>Finally, if you are looking for a good biographical crime movie, this one might be a good option. Though this was not as heavy as other movies in such category, it was still interesting to see Tom Cruise's portrayal of one of the controversial character in US history. It was also directed by Doug Liman who was the director of some good and/or commercially successful movies such as The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Edge of Tomorrow and few others. But for those who are looking for movies with lots of actions by Tom Cruise, better wait for his next Mission: Impossible movies. <br/><br/>For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

"Danielpotato","1","52","116","8 September 2017"," There are certain things that should stay in the 80's.
","And Tom Cruise is one of them.<br/><br/>Let's be honest here. Tom Cruise has never been a good actor, he just got where he is now due to contacts, his agency and especially physical aspect, to attract women and girls. He is a real drip. Whose only good performances is the good-looking hero who said good one-liners (Mission Impossible - a franchise that Hollywood created on purpose only to increase his ego, in which he is the only relevant character there), or the patriarch service, scenes of Tropic Thunder, are the perfect example what he does well, a guy who likes to be the boss and abuse women and employees.<br/><br/>Now with this pathetic movie, someone wants to convince me that Cruise can play Barry Seal, a guy who gets out in front of the government, a Latino drug cartel, drug barons, CIA, FBI or more than a thousand and one things yet to be made or discovered by man. Hell no. If someone at Hollywood want to make a convincing Barry Seal, bring someone with the caliber of Josh Brolin. That would give this project even more credit. And who had the sad idea to make Cruise the narrator of this film. I hate this one-liner, I'm the only guy, who always delivers. I do not even remember half the movie. The way the film is so bad structurally.<br/><br/>But Tom Cruise is not the only flaw in this project (this project was born crooked at birth). The movie itself was never taken seriously. What do you expect from a movie coming out after the summer season? A serious film about a serious subject, with a good script and a good acting? No way. <br/><br/>The movie is full of useless sex jokes typical of larger-budget films from Hollywodd, the Tom Cruise scene having sex with his wife in the cockpit of the plane is ridiculous or Tom Cruise's character constantly showing the ""butt""- It's deplorable, I know. Or male jokes like Tom Cruise facing 100 or more Hispanics with a baseball bat. Incompetent scene.<br/><br/>The direction of the film is flawed, the pace is horrendous, there are some scenes too long, or some too short. The acting is too fake, especially on the part of Jayma Mays (the most unbelievable justice solicitor, I have ever seen) and Sarah Wright (the windy head, annoying, generic woman of Barry Seal).<br/><br/>Holes in the script (no one has remembered the corpse of the useless brother of the wife of Barry Seal, the police in this film is really useless and unprepared, by the way).<br/><br/>Not to forget how this film treats the people of Latin America, whose only humans that appear in the film, are drug dealers, murderers or pornography lovers. Or the people of Mena, that this film represents as useless morons from the countryside. <br/><br/>What a useless and terrible movie we have here. Someone burns this movie as fast as possible.

Those who might still be in the dark about this stuff please do yourself a favor and read ""Castles Made of Sand"" by Andre Gerolymatos or ""A Great Place to Have a War"" by Joshua Kulantzick. If you want something a little more specific to this film's subject matter there's ""Smuggler's End"" by Del Hahn.

In it a TWA pilot turned CIA stooge makes a little side cash smuggling drugs, guns and people to and from Central America. While doing so, the movie frames the larger collusions and convolutions not as the result of a deeply flawed man sticking his thumbs in various proverbial pies but as an awkward jumble of ""and then"" filmmaking in spite of him.<br/><br/>Barry (Cruise) fits neatly into the recent crop of true-life protagonists too stupid to realize they're in over their head. He smiles crookedly, trying to hide his intentions under aviator glasses – mostly to the amusement of his CIA handler played by Domhnall Gleeson. He's clearly playing with a bad hand and everyone including the infamous Medellin drug cartel knows it, but damned if they're not entertained by Barry's good 'ol boy braggadocio. He's like a composite of the dudes from War Dogs (2016) only with the serendipity (and obliviousness) of Forrest Gump (1994).<br/><br/>What exactly makes a man like this tick? The movie doesn't really seem that interested in answering that question. Instead it seems more concerned with giving us a history lesson based on Barry's limited first-person perspective and various camera collage techniques that make American Made look like an episode of Arrested Development (2003-Present). This is of course told without wit, irony or the requisite anger needed. One can't help but think that if director Doug Liman brought the same level of ire to this movie that he did in the under-watched Fair Game (2010), American Made would have been a bit more palatable tosomeone.<br/><br/>As it stands however, American Made is for no one. It's a frustratingly mediocre waste of marquee space that's too dense to be entertaining and too cavalier to be worth a good discussion of Cold War foreign policy. It lacks characterization and perspective, leaving only Tom Cruise's boundless charisma to push it past the runway with any alacrity.

"dcruize_csc","10","12","22","18 September 2017"," Tom Cruise is outstanding in this brilliantly satirical black comedy
","This movie is an absolutely hilarious black comedy, and all the funnier because we know we really shouldn't find the subject matter funny (as it involves the smuggling of tonnes of cocaine from Colombia to the US), but Tom as Barry Seal is so disarmingly roguish as the happy-go-lucky lead that I found it impossible not to forgive his crimes as a pawn in a really huge game with gigantic major players.<br/><br/>Barry starts the movie as a airline pilot in a mundane job which he sometimes tries to shake up (literally) to make it a little more entertaining. He is a small-time smuggler of cheap contraband, and the CIA uses knowledge of this fact to recruit him into the big time. They hire him as a CIA contractor to take reconnaissance photos of the ""commies"" in Nicaragua, and to pick up intel from General Noriega in Panama. This leads Pablo Escobar and his two mates to recruit Barry as a cocaine smuggler, as he is always flying between Central America and the USA with the CIA's help and can drop the drugs out of the plane without detection.<br/><br/>The CIA agent in charge of Barry, Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) finds out about Barry's nefarious goings on, and gets him off the hook when he gets gaoled in Colombia on condition that he run guns for the Contras who are fighting the ""commies"" in Nicaragua. Tom agrees, but suffice it to say that the guns don't end up where they are supposed to and the cocaine operation for Escobar and his two Colombian mates ends up getting supersized.<br/><br/>To get out of doing 30 years in gaol for drug trafficking, Barry ultimately does a deal with the White House (Oliver North and a senior DEA guy), but these two double-cross him and it all ends badly for Barry, except that he had a great time for eight years and made a huge amount of dough.<br/><br/>My only beef with this film is that, unlike in another must-see film about this same subject called ""Kill the Messenger"" (2014 starring Jeremy Renner) this film does not make explicit the connection between the CIAs activities in Central American in the early to mid 80s and the importation of tonnes of cocaine into the USA to finance the war against the ""commies"" in Nicaragua, which Congress refused to back. Rather, in this move the CIA just keeps Barry out of gaol on condition that he fly heaps of guns to the Contras (which he doesn't in fact comply with), and allow Contras to do military training on the extensive property that the CIA has obtained for him in Mena, Louisiana. (Most of these ""soldiers"" just want to get to the USA and couldn't care less about fighting ""commies"", and abscond the first chance they get).<br/><br/>Despite the slight bending of historical fact to appease the CIA and company (the CIA admitted in 1998 to using cocaine money to fund the Contras in a 400 page document which went unreported in the US media thanks to the absurd controversy about President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski), this film is a very rewarding and hilarious thrill ride into high stakes espionage and drug smuggling by ""the man who always delivers""."

","After seeing American Made , the only question that lingered in my mind was why Cruise even thinks of doing movies like The Mummy when he can be this entertaining. In this era, when the Home Entertainment options are very convenient and luxurious, Cruise is still the star one should exclusively see on the big screen. Story: Barry (Tom Cruise) is earning his crust as a TWA pilot when he's approached by a clean-cut smiling, young man called Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson), who makes him an intriguing offer. Barry, who's clearly an adrenaline junkie, jumps at the offer, despite the fact he's married and a father. Surveillance work soon turns to gun-running to the Contra militias in Nicaragua, where a chance meeting with two gents called Ochoa and Escobar leads to even riskier work. Direction: Doug Liman who has worked with Cruise before in the superb ' Edge of Tomorrow' does great work here.His now-signature camera moves - the quick pull-zooms and shaky hand-held shots add to the realism of the movie. He also keeps the pace fast so it never feels boring. Acting: Domnhall Gleeson plays a convincing second hand to Cruise. He stands on his own. Sarah wright does a convincing job in playing Barry Seal's Wife. Final Words: So, All in all American Made is a superb crime - thriller that is made more special by Cruise whose star power is in full display here."

Look at broadcast interviews of Barry Seal boastfully showing how he stung the drug lords and Sandinistas, yet in the movie he was thrown under the bus by Reagan and Oliver North...Give me a break, using the actual names of historical players does not give a license to the rewriting of history - those idiots espousing that it blows the doors off some scandal probably believe that Abraham Lincoln was in fact a Vampire Hunter."
"Lewis_Heather787","7","9","16","27 August 2017"," Stylish, funny and a roller coaster of a ride!
","Lets get the record straight I personally would watch anything that Tom Cruise would appear in, over the past years his films have been solidly good with a few speed bumps along the way. Ever since hearing the story of this film and knowing that this film was entering production I was really keen to see what Doug Liman and Tom Cruise would do and they didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Doug Liman is a great director and that is shown very well in this film, the whole direction as a film is beautifully stylised for the time period that it covers. Liman makes this rather crazy, shambolic and eye opening film a real roller coaster of emotions, this is even thought the film only has really one to three main characters with a lot of ""B characters"". At heart this film is a character driven story, obviously its based on true events of Barry Seal, but it is set against this adrenaline filled underground drug world. The directing throughout the film is impeccable there is nothing to fault Liman on and it shows he was desperately keen on using as many real planes as possible some of the aircraft shots are really cool. Liman gets top marks definitely one of his better films.<br/><br/>Now onto the man himself Tom Cruise, some people hate him, how? don't ask me. However the majority including myself love his work and as the older he has got the more adventurous he has got in the roles he has taken. I read in a article the other day and it said that ""Cruise is ageing in the opposite direction, he is getting better with age"". I believe that quote fully 100% and this film demonstrates it as well, he once again some how he is at the top of his game. Barry Seal is an interesting character because weirdly you want him to succeed which is strange, especially considering that the CIA basically abandoned him. Cruise is never out of character, wow i can't believe that even crossed my mind, he is witty, charming and has a lot of heart. Anyone should just see this film for Cruise and I suppose that is the point and the main attraction for most people, his performance is nothing ground breaking however it demonstrates flexibility in his ever changing résumé of work. I can't remember the last time he turned in a bad perfor..........cough.....oh who remembers the jack reacher sequel, see I can't even remember the name of it....<br/><br/>The story of the film is heart pounding from start to finish but as I've mentioned it has this down to earth quality to it that can really resonate with audiences because at the end of the day Seal is just doing it for his family. Its strange because in reality I should not be rooting for Seal he did a lot of bad things for the US government but the qualities and traits of the man just strangely outweigh all that was bad. It is quite unbelievable that this was going on, OK it was before my time so maybe to the older more experience viewer it might not be so shocking, but for me it quite staggering how the US government and the CIA were operating. It is one of the most fascinating stories that I have heard of in quite a while it is really eye opening.<br/><br/>75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10, I really wish IMDb would change their scoring system, sorry back to American Made a solid film and really enjoyable. Has got good directing, editing, score and it has probably one of if not the most dependable actor that has lived in it. Not to sure why the film, in the UK, has a 15 rating I suppose its the subject matter but its not a dark, bloody or depressing film, I think its a real roller coaster of a journey with a lot of heart and a few good laughs. It is definitely worth your time!"

","Good film. No masterpiece but a well written biopic and definitely a career saving project for Tom Cruise, who finally gives an interesting performance again. He was not Award-Great or anything, in fact there were some mannerisms about his performance that were not quite fitting or sometimes a bit annoying or unbelievable BUT it was still a fine performance in its whole essence and if he keeps doing those projects he might redeem himself. Domhnall Gleason gave the best performance in the film as CIA Agent who recruites Cruise and makes one mistake after the other hence to his adorable naivety. Gleason is perfect for that role. Sarah Wright was miscast. First of all she was far too sexy and beautiful for that role second of all far too young to play Cruise's wife. Was not believable. Always good to see Jesse Plemons although he was a bit wasted in a short and not so important role. The screenplay was clever, funny, had some nice twists and room for entertaining action sequences, that were not over the top but smoothly fit into the whole thing.

As mentioned tom cruise plays the lead in this film and he is pretty great, he adds a lot of charisma to his performance. He adds charm to the role and even though his character isn't the most likable you can't help but root for him because of his performance. Domnall gleeson plays the CIA agent in this film and he also is good in this film. He has a quirky personality in the film and his chemistry with cruise is good when they're on screen together. I also thought the actress who plays cruise in the film was good as well. But I found all the performances involved with the cartel side of the film to be pretty drab and bland and I hated cruises characters brother in law in this film, he annoyed me a lot. The story in this film is crazy to watch and it is interesting to watch this guy have to deal with all these different things all at once. This is also a negative though as there is just so much going on in this film and I felt like some of it was just filler and pretty unnecessary. The script actually has some pretty decent humorous dialogue in it, but I feel the film doesn't go far enough with its dramatic dialogue especially towards the end of the film. The style of the film has a more grainy look about it which I didn't really feel worked very well. But the part I really didn't like was the pacing of the film. The film is less then two hours long but I swear it felt three hours long. This film just drags on a lot and it really hurts the overall quality of the film. Overall this is one of those films that isn't bad but not particularly good either which makes it not really worth watching."

","""American Made"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Barry Seal. After a clever 1970s montage featuring Jimmy Carter's infamous feel-bad speech, the movie introduces us to Seal, a TWA pilot Who is not adverse to shaking things up a bit (literally causing turbulence). It's not long before Seal is approached by a CIA agent to do clandestine reconnaissance in South America. It's not long before Seal gets involved in the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia... At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie reunites director Liman with Tom Cruise, who previously teamed up on the well-received ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (for which a sequel is being planned). Here they bring us (""Based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the movie) the story of a TWA pilot turned CIA informant turned drug runner. The movie is divided up in chapters, from ""CIA '78"" to ""Colombia '80"" and so on. While the subject matter is quite serious and Barry Seal not particularly likable per se, the movie is fast-paced and zany, and is helped tremendously by Tom Cruise's charming and very effective performance. The supporting cast are for me relatively unknowns, including Sara Wright as Barry's wife, and Domhnall Gleeson as the CIA handler. A minus point is the incessant use of hand-held cameras as well as the use of extreme close-ups. Enough already! We get that it is an action movie! There are tons of great song placements in the movie, and when George Harrison's ""Wah Wah"" plays of the closing moments and the end titles, it perfectly captures much of the movie's ebullience.<br/><br/>""American Made"" opened wide this weekend, and I was looking forward to seeing it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (about 20 people in a huge auditorium), much to my surprise. Perhaps strong word-of-mouth can generate a stronger box office performance in theaters. Regardless, this is bound to find a wider audience on VOD and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

"PotassiumMan","5","7","14","16 October 2017"," Mundane, misbegotten Tom Cruise rejuvenation vehicle
","How many more of these boy-wonder performances is Cruise going to give before he finally acquiesces to something more... normal? Don't get me wrong, he still comes across as youthful and dynamic on-screen despite being well into his 50s. But if you've followed his career for decades, this kind of film becomes something of a fraud on his part. Generally, I'd rather watch a bona fide young actor make the endeavor in the type of performances Cruise continues to strive for even though he's now within shouting distance of 60. Because Cruise is an age-battling Hollywood movie star, his presence lacks depth. Notwithstanding the film's brisk, carefree tenor, it's a stunning miscasting.<br/><br/>In this film, Cruise attempts to give a performance as Barry Seal, the TWA pilot who quickly becomes a hired gun for the CIA in the drug smuggling era involving the South American drug cartels and the Sandinistas. He basically flies loads and loads of drugs into the United States and in the process becomes a very rich man. He works for the CIA and provides a service to the drug lords. It's fairly interesting and decently executed for a while. Domhnall Gleeson is the bright spot in this film as the shadowy CIA operative who becomes Cruise's demanding, unapologetic boss.<br/><br/>But maybe the filmmakers should have done their homework before putting this together because Cruise, evidently trying to capture a young protagonist, doesn't look anything like the corpulent Seal. Ironically, this miscasting makes Cruise's effort even more ridiculous. Not only was Seal not as athletic as Cruise, he wasn't particularly youthful-looking either. This central misrepresentation is really what kills the film, not to mention a relatively rote screenplay that we've come across a million times before. None of this is going to be too egregious to most viewers. Many people would probably never even know who Barry Seal was, if not for this film. Still, it's kind of silly for Cruise to continue to perpetuate a desperate jump into the fountain of youth in a role that doesn't even call for it that much. But perhaps stardom is the ultimate source of self-delusion. Not recommended."

"zardoz-13","9","5","9","16 October 2017"," A First Rate, Real-Life Drug Smuggling Saga
","Doug Liman, the director of ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" chronicles the rip-roaring, real-life exploits of good ole boy Barry Seal in ""American Made,"" an exhilarating action-comedy, crime thriller that combines elements of the Mel Gibson epic ""Air America"" (1990) and the 2015 Netflix series ""Narcos."" If you saw the first season of ""Narcos,"" Barry Seal went out in a brief blaze of glory. At one time the youngest commercial airliner pilot for TWA, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana native got intertwined with the CIA, the DEA, Pablo Escobar and the murderous Medellín Cartel as well as the Reagan White House, and lived up to the image of 'a wild and crazy guy' before the Colombians finally snuffed him. Mind you, ""American Made"" isn't the first time that Hollywood has depicted Seal's audacious antics. The late, great Dennis Hopper portrayed Seal in Roger Young's made-for-television docudrama ""Double-Crossed"" (1991) with Danny Trejo. Later, Michael Paré had a supporting role as Barry Seal in Brad Furman's ""The Infiltrator"" (2016) with Bryan Cranston as an undercover DEA agent. More recently, Dylan Bruno played Seal in an episode of ""Narcos."" Nevertheless, the charismatic Cruise delivers a broad, light-hearted performance as the amoral drug smuggling aviator in what amounts to a modern-day version of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in the skies. Basically, as Barry Seal, Cruise dominates ""American Made"" while other equally historic personages lurk on the periphery, including President Ronald Reagan and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Helming this entertaining, 115-minute, R-rated opus with a light touch, Liman doesn't subject audiences to the usual blood-splattered carnage that characterizes the typical cartel crime expose. Although ""Stash House"" writer Gary Spinelli has altered the facts here and there to make Barry Seal appear more sympathetic, ""American Made"" qualifies as one of the better cartel crime sagas which shows audiences that you cannot smuggle your cocaine and live to tell about it without the fatal consequences catching up with you.<br/><br/>""American Made"" opens with TWA pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise of ""Top Gun"") flying passengers here, there, and everywhere, and growing bored and restless with being a just another pilot when he isn't smuggling Cuban cigars. In one scene, our prankster protagonist decides to wake up his serenely sleeping passengers as well as his snoozing co-pilot during a flight by switching off the auto-pilot and creating a little turbulence of his own. Eventually, weary of the predictable routine of shuttling passengers, Seal quits TWA just after his co-pilot and he complete their pre-flight checklist. Grabbing his gear, he exits the jetliner without a backward glance and goes off to work for an enigmatic guy named Monty 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") who furnishes him a twin-engined aircraft and clearance to fly patriotic missions for the CIA. Initially, Seal refuses to let his sweet but superficial wife Lucy (Sarah Wright of ""The House Bunny"") in on his new gig until he runs into trouble smuggling cocaine for Pablo Escobar. Colombian troops bust Escobar and his associates while Seal winds up in jail and loses a tooth until 'Schafer' shows up to bail him out. The catch is that Louisiana authorities will be knocking on his front door at dawn the following day if Seal doesn't uproot his family on a moment's notice and relocate them to Mena, Arkansas. Lucy goes reluctantly along with his harebrained scheme, and the police with their blue and red dome light flashing careen pass him on the way out of town. Talk about a cliffhanger escape! Barry finds himself running guns to Contras in Nicaragua for 'Schafer' when he isn't pausing in Panama to swap contraband with General Manuel Noriega (newcomer Alberto Ospino) or flying more cocaine into Louisiana for Pablo Escobar. Basically, as long as Seal flies for the CIA, the Agency doesn't care what he does on his own time. Furthermore, to protect their investment in his services, the CIA provide him with information so he can elude the DEA. Seal winds up hiring four other misfit pilots, and they outfly the DEA back and forth from Central and South America. The last thing our free-wheeling hero could ever imagine happening happens: he makes a ton of money but he doesn't have enough bank accounts and front companies to conceal it. Indeed, he buries so much cash on property that the CIA has given him that he has nowhere else to hide aside from stuffing in suitcases in his hanger. At this point, the devil enters paradise in the person of Lucy's sleazy younger brother J.B. (Caleb Landry Jones of ""X-Men: First Class""), who decides to take advantage of all those $100 bills cluttering up closets. Suddenly, not only do the authorities bust J.B., but the CIA decides to let the FBI, ATF, DEA, and the Arkansas State Police arrest him. In a last-ditch effort to save his wife and family, Seal agrees a mission for the White House and Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North to incriminate Pablo Escobar. Naturally, the Oval Office doesn't keep its end of the bargain.<br/><br/>Despite its historical basis in 1970s and the 1980s, the last thing that director Doug Liman wants audiences to do is take Barry Seal seriously, and ""American Made"" amounts to a nostalgic romp through headlines of the yesteryear. The excerpts from Ronald Reagan's Hollywood films as well as his White House press conference, featuring wife Nancy and her famous ""Just Say No to Drugs"" quote are thoroughly hilarious. One of the funniest scenes shows Seal crash landing a plane crammed with cocaine in a suburban neighborhood. Stumbling out of the aircraft, our clownish hero emerges covered in cocaine. Dumping packets of $100 bills at the feet of a gawking teenager, Seal takes the kid's bike and pedals away before the DEA arrives. Rarely has twentieth century history been so nostalgic as ""American Made,"" and Tom Cruise will keep you in stitches as a guy who leaped before he looked."
"Desertman84","5","5","9","14 October 2017"," Does Tom Cruise Makes A Comeback?
","After the last two movies made by Tom Cruise that somehow placed my own doubts on his mega stardom - ""Jack Reacher:Never Go Back"" and ""The Mummy"" - with the former being far less of a money earner - earning only $162 million as compared to the $500+ million that his Mission:Impossible movies make - and the latter being trashed by critics considering it as an unsuccessful and messy reboot of ""The Mummy"" franchise,the question is:Did he make a successful comeback in ""American Made""?<br/><br/>Before going to the review proper, let us discuss what ""American Made"" is all about.It is a film written by Gary Spinelli and directed by Doug Liman.It stars Cruise together with Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejía, Caleb Landry Jones and Jesse Plemons.The story or screenplay focuses on Barry Seal,who happens to be a former TWA pilot that became a drug smuggler for the Medellin Cartel during the 1980's.In order to avoid getting into prison,Seal decided to cooperate and be an informant for the DEA - Drug Enhancement Board - when he was approached by the U.S. government.<br/><br/>The movie only earned $30 million in the United States and $100 million worldwide despite having a budget of $50 million with Tom Cruise commanding at least $20 million in salary.No question that it did not earn much being a Tom Cruise movie considering his Mission:Impossible movies can earn as much as $500+ million globally.<br/><br/>With regards to his performance,no question that Tom Cruise did better as compared to his Jack Reacher and The Mummy films but I personally found him somewhat of a miscast considering that he has to have somehow a Louisiana-devil-may-care attitude and present himself as the youthful Seals on his 20's despite being 55 years of age.I felt that despite the energy he brought to the character,he wasn't able to provide a good characterization being a limited actor that can only provide life to arrogant and charismatic characters like Maverick in ""Top Gun"". <br/><br/>While many critics considered it a good film,it could have been a masterpiece and a big earner like ""The Godfather"" had it been under more talented people particularly a more capable director and a versatile lead actor instead of Doug Liman and Tom Cruise respectively.<br/><br/>So to answer the question ""Does Tom Cruise make a comeback?"",I would say no he doesn't.His cold streak from ""Jack Reacher:Never Go Back"", ""The Mummy"" and ""American Made"" continues.No question that the presence of Tom Cruise at 55 years-old is no longer enough for his movies to be successful.He definitely has to be in the right role and the right material to continue his success as a Hollywood megastar."

What's more interesting is the story behind this film, something I wasn't aware occurred, and enjoyed learning about it via this film. Every actors performance was perfect and very convincing. My only complaint is the massive amount of quick edits/cuts in certain scenes, and I wasn't a fan of the choppy camera handling and quick zoom-ins.

I can praise the operators work:the long takes,the great in plane and out plane footages.The flying was showed in a very fascinating way. The film is collecting extra points in the field of editing too. The scenes were put together in a very clever way and they added some jokes into the process.

"The-Sarkologist","7","6","12","26 August 2017"," So That's How They Did It
","I would probably describe this as being one of those true crime gangster movies, though I am not entirely sure of how accurate, or real, the story is. Sure, there was a guy named Barry Seal, but the suggestion at the end of the film was that the CIA did what it could to basically sweep this whole episode under the table and to pretend that it didn't happen. However, what is surprising is that even though this agent went off the rails, nothing really all that bad actually happened to him – well for the most part that is because he did eventually meet a rather grisly end.<br/><br/>So, the story is about a pilot named Barry Seal, who begins his misadventures smuggling Cuban cigars into American via Canada (actually he files them to Canada and his contact does the rest). While on layover in Canada he is met by a CIA operative who offers him a job – he gets his own plane as long as he flies some recon missions over South and Central America. Well, that works out reasonably well, and he even provides a delivery service for the agency – that is until he makes an acquaintance with a rather notorious guy in Columbia – Pablo Escobar.<br/><br/>Like a lot of these films, it is about the rise and fall of this particular guy, and how he eventually makes so much money he has no idea what to actually do with it, or even where to put it. The problem is that such large amounts of money tends to attract the wrong attention, and also has the habit to attracting freeloaders and blackmailers. On the other hand, such huge amounts of money also has the ability to buy friends, and to make others simply look the other way. Mind you, it was rather interesting to see so many banks arise in such a small town.<br/><br/>The other interesting thing about the film was that it looked behind the curtain of the whole Sandanista affair – the Sandanistas, who were Communists, took control of Nicuagrua, and as a result the American government did its best to try and covertly overthrow them. The thing was that it had to be covert because the government, and the people, weren't all that keen on a war. In fact, what is interesting is that the American people seem to have an aversion to war, and the government tries to do what it can to sway them otherwise.<br/><br/>I also thought it was rather cute to be introduced to a number of characters that were well known during the Eighties, and some not-so well known. One interesting character was the son of the then Vice-President, who isn't named but does make a couple of comments to drop some hints as to who he actually is. However, the one thing the film seems to be about are the excesses of the intelligence community, and the suggestion that they are more well connected to the shadows of organised crime than meets the eye. The other thing is how they simply seem to bumble around everywhere, and even though the operation turns out to be a complete failure, the operative still gets a promotion.<br/><br/>In the end it all comes down to plausible deniability, something that Reagan was an expert at (though we should also note that Oliver North was dumped right in the deep end). However, I'm not entirely sure how accurate the film is, and I suspect that there is probably a lot of speculation going on. However, it does raise the question of whether it is possible to simply having too much money, though in the case of ill gotten gains, then no doubt the answer is yes."
"rblenheim","10","4","7","17 March 2018"," One of 2017's most underrated films is a great entertainment
","Doug Liman's entertaining ""American Made"" tells the somewhat true story of Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot, who, during the 1980's, was 'coerced' into flying spy missions for the CIA before becoming a drug smuggler for a Colombian drug cartel. Then, to avoid prison, he becomes an informant for the DEA, and winds up slipping further and further into a complex web of nefarious enterprises that makes it virtually impossible for him to get out of. <br/><br/>Playing Seal with a flippant sarcasm, Tom Cruise displays the multi-leveled range of a superior character actor, but what really makes this film work is Liman's tightrope-balancing act between outrageous humor and the serious, even dangerous, reality of Seal's situation. In fact, the film brings to mind the best of Martin Scorsese's work, e.g., ""Goodfellas"", or, more precisely, Scorsese's less accomplished ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Particularly notable is the film's digital photography that employs an exaggerated sun-drenched color saturation to the point of comic-book surrealism. <br/><br/>Although taking liberty with the facts (Seal did not crash-land into a suburban neighborhood), this is a cinematic ride that ranks with the best action thrillers of recent years. And how it eventually leads into the Iran-Contra criminal escapades of the Reagan Administration in 1986 should provide an eye-opening history lesson to viewers who may not know much about that shady era in American history. (Interesting trivia: Cruise actually does his own flying in the film.) A first-rate entertainment, and Liman's career best."

"Quinoa1984","8","5","10","8 October 2017"," Cruise the Gringo
","I don't know if Doug Liman only needs to make Tom Cruise movies from now one, but the reverse is probably true: Edge of Tomorrow and now American Made are the two stand-out Cruise movies since he last paired with Spielberg in 2005 (I mean to say that movies that aren't franchises not named Mission Impossible, those 4 and 5 sequels are a lot of fun, but not much beyond the surface entertainment). Barry Seale offers Cruise a thing that feels almost fresh for him in this day and age like... An arc to his chsrzcter (how about that! Development even if its in smaller doses) But it's also impressive how Seals is a genuinely nice and cool-but-not-completely cool films; if this was done 30 years ago, I could picture Burt Reynolds in this kind of character: the wholly charismatic, polite, sometimes befuddled but confident southern gent who is also a criminal bastard.<br/><br/>Will it win awards? Eh no, but it doesn't need to be that either. Maybe its from coming off of the worst Cruise movie in recent memory, The Mummy, but that's not it, or just it. Liman finds an extremely loose shooting style, maybe *too* loose, where his camera is off kilter at many times, but at the same time it isn't incoherent in the mis en scene of it. It has a purpose; we are in the period of late 70s and early 80s chaos but its a chaos that is... Well, sort of half sanctioned by the united states government. We shouldn't be able to believe the story Seale leaves for us - in a typical but fine fashion that does work into the final act of the film in a clever way, or clever-er than usual as far as what Seale is needing to do - but we do, and there's an underlying satire to it all that cant help but make it feel less like another Blow or Infiltrator (though some carry over of DNA is here from that) than a more Southern-baked, less hedonistic Wolf of Wall Street. In other words, it's often wildly funny and twisted, but it is about something very real at the core: American imperialism and exceptionalism.<br/><br/>It tickles me to think of all those people in the American heartland who love Tom Cruise coming to what they think is another fun mindless thriller, and it indicts a hero to many in America, Ronald Reagan, who they either forget or choose to ignore was involved directly snd indirectly in a lot of criminal s***. Its almost like you cant help but like or even love Seale and by extention Cruise: hes not fully a drug trafficker and hes not personally training the Contras. He's the guy that gets your stuff from point A to B. Thank goodness Cruise took this movie on!"

","Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal. A man who works for the CIA, as well as a man who was very sneakily smuggling drugs in and out of the USA. I thought the concept was really clever, and he managed to do it was really well thought out. The problem with this movie is it doesn't really go into much detail of character.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that Tom Cruise's performance was spot on and it's best performance in years. Way better than in that horrible movie ""The Mummy."" Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) has kids to feed as well as pleasing his beautiful wife Lucy Seal (Sarah Wright). They are so many huge areas that could have been explored here, but instead they cut corners and just focus on the drug smuggling, and how he does it. It's like they just said ""How these people feel doesn't matter and it's not the focus."" But it should have been. The problem here is that Tom Cruise does not much to work on with his lines. He could have had a very emotional scene with his wife and kids or with anybody, but there's no emotion in any of these people. That's one of the main problems with this film, and the fact that no one had a background made it worse.<br/><br/>All that aside, it's Tom Cruise's best acting job in a long time, and how he smuggles in the drugs is exceptionally clever! I always wandered how they do it...now I know the secret! See it for Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise fans will not be disappointed! 3/5 stars. Jay from the Autistic Reviewers."
"adrian-43767","9","6","13","31 August 2017"," Better than I had expected

His direction is steady, intelligent, sensitive in extracting Cruise's greatest performance to date, and also very effective in action sequences, and in finding humor in all manner of situations that are usually not any reason to laugh. He even manages to get hardboiled drug smugglers like Pablo Escobar to sound jocund, and that's no mean achievement!<br/><br/>Liman also makes extremely intelligent use of speeches by Presidents Carter and Reagan, giving the movie a firm time capsule.<br/><br/>Cruise I had never, until today, rated a serious actor. Today, I saw real quality, experience, and even spontaneity in his acting. It is a wonderful performance that does much to keep the film firmly anchored in reality in spite of all the unusual goings-on involving state, police, drug barons, and all manner of criminals - plus his ever enlarging family.<br/><br/>American MADE is superbly photographed and its soundtrack is, in turns, inspired, appropriate, and unobtrusive, allowing the viewer to stay tuned into the action.<br/><br/>It is also a cautionary tale, which even carries a Nancy Reagan snippet about not smoking, drinking alcohol or consumming drugs -- and, of course, not getting involved with anything that breaks the law and leaves you exposed to recruitment by state institutions that will exploit you to the marrow, among other perils. <br/><br/>Barry Seal made the wrong choice to begin with, and once he did he was, willingly and otherwise, pulled further and further into the quicksands of state and criminal opportunism. Hopefully, this will resonate with the youth, in particular: avoid that first step that breaks the law. <br/><br/>In light of all the positives above, I give this movie 9 stars out of 10."

","Based on / inspired by true events, this movie augments the grimness of drug trafficking and covert operations involving civilians, and unravels the perils caused by a combination of boredom and an unchecked thirst for adventure. Doug Liman has artfully converted a serious storyline into an entertainer. The vintage cinematography very boldly displays accentuated colors, which underscores the seriousness of the story even through seemingly lighthearted scenes. And Tom Cruise has delivered yet another classic performance as a cavalier pilot (reminds you of something?). The screenplay is decent but the camera work can at times feel nauseating. The cast did a good job, but those depicting the drug cartel were less compelling (""Narcos"" has set a very high bar here...). Overall, an enjoyable, must-see entertainer."
"trublu215","4","10","27","11 September 2017"," American Made is conventional Hollywood biopic filmmaking
","American Made tells the story of Barry Seal, the pilot who transported drugs for Pablo Escobar from Columbia to the States. Seal was a crafty, good looking guy with a golden tongue that allowed him to operate as freely as he did. But just as crafty as Seal was, he was a daredevil. While Seal's life story is surely interesting enough to sustain a film, American Made is merely tipping the hat at conventional filmmaking and never really tries to do anything different to distinguish it from other crime films. And being directed by Doug Liman makes it feel like that much more of a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>American Made, while being conventional, is also very watchable. Tom Cruise brings everything Tom Cruise to the role where it is hard to distinguish whether Barry Seal was actually like this or if Tom Cruise thinks he is still playing Ethan Hunt. For me, I didn't see anything distinguishable from Cruise other than a half baked accent. This is especially frustrating because Tom Cruise can act and he can act better than most working actors. The problem is, his film choices have limited him to one liners and bombastic stunts. Not that I don't appreciate his work, I simply don't appreciate it in this film because it feels like Cruise is just getting by. I think he was an absolute miscast. The rest of the cast does well but we barely see them enough to make an opinion of them as we are with Seal for the majority of the movie which becomes exhausting.<br/><br/>Overall, American Made is a very conventional crime drama that makes sense for Hollywood to make. Unfortunately, those looking for a dark and gritty telling of Seal's life will be sorely disappointed as the film is the definition of conventional and plays rather light despite its dark ending. Tom Cruise makes the best out of his role and makes sure that he has more fun than anyone else...including its audience. American Made is a taxing film that relies on the star power of Tom Cruise rather than relying on the heft of its true story to carry it."

The drug war at the time was not a comedy, but Cruise did his best to make it a comedy. The entire film was laughable in its lack of credibility and overblown Hollywood stupidity. It was obviously made for action film-loving teens and other dumb Cruise fans to satisfy their need for a Tom fix, not to make a credible and realistic story.

","American Made is much more a comedy than anything else.

The main focus of the movie is that Seal get so successful that he has major problems to hide all his money, which lead to some comical effects. In one scene it literally floods out of a closet when Seal opens the door, and other times the dog digs it up when they buried it in the yard. Added to that is the hide and seek games he plays with different agencies, and even Seals eventual demise is joked about.<br/><br/>Real action is scarce, and suspense is not included at all.

"bob the moo","Null","2","3","5 June 2018"," Inconsistent in what it does but still manages to be broadly entertaining
","Pilot Barry Seal is recruited by the CIA to run a covert operation flying into South America; quickly he gets in deeper and deeper, with money flowing in all directions but significant risk with it.<br/><br/>Considering this is a Tom Cruise film, I was surprised how quickly it came and went from the cinemas in the UK. Based on a true story, the film rattles through the plot with a Goodfellas air but an inconsistent control of what it is trying to do and how it is trying to do it. It is a caper to be sure, and it has a broad humor to it; but at the same time it does have consequences and real drama behind it. It tries to do both of these things but it doesn't manage it. As a result the dirty, greasy heat of the drama knocks the swagger out of the fun, while the broad sense of caper it tries to deliver makes it feel disconnected from the stakes and realism of the drama. While both sort of work, neither really work that well.<br/><br/>Cruise is equally in two places. On one hand I thought he played it really well and convinced in his performance, but at the same time he never stopped being Tom Cruise with his winning smile and slick ways; it broke me out of the character too much and too often. The supporting cast has plenty of talent in there too, but the fast pace and slightly superficial story-telling means nobody ever has time to bed in and make something of their characters outside of Cruise. Production values are high and do well to give the film a sense of time and place with design and delivery.<br/><br/>Overall though, it is a fairly forgettable film that tries hard but doesn't convince. You can see the goals of Goodfellas and Wolf of Wall Street, but it doesn't get close and generally undercuts itself with inconsistency in what it is doing."

","The makers of the based-on-a-true-story black comedy ""American Made"" fail to satisfactorily answer one pressing question: why is CIA operative and Colombia drug-runner Barry Seal's story being told as a movie and not a book? What's being shown in this film that couldn't also be expressed in prose?<br/><br/>In telling the true story of American airplane pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise), writer Gary Spinelli and director Doug Liman (""Edge of Tomorrow,"" ""Jumper"") choose to overstimulate viewers rather than challenge them. They emphasize Barry's charm, the exotic nature of his South American trade routes, and the rapid escalation of events that ultimately led to his downfall. Cruise's smile is, in this context, deployed like a weapon in Liman and Spinelli's overwhelming charm offensive. You don't get a lot of psychological insight into Barry's character, or learn why he was so determined to make more money than he could spend, despite conflicting pressures from Pablo Escobar's drug cartel and the American government to either quit or collude.<br/><br/>But you do get a lot of shots of Cruise grinning from behind aviator glasses in extreme close-ups, many of which are lensed with hand-held digital cameras that show you the wilds of Nicaragua and Colombia through an Instagram-cheap green/yellow filter. ""American Made"" may be superficially a condemnation of the hypocritical American impulse to take drug suppliers' money with one hand and chastise users with the other. But it's mostly a sensational, sub-""Wolf of Wall Street""-style true crime story that attempts to seduce you, then abandon you.<br/><br/>The alarming pace of Barry's narrative, designed to put Cruise's charisma front and center, keeps viewers disoriented. It's often hard to understand Barry's motives beyond caricature-broad assumptions about his (lack of) character. In 1977, Barry agrees to fly over South American countries and take photos of suspected communist groups using a spy plane provided by shadowy CIA pencil-pusher Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson). Barry is impulsive, or so we're meant to think based on an incident where he wakes up a sleeping co-pilot by abruptly sending a commercial airliner into a nosedive. This scene may explain why Barry grins like a lunatic as he explains to his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) that he'll figure out a way to pay out of pocket for his family's health insurance once he opens an independent shipping company called ""IAC"" (Get it? IAC - CIA?).<br/><br/>Barry's impetuousness does not, however, explain why he flies so low to land when he takes his photographs. Or why he doesn't immediately reach out to Schafer when he's kidnapped and forced by Escobar (Mauricio Mejia) and his Cartel associates to deliver hundreds of pounds of cocaine to the United States. Or why Barry thinks so little of his wife and kids that he packs their Louisiana house up one night without explanation, and moves them to a safe-house in Arkansas. There's character-defining insanity, and then there's ""this barely makes sense in the moment when it is happening"" crazy. Barry often appears to be the latter kind of nutbar.<br/><br/>There are two types of people in ""American Made"": the kind that work and the kind that get worked over. It's easy to tell the two apart based on how much screen-time Spinelli and Liman devote to each character. Schafer, for example, is defined by the taunts he suffers from a fellow cubicle drone and his own tendency to over-promise. Schafer doesn't do real work-not in the filmmakers' eyes. The same is true of Escobar and his fellow dealers, who are treated as lawless salesmen of an unsavory product. And don't get me started on JB (Caleb Landry Jones), Lucy's lazy, Gremlin-driving, under-age-girl-dating, Confederate-flag-waving redneck brother.<br/><br/>But what about Lucy? She keeps Barry's family together, but her feelings are often taken for granted, even when she calls Barry out for abandoning her suddenly in order to meet up with Schafer. Barry responds by throwing bundles of cash at his wife's feet. The argument, and the scene end just like that, like a smug joke whose punchline might as well be, There's no problem that a ton of cash can't solve.<br/><br/>""American Made"" sells a toxic, shallow, anti-American Dream bill of goods for anybody looking to shake their head about exceptionalism without seriously considering what conditions enable that mentality. Spinelli and Liman don't say anything except, Look at how far a determined charmer can go if he's greedy and determined enough. They respect Barry too much to be thoughtfully critical of him. And they barely disguise their fascination with broad jokes that tease Barry's team of hard-working good ol' boys and put down everyone else.<br/><br/>Sure, it's important to note that Barry ultimately meets a just end, one that's been prescribed to thousands of other would-be movie gangsters. But you can easily shrug off a little finger-wagging at the end of a movie that treats you to two hours of Tom Cruise charming representatives of every imaginable US institution (they don't call in the Girl Scouts, the Golden Girls or the Hulk-busters, but I'm sure they're in a director's cut). If there is a reason, good or bad, that ""American Made"" is a movie, it's that you can't be seduced by the star of ""Top Gun"" in a book."

","The plot is loosely based on the real story of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who worked for the CIA and also as a drug and weapons smuggler.<br/><br/>Cruise is in top form as Barry, the reckless pilot who abandons the safe but boring job of airline pilot to embark on a little spying. The aerial photographing of Central America soon turns into more dangerous assignments, reaching the point of no return when Barry starts working for the Medellin cartel.<br/><br/>Weapons smuggling is added into the mix, together with training Nicaraguan Contras. It's a major political mess, during which Barry manages to earn huge amounts of cash, for which he must find creative hiding places (think Breaking Bad, but funnier).<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly edited, with an authentic feeling for the period (it takes place between the end of the 70s and 1986).

Guys who are in bed with the CIA, Noriega, Escobar and everybody else. Guys who go from a modest salary to monopolising the local bank's main vault just for their money because they've run out of places to store it in their mansion.<br/><br/>Okay, so Hollywood takes liberties with the truth for artistic licence and while this film really takes liberties, having read American Desperado and other books about the Medellin Cartel, Barry Seal's life is well documented and every bit as crazy as the film makes out. With such people, one wonders how the hell they survive day to day but eventually, everyone's luck runs out. Even if you do dodge 30 years in prison to work for the White House.<br/><br/>American Made is gloriously excessive, brilliant fun and wildly entertaining. There's no complicated plot, subtext or layers of meaning to unravel; sometimes, all you need from a film is good old fashioned escapism and an insight into the life of a man who ended up getting community service when he was hoping, nay, praying for prison.

","It's not particularily high budget or (on release) well publicised, but this is another good film starring Tom Cruise. A little bit different to the usual shooting and car chases. Following the life of an airline pilot that pitfalls his way into the deep state. First taking spy photos and then as a drug smuggler. This is a neat little film and there is not much time to feel bored. Everything happens pretty fast and at times the story suffers from a few parts where you have to fill in the blanks yourself. But I really enjoyed this film overall and it has a few funny scenes too. It is not a hugely political (propaganda) film and actually a fairly honest portrayal of South American drug smugglers and the immoral American facilitators. It is not a left wing film that is basically blaming Americans for everything, which is nice because if it had been it would have been terrible. These are all criminals and immoral people and the film isn't too worried about showing these characters as dangerous. No doubt the real life counterparts were extremely dangerous. This is portrayed brilliantly by Cruise's character having guns pointed at him every time he touches down in a cartel jungle hideout.<br/><br/>The CIA handler in this film is also quite funny. He is very well versed in 'thief' speak and does not give anything away. Not even his real name as the movie ends! Also the guy who plays Escobar looks so like the real Escobar I was wondering at times if the real Escobar had never actually gone to jail and played his own part! The ending is a little bit predictable but is also a very emotional one for the viewer. I don't want to give too much away there. All in all a good watch"
"Thanos_Alfie","7","1","1","3 January 2019"," What a pilot...
","""American Made"" is a Biography - Action movie in which we watch an ordinary pilot who was working for TWA before he was recruited by the CIA. Since he was very good at his jobs in South America the Medellín Cartel, associated with Pablo Escobar recruited him because they needed a person with his exceptional skills. With all of these jobs, he became a drug trafficker, gun smuggler, and money launderer and he received the title, 'The gringo that always delivers'.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it was based on a true story so, it had a very interesting plot and many good action scenes. It also combined and connected very well some points of Medellín Cartel with Barry Seal and the jobs they did together. Regarding the direction of the movie which was made by Doug Liman I believe that it was very good since he succeeded in making this movie so interesting and with many unexpected surprises and scenes. About the interpretations, I have to admit that Tom Cruise who played as Barry Seal was simply amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarah Wright's who played as Lucy Seal and Domhnall Gleeson's who played as Monty 'Schafer'.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""American Made"" is a nice movie with many good action scenes, an interesting plot and many good interpretations. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to like it. If you are a fan of action movies which are based on true stories or events then this is the movie you have to watch."

","I never heared of Barry Seal before, but now that I saw the movie/biography I won't forget about him. The least you can say about his story is that it is quite incredible. Incredible because of the things he got away with, big major crimes. But then again nothing surprises me anymore as you know that politicians, judges and all the so-called high elite are all corrupted. There is a law for the rich and a law for the poor and this movie is the perfect example of it. The fact that the movie is based on a true story makes it even better because you can better relate to it and understand more about how everything worked at that time. The only bad thing I could say about this movie/biography is that they should just stick to the facts like they happened and not embellish anything. At one point all major law enforcements like the FBI, CIA, ATF, DEA and the State Police all try to bust somebody at the same time without knowing about eachother's plans. That I am sure never happened. It's the only minor point that bugged me a bit. For the rest the filming was good, there was the right amount of suspense, the cast was good, aspecially Tom Cruise as the major character. It's an incredible story, that sometimes makes you wonder how the hell this all could have happened."
"Tkbn3812","8","1","1","24 December 2017"," Impressive story and stunning acting from Tom Cruise
","Tom Cruise continues to prove his worth as an A-List actor in this film based on the true story of Barry Seal, an American Pilot turned DEA agent and drug smuggler in the 70s-80s. The film can be praised for the brilliant acting from Tom Cruise, as well as the telling of the story in an organic yet simple manner, taking the viewers across a decade of Seal's life seamlessly.<br/><br/>Having watched many Tom Cruise films, such as the Mission: Impossible movies and Edge Of Tomorrow, I had high expectations watching American Made. The film definitely did not disappoint. Even though the film is not so action-heavy like most Tom Cruise films, Tom Cruise plays his character of Barry Seal, a smug man way in over his head who, on more than one occasion, bites of more than he can chew. It's a little jarring to hear Tom with a southern twang, and at times he has a bit of difficulty maintaining it, reverting to whatever his natural accent is (I'm not American so the difference is probably more obvious to Americans). Still, other than the twang there's really nothing to fault about Tom's acting.<br/><br/>Doug Liman, who has previously worked with Tom Cruise, directs the film very well, giving it an almost indie, homely feel at times. Shaky cameras and quick transitions between scenes help to evoke this. His choice to have Barry Seal narrating at times does seem a little strange at times, mainly since it's not nearly frequent or consistent enough. Still, the choice to give the film this more indie look is quite clever, especially given that the film's material is based around a simple man.<br/><br/>Personally I thought the film's pacing could have been a little better. Sometimes the film does go a little fast, especially at the start, which holds it back from a 9 or 10 star rating in my opinion. Still, the film is a very quality watch, and I definitely recommend it for action-fans looking for a gripping true story."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","1","29 November 2017"," Surprisingly fun, relaxed attitude for a crime biopic pays off
","Next up in the lengthy cinematic lineage of based-on-true-stories centered on quirky characters that rise to fortune through shady means and then come crashing down is ""American Made."" The latest collaboration between Doug Liman and Tom Cruise (who previously made ""The Edge of Tomorrow"") has a similar fun, energetic pace and goes down smooth — the Budweiser of historical biopics, or perhaps something with a notch more flavor.<br/><br/>Cruise stars as Barry Seal, an airline pilot recruited by the CIA to gather intel and fly contraband to Central and South American countries rebelling against communist regimes. It doesn't take long, however, for Seal to realize he can use their cover and protections to smuggle cocaine for his new acquaintances atop the Columbian drug cartel. Between the CIA's paycheck and his drug money, Seal begins to make more cash than he and his wife, Lucy (Sarah Wright) know what to do with.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance contains his signature fervor, but even though he plays a pilot, his default action hero affect is well-disguised as Seal, a thrill-seeking southerner who isn't smart but who's definitely not stupid. It's a fun role, and Cruise channels his underrated comedy instincts to create a likable character. He only gets a couple different notes to work with in the film, but he hits them.<br/><br/>The film shakes out as about 80 percent entertainment, 20 percent drama (and that's being generous to drama), but either way it's clear why Gary Spinelli's script made the Blacklist of top undeveloped screenplays, especially given the story is steeped in political context but isn't adapted from a singular source. Rather than deliver a two-and-a-half-hour biopic, Spinelli keeps things moving with a lot of pithy dialogue and brief snippets/windows into Seal's experiences (smartly conducted by Liman). We're familiar with this rise-and-fall narrative, so Spinelli opts to give us the highlights and moments that illustrate how over the top and around the law the whole scenario was.<br/><br/>Liman's action instincts (he also directed the first ""Bourne"" film) serve him well here as he brings a degree of style and excitement, as if at any moment something big could happen. At the least, he provides a great filmmaking lesson in how to effectively make a montage. The film's swift pacing necessitates that skill, but there's also a lot of good stuff being communicated in these scenes as opposed to the typical montage, which usually is little more than a stylized transition from point A to point B. <br/><br/>One central montage occurs once the Seals move to Mena, Arkansas and Barry's operation really takes off. We get bits and pieces of the whole process and one of the film's challenges is to show the accumulation of wealth. There are only so many ways to show this, but Barry's wife getting frustrated when she can't find a pair of heels because every other shoebox is stuffed with money provides a unique detail that really conveys the ridiculousness of their financial situation.<br/><br/>""American Made"" strings together these clever moments and that's what makes it such an easy watch. Cruise's non-serious performance also gives us permission to relax, enjoy and appreciate the story's likely exaggerations of the truth because of the perspective they put on the United States' unwise meddling in these countries during the '70s and '80s. It could have easily gone the heavyweight route and still been a great film, but the lightweight approach will give it a longer shelf life with a wider audience.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

Cruise is well-suited for the role, and he turns in arguably his best performance of the decade. The rest of the decently large cast ranges from competent to very good, but it's really only Cruise that gets the proper screen time and character depth to carry the movie, and he does very well.<br/><br/>Doug Liman directs the movie in his usual fast-paced style, but with dealings (drug, arms, and otherwise) taking place of the prototypical action/fight scenes. The intensity of this film comes from Cruise's Barry Seal, and the situations he manages to find himself in, rather than your standard action fare. The movie mixes comedy with intensity, as Seal finds himself in increasingly richer as he takes on more dangerous scenarios. Liman does very well with this style, and it gives the movie an interesting aesthetic - almost like The Wolf of Wall Street if directed by Kathryn Bigelow. <br/><br/>For me, this is one of the biggest surprises of the year. I personally thought the trailers made this film look incredibly generic, like a typical action rehash.

This is a movie that unravels the harsh realities of a story line that's definitely too good to be true, and it's based on a true story. You've definitely seen this style of filmmaking many times throughout the years, but director Doug Liman brings a fun, as well as visceral accompaniment to this crazy premise. I can't say that I loved it, but here is why it's still a great film that's worth seeing in theatres. <br/><br/>Not knowing the conclusion of the events that actually happened definitely helps when watching a film that's based on a true story, but I have to admit, this is a story that has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, even if you already know how the story ends. As Barry Seal leaves his day job as a pilot, he's recruited to work for the CIA, where he must deliver drugs and guns to cartels in the south. If that notion alone doesn't peak your interest, I'll just say that he's given opportunities that will have you either shaking your head and smiling about how things work out for him, or being scared and along for the ride due to his choices. There are surprises around every corner, which is why this movie works so well. <br/><br/>When being a smuggler, no matter how hard or often you must travel, a family life is always going to be a struggle when you're dealing with the drug cartel, there's no way around that. What worked out for this film was the fact that the clichés of kidnapping family members never happened throughout the true story, so you won't find yourself rolling your eyes, thinking the film is coming up with a way to manipulate the story. Sure, there are other surprises that I won't spoil for you, but if there's one thing I can compliment this film on, it's the fact that it's original. That being said, hardly any film is perfect, and where I feel American Made may annoy some people, is its happy- go-lucky feel throughout 80% of its duration. <br/><br/>I'm all for a film trying to have fun and lighten the mood, but when a film that should be taking itself seriously, fails to hardly ever do that, I found myself wondering if the consequences even mattered. Yes, Cruise delivers a noteworthy performance once again, and the secondary cast all play off him wonderfully, but I found myself wondering where the stakes were at times, due to the fact that Barry always seemed to make the best out of a bad situation. This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film itself, but it distracted me more than enough to slightly harm my experience with the movie as a whole. <br/><br/>In the end, there isn't much to complain about here if I'm being honest, but like I mentioned, it's filmmaking that you've seen many times before, with some questionable editing choices in its quick cuts or fast zoom-ins, and the fact that the tone is a little too happy for the story at hand. Still, the premise is interesting throughout, the surprises are worth the price of admission alone, and Doug Liman directs this film as well as any other that he's put his touch on in the past. American Made won't be winning any awards this year, but it's a really enjoyable time at the movies and I highly recommend checking it out."

"Troy_Campbell","6","5","13","26 August 2017"," Solid crime-comedy yarn
","Based on a story that would be completely unbelievable if it wasn't true, this crime-comedy yarn follows commercial pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) as he undertakes work for the CIA, the Medellin Cartel, and the White House. Often all at once. Not taking itself too seriously—murder, drug smuggling and civil wars all casually occurring with little on screen consequence—this flick is operating in strange moral territory where our protagonist is presented as a kinda-hero living the American dream. It coasts by largely on charm and light-hearted hijinks, with director Doug Liman delivering a spate of stylish filmmaking flourishes to create an exuberant atmosphere of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll that glosses over the moral murkiness. It helps that Cruise is in top gear; his Barry is excitable but level-headed, devious but likable, jokey but intelligent. It's a nice return to form after the excruciatingly bad The Mummy earlier this year. Yet overall the film doesn't quite elevate from good to great. From a comedy perspective it's amusing but lacking laugh-out-loud moments, as a thriller it's occasionally tense without being nail-biting, and as a biopic it's interesting yet never enthralling. A solid truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tale despite failing to truly excel, American Made is a fun and breezy viewing best served by lowered expectations."

","""American Made"" is the true story of Barry Seal, played by Tom Cruise, who was a former pilot turned drug smuggler and become an informant for the DEA in the 1980s. I was really looking forward to this movie since it had Tom Cruise in it, but I was ultimately let down by an excruciatingly slow pace and a movie that felt really rushed. I don't agree with the critics on this one. <br/><br/>I will say this, the movie is very well directed and most of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, which to me is different for a drama. Director Doug Liman has proved before that he can use hand-held camera the proper way and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise also delivers an award worthy performance. This is him unhinged, and probably the best I've ever seen him. You could even say he's on Cruise control.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie just fell really flat for me. This film has really poor pacing, as it felt both rushed and a lot longer than it felt. There are a lot of time jumps and it really doesn't give the film a chance to breathe. There is really no intro tot he film as well, which I know there are other movies out there that just jump right into the thick of things, but I felt I needed some more background information as to what the situation was and who the character was. There was no emotional tug at the heartstrings in this film for me.<br/><br/>This movie's lack of a musical score also made the film feel a lot longer than it was. Sure there is a soundtrack in the background in some scenes, and I'm not expecting some epic, blockbuster musical score to go with a movie like this, but the films I find slow are the ones with a lack of musical score at most times. <br/><br/>I am going to give ""American Made"" a C.<br/><br/>Check out my review of ""American Made"" on YouTube for a more in depth analysis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw4ddqed5VE"

","Although the movie makers claim that this film is based on real events, the only real thing in this movie is the fact that there was a pilot with the name Barry Seal. The rest is the pure and simple fantasy. 
The script writer has the right for developing fantasy. But what Nancy and Ronald Reagan do here? What colonel North is doing in the drug smuggling history? 
This movie is so politically charged that no room for art was left. It is schematic,chaotic, unbelievable, primitive and not worth watching."
"svhot","10","3","7","24 October 2017"," Award-Worthy Performance from Tom Cruise in a True Story Film
","""American Made"" is the best American movie I have seen this year. There are a number of factors / reasons that I am saying so. The first reason is that Tom Cruise has given an outstanding performance in this masterpiece movie. Cruise plays real-life pilot Barry Seal, who is hired by the CIA in a covert operation against smugglers (and other ""enemies"" of the state), from the year 1978 up till 1986. The hero / anti-hero nature of Barry Seal is portrayed with perfection on screen by Tom Cruise. Tom plays the character with such style, skill, panache ,wit and dare-devilry that you will never want this movie to end. He has given a rare blend of intensity and fun to his character in this movie.<br/><br/>The second reason why I loved this movie so much is because the director Doug Liman, has made a very well crafted film that shines and is definitely superior than the other flicks of its time. Mr Liman has managed to fully capture the atmosphere and style of the period during which this true story transpired - 1978 to 1986. The color palette of every scene in ""American Made"" has been given the 70s-80s look and feel. All the buildings shown, the cars used, the technology, and the clothes worn by actors have been utilized correctly to represent the style and trends of that time. Mr Doug Liman has garnished this movie with a ""sweet amount"" of fun and wit, which further increases its attraction factor / quotient.<br/><br/>The entire star-cast have given good performances. Apart from Cruise's acting, the other two actors who have shined brightly in ""American Made"" are D. Gleeson (who plays Barry's CIA handler) , and Sarah Wright Olsen (who plays Barry's wife). Although Sarah did not get a lot of scenes, she is a real scene-stealer. She can make you laugh or cry by just using her facial expressions, as she did in a few scenes with Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>I have to stop here, otherwise my review will become too long, and might not be accepted. I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for movies because intriguing stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes - I really mean it, literally !!!!).

","American Made or Mena is an amazingly sublime, beautiful movie and it's worth the money. Tom Cruise - who is still on the top of his game - really hit it out of the park and he knows how to do comedy especially when playing an anti-hero like Barry Seal and his penchant for doing stunts has no boundaries that's why they look real and keep you on the edge of your seat. American Made also highlights the corrupted politicians and CIA officials who played a role in the Contras and shaped the politics of that era during the Cold War. Tom deserves his long-awaited Oscar for portraying someone like Barry in this film along with Doug Liman who is a talented filmmaker and his father was one of the prosecutors in the Iran-Contra Affair. I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars because it's very underrated."

","Tom Cruise back flying planes again? I'm down for that even if there isn't any Kenny Loggins to vibe to. He's had a terrible time this year starring in the ill-fated The Mummy, so I was hoping for something better this time around. A very positive instrument for the film was having Doug Liman at the helm. I'm a fan of him so had faith that this would entertain. Overall, its not amazing but is decent enough with a typically good Tom Cruise character performance.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of Barry Seals, the former pilot who gets hired by the CIA to initially get surveillance photos in Central America. However, Seals soon gets drawn into the life of transporting drugs, goods, and weapons to armies and different dealers. He becomes affiliated with the Medellin Cartel and starts doing business with Pablo Escobar. Things get out of hand and he becomes wanted by the FBI and DEA. Seals becomes rich but the costs that come with it become overbearing.<br/><br/>The thing I like about Liman is he can work a decent script and works well in close quarters with a minimalist script (this is me basically praising The Wall). I found the events of the film interesting and a bit astonishing, especially if all the government agencies got involved in the ordeal the way the film portrays. Tom Cruise is good in it and makes it worth the watch even when the film falters. His cockiness and energy given to the performance is a strong point.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in the film and you have to keep up with the things Seals is told to do. I found Domhnall Gleeson's ""agent"" character mysteriously enticing, though was sad to hear that there's no real factual basis for the role. Overall, its not exactly a must see but a committed Cruise performance and rich real life basis makes the film a positive viewing experience.<br/><br/>7/10"

","For a moment I thought we might be in for some biting political commentary, like Brad Pitt's 'War Machine' which delivered exactly that with a real healthy does of realism which I was hoping it might be a new trend from Hollywood but no, sadly it was the opposite of that. The moral imperative appears to be that it's OK to break any law you want if 1) it makes you rich and 2) especially if you're doing it for the 'Merican military. We just love money, you benefit, your family benefits (always good, you can do ANYTHING for your family in Hollywood) and in this case, the local community benefits as well, especially the banks. And that's all that matters. There is no admission that the social consequences of these crimes are really, really odious and those agencies that Merica does have that are suppose to enforce 'law and order' are easily overridden for the sake of political expediency. Justice is clearly defeated. Those agencies are also portrayed as 'stuffed shirt', the well dressed female prosecutor spends time adjusting her skirt before she speaks... It might have been a very different movie if Ron Howard had directed it, but alas, he didn't. So instead of taking the opportunity to highlight US government corruption (which continues unabated today - see War Machine) - we celebrate self interest and invoke rock music, 'caddies' and some good old fashioned Southern slime. We are left with the impression that it's only those foreign agent drug cartels that are bad. They spoilt everything, except the ending. They couldn't do anything about the ending other than take the blame for it. How convenient. Having said that, obviously I was expecting too much of Cruise, but he does deliver a great performance, youthful, energetic, ebullient, just what the role needed. Gleeson too, passes himself off as young, relatively inexperienced operative learning to negotiate the waves of success and failure at the CIA - but at least the movie, however fleetingly, did expose the wholesale brutality and coercion that the CIA really does inflict on people to make them follow orders, without which they would have no 'ASSETS'..."

","Even if you didn't read about Barry Seal or see Dennis Hopper as Barry Seal in 1991. movie, it's obvious that this movie is taking artistic freedom in depicting these events. Seal was a DEA informant who ""touched base"" w/CIA, yet in this Tom Cruise movie, he's an informal CIA agent who's playing a cat-and-mouse game w/DEA. Sure, writers were smart to base the movie on Seal's ""self made testimony videos"" (invented for this purpose) and he does have the liberty to tell his story however he likes. But, it doesn't help much, smart as it is.<br/><br/>If you disregard that, you have an interesting comedy which deals with serious things, yet mostly uses them to get some (funny) ""what the hell"" reaction.<br/><br/>While Tom Cruise would be a bad choice to play a more realistic version of Barry Seal and Dennis Hopper did a _much_ better job there, Cruise is actually better suited for this comedic interpretation. He did a good job. There's not much to do for other actors, who mostly do their job ""good enough"".<br/><br/>It has a rarely seen structure for a comedy, with a high point in the middle, accompanied by ""Classic Music Greatest Hits"", including the William Tell Overture, Ode to Joy, etc. Before that, it's too fast paced and not very serious but not very funny either (though it is fun). Afterwards, it's regularly paced and somewhat serious, but more funny (and less fun).<br/><br/>It has very interesting moments, like when FBI agents come to the town of Mena, where Barry has his base of operations, only to find that the small town's main street is filled with luxurious local banks (in which Seal has deposited most of his money). It's a perfect scene for a movie, where just showing you this view, with no words, you get everything you need to know.<br/><br/>There were many missed opportunities to put a more interesting, if less fun or funny, light on these events and that is one of the main reasons why this movie isn't as good as it can be. Other's are that it's directing is somewhat strange, although not without interesting elements and that it has a general feel of a Tom Cruise vehicle, rather than a ""regular movie"". But, it's good enough."

","Tom Cruise is an interesting actor to me.  He is rock solid when he is doing his action thing in films like EDGE OF TOMORROW or the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series - it doesn't get much better than he is in these films.  It is when he tries to break free from the ""Action Hero"" stereotype that his track record is spotty.  For every MAGNOLIA or TROPIC THUNDER there is an EYES WIDE SHUT or INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.  So how did he do when he went off the beaten path once again in American MADE?<br/><br/>He did just fine.  Not GREAT, not POORLY...he did fine.<br/><br/>And that's the issue with this film - it is ""fine"", where it needed to be ""crazy great"" to succeed.<br/><br/>American MADE tells the ""based on a true story"" tale of Barry Seal a TWA pilot who becomes a pilot for the CIA, he gets in deeper and deeper and, eventually, is the one the leading players in what would become to be known as the Iran-Contra scandal during the Ronald Regan Presidency.<br/><br/>Cruise, on paper, looks like a good choice to play Seal.  He has the swagger and the ""devil-may-care"" attitude that is needed.  What Cruise is lacking, I feel, is to let go of the ""governor"" and just let it fly (kind of like Leonardo DiCaprio in WOLF OF WALL STREET).  Cruise just doesn't do it.  He doesn't let go.  He ""pretends"" to let go, but he never really does.  You can see him trying, yet pulling himself back and it is because of this hesitancy, that his performance, ultimately, doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>He is surrounded by a decent (but not strong) Supporting cast.  Seal's wife is portrayed by Sarah Wright - she is ""fine"", solid but unspectacular.  His CIA handler is portrayed by Domnhall Gleeson and he is ""fine"", solid but unspectacular.  Even the wild and crazy Central American drug lords are portrayed in a ""fine"", but unspectacular fashion.  They needed to let go of the governor like Alfred Molina did in BOOGIE NIGHTS, but they just don't go far enough.<br/><br/>With almost all of the performances going to - but never crossing over - a line, I will lay the blame on the Director, Doug Liman (so good as a Director in EDGE OF TOMORROW).  I don't know if he toned down the vision of this film to appeal to his Studio Bosses or if his sensibilities just didn't allow this film to ""go there"", but whatever it is, the film falls flat where it could have (should have) soared and was a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>This film is ""entertaining enough"" if you go to it, but I wouldn't tell you to rush right out and see this.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  B-<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","From start to finish, director Doug Liman sends us back to the 80's to vicariously live through the high risk high reward lifestyle of Barry Seal in the film American Made. At first, the idea of a cocaine-smuggling pilot who is also employed by the CIA may sound like fiction, but the undeniable Tom Cruise is in the cockpit flying like his life depends on it.
While working as a TWA pilot, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is approached by Montey Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) who works for the CIA and he is looking to recruit a pilot to capture intel on the communists in Central/South America. Not soon after Seal begins working with the CIA, the now infamous Medellin cartel notices Seals frequent visits and the potential to get their new product (cocaine) to the mainland. Soon after, Barry forms strong ties with Pablo Escobar and the Medellin cartel which means lots of cash flow. Meanwhile, the CIA tasks Barry with flying guns to Nicaragua to arm the Contras which leads to flying the Contras back to be trained for battle in a boot camp set up on Barry's land in Mena Arkansas. Barry begins to make so much money from his drug smuggling operation that he doesn't have enough ground to bury it in. This allows his operation to expand by recruiting a team of elite pilots that work for him in his drug smuggling business.
Tom Cruise is not an unfamiliar face in the cockpit of an airplane, as he has appeared in the infamous Top Gun films. But, director Doug Liman seems to cast Cruise for his on screen charisma and his ""catch me if you can"" attitude. Because of Cruises approach to the film, the audience is always vouching for the ""ring that always deliverers"". Combined with the fact that the narration of the film is by Tom Cruise, which occasionally is from the perspective of Barry Seal recording himself on a camcorder reflecting on his journey, is another reason why American Made succeeds in captivating its audience. This style of narration is used as transition cuts as well as foreshadowing in the film. Despite the fact that it's an extremely engaging film, it has to move at a fast pace to be able to captivate the story of Barry Seal in a film setting. This can lead to feeling like you missed something in the plot or just purely that the film jumps around so frequently. It is also prevalent that Seal is a family man and will do whatever it takes to provide for his wife Lucy Seal (Sarah Weight), and their children, which also makes Barry a well-rounded likable character. Doug Liman has directed other action films such as The Bourne Identity films and Edge of Tomorrow which capitalizes on a Sci-fi twist to the action genre that so many adore. The screenwriter Gary Spinelli is able to immediately capture the audience's attention by making it known that this film is based on a true story. As the film progresses further, having the knowledge that these events have truly occurred made me want to continue watching just to see what unfathomable situation Tom Cruise will get himself into next.
It's hard to resist pointing out that Tom Cruise is a big reason why the film is so enjoyable. Whether he is saving the world in the action loaded Mission: Impossible films or traveling cross-country in the drama Rain Man, it is evident that Tom Cruise fully commits to the characters he plays. The photography in American Made such as the warm colored composition when Barry is flying also helps the film convey what the emotional charge of the scene is. This movie was often filmed with a zoom lens, generally on Barry Seal, which enhanced the realistic feeling meant to be portrayed to the audience. Doug Liman was also successful in creating a setting that was essential for that authentic 80's feel to the movie by recreating the style of the architecture and costumes in Arkansas as well as in Southern America. The decision to use real clips of President Regan also provided authenticity because it was able to directly relate to the current situation at that time in the film.
Overall, American Made will keep you on the edge of your seat in disbelief just waiting to see how Barry Seal is able to fly around the never ending dilemmas with seemingly unfavorable odds. Tom Cruise is in his optimal film environment that reinforces the suspense in this ""based on a true story"" film. The portrayal of Barry Seal, his lavish lifestyle, and his personality, is sure to make the audience and to get on a plane and fly back to the 80's."

","""American made"" is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most charming pictures I have ever watched, it adds an incredible one man cast to a flawless direction and an extremely moving story. It stars the one and only Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who finds himself in a turmoil of drug and weapon smuggling, compelled by an opportunist CIA operative who, once pressured by the geopolitical repercussions of their operation, leaves Barry stranded in a violence ravaged central America accused of drug dealing and money laundering. This picture is, in my humble opinion , one of the best depictions of ""the war on drugs"" campaign that was led by the former USA presidency ,a time when central America became the promised land for ones who lack moral qualities and would do whatever it takes to grow as rich as possible before the cocaine fuelled mayhem there could settle down. Amid this human madness was caught Barry seal, a southern family man, whose sole interest was to provide more for him and his family and truly achieve the American dream. But, to the surprise of many, success in that period of global hysteria can only be achieved through illegal activities, something that was more than simple under the inter-continental crisis. as a matter of fact, Barry seal's involvement in these activities is undoubtedly an immoral act for which a legal prosecution is more than merited, selfish and stubborn as seal's actions may seem you can only root for him and support his unlucky adventure, even though we fully comprehend his unforgivable trespass of the law . Is it the charismatic personality of tom Cruise? Or is it just the genuine everyday working class man Doug Liman made him? To be fair, ""American made"" wouldn't be such a good picture without the visionary direction of Mr. Iiman , he is by all means one of Hollywood's finest , with a directorial career that includes among many Mr. and Ms. smith and the Bourne identity , a personal favourite : this picture was so well crafted that it makes you abandon your ethical righteousness in favour of another victim of the injustice system , maybe many are right to think that Barry Seal was a insensible low life criminal , an immoral drug dealer , but according to Doug Liman he was nothing more than a simple man with a big hope , a southern naïve man who was used by an uncaring society , he is an American hero who had his share of mistakes and bad deeds , but he doesn't have to go down in the American history as a dishonest fraud nor as an iconic patriot , he is simply an example of both greed and faith , Barry seal is the American dream made of flesh and blood , a common and calm life that was disturbed by the shallow flashings of wealth , and whose demise was certain the moment he took on the burden of achieving his dream , in the American way."

","American Made (2017)
This is a semi-biographical crime film about a former TWA pilot who flew missions for the CIA and became a drug smuggler for the Medellín Cartel in the 1980s. It stars Tom Cruise, Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Alejandro Edda, Mauricio Mejía, Caleb Landry Jones and Jesse Plemons. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Cruise's performance. It did modestly at the box office. I found the film to be average, worth seeing, but not likely to be viewed again. Cruise was solid, but as expected, considering his talent."

","America has laid claim to determination, grit, and all those other flattering, stubborn character traits. Barry breathes American air, drunk off of patriotic lies plastered in the board approved history books. The almighty United States has a particular skill set for obtaining what it wants.<br/><br/>A nation of opportunity only recycles wealth and power. International bartering becomes an universal language at the start of the eighties. Enemies are housed closer than ever, and meals are served upon the same table. Everyone has to eat, but the cutlery must be handled with immense care.<br/><br/>Barry is a glorified fork. He is the dignified manner by which US intelligence spears up subsistence. Once piloting domestic fares, now cutting through exotic airspace, Barry is escaping the mundane and chasing the fanciful. The thrill of bullets in the cockpit, and radar dodging intoxicates Barry. And a new drug is around the corner.<br/><br/>He re-brands himself as a knife to another allegiance, and begins to sustain opposite foes. The operation benefits him most, his country's enemy second, and his homeland the least. He owes his ingenuity to an American upbringing, and by remaining loyal to this gringo attitude he succeeds by subversive means.<br/><br/>A country manipulates in order to maintain order. A man buries problems with more problems. Both parties are stranded on the same boat, it is just that the former commissioned the later to this suicidal tango. The consequences for the nation state are laughable, but the individual has more vulnerabilities than the government has employees. <br/><br/>Greed is an obvious evil that swallows the rich and the common equally. Monetary success only gives voice to a greater vice: Self- preservation. Organizations will go to any lengths to keep their reputations intact, especially democratically operated groups. All is expendable when your brand is safety and freedom, and enemies are voted on by manila ballots."
"RforFilm","7","3","8","30 September 2017"," American Made has a nostalgic tone and along with it's comedic storytelling, make it a fun drug smuggling movie
","You have to admire the people that will do anything to provide for their family. There are those that work the long hours and ones who steal to feed their starving ones. I understand one has to do something in order to be sure that you kids can sleep soundly knowing they'll have breakfast in the morning, but if someone is breaking the law or getting involved with the wrong people, is it still about the family or does it become a selfish need? A lot of that depends on what it is your providing. I guess that line should be drawn if you know there's a chance that your own choices can get the people close to you hurt. <br/><br/>Today's movie focuses on a real person who originally went to work for one thing, only to end up with more from the other side. It may have meant a bigger home, more cash, and a happier wife, but like a lot of darker stories involving a crime family, eventually gets too over their own heads. What makes these stories fascinating is how much is explored of their personality that gives them the impression that this is okay. Let's see how American Made can do with this.<br/><br/>In 1978, airline pilot Barry Seal (played by Tom Cruise) is put into contact with the CIA through agent Monty Schafer (played by Domhnall Gleeson). Seal is asked to fly missions over Central America to take pictures of rebels and possible Soviet guerrillas. He accepts, and is given a fast plane with cameras. Though he ends up getting shot at half of the time, Seal is a good enough pilot to fly there and back. During one of his flights, he's taken by a Colombian cartel who offers him big cash to smuggle cocaine to the states. The greed gets the best of him and he accepts.<br/><br/>When the DEA starts to track him, the CIA moves Seal and his family to Arkansas, giving him a home along with a airport and two thousand acres. As the years go into the eighties, he ends up doing more such as exchanging information with rebels and even flying some of them to the states for military training. This gives Seal so much money that even the banks are running out of space to put it. How long will the CIA continue to turn the other cheek as Seal continues his mission? I will not dare reveal that.<br/><br/>Though I've seen drug smuggling stories before (I'm not even a big fan of them), American Made is not only very funny and informative, it's actually a smart parody of the 1980's obsession with materialism and Yuppie lifestyles. The film is shot a lot like a documentary, which gives it an edge to sell this guys story, which sounds like a Hollywood story (though it seems to insane to be made up). Intercut is a lot of explanation with ties to the White House and how this even connects to the Cold War and Gulf War. <br/><br/>Typically, Tom Cruise is the kind of actor who is rarely playing a part, and lets his charisma become the character. American Made doesn't slip him into a role, but he seems perfect anyway as this kind of guy would have to be a Tom Cruise-type. As a matter of fact, I liked a good chunk of these actors like his wife, the cartel leaders and the CIA agent. They all sync in line with Tom Cruise and the comedy that this story entitles. <br/><br/>I'll say though that as interesting as the story is, it suffers a lot of the same issue that I have with stories of people on top that eventually fall; them enjoying the riches. Had the movie cut at least fifteen minutes, this might have been one of my favorites of the year, but a lot of the movie is Tom Cruise using his money to build his home and the Arkansas townand that's it. It doesn't show many of the characters questioning him (though it does get a subplot going that continues the film's story) nor does it even show his character devolving. Despite the pacing, I can say that I still had fun with this.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven beta cameras out of five. American Made feels like a documentary from the eighties that was just found now. It has a nostalgic feeling, but is cinematic enough to feel a bit timeless. Tom Cruise fans and history fans should have a good time with this."

This film allows him to have some fun and is exactly the sort of film should spend the rest of his career making. The only problem is, American Made's Barry Seal was a real person.

This film, American Made, uses a rather superficial way to approach a somehow ""legendary"" figure Barry Seal in the history. There are just too many voice-overs, which certainly interrupts the pace of the film. The character development fails completely and you never know what the protagonist is thinking.

The pedestrian routine of picking and dropping off goods shown countless of times throughout the film is nothing to write home about! The film is mostly air borne and I wish it had stayed a bit more grounded because in their desire to scale greater heights both the protagonist and the film get into trouble . The film could have been much more interesting had the scenes not been thrown at us relentlessly like bowling balls and had given us some breathing space. Even with a short run time of 1 hour and 55 minutes this film seemed far too long and stretched . To the films credit it does not waste too much time in introducing the characters and gets to the point straight away. It is a treat to get to know the fascinating true story of a man who worked for four different agencies together. Some scenes are quite thrilling and rescue the film from its otherwise dry spell. Tom cruise does a good job though his Southern accent seems a bit forced. The others have a comparatively smaller role but they all manage to hold the film together.

The cinematics and photography for the film were perfectly on point as we watched closely to see if we could catch little goofs to share but we didn't catch any.<br/><br/>American Made turned out to be much better than we'd expected and its content is a much needed to be viewed by all."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","2","5","5 October 2017"," Drugs Are Bad, Mmmkay?
","Doug Liman (Swingers, Edge of Tomorrow, Bourne) is one of those directors who's built a career on confident and skilled filmmaking without actually having much in the way of a specific voice. American Made fits that resume perfectly. He takes some familiar themes (love of money is the root of all evil, dishonesty inherent in the war on drugs) and a true American story, then molds into them perfectly. It gives us a Scorsese-like knock-off that isn't terribly original but is still a solid version of an all-too-true corruption story. Cruise stars as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot in the 1980s who is recruited by the CIA to be a courier for their dealings with Central American leaders, before becoming a drug runner. With intentionally rudimentary animation, edits to old news footage, and general 1980s filmmaking tendencies, it's full of great style and appreciated detail. The plane flying is fantastic, the costuming is sweaty and authentic, and the cash and throwing motifs are prevalent and effective. When Seal is slowly covered over by piles of cash, we get the idea pretty quickly that we are watching a guy get suffocated by his own desires. There's a lot packed into the film, and this is one of those rare occurrences in which I think this would be helped by being about an hour longer. While the details of the story are well covered, the characters, their motivations and their personalities get a bit looked over. Instead of being a full engrossing narrative, it comes off more like an information document. Nonetheless, American Made is a funny, cool and intriguing tale about governmental overreach and misappropriated power."

","'AMERICAN MADE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A biopic based on the life of a former TWA pilot, named Barry Seal, who became a contract pilot working for the CIA, as well as a drug smuggler for the Medellin Cartel (in the 1980s), and later served as a DEA informant. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, and it costars Domhnall Gleeson and Sarah Wright. It was directed by Doug Liman (who also directed Cruise in 2014's 'EDGE OF TOMORROW'), and it was written by Gary Spinelli. The film is a modest hit at the Box Office so far, and it's also garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a highly entertaining, and pretty educational crime biopic. <br/><br/>In the late 1970s, Barry Seal (Cruise) was a bored pilot working for TWA, and also smuggling illegal cigars into America. He's approached by a CIA operative, going by the name Monty Schaefer (Gleeson), and offered a job flying clandestine reconnaissance missions over South America. Seal is later asked to be a courier between the CIA and General Noriega, and during this time he's also asked to fly cocaine into the US (on return flights), by the Medellin Cartel. The CIA pretends not to be aware of this, and continues to employ Barry; while moving him and his family to Mena for safety. Seal continues working for the cartel, and the CIA (making tons of money), while also trying to keep his wife (Wright) and daughter happy. <br/><br/>The movie is surprisingly entertaining, from the opening scene till the very last (and that's a pretty high compliment in my opinion). It's just a hell of a lot of fun! Cruise is amazing (like usual) in the lead, and he pretty much makes the whole movie work (on his own almost). Liman is a decent enough director too, but this movie is all about Tom Cruise (and he totally sells it). It's also amazing how he can make a character that should be pretty unlikable, in any other film, totally lovable (despite all of the immoral things he does). The movie is just a blast to watch, and that's saying a lot for a biopic (in my opinion). I usually think they're boring.<br/><br/>Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254"

","You wanna bring back ""The 'Me' Decade"" by curating a grainy, weathered look? No problem. Just add Cesar Charlone, the director of photography for American Made (my latest write-up). <br/><br/>""Made"" chronicles one Barry Seal (played by Tom Cruise). In the 1970's, Seal starts off as a bored TWA pilot who wants more money and more excitement in his life. He hastily quits his current job, gets contacted by the CIA to fly reconnaissance missions, becomes a gunrunner, and eventually smuggles drugs for the Medellin Cartel. The movie ends with him being fatally assassinated in the mid-80's (spoiler).<br/><br/>All in all, this may not be Cruise's greatest performance but it's still darn good. It's much different from his all-American heroes in the past. Notwithstanding Tom's mundane likeness, he's still got the charisma, he's still got the charm, and he's still got those whitening chompers. Cruise disappears into his role easily and effortlessly. You almost forget that you're watching Tom Cruise, the megawatt movie star.<br/><br/>Directed by Doug Liman and scripted by Gary Spinelli (Stash House), ""Made"" is a frenzied, bouncy affair. Liman usually makes action pics like The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and Edge of Tomorrow. His American Made is something invariably different. It's unlike anything he's ever done before. In fact, I'm not sure Doug Liman was even behind the camera. His film at just under two hours, breeds kookiness, contains a rich, poppy soundtrack, and breaks a few rules. Heck, Duggy and lead Cruise are all the better for it.<br/><br/>With the addition of an old school opening sequence a la Universal Pictures, Liman uses a host of cinematic techniques in regards to ""Made"". There are freeze-frames, archive footage, some jittery camera-work, random inserts of narration, and low grade animation. Doug seems to be channeling his inner Martin Scorsese along with his inner Oliver Stone. Also, despite the fact that American Made is based on a true story, Liman still had to of watched 2001's Blow or Lord of War for a little inspiration.<br/><br/>In hindsight, ""Made"" is mildly tense, feverishly paced, and even intently funny. I didn't quite embrace its ending for it made Seal's death a blase, abrupt, and forgettable event. Furthermore, I didn't completely know what was going on for most of the way. ""Made's"" plotting is sort of underdeveloped with a concealed, murky tone right from the get-go. Still, I dug Liman's groove, his balls out craft, and his breakneck style. I can't wait to see what this New York born director does next. Rating: 3 stars."

He gives a Golden Globe type of performance and caries this picture on his back.<br/><br/>It is rather light hearted considering the products he was flying.

Anyways, Tom Cruise's latest romp as a wild pilot smuggling weapons for the American Government and drugs for the Columbian cartel among committing other crimes is a fun and informative piece of cinema. The story of Barry Seal (Cruise) is so wild and under the direction of Doug Liman, American Made captures this insanity for a fast-paced two hours of history. The story of Seal is not a triumphant one but he does have massive success during his life. The film doesn't last too long on the consequences of a life of crime and spends ample time on the benefits. I liked a lot of the film, though the later parts of the film felt a like it lost some steam.<br/><br/>The story begins with Seal bored at his job as a pilot for TWA. He's flying all night and unable to spend any time with his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) because he falls asleep when he gets home. He makes money on the side smuggling cigars until a CIA agent Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) offers him a new job. His first assignment for the CIA is to take over a private company known as Independent Aviation Consultants, IAC, a not so subtle anagram of CIA. He flies over various countries in South America taking pictures of rebel camps and delivering cash to spies like Noriega for intelligence. These scenes are fun as Tom Cruise howls and the plane takes on gunfire from rebel machine guns. He finds success at his work but keeps up a lie to Lucy that he still works for TWA so the financial constraints weigh on Seal.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","I saw ""American Made"", starring Tom Cruise-Edge of Tomorrow, Legend; Domhnall Gleeson-Mother!, Star Wars:The Force Awakens; Sarah Wright- Parks and Recreation_tv, The House Bunny and Caleb Landry Jones-Get Out, X-Men:First Class. This is based on a true story about an airline pilot that got enlisted into working for the C.I.A. and making more money than he could even keep track of. It takes place in the 1980's, when Nancy Reagan was on the television talking about drugs and telling people that they should just say no. Tom plays Barry Seal, a pilot that gets roped into the smuggling business by Domhnall, a C.I.A. operative. At first, Tom is to take surveillance photos of communist militia down in South America but pretty soon, he finds himself flying drugs and guns and even people. The money starts piling up and he has problems just keeping it all straight-there is a scene where his wife, Sarah, tells him that the dog dug up a bag of money in the backyard and the money is flying all over the yard. Tom says that he will rake it up in the morning. Caleb plays Sarah's irresponsible brother that is a real red neck looser-no job, dates 15 year old girls and likes to live beyond his means. Pretty soon, Tom has the DEA, the F.B.I., the ATF and even the State Police on his tail, trying to put him in jail. The story is told by Tom as he makes a sort of diary on VHS tapes-it was the 80's, remember. It is an interesting and entertaining story. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.

"cruise01","7","2","5","29 September 2017"," American Made is quick, entertaining, and Tom Cruise is back again!!!
","American Made is fun, fast paced, and Tom Cruise is playing a character that is different from what he usually does. From the director Doug Liman, who also did Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise and showed they can have fun with that. Well same goes for American Made, were it follows Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) a bored airline pilot, who causes some shakiness with the plane to wake some of his passengers for some laughs. He is approached by Schafer (Domhall Gleeson), who wants to recruit Barry to work for the CIA in flying over South America in a plane to snap pictures. Evantually, Barry gets caught up with the Medellin Cartel, who recruits Barry to fly cocaine back to the U.S. With Schafer being blind sided with the drug smuggling. Barry is making plenty of money that he can barely keep hold of such as having it all put away in a room filled shed or even having it buried in his back yard. Soon enough, the CIA convinces Barry to run guns to the Contras. While the operation may be expanding with Barry having his own airport runaway in a small town of Mena, Arkansas. While the FBI, DEA, and TFA are hot on Barry's trail. <br/><br/>The film is very fast moving. It does goes by briefly on Barry's life events. A moment of him being an airline pilot and bored with his life. Then, it flashes to him being recruited by Schafer. And starting a family with his wife. This is the type of movie that could have last longer if it had development to the characters. But director Doug Liman kept the pace rolling, and had everything moving at a brisk pace. It is also quite fun to see Barry Allen handling some difficult situations being placed in hostile countries. From working with the cartel to smuggling drugs over. He is a skilled pilot. That flies low to wait out the DEA planes that are following him to waste fuel. To even taking off on short runaways. The scenes with seeing him expanding on his operation in bringing in more money than Mena is worth in the town is fun and entertaining. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is an underrated actor. Sure, he is great in his action movies like Mission Impossible, etc. Seeing him playing a character that is vulnerable and not a skilled fighter is fun to see. He can portray the character very well. <br/><br/>American Made may not be a typical Tom Cruise action movie. But more of fun suspenseful thrills of seeing Barry working his way to the top as a delivery man pilot. It never slows down or gets boring. There are some funny moments with the character. <br/><br/>The things that did not work with the movie. I ll have to say it is the development. There is none with the movie. If there was, it was shadowed by the quick moving pace. The movie goes over the several years quickly. A moment were Barry and his wife are living in a fixer upper safe house and a minute later, Barry and his wife have plenty of money and a remodeled home, living in luxury. <br/><br/>Another thing is the cinematography must have been hand-held. There was a lot of close ups with the characters faces. And a lot of shakiness for small dramatic scenes which felt unnecessary. Sure, the technique is done to bring some kind of realism or build the suspense. But it felt overdone in the film. Sure as well it wont be recognized for great cinematography work. <br/><br/>Overall, American Made is a fairly well crime thriller about Barry Seal and what he has done from being a bored pilot to working for the CIA, DEA, and the cartel. The direction is fast paced, fun, and entertaining. Tom Cruise was great. It may not a memorable film for a forgettable plot from the lack of development. Or its poor camera work with the film. But it was fun. <br/><br/>I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars."

","I will admit, I don't know as much about this time in history as I feel like I should. Plus, with many ""Based on a True Story"" movies, it can be hard to tell sometimes what actually happened or what was compressed or exaggerated for a movie moment.<br/><br/>But if even half of what happened in American Made is true, then it would still be a fantastic story, and Doug Liman did an excellent job bringing it to life.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, a pilot for TWA who is recruited by the CIA to take reconnaissance photos of Central American militants during the late 1970s to early 1980s. However, his life gets more interesting/dangerous/lucrative when he gets roped into working for Pablo Escobar smuggling drugs, and eventually transporting weapons to the Contras of Iran-Contra infamy.<br/><br/>These events play mainly as a stage setting for the story of Seal as he juggles all of these things while trying to provide a good life for his wife Lucy, played by Sarah Wright, and their children. It presents an interesting dilemma: does Lucy trust Barry, even if it means building a fantastical rich life only to have it potentially crumble away?<br/><br/>Indeed, Doug Liman does a great job showing the chemistry between Cruise and Wright, and in that is the film's strength.It also has fun with the narrative structure, with Seal essentially narrating his exploits through recorded tapes after the fact.<br/><br/>Where the film sometimes slides is when it has to stop dead and explain just who all the players are and what the significance of these events is. Sure, at first they can be funny in their presentation, and as someone who doesn't know a lot about these events it can be helpful, but it tends to interrupt a fun scene at a critical time, killing the mood a bit, and it breezes on to the the next scene without a chance to bring that mood back.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this film is a fun historical drama with plenty of good-natured humor to keep it afloat, and even if some things may not have actually happened, you don't care because everyone involved is having fun as well."

With regards to ""The Mummy"", it earned a lot but it was heavily trashed by many critics as well as majority of the moviegoers.It was considered as the worst film that Tom Cruise has ever made.<br/><br/>What about ""American Made""?Well,he is a miscast in it too just like in his Jack Reacher franchise.The carefree tenor does not look good on him considering that Barry Seal was portrayed as a youthful character.Too bad that Tom Cruise continues to portray young characters just like in all his films for the last three decades that moviegoers feel a lack of realism in it.Added to that,having the 33-year-old co-star Sarah Wright as his wife made it even worse as the script made it appear that they come from the same generation.Too bad that Tom has been with us for the last 30 years and he is in his 50's.Although Tom has undergone plastic surgery to look young, these roles do not look good on him anymore. He should aspire for roles near his age instead of portraying young characters in order for his films to succeed.Added to that,it is time for him to accept that he must move forward with his acting career in terms of age instead of portraying the same young characters that are supremely confident and charismatic for the last 30+ years.It is time for him to portrayed older characters and roles that fit his persona of arrogance and charisma - the only one he is talented to evoke and give life to on screen rather than being continuously miscast.If not, it will harm his very successful career soon just like his last three movies."

","American Made is based on a true story, that takes place in the 1980's, about an American commercial pilot who is recruited by both the C.I.A. and by Escobar's Colombian drug cartel. He first starts out gathering info and taking pictures from the sky for the C.I.A. but when he's made an offer that he cannot refuse by the Colombians to run drugs from Latin America to the U.S., his world changes at a break neck pace and the money starts rolling in.<br/><br/>More questions are asked than answered in this movie. The movie itself is too busy relying on Cruise's movie star charm. He's smiles from behind his aviator shades as he deeply emerges himself in his character as Barry Seal. He reminded me of what may have become of a young ""Maverick"" from Top Gun if we were to see him as an adult 20 years later. This story is fast paced and it does manage to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>Sarah Wright plays Cruise's wife Lucy. She's hilarious in her role as a girl who was working at KFC when she met her husband to the richest woman in a small Arkansas community where they are placed by the C.I.A. to run all kind of covert operations from gun running to smuggling in Nicaraguans to the U.S. to train them as ""freedom fighters.""<br/><br/>American Made is definitely a star driven vehicle for Cruise and, to his credit, he acts well enough to make you forget that your watching Tom Cruise on screen. He's Barry Seal, ""the gringo who can get anything delivered"" and he is very believable. The movie also shows the corruption in that was widespread in Ronald Reagan's government, but that's another story.<br/><br/>This movie is rated ""R"" for obscene language and some sexuality and it runs just under 2 hours long. American Made is not a great movie, but it will keep you entertained. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" it rates a LARGE.<br/><br/>Hollywood Hernandez"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","6","12 September 2017"," Not a bad film, but also a missed opportunity
","""American Made"" is (of course) an American English-language (occasional Spanish) movie from 2017, so a really new release. It runs for almost two hours and was directed by Doug Liman who is mostly known for his work on the Bourne movies (as a producer) and of course on ""Edge of Tomorrow"" where he worked with Tom Cruise too. The writer is Gary Spinelli and this is perhaps his breakthrough film we have here. I already mentioned lead actor Tom Cruise and he is in almost every scene of the film. I kinda like him, in other projects more than here perhaps, but I still thought he did a decent job all in all and not many would have given a better lead performance. Then again, despite the great deal of screen time in here, it always feels as if the movie is more about the situation and story really than about the protagonist. This may also have to do with the fact that the character of Barry Seal really did exist, so there is a great deal of historic relevance to it.<br/><br/>But sadly, the execution never really lives up to the promise. Reading a bit about Seal I must say I am embarrassed I never heard of him before and I am sure this is the case for many, especially outside of America, so the movie also has a certain educational level. Where it does not always deliver. The narrative often lacked sufficient focus and seemed all over the place at times, maybe due to the writer's lack of experience. You can see at times that they were taking the Argo approach, but it's rather a poor man's version. I also think the film would have worked much better as a gritty crime drama, maybe thriller. The ways in which they included slightly comedic scenes felt rushed and forced and a for-the-sake-of-it impression is always a bad thing. At its most dramatic moments, such as the ending too, the film is very good, but it loses itself in its desperate attempts to come off as light, probably to attract more people to theaters, and it also feels a bit on the repetitive side. So yeah, there is a great deal of substance and relevance to this man's story from a historic perspective, even today, and I don't think they came close in reaching what the premise had to offer. This is especially disappointing as now it will be at least another decade, probably more, until Barry Seal gets another, hopefully better biopic. Not that this one is a bad film by any means, it's a pretty entertaining one in fact and I recommend the watch. I couldn't care less about the media's decade-long smear campaigns about Cruise's religion and (former) relationships because as long as he keeps delivering quality like he does here, count me in as one of his fans. ""American Made"" gets a cautious thumbs-up. Go check it out."

","Tom Cruise stars in this engaging and entertaining film about a TWA pilot who gets involved in smuggling of drugs, transporting rebel fighters and taking photos for intelligence missions. During his dangerous adventures he comes into contact with some notorious drug lords and various levels of law enforcement. <br/><br/>The film starts with a bang and certainly takes you on a fun filled ride, half the time you cannot believe what is happening. Barry Seal's story of huge financial upturn has a tragic demise as most of these stories do. This is because the greed and pursuit of money is too much to resist until its too late. The humor is used well and emerges effortlessly as Barry's journey is bizarre and full of unexpected twists. When you get entangled with Pablo Escobar and the Colombian drug cartel things don't have a happy ending. <br/><br/>This was a well made film with great performances from Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast. The pace, action and intrigue of this film is ongoing and never stops. Barry's world of dangerous flight missions, a loyal and beautiful wife and tons of money will entice and fascinate many. Like a Greek tragedy his rise and fall was well captured on film. The film showed the blurred line between the CIA who initially got Barry involved in this and the Drug lords. We were left wondering who the real criminals were, at the end of the day we are all self- interested parties.<br/><br/>8/10"

","American made chooses to go with a kind of light-hearted way to tell the story of drug and arms smuggler and it works incredibly well. This movie gives Tom Cruise one the best roles he's done in a long time. Tom Cruise is perfect in this movie, i is a funny but also fairly dramatic role. When he is smuggling and dealing with the cartel it can be quite funny but also really facinating. I was sitting watching this movie thinking...this really happened, and if this wasn't based on a true story i would never have believed it.<br/><br/>The movie goes for a more Documentary feel, with snap zooms and very tight filming and to be honest I think it works well with the movie. Doug Liman and Tom Cruise work incredibly well together and so the camera work and directing is superb and works incredibly well with the movie'stone and premise
During the third act, the movie begins to become slightly more dramatic with Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) and his sentancing. After he takes photos of the cartel for the DEA they are publicly released on TV and th cartel finds out and begins to hunt him. This is the part where the film begins to get more serious which is a good thing and a bad thing. The good being, it provides a tense and enthrallinng ending but at the same time is a big contrast from the rest of the movie. I still enjoyed this part of the movie but I wish the transistion between light-hearted and serious was done a little better.<br/><br/>The ending was done really well. Throughout the movie we are shown ""home videos"" of Barry Seal talking to the camera about his experience. In these movies it shows the date of the recordings. This shows that these were recorded after the day of his sentencing, initially making the audience think everything will turn out well for him. The movie then at the end shocked me because of Barry being shot and killed by the cartel. In retrospect I should've saw it coming but it surprised me.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with the movie is, it starts off kind of slow. I wasn't really invested until maybe the 30 minute mark. It was a necessary part of the ovie because it shows Barry being approached by the CIA but it could've been made a little bit shorter and a bit more interesting.<br/><br/>Overalll, American Made is a brilliant movie that deserves to be viewed"

I wasn't quite sure what the point was. And Cruise felt slightly off in a role that would make more sense to me if he seemed a bit stupider and trashier; it seemed the equivalent of casting George Clooney to play Lyndon Johnson.<br/><br/>In the end, I would say American Made was perfectly fine, but it's the sort of movie I will have completely forgotten in a month."

","The main thing that I derived from Doug Liman's ""American Made"" is that these people care about one thing and one thing only: money. Whether it was the Contras, the Colombian drug cartels, or the CIA, they were more interested in getting rich than in fighting. And of course Barry Seal enjoyed raking in the dough (he ended up with more money than he knew what to do with, in fact). There was definitely no morality involved in any of this.<br/><br/>I understand that the movie took some artistic license. Even so, it's amazing what the CIA was able to get away with (of course, the fact remains that whoever makes the rules gets to break the rules). The so-called war on drugs was always total baloney. Not the greatest movie, but I recommend it."

Strange vehicle for Cruise, especially as he is playing a man who even just physically was nothing similar (real man was very fat). Anyhow, Tom Cruise is an everyday man who ends up claiming to end up way over his head with drug dealers, government dark arts and mass government scandals.<br/><br/>The said character is a chancer, but knows his market flying his battered planes full of drugs or guns between the US and Latin America, amassing ridiculous amounts of cash with the idealised white fence home and family turning a blind eye. And yes, it all comes crashing down. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise strangely plays against type but still as himself! Yet it works, but the charisma is sadly masking that his character is really no hero or friend. Maybe simply Cruise wasn't the right person for the role despite giving an admittedly good performance. Credit though where it's due as he has taken a role that isn't really par for the course of what he's done before. Although he & his wife just seem too perfectly beautiful for the roles as a battle hardened blue collar couple who strike it lucky then all the way down.<br/><br/>It's well made and shot and often humorous, but I couldn't empathise and am certain that enough of it masks the truth, with the authors and sources exaggerating what really happened with this character. Possibly the truth was even darker.<br/><br/>It's fine to watch but ultimately it won't grab you enough and will remain on the shelves. Fine effort, interesting story but nothing more."

","American Made bears some similarity to movies like Air America, Catch Me If You Can, and Goodfellas, and other fashionable caper movies. It is a perfect vehicle for Tom Cruise, on whose charisma, smile, and appealing cockiness the movie hinges because we don't get a lot of psychological insight into the character, or learn why he was so determined to make more money than he could spend. Cruise played pilot Bruce Seale to distancing effect. This was well advised because the real protagonist was involved in some egregious criminal activities and the supporting roles don't have much stake in the story. But, this is a movie, and audiences can suspend their judgement when they see government agencies controlling its citizens with ultimatums. All in all, this is a story about one man - a citizen - at the centre of one of the most controversial political scandal of the early 1980s. That is at least interesting."

He sweated when he should have sweated. He smiled that impish smile. He made the ""how am I going to deal with all this cash"" scenes seem believable. How could you not like that guy and sympathyze with his fate?<br/><br/>In addition to Tom, the movie was beautifully cast. The CIA guy, though the character was not believable, was played to the hilt. Even the non-speaking 15 year-old girl who the exquisitely weaselly brother-in-law picked up was perfect.

"jasontheterrible","6","1","2","23 May 2018"," Anything with Cruise is good but this was only made for one reason
","Doug Liman had to atone for the Jason Bourne film which was too right wing with this: a completely made up left wing distortion to trash Reagan. WAPO, NYT and others spent months on the real story and concluded Reagan and the CIA never knew about a drug connection. The Sandinista regime was not only installed by the Soviets, the president Daniel Ortega promised if you like your plan and total health care for no money you can keep it along with dozens of obama style pipe dreams. You can read about them. It was a very long list. But alas, corruption and infighting brought zero promises kept and then what a surprise, the communists took away every civil right and ruled with an iron fist, meaning rape, torture and murder. Reagan tried to stop it with the opponents who were called contras. The commies were eventually booted out but guess what? Good old George Bush put Ortega back in 2006. He was a fully converted supporter of the USA by then. We have been supporting the country ever since with a lot of money and plenty of programs. In other words, everything in the film is a lie but as a film it is pretty well made and enjoyable to watch. Liman admitted it was all lies and too bad few will ever read that."

","I watched this movie after having watched Kill the Messenger with Jeremy Renner because it dealt with the same subject matter. I was anxious to see the similarities and differences between the two. One thing I have to say right away is that Kill the Messenger was a lot better.<br/><br/>American Made deals with the CIA involvement in allowing drugs to flow into the US in order to surreptitiously arm the Nicaraguan Contras. Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) was a principal player in smuggling drugs into the U.S. as he was a pilot who was given the knowledge and resources to smuggle the drugs. He made millions of dollars in the process and was insanely successful at smuggling.<br/><br/>The movie had a light tone and atmosphere. Maybe it was to match the attitude and demeanor of the main character or maybe not, but that was one thing I appreciated about Kill the Messenger. Kill the Messenger gave the issue the proper respect. It was treated seriously and there were even pertinent video clips showing the outrage from those who'd suffered due to drugs. American Made was the iterations of a loosey goosey adventurer type who was making more money than he knew what to do with. It was very lighthearted and humorous even though the topic was anything but.<br/><br/>I liked the movie for the historical information it presented but nothing more than that. It's based upon a true story but we can only imagine how closely to the truth it adhered."

It was good to see him back in a great role and movie after his disastrous Mummy movie. Watching Barry Seal ascend to the top and subsequent fall reminded me of Ray Liotta's depiction of mobster Henry Hill in the movie Goodfellas. The move was a bit of a comedy wrapped around a serious story with an unfortunate ending. I really liked seeing Sarah Wright in this film playing his wife. I have never seen her in a mainstream film but look forward to seeing her in the future. <br/><br/>The plot was fast flowing with very little pauses or breaks. I was quite surprised how quickly the time passed while watching. The aerial film sequences and location was worth the price of admission. The film was bright and the sound was great unlike so many crime films today filmed in low light/night. The 80's props and clothing was very authentic and believable. Although the whole movie surrounds drug smuggling there was almost zero scenes showing drug usage. I probably would not watch again as the plot outcome is the big reveal."

","Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman take a page out of Martin Scorsese's book with a broad biographical take on prolific 80's drugs and guns smuggler Barry Seal.<br/><br/>The Good: Like Scorsese's Goodfellas, Casino or Wolf of Wall Street, American Made takes an overall breezy just the highlights flashback approach to a tale of a never do well who hits well above his weight class. Tom Cruise is excellent in the lead role and while the rest of the cast is a bit forgettable (There is no Joe Pesci here) they certainly do a fine job. The movie is also beautifully shot and the period details of the late seventies early eighties seem spot on. <br/><br/>It is also nice to see a major motion picture that doesn't look like a video game or tries to pass off various parts of Canada as the United States and Columbia. <br/><br/>The Bad: Fans of historical accuracy are in for a rough ride. For starters, the main character Barry Seal's nickname was El Gordo and he weighed over three hundred pounds. Not an exact match for Mr. Cruise. Many of the actual events shown are simply made out of the whole cloth. The movie also has an annoying habit of name dropping (Like a protagonist in an Assassin Creed video game everyone Barry meets or interacts with becomes or is famous.) They even manage to get five presidents in a movie that takes place over only seven years (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and W all cameo in the movie through TV shots, phone calls and W in person. <br/><br/>Also, speaking of El Gordo, good lord has Benito Martinez (David Aceveda from The Shield) put on some weight.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: I love this style of movie that Scorsese perfected years ago (A shout out to Brian De Palma's Scarface as well of course.) Director Liman never quite reaches those heights. The lack of memorable secondary characters doesn't help but it is the fact that our main character gets all this money but seems to have no idea what to do with it outside of burying it in the yard and putting it in the bank that puts a damper on the ride. Liman never really shows any Gomorrean excess that can make these films a guilty pleasure. <br/><br/>American Made is a very solid, handsome outing. Cruise continues to show himself as rising above his material and who always seem to give a 110%. He really is only better with age."

There were some fantastic aerial shots throughout the film. I enjoyed that being set in the 80s you felt that is was shot then too. Now and then it would cut to Barry recording himself though a old video recorder which added greatly to the overall feel of the film.

This typical story of a smug guy getting his hands dirty, just a bit at first, and, little by little, he's shoulder deep in some complex mess and has a hard time hiding cash in suitcases - it feels so overused that even the custom set of plot zigzags or the quirky little scenes don't transform it into anything you'd really wanna pay attention to.<br/><br/>It's hardly Tom Cruise's fault - after all, he's doing what he's always been doing, that is, smiling wide, talking smooth and emanating confidence.

And even if this movie will definitely not become the peak of his thespian career, the likes of Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are an alibi enough.<br/><br/>Maybe we should simply admit that this film was never supposed to be anything great. Just a generic crime adventure with an already infamous ""based on real events"" stamp. To be great wasn't even the goal - to avoid being a failure was (mostly a box office one). But fear not: the sufficient amount of properties of a consumable product is here. Will it taste good? Probably not really. But who cares about taste as long as you don't make a scene and don't ask for a refund. Nothing personal, just business. That's what being American made is about after all, isn't it?"

","Very entertaining. This movie was made with every one of its fibers to entertain. -- instead of just focusing on action shots alone to carry it like so many other lousy action movies do, this one has all the other qualities a ""real"" movie has: Very well written, acted, camera work, the pace of it is perfect ---exciting through and through. Except for the jabs at my side of the political aisle--that was hard to see. Every administration (Dem or Rep) is guilty of so much behind-the-scenes poor decision making in our history. So I hope it doesn't turn anyone an opposite aisle. But this movie is truly a success because of it's main actor, Tom Cruise, What can I say?... At the same time I have no over-the-top stumbling over myself fondness to go see all his movies, those that I do go to it's so noticeable-- he just succeeds time after time in making fun to watch movies. His on screen presence (true talent) is tops in the industry. Every time you see Cruise in a movie it's not Oh there's Tom Cruise in this movie or that movie playing this/that person, but instead you lose yourself in the actual character he plays and you just sit back and enjoy the show. This is a sign of true talent, and Mr. Cruise has talent on screen and never fails. He is what a lifetime achievement award is made for --and will be handed to one day -- hopefully many, many years away. Hats off to him yet again, he works hard to entertain and he delivers every time. (although I haven't seen all of his movies -- those I don't care for the genre: i.e. mummies or vampires.. so I have no idea how he does in those.) Go see this movie! and leave your young kids at home."

"kaptenvideo-89875","6","2","7","2 September 2017"," Another Tom Cruise fan service, with aspirations for more
","""Forrest Gump"" flying high: meet the man who was too dumb to settle for an ordinary life like almost everybody else. Tom Cruise's latest is based on the amazing life of Barry Seal, the daredevil pilot who worked for the CIA, the White House AND a powerful drug cartel at the same time. Also appearing: April Billingsley, Domhnall Gleeson, Caleb Landry Jones, Alejandro Edda. Directed by Doug Lima, known for a number of action movies, including Go"" (1999), The Bourne Identity"", and Mr. and Mrs. Smith"". He's, however, much less known for serious"" movies, which he also likes to do occasionally. Let's hope ""American Made"" will be his game-changer, because most of the personality it has owes thanks to Liman's work as director, mixing so-called period piece (the last half of 1970's and the first half of 80's) with his shaky-cam and cameras-up-close approach plus breathless editing first introduced in The Bourne Identity"". It's not a style everybody likes but it manages to give the result its very own unique vibe – and it's also compatible with the whirlwind kind of life mr Seal seemed to prefer. Everything else here is less inspired. I mean, it works fine but, essentially, we are watching the same ""rags to riches to rags again"" type of American success story that we've served countless times over the last 30 years since Oliver Stone's Wall Street"" made it popular. To be exact, the 114 minute movie is eventful, but story-wise we get only this often-copied blueprint and little else. The actors are certainly competent but there are no interesting characters to root for. Caleb Landry Jones is always cool, of course, but he has such a small role. Cruise is, of course, too much of a big star to really go into his character. He doesn't vanish in his protagonist such as, for example, Matthew McConaughey in ""Gold"" (another this year's movie about great adventurer which has copied ""Wall Street"" formula). His version of this unique man is still the same Cruise persona we've known for ages, only this time less ass-kicking and million- dollar-smile flashing because he plays a common man. Of course, Cruise still has a lot of charisma, but he turns ""American Made"" into just another Cruise project – based on good idea, lots of stuff going down, screenplay and characters are not intriguing. Often, this equation can work out quite well, especially in action- oriented movies. The other times, such as in American Made"", I want to enjoy the result more than I actually did. Still, it's probably a better movie than this long-planned Top Gun"" sequel they're still developing for Cruise."

","American politics is a theater that continues to garner more attention than even the biggest award shows. The players in their games can be just as interesting, especially in how far they go to accomplish their tasks. My second review of the weekend focuses on one such person named Barry Seal, a famous American pilot who was a cog in so many aspects. What does this movie have in store for us? Robbie K here to fill in on the latest biography and give you insight into another silver screen story. Let's go<br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>The Setting: Technology's progression allows us to do many things, and one is recreating the past. American Made is a shining example of Hollywood's ability to recreate the trends of the decades, from what towns/cities looked like to the fashion and cars that filled them. You'll be pulled back in time with this film, and become integrated in the world and fully diving into the world crafted by Seal's actions. In addition, it's also fun to see old news' broadcasts integrated into the mix, further amping up the story. And for all you nostalgia lovers out there, feel free to have fun remembering the adventures you back then. <br/><br/>Cruise's Acting: Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal life, but the man can certainly play his roles well. Cruise comes in spades with this film, capturing arrogance, coyness, and that adventurous spirit all in one sitting. His skills will bring out the emotions of the time period, the fear of being that pivotal chess piece that so many depend on. Cruise's chemistry with all his co-actors is favorable, resulting in a performance that feels natural. In addition, his dynamic abilities to transition between sub roles, further brings the character to life, an essential for a key role. <br/><br/>Thorough Tale: Biographies are only as fascinating as the story presented, which often requires details. Our directors/screenwriters have got you covered in this movie, sparing no time cost to hit all the deals that Seal was involved in. Their presentation keeps guides you well in this movie, using captioned slide transitions and Cruise's comedic dialogue to set the time and place of the next adventure. It's an easy tale to keep up with and hits so many qualities of Seal's life in tandem to his antics (including family, friends, and even sanity). I felt that of all the books brought to life, this was one that hit the closest to home. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Magic vs Reality: The challenge with these films is determining what is real and what is overdramatized. There are plenty of moments where that question comes up, as the cast of characters appears with grandiose gestures and presentations to corrupt the system. As the story progresses, the whole conspiracy gets even larger and the drama amps up to levels that are hard to believe. The over dramatization gets a little cheesy at times, and made me roll my eyes at the extremes the legal system went to and how untrustworthy they were. Fans of this style though, will easily be hooked into the escapades of the movie. <br/><br/>Skimped on other factors: While American Made touches on many aspects of the film, there was an imbalance in how much they would focus on those other aspects. The family aspect was so heavily influenced at the beginning, but then gets diluted down to background noise and occasional shots. Same thing goes for a few business partners he contracts as well, a rather focused opening, but then runs out of gas. While I give them props for keeping things concise, the disjunction between these aspects is a little disappointing to me, especially how one would affect the other. In addition, these rushed elements took the suspense away from me. <br/><br/>The wasted sequences: The most annoying thing for me though, were the tangential flashes that occur in this movie. Seal's memories are fascinating to see, but there are a few of them that were pointless to have sequences for. An example is him randomly saying he had kids, only to flash to a scene of her in labor for a brief comedic relief. While a noble attempt, it was nothing a well-placed line could have done as well. There are other examples as well that all could have been left out, thereby further reducing the run length. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>American Made is a great biography that has some flare other biographies have lacked for me. Cruise leads the way in terms of strengths for this movie, but the world and tale itself are an entertaining venue to watch. Yet, there are plenty of overdramatic moments and wasted shots that have made this a glorified Netflix/History Channel worthy production. If you are looking for a good biography though, scope this one out, otherwise wait for next week's releases before going to the theater. <br/><br/>My scores;<br/><br/>Action/Biography/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

","In most biographical accounts of Adler Berriman ""Barry"" Seal (July 16, 1939 - February 19, 1986), the narrative will describe Barry as a drug runner for the notorious Medellin Cartel of Pablo Escobar in Colombia. ""American Made"" is successful in probing deeper into Seal's life story to shift the focus to his role in the so-called Iran-Contra Affair of the 1980s.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal as a fun-loving American soldier of fortune...with the emphasis on the word ""fortune."" Seal is apolitical and is always on the lookout for a new angle into making money through his dare-devil flying skills. <br/><br/>Seal became a contract agent for the CIA, taking surveillance photos in Nicaragua at the time when the Sandinistas were the duly elected national government. The film makes it clear that in the early years of the Reagan administration, a secret task force working out of the White House began to actively support a coup of the Nicaraguan government by supplying arms and training the insurgents to topple the Sandinista government. <br/><br/>After the debacle in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, Congress and the American people demanded more accountability from its government in adventurism abroad. But as implied in the film, Ronald Reagan was personally aware of the plot to overthrow the Sandinistas early in his first term in office and long before his Alzheimer's disability could be used as an excuse for him not ""remembering.""<br/><br/>In its episodic style, the film is rather clumsy as it skips around in time and develops multiple subplots. But it is most successful when it focuses on the political machinations that first bring Barry Seal into the fold of the CIA in illegal arms shipments, until he is eventually betrayed when the clandestine government operation begins to implode. This is an important human story that included good research into Seal's peripatetic life by the filmmakers. <br/><br/>One of the most fascinating parts of the film was the improbable creation of an illegal training base for the training of the Contras on American soil in Mena, Arkansas. Seal served in transporting the rebels to Mena at the behest of the CIA. The filmmakers skillfully weave documentary footage of Oliver North's behind-the-scenes role in the convoluted swap of arms for hostages in the two-pronged goal of freeing Americans being held in Iran while supporting the Contras in Nicaragua. The outlandish training site in Mena was part of the broader secret operation.<br/><br/>The Iran-Contra Affair has never been thoroughly examined by historians, and this film goes a long way in exposing the events as they unfolded in the early 1980s. The only missing part of the story in the film was how the CIA was indirectly responsible for the sale of millions of dollars worth of cocaine to Americans, especially in the beleaguered distinct of south Los Angeles, resulting in the illicit funding of the Contras and the broader addiction of Americans to cocaine. That story was uncovered by investigative reporter Gary Webb and is the subject of a good film entitled ""Kill the Messenger. Taken together, ""American Made"" and ""Kill the Messenger"" tell a story that is rarely mentioned in the mainstream media or historians. And the deaths of Gary Webb and Barry Seal have an eerie and deeply troubling similarity."

","Just some unorganized thoughts, kept them down in case I forgot. :)<br/><br/>One thing I like America the most is its freedom of speech, and this movie has highly applied this amendment, no other country would have such things, to disclose government scandals and make a movie to make fun.<br/><br/>American is paying back to Uncle Sam's political meddling now, from the Vietnam War to nowadays ISIS, countless money, death, and disagreed voices from the public, yet peace still hasn't come. <br/><br/>Anyway, enter the movie, I was quite agitated with the shaking camera. But considering many scenes were filmed in real words and the real person, so it makes it acceptable. Also, short words to grieving over the death of the 2 pilots who sacrificed earlier during the filming. <br/><br/>Also, the relationship of the Seal's is very impressive. <br/><br/>1) The brother in law was a dumbhead, but Barry only got mad when he cursed Barry's wife in the ""c"" word before the car explosion. <br/><br/>2) Countless kisses and hugs, that's very sweet and warm. I usually thought Barry would have some drama like an affair after he became rich. But it looks like he was faithful to the family all the time (during the movie). <br/><br/>3) When Barry was caught, the wife took off her jewelry and said she is not leaving without Barry. <br/><br/>4) The wife worked in KFC to support their kids after Barry's death, which is a follow up to the beginning when Barry just move their family to a new place without explanation. The wife said she would work in KFC if Barry doesn't have a job."

","f you're like me you want to know more about Barry Seal. Short of conspiracy videos I've not had a lot of success save for Daniel Hopsicker's film which I did find scattered if informative...still heavy with conspiracy stuff yet has a ring of truth. Now we get the big one: The made for your entertainment Hollywood version. <br/><br/>It's definitely good enough it should find an audience, having Tom Cruise paints Seal more as a likable criminal. Seal as pawn playing all sides like they were playing him to which he might as well make some major bank. But, the thing that shouldn't get lost is that this is about a man who really lived and a government agency that absolutely ran amok. Lives were lost and destroyed to which we really don't see that to any extent here. This fairly spit, polished, and filtered version based on the book American Made gives what I would term a peek at the top as it never delves too deeply in favor of pure entertainment..<br/><br/>Is it entertaining to see a man get himself into the most unimaginable situation where you go from driving a bus in the sky for TWA to having so much much money you can't find enough banks or buildings to put store it in? Why yes it is! And the way Tom mugs for a videocassette camera retelling his story is interlaced (Seal may have actually done this for many reasons including his own safety) between scenes of outlandish occurrences and action as Barry Seal's unique criminal empire is pretty much built by The CIA. We know that part of this is absolutely true so it's not very hard to question anything here and it's often better than fiction.<br/><br/>This movie is filmed wonderfully with some action that includes a harrowing short runway takeoff high in the Columbian mountains. They did a fantastic job of filming this and as well as a later controlled ditching. I think it shows that Cruise is a pilot himself as the detail is impressive. I recommend this movie. This is close to the story of the century since the aliens haven't yet landed. Who in The CIA thought this up? Who gave it the green light? Are these people psychopaths? The fact they did and got a colorful character like Seal almost demands further investigation, but for now here's the big-screen sanitized entertaining version and it's pretty good."
"hunter-friesen","7","1","3","22 October 2017"," Tom Cruise headlines one of the most fun, but problematic films of the year
","We as Americans love to hear about the self-made man. Someone who saw an opportunity and made something for himself. American Made is the story of how Barry Seal, half CIA flyboy, half Colombian drug runner, made his fortunes by seizing a golden opportunity. <br/><br/>Barry Seal is a Trans World Airlines pilot stuck in a boring life of taxying from destination to destination. He's a thrill seeker that gets his rush from smuggling in Cuban cigars. This attracts the attention of CIA agent Monty Schaffer who recruits Seal to take flyover pictures of suspected communist countries in Central America. After a few runs to through Colombia, Seal is roped into doing cocaine runs for drug lords, one of which happens to be Pablo Escobar. Barry is now making a fortune running drugs into America while also working for the government. Conflicts of interest start to arise and his loyalty is tested by both sides.<br/><br/>The film flies at a breakneck pace, going from year to year in mere minutes. We see Barry with CIA in '77, then it quickly changes to '79 and the drug lords are introduced. The speed fits Barry's life since he was constantly flying for somebody, but it doesn't allow for situations to fully develop and breathe. Once something is explained, something else pops up. This causes confusion to build up around halfway through that never gets sorted out. <br/><br/>Another problem with the story is how it inadequately juggles all the different parties involved in the plot. The CIA is introduced early but goes missing multiple times before popping up again for a short time. The plot involving the drug dealers take up most of the middle third but also go missing near the end. <br/><br/>The message of American Made is explained right in the title. Barry Seal was a real man that made a fortune off of America's ineptness at foreign policy and fighting the war on drugs. He is the essence of what every American dream to be. We condemn him for cheating the government and delivering illegal drugs, but also wish we were him because of the luxury and thrill that comes from that kind of life. <br/><br/>People who enjoy Cruise-led action films such as will enjoy this because of the similar charm and fun intertwined with action scenes. The peril never feels that immediate and we always get the feeling that Cruise will talk his way out. I also expect the older generation to turn out for this because of the many plot points that circle around American politics during the 1970's. Younger viewers might not be that interested, but the people who lived during that time will get a kick out of it. Director Doug Liman sells the usual anti-American message that comes from films taking place in the turbulent 70's and 80's. We witness Reagan politics and the underbelly of the CIA working in Central America.<br/><br/>The filming is done in the 70's style. Some images are out of focus and in many instances, you can see heavy grain. This works to the films benefit by making it feel more authentic and like the story is being told through a television screen from back then.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is exceptional as Barry Seal. He plays off his best features; good looks and ability to charm everyone in the room. The entire film is revolved around him and we never lose sight of him, which is a good thing here. Domhnall Gleeson is pretty good as the enigmatic and troublesome CIA agent Schaffer. Sarah Wright is another highlight as Barry's wife who gets pushed around because of his crazy adventures. Jesse Plemons barely supports as Sheriff Downing, which is good because his character really has no use in the film and should've been cut. <br/><br/>American Made is one of those films that you know has problems, but you like it anyway because it's fun to watch. Not every film is perfect, but usually, the ones that are the most fun to watch are the ones we remember the best. Audiences should enjoy this film for Tom Cruise and high flying antics and not think too hard about some structural problems."

"iromashchenko","8","1","3","20 October 2017"," Satirical bio from Doug Liman
","'American Made' is about a US pilot who managed to work both for the CIA and for the Medelin cartel in Colombia, and later – for the DEA. The CIA received valuable pictures of military bases in the South America and supplied weapons to the local anti-communist groups, while cartel sent drugs to the US. These illegal operations allowed Seal to gain wealth, but it has not guaranteed him long and easy life. One needs to know one thing about the movie. Doug Liman is a director here. A director with recognizable style. He has authored famous actions movies, including 'The Bourne Identity', 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and 'The Edge of Tomorrow'. Tom Cruise starred the latter one, by the way. Contrary to the previous works in 'American Made' Liman is forced to put up the level and to discuss serious topics in his light manner. This is not the first time, when the director refers to complicated themes ('Fair Game'), but before it looked less persuasive. The joint mostly creates associations with another satirical bio, 'Wolf of Wall-Street' from Scorsese. Well, one can hardly compete with Scorsese in deepness and multidimensional coverage, but still methods used here by Liman very much remind those ones Scorsese used earlier. Of course, a reservation has to be made that some real facts were changed to simplify the plot and to give the movie more artistic attractiveness. Also this movie would hardly become the most favorite one for the audience as it could happen to 'Bourne Identity' and 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'. Nevertheless, this is one of the best movies of the year and a praiseworthy return of Tom Cruise into dramatic acting (after 'The Mummy')."

Sarah Wright is also good has Lucy, Barry's wife a tough but very loving. The late 70's and 80's look like the time period that it was set in.

"jdesando","Null","1","3","4 October 2017"," Cruise is a hot shot pilot and actor. Be entertained!
","Tom Cruise does the breezy hero better than most other actors working today. In a wholly entertaining American Made, he jauntily plays Bobby Seal, the hotshot TWA pilot who ran drugs for South American cartels and the CIA, became wealthy, and lost it all. Yet, he can be historically associated to the operation known as the Iran-Contra Affair, and in that his legacy can be certain.<br/><br/>American Made is Seal's story, a frenetic film about a mercurial pilot, whose love of his family competes with his love of fast planes and money. Although the film may make the uncertain life playing between the government and the cartels seem romantic, the guns both running and shooting are all too real to be seductive for your normal theatergoer.<br/><br/>Director Doug Lyman, having directed The Bourne Identity and Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, knows a thing or two about fast pace, intrigue, and the limits of idealism. Here he takes a slower pace to allow Cruise to smile and play the almost clueless jockey who is seduced into high stakes because of money, but more importantly, flying. Offered a new, spiffy, fast plane to carrying around the drugs, and this seemingly good boy goes bad.<br/><br/>Music from the late 70's and early 80's such as Hooked on Classics and A Fifth of Beethoven keep American Made rooted in the past as we try to forget Cruise is a man of our times. Intercutting with notables like President and Mrs. Reagan brings home how near Seal was to the heart of things politic.<br/><br/>As he explains in voice over associated with tapes he made recounting his adventures, ""I'm the gringo that always delivers."" The same could be said of Cruise, whose youthful swashbuckling has taken him from Top Gun fame to present day success.<br/><br/>To add to the crazy heroic treatment of this character, Cruise himself flies the planes, and in one sequence puts the plane on auto to drop bags from a trap door. He's listed as in charge of the plane stunts. His fine acting in this robust film is no stunt. It's real entertainment."

","'American Made' is a semi-biographical account of certain events in the life of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot turned CIA-informant who doubled as a drug-smuggler. Liman- Cruise combo had previously made the excellent 'The Edge of Tomorrow', and Cruise badly needed to bounce back from the fiasco that was 'The Mummy' earlier this year. Well, 'American Made' delivers, for most part!<br/><br/>Liman knows hows to capitalize on Cruise's charm (even at the age of 55), and make an entertaining movie around him. Liman has already said openly that this movie won't follow the pattern of a docu-drama and would not adhere purely to what transpired in Seal's life - i.e. historical accuracy will remain questionable (for instance, Seal was a plump, half-bald dude unlike the flawless-looking Cruise; Seal had married thrice unlike what's shown in the movie; even the timelines differ from actuality). It's strictly a commercial vehicle (come on, the tagline says 'Based on a TRUE LIE' - what more do you need?), with neat production values (the 80s setting is wonderfully rendered), first-rate cinematography and an assemblage of taut, breezy performances. Cruise is definitely in his zone here, juggling largely between the emotions of elation and discomfort. A tough job indeed, to condense someone's life into a 115 minute movie, but 'American Made' trots along like a little pony that seems to relish taking us on a fun-ride.<br/><br/>There are umpteen number of cackle-worthy occasions integrated adeptly into the screenplay (written by Gary Spinelli, with some obvious improvisation from Liman & Cruise) that at times, make the viewer exclaim ""What the hell! Seriously?"" but in a pleasurable way. Seal tries to poke fun at the characters around him - As a TWA pilot, he deliberately quivers the plane he's flying just to disturb the co-pilot's and passengers' slumber, while letting out a sly smile directed at the audience; he offers a pack of cash to the person whose property he crash-lands his plane (carrying large amounts of cocaine) on, and borrows his bicycle to escape from the cops; he is shown happily partying with the Medellin Cartel, even when he works for the CIA; at one point he has so much currency with him that he's stacked some of it along with the garbage pile..plenty of such larger-than- life yet funny instances that make the viewer dissolve into laughter. I laughed out loud when the local PD, the DEA, the FBI and the ATF all arrive at Seal's hangar at the same time to arrest him - what could be the odds of such a thing happening (for real)? But does it work as a scene in a film? Hell yeah, it does!<br/><br/>Bold move to subvert the obvious sobriety which is usually associated with movies/TV shows that deal with the National Agencies or the notorious drug mafia of South America (and loaded with heaps of life-and-death situations) - the crew is never seen trying to inject an aura of despair - even when Lucy Seal (played by Sarah Wright, who's at least 20 years younger to Cruise) laments on how she cannot trust what her husband says or does, they still hold onto each other. <br/><br/>But..but..but the movie does feel a little stretched than required, especially towards the climax portions - we sense imminent danger when Seal chooses to rat out the cartel and when his brother-in-law does some pretty-indiscreet stuff (like carrying a money-bag in public with notes sticking out through the zipper, naturally garnering attention of the local PD, amongst others). We know there's a twist coming - one that offers closure. Domhnall Gleeson surely seems to having a ball playing Seal's CIA contact Monty Schafer. Cruise apparently did all(or most) of the flying himself - an amazing feat, as these scenes looked spectacular. We need Cruise in smaller-budget films (and less in franchise flicks, except maybe for the M.I series) where he can perform without worrying about the box-office outcome. After all, Cruise is still ""the gringo that always delivers"".<br/><br/>Verdict: Refreshingly breezy action-comedy!"

","When people see the ""come on"" based on a true story, most know that alert has lost some cachet over the years. We have seen films like Hidden Figures and The Imitation Game and know the protagonists never quite come close to the real people, so we tend to approach these films with a level of detachment. At best, we hope the actors picked do the real people some justice. I don't know enough about the character Tom Cruise plays in American Made to know how far off the mark the film is; but let's be honest: I would be a fool if I though Hollywood ""Blockbusters"" were trying to teach me authentic history. Regardless of authenticity, Cruise gives us a Barry Seal who is a highly watchable adventurer who somehow decides he can flip for the DEA and avoid the Medellin Cartel and Pablo Escobar. We end with an adventure movies just a bit short of being a modern Indiana Jones who has a larcenous heart. For pure entertainment and an increased adrenalin rush brought on by chomping down on popcorn, I would say American Made delivers. I don't know why some people dismiss Tom Cruise movies because he always delivers except for Eyes Wide Shut; but I figure Cruise saw the chance to work in a Stanley Kubrick production and missed all the cues that this was a bad project. Cruise does it all here and is just short of giving us a real Mission Impossible trip. Forget your Cruise animosity, see this is a movie theater with speakers rolling you around in your seat and chomp that popcorn."

","Based on a true story covering the Carter years to the Reagan/Bush administration. Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is a TWA pilot who in '78 supplements his income with a pickup and delivery service bringing in Cuban cigars via a Canadian connection. He catches the eye of the CIA who enlist him to take recce photos for them out of a shell corp., flying a hot twin-engine plane. Sure enough, he ends up supplementing his income again, heavier drugs this time, a regular trifecta of arms, drugs and currency on the behest of the CIA. He's ""protected"" by a crucifix dangling from his dash.<br/><br/>He'd do better to heed (Sirach 9:13) ""Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city."" If he gets on the wrong side of some drug pooh bah, it's the final curtain, and prison would make him a sitting duck. His brother-in-law JB (Caleb Landry Jones) is not trusted by the cartel to keep silence once he learns too much. Seal flies an intricate pattern to avoid getting snared by law enforcement, per CIA intel. And in the end he fears to start is car—kaboom!<br/><br/>""American Made"" opens at the Baton Rouge airport with a loudspeaker advising that a good place for history buffs is Louisiana. The average Joe will know that Thomas Jefferson wrote all men are created equal and that a later civil rights movement capitalized on the neglected equality of the Negro. History buffs, how­ever, familiar with the Louisiana debates will be aware that ""Negro equality"" never came up when Congress went over the slavery issue upon admitting Louisiana to the Union. People back then just didn't think in those terms. The Declaration of Independence was but an experiment in whether shop­keepers could run the government.<br/><br/>Sacred history addresses the other in the uniquely favored Noah who escaped a world-killing deluge, with his family. Seal was favored by the CIA and he packed off his family to settle in Mena, Arkansas and raise horses. (Gen. 9:18) ""And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan."" From Shem came the Semites, here via a British/American connection represented by Barry. Japheth (meaning enlarged—they settled every­where) are the Central Americans in this movie. Ham (the father of Canaan) through his son Cush (means black, settled in Africa) is represented in the movie by JB who doesn't get the family wealth but is given menial work. Ham's offspring were given a sentence of servitude on account of bringing into the post-flood world the wicked thoughts and violent deeds that got the old one drowned. JB also has a flourishing history of bad language and a record of two felonies. He is not a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The actual prophesy is (Gen. 9 :27) ""God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."" The Contras had a training camp on Barry's land, i.e. dwelling in the tents of Shem. The blacks in the movie served: a black DEA agent doing the drudge work following a money trail, and two colored boys offering parking of a hot plane in their yard, and a bike for a get­away. Lucy Seal (Sarah Wright), wife of Barry, escaped DEA confiscation with only what jewelry and fur coat she wore on her body. Noah escaped the judgment of being a drunken bum only by virtue of the covering his two sons Shem and Japheth gave him, Ham having mocked his father's nakedness, whence the judgment against Ham's offspring.<br/><br/>The above was for the benefit of the history buffs; it might sail over the heads of everyone else—sorry. What is explicitly explained, though, is the Contra-weapons-drugs-money-Sandinista (illegal) connection, with a hint of an Iran-Contra scandal to come, and a mention of the CIA trafficking drugs during the Vietnam fiasco. America is portrayed as both a land of opportunity as well as a land of some illegal shenanigans, though, surprisingly a relatively benign form of Negro slavery as justified by a Christian country is brushed aside by some historical bench­marks. The Confederate battle flag is proudly displayed in the South in the movie. The smuggled Cuban smokes is not condemned—people need their cigars. Virginia—where Robert E. Lee hails from—only imported slaves from the Caribbean—not from the brutal African trade—and then only to harvest their tobacco when there weren't enough laborers otherwise.<br/><br/>This movie portrays America with its warts of drug/arms trafficking, but it doesn't get all bent out of shape over the past slavery issue. I was of draft eligible age during the Vietnam War and didn't like what was going on with us there, so I have particular objections to what the CIA continued to do, as portrayed here. Never­the­less, I figured that if Barry could remain patriotic till his dying breath, after being used by his government, I can feel patriotic, too. This might be just me, a creature of contradictions at times, but the movie has the potential of inspiring good feelings for a flawed country. The LA history lesson is a bit obscure, except for history buffs, so I figure it's just history reasserting itself through an artist's open imagination, after being twisted by contemporary politics.<br/><br/>The plot was easy to follow. The American ""good guys"" were easy to root for even when they were technically on the wrong side of the law. Oh, well, some movies succeed despite inherit contradictions. Tom Cruise did well in his part of a regular guy getting in too deep. There were some great flight scenes."

","The one thing I always ask of biopics is entertainment. You don't have to make a completely faithful adaption of true events, we have Wikipedia for that. All I ask is for a film to provide entertainment while maintaining the spirit of the true events. I'm not entirely sure how close American Made stayed to the life of Barry Seal, but it's damn well one of the most entertaining films of the year. With a refreshingly great performance from Tom Cruise and a pace that rivals the best of Scorsese's based-on-true-story films, American Made is another gem collaboration from star Cruise and director Doug Liman.<br/><br/>American Made centers around the life of Barry Seal, a pilot who gets hired by the CIA to ship weapons to Central America and also gets caught up with drug cartels during his trips. The best way to describe this film is wild. But I think what I appreciated the most about it was it never felt like Liman was glorifying this irreverent lifestyle. Unlike say, Wolf of Wall Street, American Made never explicitly shows drug use, overtly sexualized scenes, or extreme violence. Instead, you get the full effect by just watching Seal go through ridiculous experience after ridiculous experience, and the smile never leaves Cruise's face.<br/><br/>You can tell Cruise is having a blast making this, and his performance certainly echoes that. I mean, it doesn't hurt that I still had the taste of that Mummy movie before watching American Made. Luckily, Cruise is surrounded by a talented cast who follow along with the energetic tone Liman brings. And the energy this movie brings is second to none this year. I absolutely loved the way Liman told this story, never allowing the political side of this story to get in the way of a fast-paced drama. <br/><br/>This isn't Goodfellas, Casino, or even Wolf of Wall Street, but American Made is a fascinating story that needed to be told and I'm glad Liman and Cruise were the ones who got the chance to tell it. Perfectly paced and infectiously performed, American Made is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"mt-95256","7","1","3","30 August 2017"," A few too many montages and some underdeveloped characters, but funny & fast-paced with non-stop laughs and thrills
","Biopics can be a tricky genre, their conventions prone to becoming stale and boring. Yet Liman and Cruise together brought us a refreshing and intriguing take on sci-fi/action films in Edge of Tomorrow – can they do the same for biopics? In short, yes and no. Though a simple but exciting story well-told and fun to watch, the biopic conventions and structures are the same we've seen before and become a little monotonous and repetitive.<br/><br/>In terms of structure and story it's very reminiscent of lots of crime biopics, particularly Scorsese's Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street; there are so many similarities – fans of these films are bound to enjoy elements of American Made, rife with innumerable montages and voice-overs. The problem is, once you take a step back and really look at it, there are just so many. A couple of scenes, then a montage with a voice-over, then another scene, followed by another montage accompanied by a montage; rinse repeat (and repeat). This is the structure the film follows for the majority of its run-time and it does start to wear a little thin, feeling repetitive.<br/><br/>Still, the plot itself is fairly light and simple while also being fun and entertaining, charting the progression of Barry's journey from rags to riches (and inevitably rags again), yet within these montages they cram so much in, it feels like an epic journey with a huge story. So much enjoyable detail is packed into these montages while still keeping the story flowing at an excellent pace that we never really get tired of the constant montages. They're fun, often amusing, and bring so much for us to enjoy. The film just doesn't slow down for you to think, evoking its protagonist's adrenaline- seeking nature – this is where so much of the fun and personality in the story come from.<br/><br/>More than this though, the montages are a perfect showcase of the style and personality the director injects into the film. The voice-overs are perfect accompaniments to the fun montages (full credit given to both Tom Cruise for his delivery and Gary Spinelli for his excellent screenplay), but it's the director's style that makes this film a fun affair, constantly laughing and poking fun at the danger Barry frequently finds himself in. It's light and comedic, with animated maps that are like a cross between Indiana Jones and Dad's Army. The music choices too aren't only authentic to the era, plunging us headfirst into the 1970s and 1980s, but really put us in the giddily excitable mood we should be in as we enjoy watching Barry get away with everything. It's a fun, cocky style that suits the main character and drives the film.<br/><br/>While Cruise's performance is spot-on, his portrayal of Barry Seal is similar to many other characters he's played; lovable, but cocky guys who always have a smart way out, laughing in the face of danger all the while. In many ways really he carries this film, showing his real talent as an actor since we never get fed up of nearly 2 hours of nigh on constant Tom Cruise. Still this is largely due to the fact that the script rarely gives anyone else a chance. The character we see the next most of would be Domhnall Gleeson's CIA man Schafer, who is wonderfully ambiguous as we never know whether he's good or bad, whether Barry should trust him or not. He keeps this going for the whole film and plays well opposite Cruise; it's just a shame he doesn't get a chance for his character to develop to the extent it could have done. The Medellín cartel too are excellent, a careful balance of welcoming charm with a sinister undercurrent of cruel menace and violence.<br/><br/>Sadly many other characters are unfairly marginalised, not having the screen time they really deserve. While Caleb Landry Jones has a nice brief turn as Lucy's annoying, trouble-making brother (a very similar role to his one in Get Out just a few months earlier), it's all too brief. This extends to the four pilots Barry recruits to join his little gang. Each of these characters could have been unique and quirky, befitting of the film's style and really enriching the roster of characters. Instead they're left by the wayside, occasionally appearing for plot-points or small laughs. It felt as if they were only included for the sake of accuracy to real life, whereas they could have been developed into wonderful little characters. Sarah Wright's Lucy however is the biggest missed opportunity. Continuing the comparison to The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese really did something excellent with Margot Robbie's character, Naomi, that part alone making the huge star she is today. If only the script had allowed for more to be made of Lucy in American Made. Beautiful, effortlessly sexy and loyal even when the going gets rough, Wright's portrayal is excellent and it's a joy to watch her. However, it feels like with a bit more she could have been more than just eye candy and the 'wife-left-back-home', the family scenes seeming less important that the money-grabbing main plot. Her inclusion improves as the film goes on, yet it still feels as though more could have been done with her. <br/><br/>Funny, fast-paced and with tons of enjoyable detail in more montages than you can count, this is a fun, stylish biopic which you can't help but enjoy. Though the structure (particularly the montages) can become repetitive, not much is done to make it stand out or refresh the biopic genre and despite the film focusing too much on Cruise when there were some potentially excellent characters left on the side, this is a crime-comedy-biopic that never slows down, giving you all the thrills and excitement Cruise's character is in constant search of."

","Do we ever fully comprehend how stupid or incompetent our own government can be?<br/><br/>Doug Liman, Tom Cruise, and company do Barry Seal justice in this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a lot of actual flying in this. Good for him. Nice to see.<br/><br/>While it might be the most important Hollywood film of 2017, American Made is not perfect.<br/><br/>First off, the wife character is not fleshed out enough. She seems just ancillary and undeveloped compared to the equivalent role in Wolf of Wall Street. Was there more left on the cutting room floor because it wasn't any good or was it just written this way? I can't say one way or the other if this actress had the chops to pull off an expanded part, but there's a disappointing lack of much attempt to give us more meat here.<br/><br/>This version of Seal has more of the CIA stuff in it than the Hopper film that not only left most of that out but attempted to make the DEA look blameless to over-the-top & embarrassing levels. American Made fibs a bit on how Seal left TWA, still doesn't go back far enough on Seal's actual agency connections, distorts the sequence of events of how Seal got into drug trafficking, and then fibs again at the end on the exact sequence of events when the Reagan administration outed him during their attempts to convince Congress to fund the Contras. <br/><br/>Seal was far more connected to the agency and for much longer than the Hopper film shows, with the DEA affiliation occurring later to keep him out of jail that the Hopper film does show. However, he was not conned into drug running due to his connections to the agency and he had a much longer history with both the agency and drugs than American Made portrays. The two, drugs and covert ops, simply went hand-in-hand and had been occurring for some time along with the gunrunning on their behalf. At least as far back as Vietnam, with some indications Seal was involved with the Bay of Pigs. The administration did indeed put his life in jeopardy, though it was not in such a visual manner as in this film.<br/><br/>I will also add that there are many further allegations not covered in this movie of the Clintons' complicity in CIA operations through Arkansas that explain some of Hillary Clinton's later bizarre agenda of continuing to promote revolutions around the world during the 2016 campaign, not to mention various other questionable deeds that have been revealed through Wikileaks.<br/><br/>There are also some odd connections between Obama's family and the agency, as well, which might explain some of the backlash against Trump from the intelligence community for him being an un-vetted, unconnected outsider with no prior affiliation or loyalty to them. You'd just had Reagan, Bush senior (former DCI), Bill Clinton, Bush Jr (who is portrayed here by the perfectly-cast Connor Trinneer), and now Obama in a row. Couldn't have been easy for the community to stomach. You don't need a conspiracy to have aligned interests, past connections, and sharp elbows resulting in new friction.<br/><br/>Oh, you might also want to go back and watch Blow after this. Carlos Lehder was helping the CIA out, too, and probably knew Seal was already CIA from the beginning of Seal's involvement with the Medellin cartel. It starts to explain why the cartel was so trustful of Seal even with his legal troubles and then went out of their way to try and involve the Sandinistas in drug smuggling if you have Lehder pushing for it and Seal there to help. Lehder is now in ""protective custody"" in the US federal prison system under an assumed identity.<br/><br/>Will the USA ever get the equivalent of Truth and Reconciliation as those supposedly inferior nations around the world have been achieving as they surpass us in justice and honesty? Probably not, but we get a small taste of it at least in our arts like here in American Made."

","Cruise is back! After two bad movies, Tom usually makes a solid movie as a comeback. What I liked about American Made is true stories or based on true stories are more entertaining than made up fiction! The over unbelievable can not be made up. How much the CIA knew and or wanted to know is left to the viewer's interpretation in American Made. The film starts out with strong character development with a bored, risk taking pilot aka Tom Cruise fits the profile for a CIA operative and is recruited. Cruise nails down the alpha male con man perfectly. Memorable scenes in the middle with the drug cartels, dangerous missions and reverting back to normal family life. The Beary Seal/Tom Cruise character theme is once Seal got in the dirty business, one can not say no and becomes deeper and deeper involved. Not that the shady character did not enjoy the benefits of the job and adrenaline of being an operative. Much humor is added to the middle of American Made with small town Arkansas with the C I A and drug money changing the town overnight during a recession. American made has a strong ending with the reality of an operative being told there is a risk and you will be left on your own. Nine stars."

","Cruise has a checkered history, with stories of: his bizarre marriage arrangements, his famous Oprah appearance, and, of course, his adherence to Scientology. Originally, Cruise was liked by the public, then fell out of the public's good graces, and now, due to his skill as an actor, is conditionally liked again. It seems only appropriate that Cruise could make you root for someone as dubious as Barry Seal.<br/><br/>""American Made"" tells the true story of Seal, a TWA pilot who got an offer to work from Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) for the CIA. He soon starts taking surveillance photos overseas when he stumbles onto a drug cartel. A little talk of money and he becomes a drug smuggler. When CIA learns of this, they decide to enlist him to transport guns to the contras. Pretty soon Seal has a thriving drug smuggling and gun running business.<br/><br/>Seal is very much the protagonist, but fails as a good guy. However, the movie doesn't pass any judgment on his actions, but instead tells the story of a man trying to provide for his family while his life spirals out of control. That's where Cruise comes into play. You may not like what Barry is doing. You may find his actions repugnant. But with Cruise in the role, and despite your better judgment, you sympathize with the character.<br/><br/>Like many movies based on a true story, facts are certainly jumbled up for effect. The director, Doug Liman, uses the narrative not to be critical of Barry Seal, but to be critical of the the CIA and the Reagan administration, which makes sense, since they were calling the shots. If Seal didn't takes the job, they would have found someone else and we'd have a movie about that guy.<br/><br/>This is all background however. Liman adds a lot of flair to the movie to create the time period and to make it less jarring when we cut to the copious amount of stock footage used in this movie. But this is very much a Tom Cruise vehicle. Despite your better judgment, you spend the movie cheering for his character.<br/><br/>""American Made"" does drag as Barry gets his business going and things run as expected for a while, but, fortunately, it's short. Overall, the movie was an interesting character study of a man with no real moral compass doing whatever he can to make money. Sadly, this film demonstrates that one can go far in this world if you don't allow issues such as laws and ethics distract you. Barry Seal seems like abysmal person, but I did enjoy spending two hours with him."

It did help that the movie starred international Superstar Tom Cruise - a star renowned for his action flicks. We were expecting a high dose of action & drama. Biopics have a good chance of succeeding if a lot of time has been devoted to researching the principal character & having a tight script in place.The makers have devoted good amount of time researching the life of Barry Seal - the CIA agent, who also ferried cocaine for the Medellin cartel of Pablo Escobar & it shows. But they falter in scripting the life journey of Barry Seal. Although a lot of exciting things may have happened during the life & times of Barry Seal, it is not shown in a manner which excites the audience. It feels more like a plain jane reportage of the events that happened in Barry Seal's life. The director has to be blamed for not building up the excitement like Martin Scorcese did in Wolf Of Wall Street or the way Lord Of War starring Nicholas Cage was made. The film does show a lot of improvement in the second half. It is one of the movies which has a better second half. The second half feels a tad bit similar to Lord Of War, but it still does keep you engrossed till the end. Tom Cruise is convincing in his role. We were a bit let down by the character playing Pablo Escobar. Netflix has set the benchmark for how the legendary Medellin drug cartel boss has to be portrayed. You expect Pablo Escobar to be a menacing character who very mention makes people shudder. But the guy playing Pablo in this movie seems like a caricature of the Netflix version. The makers probably did not want the attention to shift away from Tom Cruise! We weren't bored while watching the movie, but the movie lacked the adrenaline inducing, end of the seat ride that other aforementioned movies in the genre offer. A lot of people will probably will watch the movie, but what could have been an Oscar winning performance by Cruise is reduced to just another caper."

","The film has a dual-function title: Tom Cruise's character, based on Barry Seal (a maverick TWA pilot), is American born – and his fate is sealed (he's 'made') by a government assignment which tragically goes public.<br/><br/>The story opens with former president Jimmy Carter's broadcast- address 'The Crisis of Confidence' (which is fully available online). During it, Carter states that ""For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe, that the next five years, will be worse than the past five years."" <br/><br/>The lives of Seal and his family are soon better, then worse than, their prior years.

Barry's to fly for the fictitious company 'Independent Aviation Consultants', piloting the fastest prop-engine plane in the world to take reconnaissance pictures. Over time, his cargo will include drugs, AK47 rifles, and more cash than he's able to stash. He shuttles these items while risking his life in many countries. The scene with the first 'coke lift' to America has great music playing beneath it. <br/><br/>In one flight over El Salvador, an anti-aircraft gun blows out the left engine. Panama and Colombia are other nations, with which Barry Seal must deal. He first deploys airdrops of well-wrapped cocaine to America in Miami. Louisiana and Arkansas later unknowingly host drop-off spots for the illegal cargo. After delivering the cocaine, Seal must scrub the cargo hatch with a liquid chemical, to cover the scent of his delivered packages from dogs, used to detect the odor of illegally transported drugs.<br/><br/>Seal and his wife Debby soon attempt a normal family life – with three children as time passes – while Barry continues as a runner of guns, drugs, and money. Debby's brother JB becomes part of the enterprise, and at one point Ronald Reagan replaces Carter as president. Three planes (snowbirds) are required for transport of all the drugs. JB allows his mind to overlook the constant danger he's in; Barry is informed that the JB problem will be resolved without his involvement.<br/><br/>With a disco beat, the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony plays, as planes shuttle more illicit cargo. I believe ""MENA 1982"" was superimposed on the screen while this action and music played. This device, of showing locations (here a city in Arkansas), and the then-current year, helps viewers keep track of what's happening and when. <br/><br/>Cruise is magnificent throughout this work's breakneck speed, as is everyone else. A popular promo scene (while Bill Clinton is governor of Arkansas) is when Seal's in custody amidst ATF, DEA, FBI, and State Police personnel, wanting to claim him as their own detainee. While an enjoyable and intriguing film for some, it's also not suitable for the palate of others."

","The MPAA should probably consider a ""Whopper Alert"" warning for audiences who attend a motion picture prefaced with the phrase ""based on a true story."" And the first movie to feature the designation—in big red letters—should be ""American Made.""<br/><br/>""American Made"" is purportedly the true story of Barry Seal, a onetime TWA pilot who eventually became a minor peripheral player in the Iran- Contra political scandal which plagued the second term of the Ronald Reagan Administration. <br/><br/>The picture depicts Seal as an innocent adventurer recruited and co- opted by the CIA to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions over Central America. As Seals' value to the CIA increases, he's asked to become more deeply involved in highly illegal diplomatic interactions.<br/><br/>The film shows Seal becoming a courier between the US and Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, transporting weapons to Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras and eventually building an army of Contras training at a secret base in Arkansas. It's only a matter of time before Seal is captured by Columbian drug-lord Pablo Escobar, and compelled to run shipments of cocaine from Medellin to the US. <br/><br/>According to ""American Made,"" Barry Seal was the Forrest Gump of the Reagan Administration and Iran-Contra. In real life, Barry Seal was a reprobate and career criminal who was sentenced to ten years in a federal penitentiary before avoiding imprisonment by offering to become an informant against Escobar and the Medellin Cartel. The extent of the ""based on a true story"" designation is apparently that both the movie and the history books agree that Seal was once a pilot for TWA.<br/><br/>You'll never find an entertainer who works harder to please an audience than Tom Cruise. And in ""American Made,"" Cruise as Seal is the whole show, a fun-lovin' good ol' boy, a-servin' his country ""Air America""- style, and making a little money in the bargain. And it's astonishing how many audience members—and even film critics—are accepting ""American Made"" as a factual account of a confusing time in history. <br/><br/>But it just ain't so. Director Doug Liman, who also teamed with Cruise on the well-received ""Edge of Tomorrow"" in 2014, excuses ""American Made"" as ""a fun lie based on a true story."" And from his perspective, maybe it is.<br/><br/>Warner Bros. studios during the 1930s turned this sort of story into an art form, in a series of cautionary tales such as ""Little Caesar,"" ""The Public Enemy,"" and ""Bullets or Ballots."" And in each of those pictures, the message came through, loud and clear—Crime Doesn't Pay. <br/><br/>In ""American Made,"" that message is mostly lost in translation. A running gag in the movie is that every time Cruise as Seal leaves home to commit another abomination in the name of Uncle Sam, as a gesture of farewell he drops his pants and bares his butt to his family.<br/><br/>And in the end, that's the image we're left with—Tom Cruise, his famously dazzling grin turned away from the camera, mooning the audience in the name of democracy.<br/><br/>That's show biz, folks!"

","Between the time of Jerry McGuire & now, the only two Tom Cruise movies I've watched was War of the Worlds & Valkyrie, both of which I liked. But I am not a fan and avoid his movies. We went to see American Made because lately we're all swept up into NARCOS and the like. The subject matter interested us so we went. It was very good, better than expected. Tom Cruise in his best role AND his best acting. Maybe because he's older and wiser now, same age as me. Maybe he's had a good acting coach as of late. He's had much work done to his appearance, maybe this also lends to his ""rebirth"". He doesn't look like you remember him, this is a good thing. The film moved at a good pace, I was kept interested and involved throughout. I thought the relationship between Barry Seal and his wife Lucy was never fully developed. She's was just kind of there, keeping quiet & dragged through, never seen asking many questions but was seen dripping in jewelry and furs which we never saw being purchased or given to her. Just a disconnect in that relationship, probably because of time constraints. I think Caleb Landry Jones as JB, Lucy's broken brother, did a FABULOUS job. Wow, good acting there. We've watched much about the 1970's & 80's drug trade and the cartels, movies and documentaries. This was a different story I hadn't heard. I didn't know they dropped drugs into the swamp bayou in Louisiana! And much like Walter White & Pablo Escobar, one wonders how much is enough money before you can just stop- Just Say NO- and enjoy life. There is never enough . Give this one a chance."

","Whenever there is any kind of historical, political or cartel speak in a film; my brain turns to soft cheese, and so I cannot rely in great depth the full plot of American Made. I think however this fact makes it even more significant that I LOVED this film. I have watched so many dull and uninventive films recently so I may find myself a bit overzealous in my review but I did have fun! Right from the first moment; the shots where visually interesting and snappy. Barry seals' restless cot pit antics comically establishes the job apathy and dangerous gusto that leads to the characters illicit journey. Tom cruises skilled but naive character becomes swept up in seemingly impossible missions (sorry I just had to) to ship illegal goods over seas with the constant threat of death and incarceration. The film however doesn't take itself too seriously and at some moments becomes a bit ridiculous, which only added to my levels of enjoyment. There where many creative, teetering on surreal, features of this film. The highly saturated shots in the first half made everything look stylised and vibrant and even in a very functional shot there is plenty of lurid feasts. The garish early on shots I think where to mimic the hyper-real grading of 80s video cameras. As the film progressed the colour quality got progressively more modern and I thought this was a very innovative way of presenting the time frame of the film. My favourite section was the over the top montage with a spectacularly excessive classical music remix playing as Barry and his wife are dining out on their wealth in the most ostentatious ways possible. Another very mention-able part of the film was Domhnal Gleeson and his charming, weaselly performance as the CIA agent trying to entangle Seal in the films daring operations. To be fair to Seal if Gleeson had approached me with those levels of biting Charisma I probably would have been shipping Crack and Weaponry to Miami myself."

","It's been advertised as another dopey Tom Cruise action movie. In reality, American Made is the true story of Barry Seal given the full GoodFellas treatment. Yes, this film is in the tradition of such Scorsese inspired biopics of the past decade. It shares the political intrigue of War Dogs, the border smuggling decadence of Blow, the high octane energy of The Wolf of Wall Street and the comedic chops of The Big Short. It's deja-vu for sure, but who the hell cares? Real life is a Scorsese movie. Deal with it.<br/><br/>You will sit back and giggle with glee as this is, evidently, the best thing Tom Cruise has been involved with in years. He soars as Barry Seal. He captures the ""aw-shucks"" naiveté of a southern airline pilot way in over his head in a massive CIA conspiracy that at least 4 U.S. Presidents were complicit in. American Made takes no prisoners as it mocks political corruption and hypocrisy. But like GoodFellas and all the biopics after it, it tells the timeless story of just how far man will go to achieve unspeakable riches and the fatal cost of it all. Doug Liman makes the film fast and loose, especially on the cutting room floor. Between shaky, documentary style cinematography are countless archival clips from news reports, presidential speeches, pop-culture and even mock VHS recordings of Barry himself. Everything moves at lightning speed. This is a biopic for the age of the smartphone. You won't be distracted by anything. Fall 2017 has already proved to be a comeback season for moviegoers and American Made has already fallen under the radar in favor of other great films. Don't miss it."

","'American Made' is one of those films where I can't really think of anything particularly negative to say about it, but then I also can't really think of any major positives. On paper, it all works - it's one of Hollywood's 'true' stories, which basically means it's loosely based on people and events that actually happened. It has star-power, drama, high-tension moments and a good supporting cast. And yet only a day after watching it, I'm struggling to remember anything really to say about it.<br/><br/>Back in the late seventies and early eighties an American pilot Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) started smuggling drugs for the South American cartels, but was subsequently 'recruited' by a CIA man Monty 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson) to start double-crossing the drug dealers and gathering evidence for the White House.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is no stranger to headlining films and therefore is the perfect leading man to root for. There's no shortage of budget for the production and all the sets look like they're set in the appropriate time period, plus there are some dramatic moments which utilise the dramatic elements of danger associated with trying to doublecross organised crime. Plus the story is - relatively - true, therefore it adds an element of interest knowing that this actually happened. Yet I still felt a little unsatisfied.<br/><br/>I've checked other reviews online and it seems that I'm in the minority. Most people seemed to really love it and think it was great. I guess it was watchable enough, but not memorable. Perhaps because I'm part of that 'older' generation, I've seen plenty of films such as this that are based on trues stories where one man is recruited by some law enforcement agency and has to infiltrate the mob. It's like I've seen all this before and 'American Made' didn't offer enough that was new in order to make me remember it too well or even want to see it again.<br/><br/>If this is your thing, or you don't know that much about 'true' crime then you should enjoy it. I did. I just don't really think I'll ever bother watching it again. For me, it was certainly one of those films where I'm happy to watch on an online streaming service, but would never bother buying on DVD. At least it proved that Domhnall Gleeson can do more than just shriek and be the 'comedy bad guy' in those depressing new 'Star Wars' movies."

","I had no idea what to expect from this film, although seeing it listed as a comedy certainly gave me misgivings. I needn't have worried as this is a fast-paced and highly entertaining thriller that tells a story so incredible that it couldn't be fiction. Tom Cruise plays a wide-eyed novice and pilot who finds himself in an increasingly bizarre situation thanks to his skills in the cockpit. The megastar contributes surprisingly goofy charm here which works well compared to his other mainstream roles. The complex storyline leads to weirder and weirder events before he takes a central part in America's drug war in South America under Reagan. Excellent special effects and flying scenes contribute to a lively narrative with style to spare; it's reminiscent of the glory days of GOODFELLAS in that respect. Plenty of twists keep you watching and the ending is both inevitable and satisfying. Doug Liman's best film since THE BOURNE IDENTITY? I think so."

The tone/approach was just light and nostalgic enough to maintain balance between dark and entertaining. The protagonist seems both morally questionable and highly likable from moment one because - well - it is Cruise. There's a fair amount of fluff here, but it is hard not to enjoy the fluff.

","1978. Barry Seal, an airline pilot, is recruited by the CIA to fly special transport missions in Central America.

Told in a very light-hearted, fun way it is a roller-coaster ride of humour and action. The humour stems largely from the ineptness and unintended consequences of the actions of the CIA and US government. If told in a more serious way, this would have been a very damning indictment of the US's involvement in Central America in the 1980s, and a powerful examination of how the CIA and US government abuse the loyalty of their own citizens. <br/><br/>However, the story is told as a comedy, with absurdity piled upon absurdity, so difficult to believe.

To quote but one example : the CIA hires a pilot in order to transport weapons from point A to point B. This is supposed to become a long-time arrangement, whereby the man executes numerous flights. The pilot does execute numerous flights. However, he does not drop off his cargo at point B, he drops off his cargo at point C, so that the weapons benefit a whole different party. The CIA does not notice or suspect this fact for a very long time.<br/><br/>Really ?<br/><br/>This, at least to my untrained ears, sounds highly implausible. One would think that someone somewhere would notice that the supposed beneficiaries go weaponless, in the same way that someone somewhere would notice that a third party is receiving huge amounts of weapons it isn't entitled to. Moreover, one would think that the CIA would have some kind of monitoring or supervision protocol, especially when dealing with persons known to be quixotic and unreliable. But nah, the CIA entrusts a delicate and costly mission to a known maverick, without checking progress or results. There are small-town cupcake bakers who run their business with more vigilance.<br/><br/>""American made"" does deserve credit for pointing out that the CIA has a sad habit of interfering in international affairs, often in the most duplicitous or violent way. However, these episodes deserve a far more searching and in-depth approach than the one provided by the movie."

","In 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is a TWA pilot smuggling cigars into the country. He is recruited by CIA operative ""Schafer"" (Domhnall Gleeson). At first, he does surveillance flights over Nicaragua. He's also delivering money to mid level military officer Noriega in Panama. As he and his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) grow their family, he supplements his income by smuggling drugs for Pablo Escobar. Later, he is pulled into the Contra affair as he diverts guns intended for the Contra to Escobar.<br/><br/>This is directed by Doug Liman. Initially, I didn't realize it watching this movie. I was very impressed with the quality of the movie until the credits started to roll. Of course, Liman is no slouch. Honestly, I was expecting a crappy Cruise misfire. In reality, this is quite the opposite. I love Cruise in this roguish role. Knocking out his tooth struck me as extremely hilarious. I love this character better than his need to be loved in many of his leading man roles. The other main part of this movie is the Based on a true story. As most Based movies, there are only slivers of truths. In many ways, it fits Barry Seal well. He's a character of lies and this is a movie of lies. This is a fun romp through a history what if."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","1","28 February 2018"," American Made is a slyly comedic drug fuelled escapade about the career of Barry Seal.
","I used slyly due to the themes involved, it involves the Iran-Contra affair that gripped Central America in the 80's. It's a well documented scandal, we had The Infiltrator last year which tackled the same subject. What started off as simply taking photos in Colombia, turned into smuggling cocaine. Then smuggling guns. Oh, don't forget smuggling Contra fighters. Then hiding all the laundered money. Outwitting the DEA, ATF, CIA, FBI, State Police and Pablo Escobar. I mean a lot happened to Seal over the course of 7 years, which is what made this film enjoyable. It's pacing is very brisk, something is always happening and the inclusion of Seal's narration helps to outline the plot without making the audience seem unintelligent. It's not just Seal's ""career"" that the plot revolves around, it's also his personal life. His family are suddenly brought into a lavish lifestyle of riches, and surprisingly his wife's greed actually makes her an asset to him as she starts to hide the laundered money. An interesting dynamic between the two but a clear statement that money corrupts everyone...including the innocent. Tom Cruise gives a hundred percent as always, I found him to be charismatic and charming which made Barry a likeable character. Supporting cast were decent, particularly Domhnall Gleeson. The editing and direction felt fresh, with plenty of stop frames and embedded animation to enhance the subtle comedic undertone. The story felt very light hearted. It wasn't heavy to a point where it felt depressingly dull, it was a fun creative vision on a formulaic film that has been portrayed many times. There just was not enough substance to substantiate a longish runtime. The plot is constantly going back and forth much like with Barry and his smuggling, it took too long to actually progress and therefore was not always engaging. The ending was slightly rushed and anti-climatic in comparison to the finely developed second act. Well crafted, just too empty."

"blrnani","6","0","1","11 February 2018"," Black comedy
","This film stands as an enjoyable adventure romp in the best TC style, but at heart it is a black comedy, although that may come as a surprise to non-Americans constantly bombarded by the notion that the USA is the bastion of virtuous western civilized values, particularly as, unlike ""Wag The Dog"", this is not fiction, but 'alternative facts'. There are sources that will tell you how this film deviates from the true facts, but it is sufficiently close to what actually happened to send out a valuable warning.
And the warning is basically what is likely to happen when an individual with a defective moral compass goes through life saying ""Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun"". The extreme version is provided by Barry's brother-in-law, who has no moral compass whatsoever, but is driven exclusively by the gratification of his own immediate desires, to a degree that even the flawed Barry finds shocking. It is a timely lesson, given the way the Trump presidency and related worldwide turbulence is challenging everybody's values and calling us to reassess the world we want to live in from here on.
It's also a warning about how an ""America First"" policy will continue to feed injustice and divide the world along competitive lines, just when we are most needing to work together to solve the problems the planet and human society are facing.
so you can enjoy this film at the most superficial level, or on a much deeper one, but either way it is good entertainment."
"Bradhowe128","6","0","1","6 February 2018"," An exciting work of FICTION.
","Before I get down to it, let me just say that this was a highly entertaining work of PURE FICTION that is VERY LOOSELY inspired by true events. Much like films that fall along the lines of The Wolf of Wall Street, I, Tonya and A Beautiful Mind, Hollywood has thrived on taking true stories and bending them every which way strictly for entertainment purposes. I am in no way against this (except for the new, festering terd of a Bruce Lee film, that **** I took personal). Sometimes the truth is bland, uninteresting and doesn't make for good cinema. If the true story of The Wolf of Wall Street stuck to the truth from start to finish, it would've been called, The Wolf of Long Island (Yawn!). 
Other times they bend the truth to push towards an agenda which doesn't suit well with fans unless they fully agree with that agenda or are willing to blindly follow it.
But I digress, this movie was entertaining and I would like to give it justice.
American Made is an action packed adventure that depicts the events of Adler Berriman ""Barry"" Seal, who was an American airline pilot who became a major drug smuggler for the MedellÃ­n Cartel. I thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences, the story behind who this man was, and the humor behind it all.
However, a lot of the events in this movie that were made up or sugar coated to be more dramatic. Barry Seal never worked for the CIA, he worked for the DEA after being arrested to avoid jail time. But again, I guess it generates more controversy and caters to a far left audience to weave an anti-CIA rhetoric into the plot.
The war in Nicaragua between the Contras and the Sandinistas was another subject the film touched. However, the film claims that Barry helped the CIA arm the Contras by smuggling guns across the boarding only for him to be turned down by the CIA who allegedly claimed ""the Contras had no interest in fighting, they just wanted to sell drugs and make money"". Hmmm... I would LOVE to hear what my Nicaraguan friends and family have to say about that.
Overall, this was a fun film. Many (if not all) of the events throughout the 80's and in Barry's life were highly fabricated. So when watching this, like many films like this, be aware that this movie was not factual by any means. If you want to know what really happened with this man and his real story, his biography has raving five star reviews; Smuggler's End: The Life and Death of Barry Seal. Tom Cruise's acting and wittiness he put into the role added to the excitement of this film as well.
Scored: 3.5/5 stars

"asifahsankhan","9","0","2","5 February 2018"," Tom Cruise flies high as a fictional Barry Seal reaching heights he hasn't in years!
","Well, after Fargo turned out to be a totally made up story, I'm sure that most people have doubts on this movie. The back story of Pablo Escobar flying in coke to the US is true, the Oliver North selling the weapons via the Contra and the Iranians is true, the drug corruption of Col. Noreiga is all true, many elements are true as far as the back story, which makes for a great story. Actually, there was a Barry Seal, who did smuggle drugs, so that's why this story works well. Plus they really nailed the period dress, cars and boats that made for a great atmosphere. Plus there are funny tie-ins like George Bush, Ronald Reagan and even Bill Clinton. There was even some debate whether George Bush, ex head of the CIA had Barry killed or was it Escobar in a book by Shaun Attwood.<br/><br/>So was this better than Mummy?<br/><br/>Definitely, better. It shows the difference a well developed plot and characters can make in a movie. Plus I think this role really is a good fit for Tom Cruise, since we all know him as Top Gun. We all naturally assume he's a good pilot, so it always helps to have that background. The pilot Barry Seal is this bored TWA pilot approached by the CIA to start photographing all the USSR/Cuba communist supported troops in Central America. Of course he jumps at the opportunity having grown bored in a job similar to what we all have in life.<br/><br/>How well does Sarah Wright play his wife Lucy? She helps to build up the common man wife of a pilot for the movie. She is actually from Kentucky, so that really helps give the Old South feel to the movie. Barry has to convince her of his nefarious dealings with the CIA despite losing their vaunted health care. Not sure if that's a jab at private health care, but she makes the sauce of the marriage work in the movie and is a great partner in crime for Barry. <br/><br/>One of the best contrasts that really shows both of their original country roots is her cousin JB, who goes on to create endless trouble for the two. He really defines country stupid all around, but especially fits in Mene, Arkansas for the most part. <br/><br/>How was the Pablo Escobar introduction handled? I think for the small part he plays in the movie, the actors playing his gang are impressive. They are the ultimate downfall of Barry, since he can't untangle himself as one of the key suppliers for Pablo in the movie. Barry looks aside the danger in the first bust, where he ends up losing a whole tooth in a Colombian jail. Luckily, his CIA pal Monty Schafer shows up and bails him out.<br/><br/>The real Seal made daily deposits of $50,000 to his Honduran account through the early '80s. The filmmakers show him frantically burying duffle bags of cash in his backyard until he runs out of room because, well, that's funnier. Liman and Cruise want the audience to have a good time watching Seal play one side against the other. So comic scenarios are concocted out of whole cloth. In the film, for example, Seal pays regular visits to Manuel Noriega to pick up intel and deliver government payoffs. In real life, he may have used one of Noriega's runways.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, American Made is an undeniably good time. It's briskly paced and amusingly absurdist. Cruise has rarely been as magnetic, perhaps because he's portraying a human being and not the kind of bulletproof action figure he's played for most of the past two decades. One thing the film isn't, though, is thoughtful.<br/><br/>Even when Seal finds himself at the center of what would become the Iran-Contra scandal or is saved from jail by a last-minute call from president Bill Clinton, Liman and co. never pause to give events time to take on meaning. While that's a legitimate artistic choice, it's also a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>It's fine to make a screwball comedy with government agencies running in circles like bureaucratic Marx Brothers. But I can't help imagining what this movie might have been if Liman had cut the engine occasionally, allowing viewers a moment to reflect on its ominous mix of Hollywood and history.<br/><br/>With all the talk of making the country great again these days, we could use a wake-up call. Liman's film almost offers an unsettling reminder of the nightmare ""Morning in America"" often was."

","America Made is certainly above average. It is not the best movie in the world but it just a little above average.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again did a incredible performance in this movie. The supporting cast also had great acting as well. there were only a few rare moments that the acting was a bit rusty or off. Other than that i don't have much more to say about the acting in this movie other than it was great.<br/><br/>Usually when I review or talk about a movie I don't judge the movie too much on the cinematography but in this movie the cinematography started out good. Not great or anything just your average movie. But then towards the end the cinematography was just plain strange and quite bad in parts. Some parts more than others as well. The camera sometimes quickly zoomed in then out slightly for no reason and it made the movie have a amateur tone to it. Some of the directorial decision i thought were off as well such as when Barry seal (Tom Cruise) got shot and killed. That sort of bleeds into another segment though.<br/><br/>That segment being run time. This movie ran for 1 hour and 55 minutes which is a good length for a movie. I have liked movies to be at least 105 minutes long which equals to 1 hour and 55 minutes but this movie didn't need to go for that long. They could have cut out about 10-15 minutes worth of unnecessary footage and scenes that either didn't progress the story or weren't entirely needed. When Barry Seal got shot and the camera failed (like I was talking about just before) the camera freeze framed because of course it got shot along with Barry. This freeze frame lasted for way too long to the point when I was wondering if it had actually frozen or not. Just little things like that made me dislike this movie a little more.<br/><br/>The writing of this movie now. To be honest i was quite impressed at how smooth the dialogue was. The dialogue was smooth and progressed well and wasn't patchy. With some characters the writing seemed a bit bland and they didn't seem to have much personality at stages. But Barry Seal's (Tom Cruise) dialogue was well crafted and well executed. I think in part this is because of Tom Cruises suburb acting ability.<br/><br/>Movies about drugs are sometimes seem to glorify drugs and make them seem like a cool, good thing. This movie did that a bit. It seemed to make this business look cool and something you can make a lot of money from reasonably easily. vibes like these rub me up the wrong way and make me a little annoyed about why theirs so many of these movies. It makes you not really like the character all that much. It didn't really help with the fact that the main character was a bit rude and arrogant at times which made me really not like him. a character being one or all of these things can work and can make you either root for the character or at the very least like them. But this is one of the movies that shows drugs in a almost good light. If this is to be achieved and executed well there needs to be at least a character or two against it to make it look not all that good and happy. You could argue that it fixed this issue when the people he was trafficking for killed him and JB but by then I think that it was too late. it did have some aspects of the film that were about that but not enough to balance it correctly.<br/><br/>In conclusion this was a decent film. It had great acting and pretty good writing. the way that some themes and issues were displayed in the movie didn't seem right and weren't balanced correctly though. It was a bit above average and for that reason I am going to give it a 7/10."

","American made<br/><br/>Loosely based on the exploits of Barry Seal an airline pilot who was recruited by the CIA in 1978.
I say loosely because this film would seem too far fetched if it wasn't actually based on true events.
His task was to photograph facilities in Central America before he realised he could make more money trafficking drugs for the Medellin Cartel who were associated with Pablo Escobar.
When I say a lot more money, I really do mean this as the bags of cash soon begin to pile up in what becomes a thoroughly enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise hasn't been this good in years. The light hearted and comedic approach of this film allows Cruise to have a good time with his role as Barry Seal and he gets to exercise those acting chops of his.
He owns every second he is on screen and carries this film to the heights of one of the years most entertaining movies.
Director Doug Liman's film grabs you from the opening frame and takes you on an adventure that doesn't let up until the credits role.
Obviously Seals exploits are overly exaggerated but the way in which both director and star deliver this excellent piece of cinema allows the audience to laugh,gasp and cry as the main character stumbles from one fortune to another.
Things don't always go so well for our leading man and that's what really rivets the audience.
There's only so many times you can role the dice and Lady Luck won't stay by your side forever.<br/><br/>A film that is ultimately as sad as it is funny, showing how greedy we are as a species.
A rather thought provoking moment is when Cruise's character is handed the umpteenth large bag of cash as reward for his cooperation with the Cartel.
Cruise almost sighs as he realises he has nowhere else to put all the money.
Hilarious when he his forced to bury it in his garden only for his dog to dig it back up.
Seal casually says ""I'll rake it up in the morning"" when his wife tells him there's notes blowing all over the garden.<br/><br/>American made is a movie that reminded me of Spielberg's Catch me If you can. Another flick loosely based on the adventures of a character that seems too large for real life.<br/><br/>An absolute blast from start to finish. American made is a must see and a refreshing change to have Tom Cruise in a role such as this."

","Barry Seal is the youngest pilot at TWA in the 70s. He's recruited by the CIA to do risky low altitude flights over Central America and take pictures of Soviet training camps. He succeeds and that helps his handler and himself. Now he's also tasked with delivering payments to Panamanian strongman Noriega in return for intel on the communists. Seal eventually catches the attention of the Medellin cartel who want him to transport cocaine to Miami. He instead suggests and convinces the cartel that dropping of shipments over Louisiana is better. He continues to do well on both fronts. The CIA buys him a huge piece of land in Arkansas including airport and Seal expands the drug transport operation. Once a leftist government is elected in Nicaragua, the CIA in its usual harebrained thinking process decides to repeat its mistakes and arm some guys claiming to be rebels. It's Seal's job to transport the weapons to the Contras. But of course these guys aren't interested in fighting someone else's war. The CIA then decides to train the rebels in the US and again Seal is tasked with the human trafficking. But the Nicaraguans would rather run away in the US than get trained. The cartel wants in on the action so it gets Seal to fly the weapons to Colombia instead.<br/><br/>In the process Seal amasses a huge fortune that he buries in his backyard, fills up his mansion, deposits in banks all over Arkansas. Presumably the rest of his crew also does well so much so that suddenly Mena, the small town in Arkansas, becomes filled with banks. This eventually catches the attention of the FBI, ATF, DEA who arrest him. But the judge, after getting a call from governor Clinton lets him go in exchange for services he can provide to the government. It wants him to produce pictures tying the Central American communists to Colombian drug lords. Again, Seal delivers, but one of the pictures is leaked by someone to the press, a picture that shows him too. Now that Colombians, who have proven that they able to get to people in the US, know that they've been deceived by Seal and will try to get him. <br/><br/>American Made is a strong action light comedy of the rise-and-fall of corrupt guy. Direction, editing, and music follow the Scorsese pattern to some extent. For the most part we are spared the family drama though but still, we get too much Cruise and not enough anyone else, especially the lovely Sarah Wright. Cruise overdoes his usual light-hearted approach; no matter the situation, he's nothing but smiles throughout the entire movie keeping things lighter than they need to be given the serious issues involved. But it's the story (and Wright) that shines, which is based to some extent on reality and the strange turns that Seals life take. Overall, a highly entertaining movie."

Based on a true story as written by screenwriter Gary Spinelli and directed with skill by Doug Liman, the facts are fascinating (the back story of the Iran-Contra affair), the multileveled changes to the story line pointing out the corruption and misdirection of the US in Central American affairs - all is brought to credible levels by the superb performance of Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>The film is cleverly related in video flashback segments made by the lead character Barry Seal. Opening in the year 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) works as a pilot for Trans World Airlines. He is married to Lucy (Sarah Wright) and has two children with her, with a third on the way. Barry was recruited by the CIA (via agent Monty Schaefer played well by Domhnall Gleeson) who offers Barry better money by taking on reconnaissance missions for the CIA in a smaller plane with cameras just south of the border. Schafer convinces Barry that he would be working for the good guys, but it would have to be kept completely secret, even from his own family. He then lets Barry take the plane out for a ride. Through a series of odd circumstances Barry becomes a drug-runner, catches the attention of the Medellín Cartel associated with Pablo Escobar (Mauricio Mejia) who needs a man with his skill set. Barry becomes a drug trafficker, gun smuggler and money launderer. Schafer asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua. Barry invites pilots that are his friends and plots routes to smuggle drugs for the cartel. The CIA closes eyes to the scheme and Barry becomes richer and richer. He uses the Arkansas town Mena to laundry his money. But the DEA and the FBI are tracking him down. When the CIA shuts down the scheme, Barry is left alone and arrested by the agencies. Barry's wife's brother JB (Caleb Landry Jones) is a freeloader who adds to the mounting problems and tragedies. <br/><br/>To add to the sense of reality the film includes snippets of President Reagan's speeches and brig sin Oliver North (Robert Farrior), offers extended shots of flying the planes of the mission, and keeps the dialog in Central America in Spanish. The cast is strong, but the film goes on too long - the saving grace is the performance of tom Cruise who is wholly convincing as the now infamous Barry Seal> A bit of history that now somehow seems more credible than when it was first reported!"

","Review:
This movie actually didn't start off to bad, mainly because of the fast paste storyline which gets straight to the core of the plot but after a while it seemed to go round and round in circles. The main character, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) kept on jumping into situations without a care in the world, and his hunger for money was bound to lead him down the wrong path. Anyway, Cruise plays a talented pilot, working for TWA, who is approached by an CIA agent, Monty (Domhnall Gleeson), who wants him to work for him. Basically he wants Barry Seal to take pictures of various places over Central America, using a state of the art aeroplane, so he gladly takes the job, which means that he has to leave TWA. After several successful missions, he is approached by the Medellin Cartel, who want him to traffic large quantities of drugs to the USA, which he takes on for a high price. Monty then asks Barry to carry weapons for the Contras in Nicaragua, so with several jobs on board, he recruits some of his friends to help him. With loads of cash flooding in, Barry becomes close friends with the cartel, and he starts to have problems laundering the cash in his small town in Arkansas called Mena. With business booming, and his wife Lucy Seal (Sarah Wright) loving the lavish life, the DEA and the FBI starts to investigate his business, so the CIA decides to shut down the whole operation, which leaves Barry without any protection. He is then forced to strike a deal with the agents, which causes problems with the cartels and leaves him fighting for his life. It's quite an interesting storyline, which is set in the 70s, during Pablo Escobar's multi-million dollar rein as a drug dealer. Tom Cruise was a decent choice to play Barry Seal but he seemed to be taking on jobs without thinking about the consequences, especially as he had 2 kids and a wife. I wouldn't say that it was an in depth look into Barry Seal because the movie concentrated more on the crazy situations that he got himself into. With that aside, I still found this biopic entertaining, and it was amazing to see how the cartels was flooding the world with there drugs but it's not in the same league as Blow or Goodfellas. Personally I think that this movie needed some other stars, to be in the same league as other big movies in this genre but it's still worth a watch. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Doug Liman, 52, who also brought you Getting In, Swingers, Go, The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Jumper, Fair Game and Edge of Tomorrow, which also starred Tom Cruise. Judging by he's previous movies, he's a versatile director, who has taken on different projects which have made an impact in Hollywood but this movie seemed mediocre in scale. I would have liked to have seen the aftermath of Barry Seals life, which would have shown what happened to his family, the cartels and the CIA who started the whole mess in the first place but the director chose to keep it simple, which wasn't a good idea. It's good to see Tom Cruise in a different light, especially after the poor Mummy movie which was a total let down but there is something in the back of my mind that's telling me that this movie would have been better if there was someone else in the leading role. Anyway, I was surprised with the outcome but it won't be an old time classic.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million
Worldwide Gross: $135million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Biography, Comedy
Cast: Tom Cruise, Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Jesse Plemons, Caleb Landry Jones, Lola Kirke and Jayma Mays. 6/10"

"MplusA92","6","0","1","3 January 2018"," There is something dirty behind everything American
","The ""Based on True Story"" statement is not so true in that situation, it can be considered as inspired only from Barry Seal real story, in addition it's not a real classical Biography movie, also a lot of details in that movie about the life of Barry Seal are not true,So we come to a question, Is this movie to improve the picture of a corrupt pilot who used every situation in his life for his own benefit ? or Is there any hidden message the movie makers want to deliver ? or Is it the image of the American Hero whom we should look forward at ?<br/><br/>The major differences between the real life of Barry Seal and the movie are:
-He was recruited early in life before joining TWA by different governmental agencies to transfer guns to Cuba from CIA and he did flying operations for U.S Army before Vietnam War.
-He didn't resign from TWA but he got fired for falsely citing medical leave and was arrested for trying to fly plastic explosives.
-No Schafer or Monty in real life.<br/><br/>That was story wise, but about the movie it self it was below the expectations, the spirit of Tom Cruise is the only thing that will make you continue watching it. <br/><br/>Finally,it's an average somehow action movie with good ups and downs but i think it's a little bit elongated. You may enjoy it if you just love Tom Cruise regardless any other component in the movie."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","2 January 2018"," A Fun Lie Based On A True Story That's Casual, Cavalier & Carefree
","From the director of The Bourne Identity & Edge of Tomorrow comes a breezy & lighthearted biopic that's not only aware of the limitations it imposes on itself but is more than happy to work within those confinements. Definitely not aiming for much, it is a fun-filled delight that does what it set out to do.<br/><br/>The story of American Made follows the life & exploits of Barry Seal, a former airline pilot who flew missions for the CIA before becoming a drug runner for the Medellín cartel during the 1980s. But playing for both sides has its consequences, and it all eventually comes crashing down for ""the gringo who always delivers.""<br/><br/>Directed by Doug Liman, the film creates its own version of Barry Seal, using only snippets of his real-life exploits while imagining other events in a way that serves well to its entertainment purposes. The narrative unfolds at a swift pace, is always on the move, and Liman does well to keep the interest alive with its amusing tone & fun vibe.<br/><br/>Its varying set pieces evoke the required timeline while its groovy camerawork & warm colour palette help add a tinge of warmth to its images. Editing makes sure the film remains an engaging ride, despite its weak plot & poor characterisation, and paces the plot brilliantly. And its score & incorporated songs add flavours of their own into the finished material.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, American Made rides heavily on Tom Cruise's flair, on-screen charisma & magnetic presence, and the actor does all in his power to steer the film past the finish line. His input has an energetic, jovial quality to it that makes us root for his shady character at times, and he's finely supported by the remaining cast, especially Domnhall Gleeson who plays a CIA officer.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, American Made is a fun lie based on a true story that's casual & carefree, and works mainly due to Doug Liman's kinetic direction & Tom Cruise's dynamic poise. Better than what I expected even though I didn't expect much, it's a sunny, sparkling & serviceable ride that promises an enjoyable time and delivers it. Although not a memorable entry by any means, American Made is nonetheless worthy of a shot."

","This is a good movie, however, it feels more like a documentary than a story. It is based on a true story, however, after doing research on the movie, most of it has to be taken with a grain of salt. In essence, there was a Barry Seal, he ran drugs for Pablo Escobar, he was caught by the DEA in 1983, he made a deal with them in 1983 to spy on the cartels, and was eventually assassinated by the cartels. The rest, as far as I can tell, is unsubstantiated."

","My decision to watch this film, came through boredom and an idea that in the New Year I would expand my film knowledge and watch as many different movies and TV shows as possible. I was hardly excited as the genre isn't really something I find myself easily immerged in. I am happy to say, I was wrong...<br/><br/>The film has a strong acting cast, as in their ability and portrayal of the characters are more than realistic. The Main Character is loosely based on an actually person, although the portrayal and certain aspects of the story are clearly fictional. Tom Cruise give a phenomenal performance, and before you think I'm just being a 'fanboy', this is the only motion picture I've seen Tom Cruise in. <br/><br/>The story follows a man, who is contacted by the CIA to do work. He's then brought into the Mexican Drug Cartel, and the story escalated from there. It is fast paced and consistently moving. Most scenes are very realistic, and feel like you could go somewhere in the world, and witness them first hand. That being said, I did find one scene, which broke the immersion for me. The scene in question, is when the Main Character crash lands his plane in the streets, I'll say no more. <br/><br/>The sexual nature of this film is spot on, and portrays enough to aid the story, without needing it to make the story. As a man, I obviously enjoy a good sex scene here and there, but I find they are over used in way too many scenarios, and often don't make sense. This film didn't do that, and although one scene with the Main Character mooning in a flashback, didn't fit, I understood it, as the film progressed, and realised it was more than a cheeky flash. <br/><br/>With all that being said, I went in to this film, with the idea I would be browsing the web, or playing on my phone as my interest in the movie died. Never did I expect the film to keep me on the edge of my seat, with me consistently putting off a much needed trip to the bathroom. I thoroughly enjoyed this motion picture, and would welcome a sequel with open arms. <br/><br/>If you're thinking of watching this film yourself, I would strongly advise putting the kids to bed, locking the doors, and turning your phones off. If your spouse is like mine, and enjoys talking through the films, some tape may be required, as you won't want to miss this film. So grab a nice hot drink and use it as an excuse to indulge in a little more chocolate than you should. <br/><br/>Oh, and use the bathroom..."

","In this Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, Fair Game) directed and Gary Spinelli (Stash House, American Made) written film, Tom Cruise (A Few Good Men, Mission Impossible) stars as Barry Seal and ordinary pilot for TWA who smuggles Cuban cigars and is recruited by the CIA. <br/><br/>
Monty Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson: About Time, Ex Machina), his CIA handler asks him to photograph facilities over Central America, then be courier to General Noriega (Alberto Ospino in his first film), carry weapons to the Contras in Nicaragua and more. Soon his work attracts the attention of the Medellin Cartel, Jorge Ochoa (Alejandro Edda: The Bridge, TVs Fear the Walking Dead), Carlos Lehder (Fredy Yate Escobar in his first movie) and Pablo Escobar (Mauricio Mejia: El Chapo, La Viuda Negra), and he begins to work for both them and the CIA. <br/><br/>
Barry gets very rich as a drug trafficker, gun smuggler and money launderer, and becomes 'the gringo that always delivers,' using the small town of Mena, Arkansas to launder the profits. But the DEA an the FBI are tracking him down. What will happen to his family if he gets arrested?<br/><br/>
Sarah Wright (The House Bunny, Walk of Shame) plays Barry' wife Lucy, Caleb Landry Jones (Get Out, Contraband) as her hapless brother Bubba and Jayma Mays (The Smurfs, TVs Glee) Dana Sibota, who wishes to put Barry away for his crimes.<br/><br/>
The movie is based on the life of a real person but whether we get the truth is debateable. It doesn't seem to matter a the film is pure entertainment.<br/><br/>
Tom Cruise is great in this film, exuding all the cockiness and humour that the role demands. When Barry Seal is doing well we live the journey with him in every way and when things take a turn for the worse, we root for him despite knowing how history played out.<br/><br/>
I loved the 80s setting, the plane sequences and the superb acting, you almost forget that Seal was profiting off a life-ruining product.<br/><br/>
Tom Cruise plays a pilot in Top Gun in 1986 and in this film he plays a real-life pilot in the same era which is a strange irony, as is the character of Seal who is a man of questionable decisions, putting his family and his life in jeopardy for profit, yet we as an audience, like him any way."
"demetrius11","5","0","3","8 December 2017"," Please no more Escobar movies !
","Sadly this is one of the worst Tom Cruise movies ever made. To me it felt more like a documentary than an actual movie. Just another attempt to cash in on the very ""trendy"" Escobar persona. The acting was OK because the actors are good, but they lucked the material that would allow them to ""shine"". Overall there was a huge shortage of emotion and suspense. I found some common ""cool"" elements with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" regarding direction and pace, but even these failed to save the movie miserably. Why? Because this movie was not directed by Martin. So: This movie is like watching a documentary on the ""Life of Barry Seal"". Watch it on DVD."

"gavondo","6","0","2","24 October 2017"," American Made (2017) in one word: Cruise-control
","American Made begins with the familiar text, ""Based on a true story."" Movies based on true stories, which are not vetted by any type of historical regulatory agency to my knowledge, often end with a prologue containing additional historical information about the subjects. Photographs of the real-life individuals are sometimes shown on screen at this point in the film. There are no such photographs in this film. I took this as a sign that the real Barry Seal, a DEA informant and drug smuggler, didn't bear much resemblance to the actor portraying him, Tom Cruise. A post-credits image search confirmed this suspicion. Doug Liman, director, addressed this, saying, ""Tom Cruise doesn't look like Barry Seal. His character is inspired by the stories we learned about Barry. "" He added, ""You know, we're not making a biopic."" Unfettered by history, writer Gary Spinelli was free to tailor the story for Cruise, and in this he was successful.<br/><br/>In Top Gun, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented pilot. In American Made, Cruise plays a handsome, cocky, talented, drug and arms trafficking pilot. It feels familiar, but it's a good ""seeing an old friend"" familiar. Cruise is at his best when he is somewhat frantic, and there is a lot of frantic in this film. In fact, frantic is likely the best word to describe the camera-work here. Cinematographer CÃ©sar Charlone (City of God) zooms in and out with the speed and erraticism of an octogenarian photographing a grandchild at graduation. Seal is always moving, and the camera rushes to keep up with him. As cash continues to roll in, Barry Seal frenetically searches for an empty closet, a fresh piece of ground, but to no avail. There is plentiful comedy in the ineptitude of Seal, because he isn't entirely inept. At times he is shrewd and scheming, adept at evading his enemies. But, the true comedy and tragedy are in the excess, the scale of Seal's operation. The mere existence of such a ""business"" and the associated connections, if not only tenuous, to the U.S. government is laughably inconceivable.<br/><br/>Seal's recorded confessions serve as plot perpetuators, interspersed among the action. This is an effective plot device, and the achieved feel of the home videos is authentic and somewhat endearing. Sarah Wright, as Seal's wife Lucy, provides a lukewarm contrast to her husband's mostly unwarranted confidence. She repeatedly declares her distrust for Seal, but brushes aside all concerns once sufficient funds have been brought home. Her patience could exist only in the imagination of Seal, who, in reality, married three times. But again, this is not a film about reality. Suspending history, it is a thoroughly entertaining, energetic romp that capitalizes on the strong points of its male lead.<br/><br/>More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo"
"lesleyharris30","8","0","2","18 October 2017"," Has its Imperfections, but Generally Enjoyable,
","American Made is a great movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a solid cast. It's an enjoyable film with a very intriguing story that I was never aware of. Barry Seal certainly lived a fascinating life that was chronicled very well here, we feel for him as a character, but also detest him as a human at points, which made for a varied, well rounded character. <br/><br/>I was really not fond of the way in which this film was made, I get that they were going for something different but it felt unnecessary. It is shot in a sort of documentary style, where the camera is never completely still and it zooms in at weird points, but it is not blatantly pretending to be a documentary, so it simply comes out in a way that's puzzling to look at. <br/><br/>The cast is generally well casted, a lot of the characters are underdeveloped, but the people with meaty roles do a stellar job. Tom Cruise is the star, of course, and really throws himself in to the role of Seal, more so than I have seen from him in a while. Domhnall Gleeson is also terrific as Schafer, stealing every scene he is in, his character is a complete enigma that we are always left wanting to see more of. <br/><br/>Certainly worth the ride. It definitely has its flaws, but American Made is an enjoyable two hours that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. <br/><br/>Follows the story of Barry Seal, an airline pilot who becomes a drug runner for the CIA in the 1980s. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Cruise"

","Had this come out 10-15 years ago it would have had a lot more impact. In 2017 it's about the 5th best movie/series about the drug trade. Back-tracking to the past doesn't make it any fresher.<br/><br/>There is really nothing wrong with this movie unless you expect it to contain a shred of originality. It's exactly, and I mean exactly like about 20 movies in this genre. Tom Cruise plays himself, the hot-shot adrenaline-fueled man with a smile.<br/><br/>Music from the era isn't enough to make something a period piece. The music annoyed the living crap out of me at almost every turn, like the music was yelling at you about how you should be thinking about the scene. There were at least a half a dozen music video clips which is about a half a dozen too many in my book."
"statuskuo","6","0","3","4 October 2017"," I've Seen This Before
","Something is so very familiar about this movie. It seems director Doug Liman is doing his best Oliver Stone impression. Fueled with a little big of mania, Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, the former TWA pilot turned drug and gun smuggler turned family man. I put that last because, let's be honest, we saw so little of the family in context with his life.<br/><br/>And let's address that right now. For someone who had a wife and three kids...there is a logistical flaw in his puttering around with famous drug kingpins. Speaking of which, Barry was the Forrest Gump of the drug world. Stumbling amongst the famous characters in life that we remember from this era. He's a simpleton from the south too. Well, kinda. He gets in WAY over his head and spirals into working for everyone as a complete innocent. But he's not. The most aggravating thing about this movie IS that he doesn't seem to have a moral compass. He's muling in so much cocaine and getting so much money for it, it's hard not to hate the guy for ruining lives. But we don't see that part. We see a great scam. Or at least that's what it seems like. Crazy characters who bounce through the buoyant cocaine 80's. The end doesn't justify the means. AND, to make matters worse, a key character who is close to the family meets a tragic end, and is forgotten by the last reel. That is ridiculously lazy. Maybe honest, but confusing. I applaud the cojones for Cruise to step out of a little comfort zone, but there is something less endearing when he really gets despicable. Also, why does this movie feel familiar??? That nagging thought may eat at other viewers. Speaking of which, was this thing shot on VHS. It's looks video-terrible."
